including the Closing Balance Sheet and setting forth Purchaser's calculation
of (i) the Adjustment Amount (including the components thereof) and the final

principles and methodologies described in Exhibit A and (iii) the Shortfall
Amount.

  

  

(b) Seller shall have forty-five (45) calendar days following receipt of the
Closing Statement to review the preparation and confirm the accuracy of the
Closing Statement. Upon reasonable advance notice, Purchaser shall give, and
shall cause its Representatives to give, Seller and its accountants reasonable
access, during normal business hours, to such books, records (including all
documents, schedules and workpapers used by Purchaser in the preparation of
the Closing Statement) and personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries and
their respective accountants as may be reasonably necessary to enable Seller
to review the preparation and confirm the accuracy of the Closing Statement
and throughout the periods during which any disputes arise under this Section
2.04(b) are being resolved. Seller may, on or prior to the 45th calendar day
following receipt of the Closing Statement, deliver a notice to Purchaser
setting forth, in reasonable detail, each disputed item or amount and the
basis for Seller's disagreement therewith, together with supporting
calculations (the "Dispute Notice"). Matters as to which Seller may submit
disagreements (and the Dispute Notice) shall be limited to whether the Closing
Statement delivered by Purchaser was accurate and whether the Adjustment
Amount, the Closing Company Repayment Amount or the Closing Date Shortfall
Amount was properly calculated on the basis set forth herein and Seller shall
not be entitled to submit disagreements on any other basis. Matters included
in the calculations in the Closing Statement to which Seller does not object
in the Dispute Notice shall be deemed accepted by Seller and shall not be
subject to further dispute or review. If no Dispute Notice is received by
Purchaser in relation to the Closing Statement on or prior to the 45th
calendar day following Seller's receipt of the Closing Statement, the Closing
Statement prepared by Purchaser and delivered to Seller shall become the final
Closing Statement.

  

  

(c) If Seller delivers to Purchaser a Dispute Notice on or prior to the 45th
calendar day following Seller's receipt of the Closing Statement, then
Purchaser and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any disputes in
such Dispute Notice. If Purchaser and Seller agree on all disputes in such
Dispute Notice, then the Closing Statement, as modified by such agreement of
Seller and Purchaser, shall be used to determine the payments pursuant to
paragraphs (f), (g) and (h) of this Section 2.04. If Purchaser and Seller are
unable to resolve any disagreement within fifteen (15) calendar days after
delivery of a Dispute Notice, Purchaser and Seller shall jointly select a
partner at a mutually agreeable accounting firm to resolve such disagreement.
If Purchaser and Seller are unable to reach agreement on the identity of such
a partner within ten (10) calendar days after the expiration of such 15-day
period, either Party may request that a partner at a nationally recognized
accounting firm be appointed by the American Arbitration Association. The
individual so selected shall be referred to herein as the "Independent
Arbiter." The Parties shall instruct the Independent Arbiter to consider only
those items and amounts set forth in the Closing Statement as to which
Purchaser and Seller have not resolved their disagreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

19  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate with one another and the Independent
Arbiter to resolve the issues set forth in the Dispute Notice no later than
fifteen (15) calendar days following the date of the Independent Arbiter's
retention so that the Independent Arbiter may deliver to Seller and Purchaser
a report (the "Adjustment Report") setting forth the adjustments, if any, that
should be made to the Adjustment Amount, the Closing Company Repayment Amount
and/or the Shortfall Amount. With respect to each disputed account, such
determination, if not in accordance with the position of either Seller or
Purchaser, shall not be in excess of the higher, nor less than the lower, of
the amounts advocated by Purchaser in the Closing Statement or Seller in the
Dispute Notice with respect to such disputed account. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Independent Arbiter shall not review any accounts or make any
determination with respect to any matter other than those matters specifically
set forth in the Dispute Notice that remain in dispute. The fees, expenses and
costs of the Independent Arbiter for the services described herein with
respect to the Adjustment Amount shall be shared equally by the Parties.
During the review by the Independent Arbiter, the Parties shall each make
available to the Independent Arbiter such individuals and such information,
books, records and work papers, as may be reasonably required by the
Independent Arbiter to fulfill its obligations under this Section 2.04(d). The
Closing Statement, as modified by the Adjustment Report, shall become the
final Closing Statement and shall be used to determine the payments pursuant
to paragraphs (f), (g) and (h) of this Section 2.04. The Adjustment Report
shall be final and binding upon Purchaser and Seller, and shall be deemed a
final arbitration award that is enforceable in any court having jurisdiction.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Adjustment Report shall be nonappealable and
incontestable and not subject to collateral attack for any reason (other than
manifest error).

  

  

(e) Effective upon the end of the 45-day period following Seller's receipt of
the Closing Statement (if a timely Dispute Notice is not delivered), or upon
the resolution of all matters set forth in the Dispute Notice by agreement of
the Parties hereto or by the issuance of the Adjustment Report (if a timely
Dispute Notice is delivered and the Parties do not resolve the matters set
forth therein) (the "Resolution Date"), the Closing Statement shall be
adjusted (as described above) to the extent necessary to reflect the final
resolution of any disputed items in accordance with this Agreement.

  

  

(f) If the Purchase Price as finally determined in accordance with this
Section 2.04 is (i) greater than the Closing Payment, Purchaser shall pay to
Seller an amount equal to such difference, or (ii) less than the Closing
Payment, Seller shall pay to Purchaser an amount equal to such difference, in
either case, by wire transfer, within three (3) Business Days after the
Resolution Date, of immediately available funds to an account designated by
the Party receiving payment, plus interest on such amount accrued from the
Closing Date to the date of payment at the prime rate applicable from time to
time as announced by Citibank, N.A. Such interest shall be calculated daily on
the basis of a 365-day calendar year and the actual number of days elapsed.
For the avoidance of doubt, if the difference between the Purchase Price as
finally determined in accordance with this Section 2.04 and the Closing
Payment is equal to $0.00, no payment shall be made by either Party pursuant
to this Section 2.04(f).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

20  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(g) If the Closing Company Repayment Amount as finally determined in
accordance with this Section 2.04 is (i) greater than the Estimated Closing
Company Repayment Amount, Purchaser shall cause the Company to pay to Seller
(or its designee) an amount equal to such difference, or (ii) less than the
Estimated Closing Company Repayment Amount, Seller shall (or shall cause its
relevant designee to) pay to the Company an amount equal to such difference,
in either case, by wire transfer, within three (3) Business Days after the
Resolution Date, of immediately available funds to an account designated by
the party receiving payment, plus interest on such amount accrued from the
Closing Date to the date of payment at the prime rate applicable from time to
time as announced by Citibank, N.A. Such interest shall be calculated daily on
the basis of a 365-day calendar year and the actual number of days elapsed.
For the avoidance of doubt, if the difference between the Closing Company
Repayment Amount as finally determined in accordance with this Section 2.04
and the Estimated Closing Company Repayment Amount is equal to $0.00, no
payment shall be made by either Party pursuant to this Section 2.04(g).

  

  

(h) If the Shortfall Amount as finally determined in accordance with this
Section 2.04 is (i) greater than the Estimated Shortfall Amount, Seller shall
(or shall cause its relevant designee to) pay to Purchaser an amount equal to
such difference, or (ii) less than the Estimated Shortfall Amount, Purchaser
shall cause the Company to pay to Seller (or its designee) an amount equal to
such difference, in either case, by wire transfer, within three (3) Business
Days after the Resolution Date, of immediately available funds to an account
designated by the party receiving payment, plus interest on such amount
accrued from the Closing Date to the date of payment at the prime rate
applicable from time to time as announced by Citibank, N.A. Such interest
shall be calculated daily on the basis of a 365-day calendar year and the
actual number of days elapsed. For the avoidance of doubt, if the difference
between the Shortfall Amount as finally determined in accordance with this
Section 2.04 and the Estimated Shortfall Amount is equal to $0.00, no payment
shall be made by either Party pursuant to this Section 2.04(h).

occurrence which would not reasonably be expected to be material to the
Purchaser.

4.04 Governmental Consents.

  

  

(a) Section 4.04(a) of the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule sets forth each
material consent, waiver, authorization, notice, approval, registration,
license, qualification or other filing that is required to be obtained from,
or to be given to, any Governmental Authority in connection with the
execution, delivery or performance by Purchaser of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby other than those that may
be required solely by reason of Seller's participation in the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. The consents, waivers, authorizations,
notices, approvals, registrations, licenses, qualifications or other filings
listed on Section 4.04 of the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule are referred to
herein as the "Purchaser Required Regulatory Approvals".

  

  

(b) None of the execution, delivery or performance by Purchaser of this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby requires
any consent, waiver, authorization, notice or filing that is required to be
obtained from, or to be given to, under any Contract to which Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates is a party or otherwise bound.

  

  

4.05 Litigation. There is no Action pending against, or to Purchaser's
Knowledge, threatened against or affecting, Purchaser that in any manner
challenges or seeks to enjoin, restrain, prohibit, materially delay or
materially impair the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Agreements.

  

  

4.06 Investment Intent. Purchaser is an "accredited investor" within the
meaning of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the "Securities Act"). Purchaser understands that the Partnership
Interests and the IO Strips have not been registered under the Securities Act.
Purchaser is acquiring the Partnership Interests and the IO Strips for its own
account, for the purpose of investment only and not with a view to, or for
sale in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of applicable
securities Laws.

  

  

4.07 Brokers. No broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other Person
is entitled to any broker's, finder's, financial advisor's or other similar
fee or commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Purchaser.

  

  

4.08 Financial Statements. Section 4.08 of the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule
sets forth a true and correct copy of the audited consolidated balance sheet
of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and December 31,
2009 and the related audited consolidated statements of operations, members'
equity and cash flows of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries for the years then
ended, together with the notes thereto (the "Purchaser Financial Statements").
The Purchaser Financial Statements have been prepared, in all material
respects, in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis as at the
dates and for the periods presented and present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position and the results of operations and cash flows
of Purchaser on a consolidated basis as at the dates and for the periods
presented.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

35  

  

 

 

 

  

  

4.09 Financial Ability. Purchaser will have available free and unrestricted
cash that is sufficient to enable it to pay the amounts required under Section
2.02 and otherwise as necessary to fulfill its obligations hereunder.
Purchaser specifically acknowledges and agrees that its obligations hereunder
are not subject to any financing condition (other than pursuant to Section
10.02(e)).

  

  

4.10 Financing Section 4.10 of the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule sets forth
true, complete and correct copies of (a) the debt commitment letter dated as
of the date hereof among Barclays Bank PLC, Barclays Capital and Purchaser
regarding the $575,000,000 senior credit facility (the "Senior Corporate
Facility") and (b) the debt commitment letter dated as of the date hereof
among The Royal Bank of Scotland plc, Barclays Bank PLC, Bank of America, N.A.
and Purchaser regarding the Third Party Advance Facility (collectively, the
"Debt Financing Commitments"), pursuant to which the lenders party thereto
have committed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, to lend
the amounts set forth therein for the purposes of financing the transactions
contemplated hereby and related fees and expenses (the "Debt Financing"). The
Debt Financing Commitments have not been amended or modified prior to the date
of this Agreement, no such amendment or modification is contemplated by
Purchaser, and the respective commitments contained in the Debt Financing
Commitments have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. Except for a
fee letter relating to fees with respect to the Debt Financing, as of the date
hereof there are no side letters or other Contracts or arrangements related to
the funding or investing, as applicable, of the Debt Financing other than as
expressly set forth in the Debt Financing Commitments delivered to Seller
prior to the date hereof. Purchaser has fully paid any and all commitment fees
or other fees in connection with the Debt Financing Commitments that are
payable on or prior to the date hereof, and the Debt Financing Commitments are
in full force and effect and are the legal, valid, binding and enforceable
obligations of Purchaser and, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, each of the other
parties thereto. There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies
related to the funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing, other than as
expressly set forth in or expressly contemplated by the Debt Financing
Commitments, which include conditions to be set forth in the definitive
transaction documents for the Debt Financing (including, with respect to the
Third Party Advance Facility, that the amount of the Third Party Advance
Facility will not exceed the amount that can be assigned a "AAA" or equivalent
rating from at least one nationally recognized credit rating organization). No
event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
or would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach on the part
of Purchaser or, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, any other party thereto under
any of the Debt Financing Commitments. Assuming satisfaction of the conditions
set forth in Sections 10.01 and 10.02 of this Agreement, there are no facts or
circumstances to the Knowledge of Purchaser that would cause any of the
conditions to the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Financing
Commitments not to be satisfied as of the date hereof. At the Closing,
Purchaser will have at and after the Closing funds sufficient to (a) pay the
Purchase Price and the Closing Company Repayment Amount, (b) pay any and all
fees and expenses required to be paid by Purchaser in connection with the Debt
Financing and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (c) satisfy
all of the other payment obligations of Purchaser contemplated hereunder.
Purchaser has no reason to believe that the Debt Financing will not be
available at the Closing.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

36  

  

 

 

 

  

  

4.11 Solvency Assuming satisfaction or waiver of the conditions in Article X,
and after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Debt Financing, any alternative financing and the payment of the
Purchase Price and the Closing Company Repayment Amount, payment of all
amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and payment of all related fees and expenses,
Purchaser will be Solvent as of the Closing Date and immediately after the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. For the purposes of this
Agreement, the term "Solvent" means that, as of any date of determination, (a)
the amount of the "fair saleable value" of the assets of Purchaser will, as of
such date, exceed the sum of (i) the value of all of Purchaser's "liabilities,
including contingent and other liabilities," as of such date, as such quoted
terms are generally determined in accordance with applicable Law governing
determinations of the insolvency of debtors, and (ii) the amount that will be
required to pay the probable Liabilities of Purchaser, as of such date, on its
existing Indebtedness as such Indebtedness becomes absolute and mature, (b)
Purchaser will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount of
capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed
to be engaged following such date and (c) Purchaser will be able to pay its
Liabilities as of such date as they mature. For purposes of this definition,
"not have an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the
businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged" and "able to pay
its Liabilities as of such date as they mature" means that Purchaser will be
able to generate enough cash from operations, asset dispositions or
refinancing, or a combination thereof, to meet its Liabilities as they become
due.

  

  

4.12 No Other Representations or Warranties.

  

  

(a) Purchaser acknowledges that (i) it and its Representatives have been
permitted access to the books and records, facilities, equipment, contracts
and other properties and assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and that
it and its Representatives have had an opportunity to meet with officers and
employees of the Companies and its Subsidiaries and (ii) except for the
representations and warranties expressly set forth in Article III, the Seller
Disclosure Schedules, or in the certificate delivered pursuant to Section
10.02(c), (A) Purchaser has not relied on any representation or warranty from
Seller or any other Person in determining to enter into this Agreement and (B)
neither Seller nor any other Person has made any representation or warranty,
express or implied, as to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or their
respective operations or financial condition) or the accuracy or completeness
of any information regarding any of the foregoing that Seller or any other
Person furnished or made available to Purchaser and its Representatives
(including any projections, estimates, budgets, offering memoranda, management
presentations or due diligence materials). Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, except as expressly set forth in the representations and
warranties in Article III, the Seller Disclosure Schedules and the Transaction
Agreements, THERE ARE NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING WARRANTIES
OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

37  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 4.12(a), Purchaser (i)
acknowledges and agrees that (A) it has made its own independent determination
of the value (including recoverability) of the Servicer Advances and the
mortgage servicing rights held by the Company and has not relied on Seller or
any other Person with respect to such value, (B) neither Seller nor any other
Person has made any direct or indirect representation or warranty (whether in
this Agreement or otherwise) with respect to such value and (C) it will not
assert that any matters related to such value resulted in the failure of any
of the conditions set forth in Section 10.2 to be satisfied and (ii) waives,
on behalf of itself and each other Purchaser Indemnified Party, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all rights, claims and causes
of action (other than claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud) it
may have against Seller or any of its Affiliates or representatives related to
such value and arising under or based upon this Agreement or any certificate
delivered in connection herewith, whether under this contract or arising under
common law or any other Law; provided, that nothing in this Section 4.12(b)
shall be deemed to limit any remedies available pursuant to Section 12.02(a)
with respect to any breach of the representation and warranty described in
Section 7.06(b)(ii), if made.

5.02 Access.

  

  

(a) Seller will cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, (i) permit
Purchaser and its Representatives reasonable access, during normal business
hours and upon reasonable notice, to the employees, premises and properties,
books, records (with respect to income Tax records, only to the extent
directly related to the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries),
Contracts, Servicing Agreements and other documents of or pertaining to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and outside accountants and other advisors,
and (ii) furnish to Purchaser and its Representatives such financial and
operating data and other information relating to the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries (such as imaged servicing files) as is normally
prepared by the Company and as Purchaser may reasonably request and (iii) make
reasonably available to the Representatives of Purchaser, the employees of the
Company, Seller or their respective Subsidiaries in respect of the Company and
its Subsidiaries whose assistance and expertise is necessary to assist
Purchaser in connection with Purchaser's preparation to integrate the Company,
its Subsidiaries and assets and the personnel related thereto with Purchaser's
organization following the Closing (such integration, the "Pre-Closing
Integration"); provided, however, that (A) any such access shall be conducted
at Purchaser's expense, in accordance with Law (including any applicable
antitrust, bank regulatory or competition law), at a reasonable time, under
the supervision of Seller's personnel and in such a manner as to maintain
confidentiality and not to unreasonably interfere with the normal operations
of the Company and its Subsidiaries and (B) Seller will not be required to
provide to Purchaser access to or copies of any personnel file of any Employee
that in Seller's good faith opinion is sensitive or the disclosure of which
could subject Seller, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates to
risk of liability or violation of Law.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained in this or any other agreement between
Seller and Purchaser executed on or prior to the date hereof, Seller shall not
have any obligation to make available to Purchaser or its Representatives, or
provide Purchaser or its Representatives with, (i) any Tax Return filed by
Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) or predecessors, or any related material or (ii) any information
if making such information available would (A) jeopardize any attorney-client
or other legal privilege or (B) contravene any applicable Law, fiduciary duty
or agreement (including any confidentiality agreement to which Seller or any
its Affiliates is a party), it being understood that Seller shall cooperate in
any commercially reasonable efforts and requests for waivers that would enable
otherwise required disclosure to Purchaser to occur without so jeopardizing
privilege or contravening such Law, duty or agreement.

  

  

(c) Seller and Purchaser shall each nominate a representative to act as the
primary contact persons and decision-makers with respect to all matters
relating to the Pre-Closing Integration (the "Integration Coordinators"). The
initial Integration Coordinators shall be Shane Ross for Seller and Scott
Anderson for Purchaser. Each Party shall be entitled to replace its
Integration Coordinator. Except as specifically set forth in this Agreement,
each Integration Coordinator will have the authority and responsibility to:

  

  

(i) oversee matters relating to the respective appointing Party that relate to
the Pre-Closing Integration;

  

  

(ii) make or otherwise coordinate appropriate decisions on day-to-day issues
relating to the Pre-Closing Integration;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

42  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(iii) coordinate the technical aspects of the Pre-Closing Integration and
consult on the operation and management of the Pre-Closing Integration; and

  

  

(iv) monitor the appointing Party's compliance with its obligations under this
Agreement as they relate to the Pre-Closing Integration.

  

  

The Parties shall cause the Integration Coordinators to meet on a weekly basis
or with such other frequency as they may agree to discuss the status and
progress of the Pre-Closing Integration and concerns of the Parties regarding
the same. Should a dispute arise under this Agreement between the Parties with
respect to the Pre-Closing Integration, the Integration Coordinators shall
negotiate in good faith on behalf of such appointing Party to resolve any such
disputes. If the Integration Coordinators are unable to resolve such dispute
within ten (10) Business Days after the date of such dispute, either Party
shall have all applicable remedies available to it under this Agreement.

  

  

5.03 Leases. On or before July 15, 2011, Purchaser shall provide Seller with
notice (a) instructing Seller to allow the sublease listed in Section 5.03 of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule (the "Texas Lease") to terminate in accordance
with its terms as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby (a
"Termination Notice") or (b) indicating that Purchaser would like to retain
the premises subleased under the Texas Lease after the Closing and specifying
the post-Closing term of the Texas Lease, which term may not exceed the
current term of the Texas Lease (an "Extension Notice"). If Purchaser does not
deliver an Extension Notice or a Termination Notice on or before July 15, 2011
or delivers a Termination Notice on or before July 15, 2011, Seller shall
allow the Texas Lease to terminate in accordance with its terms as a result of
the transactions contemplated hereby. If Purchaser delivers an Extension
Notice on or before July 15, 2011, Seller shall, in its sole discretion, (i)
amend the Texas Lease (A) so that it will not terminate as a result of the
transactions contemplated hereby and (B) making the termination date of the
Texas Lease the end of the term specified in the Extension Notice or (ii)
assist Purchaser in locating and procuring a leased property comparable to the
property subject to the Texas Lease, on terms and conditions substantially
similar to those set forth in the Texas Lease. In the event Seller makes the
election set forth in clause (ii) of the foregoing sentence, all reasonable
and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Seller and
Purchaser (and their respective Affiliates) in finding the location and
procurement of a comparable leased property (including any costs and expenses
relating to the negotiation of lease terms with respect to such comparable
property) shall be borne solely by Seller; provided, however, that after the
Closing, Purchaser shall cause the Company to be responsible for all lease and
other payments relating to such comparable property for the period following
the execution and effectiveness of such new lease.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

43  

  

 

 

 

  

  

5.04 Alternative Transaction. From the date of this Agreement until the
Closing Date or termination of this Agreement, neither Seller nor any
Affiliate of Seller shall, directly or indirectly through any of its
Representatives, (a) solicit, initiate or encourage or engage in discussions
or negotiations with respect to any proposal or offer from any Person (other
than Purchaser or its Affiliates) relating to in each case any transaction
that would be considered an Alternative Transaction, (b) furnish any
information with respect to, or participate in, or assist, any effort or
attempt by any Person to do or seek the foregoing, or (c) execute any letter
of intent or agreement providing for an Alternative Transaction. Without
prejudice to any other methods or actions that may result in the cure of any
breach of this Section 5.04, the Parties acknowledge and agree that in the
event that any officer or other employee of Seller or the Company acting alone
in violation of a corporate policy takes an action that constitutes a breach
of clause (a) of this Section 5.04 but does not constitute a breach of any
other clause of this Section 5.04, such breach shall be deemed cured in the
event such action ceases and Seller notifies the counterparty or
counterparties to the potential Alternative Transaction in writing that Seller
will not undertake such Alternative Transaction, in each case no later than
the fifth (5th) day after Seller becomes aware of such breach (for such
purposes excluding the knowledge of the employee or officer whose action
constitutes such breach). "Alternative Transaction" means the sale, transfer
or other disposition, directly or indirectly, including through an asset sale,
Equity Interests sale, merger, amalgamation, plan of arrangement or other
similar transaction, of all or a substantial portion of the Company or its
assets, considered as a whole, in a transaction or a series of transactions
with one or more Persons other than Purchaser and/or its Affiliates.

  

  

5.05 Subservicing Transfer If after the Closing an Investor for which the
Company provides servicing under the Servicing Agreements set forth on Section
5.05 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule terminates such Servicing Agreement or
transfers such servicing to a Person other than Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates, in either case other than as a result of a failure of the Company
(or its Subsidiary) to comply with such Servicing Agreement or the active
encouragement of Purchaser or its Affiliates (a "Servicing Transfer") prior to
the one-year anniversary of the Closing Date, Seller shall pay Purchaser as
follows:

  

  

(a) If such a Servicing Transfer occurs on or before the six-month anniversary
of the Closing Date, Seller shall pay Purchaser an amount equal to the product
of the unpaid principal balance as of the date of such Servicing Transfer
("UPB") of the Mortgage Loans relating to such Servicing Transfer multiplied
by 0.002525.

  

  

(b) If such a Servicing Transfer occurs after the six-month anniversary of the
Closing Date but prior to the one-year anniversary of the Closing Date, Seller
shall pay Purchaser an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the product of
the UPB of the Mortgage Loans relating to such Servicing Transfer multiplied
by 0.002525.

  

  

● In the event of any Servicing Transfer with respect to which Purchaser is
entitled to a payment from Seller pursuant to this Section 5.05, Seller shall
pay Purchaser the amount due Purchaser within five (5) Business Days of
Seller's receipt of evidence of such Servicing Transfer.

5.06 Cooperation with Financing. Prior to the Closing and subject to Section
7.06, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide to Purchaser
all reasonable cooperation requested by Purchaser that is necessary in
connection with the Debt Financing; provided, however, that (a) nothing herein
shall require such cooperation to the extent it would interfere unreasonably
with the business or the other operations of Seller, the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries and (b) neither Seller nor any of its
Subsidiaries (including the Company) shall be required to commit to take any
action that is not contingent upon the Closing (including the entry into any
agreement) or that would be effective prior to the Closing. Except with
respect to the payment by Seller of the Financing Break Fee (as contemplated
in the definition of Base Purchase Price) or in connection with the Full
Seller Advance Facility or the Partial Seller Advance Facility, in each case,
if applicable, none of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to
take any action that would subject it to Liability (including the entry into
any agreement), to bear any cost or expense or to pay any commitment or other
similar fee or make any other payment (other than reasonable out-of-pocket
costs) or incur any other Liability or provide or agree to provide any
indemnity in connection with the Debt Financing or any of the foregoing.
Except with respect to the payment by Seller of the Financing Break Fee (as
contemplated in the definition of Base Purchase Price) or in connection with
the Full Seller Advance Facility or the Partial Seller Advance Facility, in
each case, if applicable, Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller,
its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and against any and
all Liabilities and losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with the
arrangement of the Debt Financing (including any action taken in accordance
with this Section 5.06 and any information utilized in connection therewith
(other than historical information relating to the Company or its
Subsidiaries)). Purchaser shall, promptly upon request by Seller, reimburse
Seller for all documented and reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries that are the financial responsibility of
Purchaser pursuant to this Section 5.06.

  

  

5.07 Applications License. On or prior to Closing, Seller will cause the
Company to grant to Seller and its Affiliates a non-exclusive, royalty-fee,
fully paid-up, perpetual, worldwide, non-transferable (other than to
Affiliates of Seller) irrevocable license to use, reproduce, distribute,
publish, modify, prepare derivative works of, display, perform and otherwise
exploit (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the receipt of services by the
Seller or its Affiliates from third parties) the Software identified as
"Licensed Applications" on Section 5.07 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (the
"Licensed Applications") in connection with Seller's and its Affiliates'
business. On or prior to Closing, Seller will cause the Company to deliver
fully buildable and functional copies of the Licensed Applications to Seller
and otherwise at the Seller's request to the extent not in Seller's
possession; provided, however, that in no event shall the Company have any
obligation after the Closing to provide any updated versions or otherwise
maintain the Licensed Applications.

  

  

VI. COVENANTS OF PURCHASER

  

  

6.01 Use of Intellectual Property, Trademarks and Logos. Purchaser
acknowledges that neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has, and
Purchaser is not acquiring, any right to use, and from and after the Closing
Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company and each of its Subsidiaries to,
desist from all use of, Intellectual Property of Seller, including the name
"Goldman Sachs" or any Trademarks owned by Seller or any of its Affiliates
(other than the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) or employing the words

confusingly similar trade names, trademarks or logos to any of the foregoing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 6.01 shall (a) prohibit
Purchaser from using the name "Goldman Sachs" to represent, in a truthful and
accurate manner, the prior relationship between the Company and Seller, (b)
prohibit Purchaser from maintaining possession of materials bearing
Intellectual Property of Seller for archival purposes or give rise to

Closing Date) or materials archived on the internet on a website not operated
by or on behalf of the Purchaser (e.g. cached pages of third party websites);
provided, that Purchaser and its Affiliates shall not, in any event, be
permitted to issue a press release or other public announcement containing the
name "Goldman Sachs" except as permitted in Section 7.04(b).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

45  

  

 

 

 

  

  

6.02 Termination of Insurance; Overhead and Shared Services and Related Party
Contracts.

  

  

(a) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that, effective as of the Closing, the
Company and its Subsidiaries will cease to be insured by any insurance
policies of Seller and its Affiliates.

  

  

(b) Seller acknowledges and agrees that, except as otherwise expressly
provided in the Transition Services Agreement, effective as of the Closing

further obligation to provide any such Overhead and Shared Services to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

  

  

(c) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that (and Seller shall cause), effective
as of the Closing, each Contract between Seller or any Subsidiary of Seller
(other than the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company), on the one hand,
and the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, on the other hand, will be
automatically terminated and of no further effect, with no further Liability
of any party thereto, except that the Contracts set forth in Section 6.02 of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule as they may be amended prior to Closing ((i)
with the prior written consent of Purchaser, (ii) as expressly provided in
this Agreement or (iii) otherwise in any manner not disadvantageous to the
Company or its Subsidiaries), will not terminate and will survive the Closing.

  

  

6.03 Seller Guarantees and Other Credit Support. Purchaser shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to procure the release by the applicable
counterparty of each Contract set forth on Section 6.03 of the Purchaser
Disclosure Schedule, effective as of the Closing, of any continuing obligation
of Seller or any Affiliate of Seller (other than the Company or any Subsidiary
of the Company) to guarantee the obligations of the Company or otherwise

the Closing shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and the each such
Affiliate from and against any Covered Loss resulting from or relating to any

suspected or unsuspected, at law or in equity, solely arising from or related
to any act or omission by any of those individuals in their capacity of
directors or officers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the
Closing ("Pre-Closing Claims"); provided that such release and discharge shall
be without prejudice to, and shall not limit or otherwise affect, any rights
of any Purchaser Indemnified Party under Article XII against Seller with
respect to any such Pre-Closing Claims. Purchaser also acknowledges and agrees
that, notwithstanding anything in the contrary contained herein, prior to the
Closing, Seller shall be entitled to cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to
release each Resigning Person and each other such Person referred to in the
prior sentence from all such Pre-Closing Claims; provided that such release
and discharge shall be without prejudice to, and shall not limit or otherwise
affect, any rights of any Purchaser Indemnified Party under Article XII
against Seller with respect to any such Pre-Closing Claims.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

46  

  

 

 

 

  

  

6.05 Maintenance of Books and Records. After the Closing, Purchaser shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries (including the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries) to, preserve all pre-Closing Date records to the extent relating
to the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries possessed or to be
possessed by such Person. Upon any reasonable request from Seller or its
Representatives, Purchaser shall (or shall cause the relevant Subsidiary to)

require Purchaser to disclose its Tax records (except for Tax records of, or
with respect to, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, which records are
relevant or relate to any period that ends on or before the Closing Date or
any Straddle Period). Such records may be sought under this Section 6.05 for
any reasonable purpose, including to the extent reasonably required in
connection with accounting, litigation, regulatory, securities law disclosure
or other similar purpose (other than for purposes relating to claims between
Purchaser and Seller or any of their respective Subsidiaries under this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement). Notwithstanding the foregoing, any and
all such records may be destroyed by Purchaser (or its Subsidiary) if
Purchaser sends to Seller written notice of its intent to destroy such
records, specifying in reasonable detail the contents of the records to be
destroyed; such records may then be destroyed after the 60th day following
such notice unless Seller notifies Purchaser that such Seller desires to
obtain possession of such records, in which event Purchaser shall transfer the
records to Seller and Seller shall pay all reasonable expenses of Purchaser in
connection therewith.

  

  

6.06 Financing Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the Debt Financing
on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Financing Commitments,
Purchaser shall not permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or any
waiver of any provision or remedy under the Debt Financing Commitments (except
for any such amendments, modifications or waivers which, individually or in
the aggregate, would not be reasonably expected to prevent, delay or impair
the availability of the financing under the Debt Financing Commitments or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) without the
prior written consent of Seller. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) maintain
in effect the Debt Financing Commitments in accordance with their terms, (ii)
satisfy on a timely basis all conditions and covenants applicable to Purchaser
in the Debt Financing Commitments and otherwise comply with its obligations
thereunder, (iii) enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto on the
terms and conditions contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments, (iv)
subject to Section 7.06, consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to the
Closing, (v) enforce its rights under the Debt Financing Commitments and (vi)
cause the lenders and other Persons providing Debt Financing to fund on the
Closing Date the Debt Financing required to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement unless, in the case of the Third Party Advance
Facility, Seller elects in accordance with Section 7.06(b) to cause the
transactions contemplated hereby to be consummated without using the Third
Party Advance Facility. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Purchaser shall give Seller prompt notice: (A) of any material breach or
default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, could reasonably be expected to give rise to any material breach
or default) by Purchaser, or to Knowledge of Purchaser, any other party to any
Debt Financing Commitment or definitive document related to the Debt
Financing; (B) of the receipt of any written notice or other written
communication from any Person with respect to any (x) actual or potential
breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to any Debt Financing
Commitment or any definitive document related to the Debt Financing or any
provisions of the Debt Financing Commitment or any definitive document related
to the Debt Financing or (y) material dispute or disagreement between or among
any parties to any Debt Financing Commitment or any definitive document
related to the Debt Financing; and (C) if for any reason Purchaser believes in
good faith that (1) there is reasonably likely to be a material dispute or
disagreement between or among any parties to any Debt Financing Commitment or
any definitive document related to the Debt Financing or (2) it is reasonably
likely that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Debt
Financing on the terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the
Debt Financing Commitment or the definitive documents related to the Debt
Financing. As soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event within five (5)
business days after the date Seller delivers to Purchaser a written request,
Purchaser shall provide any information reasonably requested by Seller
relating to any circumstance referred to in clause (A), (B) or (C) of the
immediately preceding sentence. If any portion of the Senior Corporate
Facility becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the
Debt Financing Commitment relating to the Senior Corporate Facility, Purchaser
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to arrange and obtain financing
as promptly as practicable from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to
replace the Senior Corporate Facility as promptly as practicable. Subject to
the terms of Section 7.06(c), if any portion of the Third Party Advance
Facility becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the
Debt Financing Commitment relating to the Third Party Advance Facility, upon
the request of Seller, Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to arrange and obtain financing as promptly as practicable from alternative
sources in an amount sufficient to replace the Third Party Advance Facility on
terms that are not in the aggregate materially worse for Purchaser than the
terms indicated in the Debt Financing Commitment relating to the Third Party
Advance Facility.

7.01 Efforts and Actions to Cause the Closing to Occur.

  

  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, Seller and
Purchaser shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to take,

including (i) the preparation and filing of all forms, registrations, notices
and other documentation required to be filed to consummate the Closing and to
effectuate the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, and
the taking of such actions as are necessary to obtain any Seller Required
Regulatory Approval, Purchaser Required Regulatory Approval or Required Third
Party Consent, provided that neither Seller nor Purchaser shall be obligated
to make any material payment or deliver anything of material value to any
third party (other than filing and application fees to Governmental
Authorities, all of which shall be paid or reimbursed by Purchaser) in order
to obtain any such approval or consent, (ii) seeking to prevent the initiation
of, and defend, any Action by or before any Governmental Authority challenging
this Agreement or the consummation of the Closing, and (iii) causing to be
lifted or rescinded any Order adversely affecting the ability of the parties
to consummate the Closing. In furtherance of and not in limitation of the
foregoing, each of Seller and Purchaser agrees to make or cause to be made an
appropriate filing of any Notification and Report Form required pursuant to
the HSR Act and to negotiate as promptly as practicable definitive documents
reflecting the terms of the Partial Seller Advance Facility (as set forth in
Exhibit B) and the Full Seller Advance Facility (as set forth in Exhibit B).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

48  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) If any Party or Affiliate thereof receives a request for information or
documentary material from any Governmental Authority with respect to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, then such Party

reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other Party (to the
extent permitted by applicable Law), an appropriate response in compliance
with such request.

  

  

(c) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Parties shall keep each
other apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and work cooperatively in
connection with obtaining the Required Seller Regulatory Approvals and the
Required Purchaser Regulatory Approvals, including:

  

  

(i) reasonably cooperating with each other in connection with any filings with
respect to Seller Required Regulatory Approvals and Purchaser Required
Regulatory Approvals;

  

  

(ii) furnishing to the outside counsel of the other party all reasonably
requested information within its possession that is required in connection
with any Seller Required Regulatory Approval or Purchaser Required Regulatory
Approval,

  

  

(iii) promptly notifying each other of any material communications from or
with any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement;

  

  

(iv) not participating in any substantive meeting, discussion or conversation
with any Governmental Authority in connection with proceedings under or
relating to any Seller Required Regulatory Approval or Purchaser Required
Regulatory Approval, unless it consults with the other party in advance, and,
to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other party
the opportunity to attend and participate therein; and

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

49  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(v) reasonably consulting and cooperating with one another in connection with
all analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments,
opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto
in connection with proceedings under or relating to any Seller Required
Regulatory Approval or Purchaser Required Regulatory Approval.

  

  

7.02 Ancillary Agreements. On the Closing Date, each of Seller and Purchaser
shall (and, if applicable, each shall cause its respective Affiliates to)
execute and deliver each of the Ancillary Agreements to which it (or any such
Affiliate) is a party if such Ancillary Agreement has not been executed prior
thereto.

  

  

7.03 Post-Closing Cooperation In Connection with Actions. Subject to Section
5.02(b), from and after the Closing, in connection with any Action arising in
connection with (a) any Loss Sharing Claim or claim with respect to a Retained
Liability or (b) any fact, situation, circumstance, status, condition,
activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to act
or transaction on or prior to the Closing involving the Company or any of any
Subsidiary (each Party shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries), to, cooperate
with reasonable requests of the other Party and its counsel, to make available
its personnel, and provide such testimony and, subject to any applicable
confidentiality restrictions and applicable Law, access to its books and
records as is reasonably necessary in connection with the contest or defense,
all at the sole cost and expense of the requesting Party.

  

  

7.04 Confidentiality; Publicity.

  

  

(a) The terms of the letter agreement dated March 17, 2011 between Purchaser
and GS and Co (the "Confidentiality Agreement") are hereby incorporated herein
by reference and shall continue in full force and effect until the Closing, at
which time the confidentiality obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement
shall terminate. If this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to the
Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall nonetheless continue in full
force and effect in all respects and its term shall be deemed extended until
the date two years from the date hereof. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section 7.04(a), following the date hereof, except as
required by applicable Law, Purchaser and its Subsidiaries shall not disclose
or use for any purpose information with respect to Seller and its
Subsidiaries, other than the Company and its Subsidiaries, that is obtained by
Purchaser in connection with this Agreement and the transactions hereunder.
Purchaser and its Subsidiaries shall not make such information available to
any Affiliate or any other Person (other than Purchaser, the Company and their
respective Subsidiaries).

  

  

(b) Neither Party shall issue any press release or make any public
announcement concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
without the prior written approval of the other Party (which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except that each Party
may make such disclosure to the extent required by an applicable requirement
of Law; provided that each Party shall give the other a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment upon such disclosure to the extent practicable.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

50  

  

 

 

 

  

  

7.05 Notices of Certain Events. From the date hereof until the Closing Date,
each Party will, subject to applicable Law, promptly notify the other Party
of:

  

  

(a) any material notice or other communication from any Person alleging that
the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

  

  

(b) any written notice or other written communication from any Governmental
Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

  

  

(c) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event that is likely to cause any
representation or warranty of such Party in this Agreement to be untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect at or prior to the Closing Date; provided,
however, that the obligation to give notice pursuant to this Section 7.05(c)
shall not be deemed a covenant or obligation for the purposes of Section
10.02(a) or Section 10.03(a);

  

  

(d) any change or event that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or
would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect;

  

  

(e) any written material action, suit, claim, investigation or proceeding
commenced or, to such Party's Knowledge, threatened against, relating to or
involving or otherwise affecting such Party that, if pending on the date
hereof, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to Section
3.10 of this Agreement; and

  

  

(f) any change or fact of which it is aware that will or is reasonably
expected to result in any of the conditions set forth in Article X becoming
incapable of being satisfied.

  

  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no delivery of any notice pursuant to this
Section 7.05 shall (i) have any effect for the purpose qualifying the
representations and warranties of the notifying party contained herein, or be
deemed to cure any misrepresentation or breach of warranty that might
otherwise have existed hereunder by reason of the omission of such item from
the Seller Disclosure Schedules or (ii) limit or otherwise affect any of the
remedies available to any party pursuant to this Agreement or the
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or conditions to the
obligation of the parties under this Agreement.

  

  

7.06 Advance Financing.

  

  

(a) Purchaser shall cooperate with Seller's reasonable requests for
information with respect to the expected terms and conditions of the Third
Party Advance Facility. In addition, the Parties shall cooperate and use
commercially reasonable efforts, including obtaining necessary consents from
third parties, to cause Servicing Agreements to be deemed "Eligible Servicing
Contracts" as defined in Exhibit C.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

51  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to
Seller a notice containing the Final Third Party Advance Facility Terms on or
prior to the Final Third Party Advance Facility Delivery Date. If Purchaser
does not deliver such notice because the Rating Agency Levels Delivery Date
has not yet occurred by such time, Seller shall instruct Purchaser whether to
continue pursuing the Third Party Advance Facility for execution post-Closing.
If Purchaser delivers such notice, not later than five (5) Business Days
thereafter, Seller shall notify Purchaser in writing whether Purchaser shall
be required to consummate the transactions at the Closing using (x) the Third
Party Advance Facility and the Partial Seller Advance Facility or (y) the Full
Seller Advance Facility. If Seller fails to deliver such notice or otherwise
rejects the Final Third Party Advance Facility Terms, it shall be deemed to
have elected to cause Purchaser to consummate the transactions at the Closing
using the Full Seller Advance Facility (and to have instructed Purchaser not
to continue pursuing the Third Party Advance facility for a post-Closing
execution as described in Section 7.06(d)).

  

  

(i) If Seller makes the election referred to in clause (x), Seller (either
directly or through one or more Subsidiaries) shall purchase, at par, at the
Closing the principal amount of Subordinated Notes issued from the Third Party
Advance Facility that is described as the amount thereof that "GS" is required
to purchase under the heading "Loan Facility" in Exhibit B, and the amount
made available under the Partial Seller Advance Facility shall be determined
as set forth under the headings "Initial Commitment" and "Weighted Average
Advance Rate Cap" in Exhibit B.

  

  

(ii) If Seller makes (or is deemed to have made) the election referred to in
clause (x) above and the transactions at the Closing are consummated using the
Third Party Advance Facility or a Third Party Advance Facility is executed
after the Closing, Seller shall be deemed to have made in Article III the
following representations as of the date hereof: to Seller's Knowledge, all of
the Servicer Advances not previously collected or reserved for as of the
Closing Date (x) were made in compliance with the applicable Servicing
Agreements and (y) are valid receivables of the Company under GAAP.

  

  

(c) If Seller makes the election contemplated by clause (x) of Section 7.06(b)
but the purchasers of the Senior Term Notes and Senior VFNs under the Third
Party Advance Facility fail to complete such purchase (or if the Third Party
Advance Facility (or any replacement facility to the Third Party Advance
Facility that becomes available after the application of the covenant in the
last sentence of Section 6.06) otherwise becomes unavailable for any reason),
Seller (without limiting any other rights it may have in respect of such
failure) shall at the Closing provide the Full Seller Advance Facility,
subject to its terms and conditions.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

52  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) If Purchaser does not deliver the Final Third Party Advance Facility Terms
on or prior to the Final Third Party Advance Facility Delivery Date because
the Final Third Party Advance Facility Delivery Date shall have occurred
before the Rating Agency Levels Delivery Date, and the Closing occurs using
the Full Seller Advance Facility, if Seller has instructed Purchaser pursuant
to Section 7.06(b) that it desires to continue pursuing the Third Party
Advance Facility for a post-Closing execution, then Purchaser shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to Seller a notice setting forth
the Final Third Party Advance Facility Terms on or prior to the Rating Agency
Levels Delivery Date, which notice shall include an offer to refinance the
Full Seller Advance Facility using a Third Party Advance Facility reflecting
such Final Third Party Advance Facility Terms and the Partial Seller Advance
Facility. Seller may accept such offer by delivering a notice of acceptance to
Purchaser within five (5) Business Days after receipt of such notice from
Purchaser.

  

  

(i) If Seller does not so accept such offer, the Full Seller Advance Facility
shall continue in accordance with its terms and, if the Final Third Party
Advance Facility Terms set forth in Purchaser's notice are consistent with the
Minimum Conforming Third Party Advance Facility Terms, Seller will within five
(5) Business Days thereafter pay to Purchaser in immediately available funds
an amount equal to the Financing Break Fee.

  

  

(ii) If Seller accepts such offer, Seller shall be obligated to purchase, at
par, at the closing of the Third Party Advance Facility, the amount of
Subordinated Notes issued from the Third Party Advance Facility that is
described as the amount thereof that "GS" is required to purchase under
heading "Loan Facility" in Exhibit B and the aggregate amount made available
under the Partial Seller Advance Facility shall be determined as set forth
under the headings "Initial Commitment" and "Weighted Average Advance Rate
Cap" in Exhibit B.

  

  

(e) If the Final Third Party Advance Facility are not consistent in all
material respects with the Minimum Conforming Third Party Advance Facility
Terms, Purchaser may present to Seller (at the time when it would otherwise be
required to notify Seller of the proposed final terms of the Third Party
Advance Facility) an alternative proposal for third party financing of the
Servicer Advances containing the most favorable terms then available to
Purchaser (the "Alternative Third Party Advance Facility") and, at Seller's
request, Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate to seek to consummate the
Closing utilizing any such Alternative Third Party Advance Facility together
with the Partial Seller Advance Facility modified, to the extent necessary, to
achieve for Purchaser the same aggregate economic terms as would have applied
had the Minimum Conforming Third Party Advance Facility Terms been available.

  

  

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 7.06 shall permit any
Party to delay the Closing beyond the date that the Closing would otherwise
occur in accordance with the other terms and conditions of this Agreement.

  

  

7.07 GS Interco Payable; Other Intercompany Indebtedness.

  

  

(a) Purchaser agrees that, concurrently with the Closing, it will make a
capital contribution to the Company in an amount equal to Estimated Closing
Company Repayment Amount less the proceeds, if any, of the Full Seller Advance
Facility or the Partial Seller Advance Facility and Third Party Advance
Facility, as the case may be. Each of Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate so
as to cause the Company, concurrently with the Closing, to immediately use
such capital contribution and such proceeds to repay in full the amount
outstanding under the Existing Seller Advance Facility Agreement and to repay
the Closing GS Interco Payable.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

53  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Prior to or simultaneous with the Closing, Seller will cause all
Intercompany Indebtedness to be satisfied in full and thereby cease to be
obligations and rights of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (in each
case, without Liability to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates including, after
the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries) such that as of the Closing
there will be no Intercompany Indebtedness.

  

  

7.08 GS Servicing Agreement. Following the date hereof and prior to July 1,
2011, the Parties will negotiate in good faith to agree on amendments to the
GS Servicing Agreement and similar agreements between Affiliates of Seller, on
the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, that are on terms mutually
acceptable to the Parties and that would be effective from and after the
Closing, such negotiation to be initially based on the terms set forth in the
form of amended and restated agreement attached as Exhibit E with such
negotiated additions and revisions as the Parties may agree to in good faith.
If the Parties fail to so agree by July 1, 2011, Seller may cause the GS
Servicing Agreement and similar agreements between the Company and Affiliates
of Seller to be terminated on sixty (60) days' notice to the Company. Nothing
in this Section 7.08 shall be deemed to require any Party to agree to any such
amendments and any such agreement shall be subject to such Party's review and
approval process for similar matters.

  

  

VIII. TAX MATTERS

  

  

8.01 General. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement (with the
exception of Sections 3.09, 5.01(viii) and clause (ii) of the first sentence
of Section12.01(a) hereof), this Article VIII will exclusively govern the
allocation of Tax liabilities and Tax matters.

  

  

8.02 Tax Cooperation.

  

  

(a) Purchaser and Seller will furnish to each other, upon request, as promptly
as practicable, such information and assistance relating to Seller, either
Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries (including access
to books and records) as is reasonably necessary for the filing of all Tax
Returns and claims for refund of Taxes, the making of any election relating to
Taxes, the preparation for any audit by any Taxing Authority and the
prosecution or defense of any Action relating to any Tax, in each case in
respect of the Company or its Subsidiaries. The Party requesting any such
information will bear all of the reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including attorneys' fees, but excluding reimbursement for salaries and
employee benefits) reasonably incurred in connection with providing such
information. Except with respect to information that is generally available to
the public, the Party requesting such information will (i) hold all such
information in the strictest confidence, except as required by applicable Law
or which must be disclosed in connection with any audit or Taxing Authority
inquiry, (ii) disseminate such information only to its Representatives who
have been advised of the confidential nature of such information, and only on
an as-needed basis, (iii) return any original documents promptly, after (A)
the filing of such Tax Return or claim for refund, the making of such
election, or the conclusion of such audit or Action and (B) upon request of
the other Party, all copies of the information received by it, and (iv) take
all steps necessary to cause its officers, directors, employees and
Representatives to comply with the terms and conditions of this Section 8.02.
Purchaser and Seller will retain all books and records with respect to Taxes
pertaining to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for a period of six (6)
years following the Closing or, if longer, until the statute of limitations
has run on any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period. Subject to Section
8.04, Purchaser and Seller will cooperate with each other in the conduct of
any audit or other proceeding relating to Taxes involving Seller, the Company
or any of their respective Subsidiaries.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

54  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) At Seller's reasonable request, Purchaser will cause the Company and/or
any of its Subsidiaries to make and/or join with Seller (or any of its
Affiliates) in making any election if the making of such election could not
reasonably be expected to have any adverse impact on Purchaser, any Affiliate
of Purchaser, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

  

  

(c) Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate as provided in this Section 8.02(c)
to determine (in accordance with all applicable Treasury Regulations
promulgated under Section 1060 of the Code) the allocation of the Purchase
Price and, to the extent included in the amount realized for federal income
tax purposes, liabilities of the Company (including liabilities of any
Subsidiary that are disregarded as separate from the Company) among the assets
of the Company (including the assets of such Subsidiaries) (the "Allocation").
No later than the Closing Date or as soon thereafter as practicable, Purchaser
and Seller shall agree on a preliminary Allocation. Thereafter, as soon as
practicable after the determination of the final Closing Statement, Purchaser
and Seller shall mutually adjust such allocation solely to the extent
necessary to reflect differences between the Company's assets and liabilities
as of the Closing Date and those taken into account in determining the
preliminary Allocation. Except as required by Law, neither Purchaser nor
Seller shall take, nor shall they permit any Affiliate (including the Company
and its Subsidiaries) to take, any position for income Tax purposes that is
inconsistent with the Allocation as finally determined hereunder; provided,
however, that (i) the basis of the Company's assets to Purchaser shall differ
from the total amount allocated to the extent necessary to reflect Purchaser's
capitalized transaction costs not included in the Allocation, and (ii) the
amount realized by Seller on the sale of the Partnership Interests may differ
from the Allocation to reflect transaction costs that reduce Seller's amount
realized for federal income tax purposes.

  

  

(d) None of Purchaser or its Affiliates shall make an election under Section
338 of the Code (or similar election) regarding the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

  

  

(e) Purchaser or Seller, as required by applicable Law, (the "Preparing
Party") will timely file all Tax Returns with respect to all excise, sales,
use, value added, registration, stamp, recording, documentary, conveyancing,
transfer, transaction privilege and similar Taxes, levies, charges and fees
incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(collectively, the "Transfer Taxes"), and all such Transfer Taxes (and all
out-of-pocket costs for preparation of such Tax Returns) shall be borne
equally by Purchaser and Seller, whether or not reflected on a Tax Return.
Within ten (10) days prior to payment of such Transfer Taxes being due, the
Preparing Party will provide the other Party with copies of such Tax Returns,
and the other Party will pay to Preparing Party within seven (7) days thereof
fifty percent (50%) of the amount of such Transfer Taxes. Purchaser and Seller
will reasonably cooperate to reduce or eliminate Transfer Taxes to the extent
permitted by applicable Law.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

55  

  

 

 

 

  

  

8.03 Apportionment; Return Filings; Refunds and Credits.

  

  

(a) The portion of Tax with respect to the income, property or operations of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that relates to any taxable period that
includes but does not end on the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period") will be
apportioned between the period of the Straddle Period that extends before the
Closing Date through the Closing Date (the "Pre-Closing Straddle Period") and
the period of the Straddle Period that extends from the day after the Closing
Date to the end of the Straddle Period (the "Post-Closing Straddle Period") in
accordance with this Section 8.03(a). The portion of such Tax attributable to
the Pre-Closing Straddle Period will (i) in the case of any Taxes, other than
(A) sales or use taxes, (B) value-added taxes, (C) employment taxes, (D)
withholding taxes and (E) any Tax based on, or measured by income, receipts or
profits earned during a Straddle Period, be deemed equal to the amount that
would be payable for the entire Straddle Period (or, in the case of such Taxes
determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately
preceding period), multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of days in the Pre-Closing Straddle Period, and denominator of which is
the number of days in the Straddle Period and (ii) in the case of any (A)
sales or use taxes, (B) value added taxes, (C) employment taxes, (D)
withholding taxes, and (E) any Tax based on or measured by income, receipts or
profits earned during a Straddle Period, be deemed equal to the amount
(determined without annualizing any Tax rate) that would be payable if the
Straddle Period ended on and included the Closing Date but excluded all
transactions that occur after the Closing (without Seller's prior consent)
outside the Ordinary Course of Business. To the extent that any Tax for a
Straddle Period is based on the greater of a Tax on net income, on the one
hand, and a Tax measured by net worth or some other basis not otherwise
measured by income, on the other hand, the portion of such Tax related to the
Pre-Closing Straddle Period will be determined based on the foregoing and
based on the manner in which the actual Tax liability for the entire Straddle
Period is determined. For purposes of this Section 8.03(a), any exemption,
deduction, credit or other item that is calculated on an annual basis will be
allocated to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period on a pro rata basis by
multiplying the total amount of such items for the Straddle Period by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the Pre-
Closing Straddle Period, and the denominator of which is the number of
calendar days in the Straddle Period. The portion of Tax attributable to a
Post-Closing Straddle Period will be calculated in a corresponding manner.

  

  

(b) (ii) Seller or its designee will prepare and timely file (including
extensions), or cause to be prepared and timely filed (including extensions),
in proper form with the appropriate Taxing Authority all Tax Returns of the
Company and its Subsidiaries required to be filed (taking into account any
extensions) for any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date.
Seller will pay or cause to be paid any and all unpaid Taxes due with respect
to such Tax Returns; provided, however, that Purchaser will pay or cause to be
paid any such Taxes to the extent of the accrued amount of such Taxes included
in the final Closing Modified Net Worth Amount. Purchaser will provide or
cause to be provided to Seller in a timely manner all reasonably necessary
data and other information available to Purchaser and not otherwise available
to Seller to prepare such Tax Returns.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(iii) Purchaser or its designee will prepare and timely file (including
extensions), or cause to be prepared and timely filed (including extensions),
in proper form with the appropriate Taxing Authority all Tax Returns of or
relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries required to be filed (taking into
account any extensions) for any taxable period ending after the Closing Date.
Purchaser will pay or cause to be paid any and all Taxes due with respect to
any such Returns; provided,however, that Seller will pay or cause to be paid
any such Taxes of the Company or its Subsidiaries relating to a Pre-Closing
Straddle Period except to the extent of the accrued amount of such Taxes
included in the final Closing Modified Net Worth Amount.

  

  

(iv) Purchaser will deliver to Seller any Tax Returns described in Section
8.03(b) with respect to which Seller is required to pay or cause to be paid
any Taxes relating to any Pre-Closing Straddle Period (and any relevant
workpapers or other documents reasonably requested by Seller) for Seller's
review and comment as soon as practicable prior to the due date of such Tax
Returns (but in any event no fewer than thirty (30) days before the filing
date), and Seller will provide Purchaser with comments no later than ten (10)
days prior to the due date of such Tax Returns. Unless otherwise agreed with
Seller, Purchaser shall prepare such Tax Returns on a basis consistent with
past practices, unless otherwise required by applicable Law on the advice of
counsel. Purchaser will reasonably consider any revisions to such Tax Returns
that relate to any Pre-Closing Straddle Period as are requested by Seller.

  

  

(v) Except as required by Law, neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates
will amend, refile, revoke or otherwise modify any Tax Return or Tax election
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period or Pre-Closing Straddle Period without the prior written consent of
Seller. Except as required by Law, Seller may not amend, refile, revoke or
otherwise modify or cause or permit to be amended, refiled, revoked or
otherwise modified any Tax Return or Tax election of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that affects or may affect the Tax liability of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries with respect to a Post-Closing Tax Period or Post-
Closing Straddle Period without the prior written consent of Purchaser.

  

  

(c) Seller shall indemnify Purchaser, Purchaser's Affiliates, the Company and
its Subsidiaries, and hold them harmless from and against, without
duplication, any loss, claim, liability, expense, or other damage attributable
to (i) all Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Pre-Closing Straddle Period
(except to the extent of the accrued amount of such Taxes included in the
final Closing Modified Net Worth Amount), (ii) all Taxes (or the non-payment
thereof) for which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is liable because of
its membership in a consolidated, combined or other group with Persons other
than the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date, and (iii)
subject to Section 12.01, any failure of any representation or warranty of
Seller set forth in Section 3.09 to be true and correct in all material
respects or a material breach of a covenant set forth in Section 5.01(viii) or
any agreement set forth in this Article VIII. Purchaser shall indemnify Seller
and Seller's Affiliates and hold them harmless from and against, without
duplication, any loss, claim, liability, expense, or other damage attributable
to (i) all Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) for which Purchaser is liable
under this Article VIII and (ii) a breach of or any agreement set forth in
this Article VIII.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

57  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) Purchaser will pay or cause to be paid to Seller any refunds or credits of
income Taxes (including interest thereon) with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period or Pre-Closing Straddle Period received by or credited to Purchaser,
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates within ten
(10) Business Days after the receipt of such refund or the realization of such
credit; provided, however, that Purchaser shall not be required to reimburse
Seller for any such refund or credit to the extent such refund or credit was
included as an asset in the final Closing Modified Net Worth Amount. At
Seller's reasonable request, Purchaser and its Affiliates will use
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Seller in obtaining such
refunds or credits, including through the filing of amended Tax Returns or
refund claims as prepared by Seller, at Seller's own expense.

  

  

8.04 Procedures Relating to Defense of Tax Claims. If after the Closing,
notice of a Tax Contest is made by any Taxing Authority against the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, which asserts that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is or may be liable for any Taxes and which Tax Contest, if
successful, might result in a Liability of Seller under applicable Law or
under this Agreement, Purchaser will promptly notify Seller in writing of such
claim after receipt of notice by Purchaser, the Company or any of their
Affiliates. Seller will promptly notify Purchaser in writing of such claim
after receipt of notice by Seller or any of its Affiliates. Seller shall, at
its election, have the right to represent the Company's or its Subsidiaries'
interests, as the case may be, in any Tax Contest relating to a Pre-Closing
Tax Period, to employ counsel of its choice at its expense and to control the
conduct of such Tax Contest. Seller shall have the right to settle or dispose
of any such Tax Contest, provided, however, that Seller shall consult with
Purchaser regarding any such Tax Contest and shall allow Purchaser to
participate in any such proceeding (at its own cost and expense), and provided
further that no settlement or other disposition of any Tax Claim which would
adversely affect Purchaser (or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in any
Post-Closing Tax Period) shall be agreed to without Purchaser's prior written
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned. Purchaser shall have the right to control the conduct and
resolution of any Tax Contest relating to a Post-Closing Tax Period, provided,
however, that with respect to Tax Contests relating to a Straddle Period (in a
way which could result in an indemnification obligation by Sellers pursuant to
Section 8.03(c)), Purchaser shall keep Seller reasonably informed of the
progress of such Tax Contest and shall not effect any settlement or compromise
of such Tax Contest without obtaining Seller's prior written consent thereto,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned.

  

  

8.05 Separate Tax Returns. For the avoidance of doubt, references in Section
3.09, 5.01(viii), 5.02(a), 7.03 and in this Article VIII to Tax Returns, Tax
withholding or other liabilities, or Tax audits, elections or other procedural
matters relating to Taxes, of or in respect of the Company or its Subsidiaries
apply to them only to the extent they are treated for purposes of Taxes as
separate entities or as part of a group consisting only of them, and thus
shall not apply to any direct or indirect owner of the Company or its
Subsidiaries based on the status of the Company or its Subsidiaries as
disregarded entities for certain Tax purposes. Nothing in this Agreement shall
grant to Purchaser or to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries any rights of
control over, or access to or information about, Taxes or Tax procedures or
Tax Returns of or filed by The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. or its Affiliates
other than the Company and its Subsidiaries to the extent they are separate
taxpayers.

IX. EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

  

  

9.01 Employee Benefits and Compensation.

  

  

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 9.01 or Article XII (relating
to indemnification), the Company or one of its Subsidiaries (or an Affiliate
thereof designated by Purchaser) will be responsible on and following the
Closing for each Litton Employee Plan identified in Section 3.12(a)(i) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule and employment-related liabilities (whether
incurred before, on or after the Closing Date) with respect to any Company
Person, including liability for continuation coverage pursuant to Section
4980B of the Code and Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA ("COBRA") under
any Litton Employee Plans. Seller (or one of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates
designated by Seller) will be responsible on and following the Closing for
each Seller Plan and employment-related liabilities (whether incurred before,
on or after the Closing Date) with respect to any Company Person.

  

  

(b) (i) Without limitation on the foregoing, until the one-year anniversary of
the Closing Date, the Purchaser will continue in effect the severance plans of
the Company and the Seller (or applicable Affiliate) for the benefit of
respective Continuing Employees that were participating therein immediately
prior to the Closing Date. Any payment pursuant to such severance plan shall
be calculated based on the higher of the Continuing Employee's salary as of
(A) the termination date of employment with Purchaser or its subsidiaries or
successors, or (B) the Closing Date.

  

  

(ii) Purchaser will, or will cause the Company or one of its Subsidiaries (or
an Affiliate thereof designated by Purchaser) to, administer and assume all
responsibility for the Litton Employee Plans in accordance with their terms.
Except as provided in Section 9.01(c)(i), Purchaser will, or will cause the
Company or one of its Subsidiaries (or any other Affiliate designated by
Purchaser) to, cause all plans and programs of Purchaser, the Company and its
Subsidiaries (or any other Affiliate designated by Purchaser) that provide
benefits to Continuing Employees to recognize all service of the Continuing
Employees with Seller or any of its predecessors and Affiliates to the same
extent and for the same purposes thereunder as such service was counted under
similar benefit plans of Seller or any of its predecessors and Affiliates for
purposes of eligibility, vesting, eligibility for early retirement benefits
and benefit accrual, except as would result in a duplication of benefits.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

59  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(iii) Any medical, dental or vision plan of Purchaser, the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (or any other Affiliate designated by Purchaser) that is
adopted or continued after the Closing to provide group health benefits to
Continuing Employees (a "Purchaser Group Health Plan") will not include with
respect to any Continuing Employee any restrictions or limitations with
respect to pre-existing condition exclusions or any actively-at-work
requirements (except to the extent such restrictions or limitations were
applicable as of the Closing Date under a Litton Employee Plan or Seller's or
any of its Subsidiaries' current group health plans in effect as of the
Closing Date or any similar plans of Seller or any of its predecessors or
Affiliates (an "Existing Group Health Plan")), and any eligible expenses
incurred by any Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during
the portion of the plan year of such Existing Group Health Plan ending on the
date such Continuing Employee's participation in such Purchaser Group Health
Plan begins will be taken into account under the Purchaser Group Health Plan
for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-
pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her
covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been
paid in accordance with such Purchaser Group Health Plan.

  

  

(c) (i) On or immediately prior to the Closing Date Seller shall, or shall
cause its Subsidiary or Affiliate to, fully vest the unvested account balances
of Continuing Employees who participate in the Archon 401(k) Retirement Plan
(the "Archon 401(k) Plan") or any other 401(k) retirement plan maintained by
Seller or its Affiliates for the benefit of Continuing Employees. As soon as
practicable after the Closing Date but in no case later than 60 days Purchaser
shall cause the Company to adopt a defined contribution plan with a section
401(k) feature (the "Company 401(k) Plan"). The Company 401(k) Plan shall
provide for the receipt of eligible rollover contributions from Continuing
Employees entitled to distributions from the Archon Retirement Plan or any
other 401(k) retirement plan maintained by Seller or its Affiliates for the
benefit of Continuing Employees, including, to the extent possible under the
recordkeeping system supporting the Company 401(k) Plan, associated loans
transferred in kind as a direct rollover within the meaning of section 402 of
the Code.

  

  

(ii) Purchaser will, or will cause the Company and its Subsidiaries (or an
Affiliate thereof designated by Purchaser), have the Company 401(k) Plan to
recognize all service of the Continuing Employees with Seller or any of its
predecessors and Affiliates to the same extent and for the same purposes
thereunder as such service was counted under the Archon 401(k) Plan or another
401(k) retirement plan maintained by Seller or its Affiliates for the benefit
of Continuing Employees, except as would result in a duplication of benefits.

  

  

(iii) Purchaser will, or will cause the Company or its Subsidiaries (or an
Affiliate thereof designated by Purchaser) to, continue to reimburse Archon
for the participation of Continuing Employees in any employee benefit plan,
program, arrangement, agreement or commitment maintained by Seller or its
Affiliates including Archon (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries), or
in respect of which any such Person has or may have any liability for benefits
provided to Continuing Employees in respect of the period on or prior to the
Closing Date to the extent accrued or reserved against and is included in the
final Closing Modified Net Worth Amount, as consistent with past practice.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

60  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) On or prior to the Closing, Seller shall cause the individuals set forth
on Section 9.01(d)(i) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule ("Company Transfer
Employees") to cease to be employed by the Company and become employees of
Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries).
Purchaser agrees that it will not (and will cause each of its Affiliates not
to), directly or indirectly (including through an executive search firm),
without the prior written consent of Seller prior to the eighteen month
anniversary of the Closing Date, (i) solicit any employee set forth in Section
9.01(d)(i) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule to leave his or her employment,
with the Seller any of its Subsidiaries or any such successor, or to accept
any other position or employment or enter into any independent contractor
relationship or assist any other Person in hiring or attempting to hire such
employee, or (ii) hire, employ or engage any such employee. Purchaser further
agrees that, for the time period commencing on the date of this Agreement and
continuing until the earlier of (x) the Closing Date or (y) eighteen (18)
months from the date of this Agreement, it will not (and will cause each of
its Affiliates not to), directly or indirectly (including through an executive
search firm), without the prior written consent of Seller (i) solicit any
employee set forth in Section 9.01(d)(i) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule to
leave his or her employment with Seller, any of its Subsidiaries or any such
successor, or to accept any other position or employment or enter into any
independent contractor relationship or assist any other Person in hiring or
attempting to hire such employee, or (ii) hire, employ or engage any such
employee.

  

  

9.02 Employee Matters.

  

  

(a) It is expressly agreed and understood that neither Purchaser nor Seller
has any right, power or authority to control, direct or regulate the labor
relations and human resources policies and procedures of the other, that
neither is deemed to constitute the agent or representative of the other, and
that neither is liable in any manner whatsoever for the acts or omissions of
the other, its agents, representatives or employees.

  

  

(b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, at all times prior to the Closing,
Seller will have sole and exclusive responsibility for the operation and
management of the Company and its Subsidiaries, for the employment and control
of Company Employees, for compliance with all Laws governing the employment
relationship, and for compliance with the terms of any employment Contract or
Employee Plan covering Company Employees. At all times on or subsequent to the
Closing, Purchaser will have sole and exclusive responsibility for the
operation and management of the Company and its Subsidiaries, for the
employment and control of Continuing Employees, for compliance with all Laws
governing the employment relationship, and for compliance with the terms of
any employment Contract or Employee Plan covering Continuing Employees.

on the failure of any condition set forth in Sections 10.01, 10.02 or 10.03 to
be satisfied if such failure was caused by such Party's failure to comply with
its obligations in this Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

63  

  

 

 

 

  

  

XI. TERMINATION

  

  

11.01 Grounds for Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the Closing:

  

  

(a) by mutual written agreement of Seller and Purchaser;

  

  

(b) by either Seller or Purchaser if the Closing has not been consummated on
or before November 1, 2011, provided, that if the condition set forth in
Sections 10.02(d) or 10.03(d) have not been satisfied prior to the Termination
Date, but all other conditions to the Closing have been satisfied or are
reasonably expected to be capable of being satisfied, the Termination Date may
be extended from time to time by Seller or Purchaser one or more times by
written notice to the other Party up to a date not beyond January 1, 2012
(such date, as so extended the "Termination Date");

  

  

(c) by Seller, (but only so long as Seller is not in material breach of its
obligations under this Agreement) if there has been a material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Purchaser such that one or
more of the conditions to Closing set forth in Section 10.01 and 10.03 are not
capable of being fulfilled as of the Termination Date and such breach, if of a
type that can be cured, shall not have been cured by Purchaser or waived by
Seller within twenty (20) days of written notice thereof from Seller;

  

  

(d) by Purchaser, (but only so long as Purchaser is not in material breach of
its obligations under this Agreement) if there has been a material breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Seller such that one or
more of the conditions to Closing set forth in Section 10.01 and 10.02 are not
capable of being fulfilled as of the Termination Date and such breach, if of a
type that can be cured, shall not have been cured by Seller or waived by
Purchaser within twenty (20) days of written notice thereof from Purchaser; or

  

  

(e) by either Seller or Purchaser in the event of the issuance of a final,
non-appealable Order restraining or prohibiting the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

Notwithstanding anything in this Section 11.01 to the contrary, no Party may
terminate this Agreement pursuant to paragraphs (b), (c), (d) or (e) of this
Section 11.01 if such Party's failure to perform in any material respect any
of its obligations or covenants, or the inaccuracy of any of its
representations or warranties, under this Agreement has been the principal
cause of, or has resulted in, the event or condition purportedly giving rise
to a right to terminate this Agreement under such paragraph.

  

  

The Party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to paragraph (b), (c),
(d) or (e) of this Section 11.01 will give written notice of such termination
to the other Party specifying the grounds for termination.

  

  

11.02 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with Section 11.01, (a) this Agreement shall be null and void and have no
further force and effect, except that the provisions of this Section 11.02
(Effect of Termination), Section 7.04(a) (Confidentiality) and Article XIII
(Miscellaneous) will survive any termination hereof pursuant to Section 11.01
and (b) nothing contained herein shall terminate any Party's liability for
intentional breaches of this Agreement prior to termination. For this purpose
"intentional" means an action or omission that the breaching party knows or
reasonably should have known is or would result in a breach of this Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

64  

  

 

 

 

  

  

XII. SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION

  

  

12.01 Survival.

  

  

(a) The representations and warranties of the parties hereto contained herein
shall survive until the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing Date,
except that (i) each Seller Fundamental Representation and each Purchaser
Fundamental Representation shall survive without limitation and (ii) the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.09 (Taxes) shall survive
the Closing and continue until thirty (30) calendar days after the expiration
of the applicable statute of limitations. Neither Purchaser nor Seller shall
have any obligation to indemnify Seller Indemnified Parties or Purchaser
Indemnified Parties, as the case may be, with respect to claims for breach of
any representation or warranty first asserted in accordance with this Article
XII after the expiration of the survival period specified therefor in this
Section 12.01(a).

  

  

(b) Neither Purchaser nor Seller shall have any obligation to indemnify Seller
Indemnified Parties or Purchaser Indemnified Parties, as the case may be, with
respect to claims for breaches of covenants under this Agreement (i) that are
to be performed prior to Closing unless such claims are first asserted in
accordance with this Article XII within twelve (12) months following the
Closing and (ii) that are to be performed after the Closing unless such claims
are first asserted within twelve (12) months following the date on which such
covenant or agreement was required to be performed in accordance its terms.

  

  

12.02 Indemnification by Seller. Subject to the limitations set forth in this
Article XII, from and after the Closing, Seller will indemnify, defend and
hold harmless Purchaser, the Company, their respective Subsidiaries and
respective officers, directors and employees (collectively, the "Purchaser
Indemnified Parties")

  

  

(a) from and against any Covered Losses incurred by any such Purchaser
Indemnified Party resulting from or arising out of the breach or inaccuracy of
any representation or warranty of Seller contained in this Agreement or the
certificate provided by Seller pursuant to Section 10.02(c);

  

  

(b) from and against any Covered Losses incurred by any such Purchaser
Indemnified Party resulting from or arising out of any failure by Seller to
comply with any covenant or agreement made by Seller in this Agreement; and

  

  

(c) from and against any Covered Losses incurred by such Purchaser Indemnified
Party resulting from or arising out of Loss Sharing Claims to the extent
necessary so that Seller (and the other Seller Indemnified Parties) shall
bear, whether directly or through the indemnification provided in this Section
12.02(c), (i) first, eighty percent (80%) of each claim in respect of such
Covered Losses until the amount paid pursuant to this Section 12.02(c) is
equal to eighty percent (80%) of the Shared Loss Cap and (ii) thereafter,
twenty percent (20%) of any such Covered Losses until the amount paid pursuant
to this Section 12.02(c) is equal to the Shared Loss Cap; and

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

65  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) from and against any Retained Liability.

  

  

The following shall be deemed payments by Seller pursuant to Section 12.02(c)
for purposes of the Shared Loss Cap: (i) eighty percent (80%) of any Pre-
Closing Loss Sharing Claim Payments (for the portion, if any, of the aggregate
Pre-Closing Loss Sharing Claim Payments and Loss Sharing Reserves that are
less than fifty percent (50%) of the Purchase Price Cap) and (ii) twenty
percent (20%) of the Pre-Closing Loss Sharing Claim Payments and Loss Sharing
Reserves (for the portion, if any, of the aggregate Pre-Closing Loss Sharing
Claim Payments and Loss Sharing Reserves that are less than one hundred
percent (100%) of the Purchase Price Cap). In the event a Covered Loss would
be eligible for indemnity under either Section 12.02(a) or Section 12.02(c),
such Covered Loss shall be recoverable only under Section 12.02(a). In the
event a Covered Loss would be eligible for indemnity under (i) either Section
12.02(a) or Section 12.02(c) and (ii) Section 12.02(d), such Covered Loss
shall be recoverable only under Section 12.02(d).

  

  

12.03 Indemnification by Purchaser. Subject to the limitations set forth in
this Article XII, from and after the Closing Purchaser will (and will cause
the Company, jointly and severally with Purchaser, to) indemnify, defend and
hold harmless Seller, its Subsidiaries and their respective officers,
directors and employees (collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Parties")

  

  

(a) from and against any Covered Losses incurred by any such Seller
Indemnified Party resulting from or arising out of any inaccuracy in any
representation or warranty of Purchaser contained in this Agreement or the
certificate provided by Purchaser pursuant to Section 10.03(c);

  

  

(b) from and against any Covered Losses incurred by any such Seller
Indemnified Party resulting from or arising out of any failure by Purchaser to
comply with any covenant or agreement made by Purchaser in this Agreement; and

  

  

(c) from and against any Covered Losses incurred by such Seller Indemnified
Party resulting from or arising out of Loss Sharing Claims to the extent
necessary so that Purchaser (and the other Purchaser Indemnified Parties)
shall bear, whether directly or through the indemnification provided in this
Section 12.03(c), (i) first, twenty percent (20%) of each claim in respect of
such Covered Losses until the amount paid pursuant to this Section 12.03(c) is
equal to twenty percent (20%) of the Shared Loss Cap, (ii) second, eighty
percent (80%) of any such Covered Losses until the amount paid pursuant to
this Section 12.03(c) is equal to the Shared Loss Cap and (iii) thereafter one
hundred percent (100%) of any such Covered Losses in excess of the Shared Loss
Cap.

  

  

● The following shall be deemed payments by Purchaser pursuant to Section
12.03(c) for purposes of the Shared Loss Cap: (i) twenty percent (20%) of any
Pre-Closing Loss Sharing Claim Payments and Loss Sharing Reserves (for the
portion, if any, of the aggregate Pre-Closing Loss Sharing Claim Payments and
Loss Sharing Reserves that are less than fifty percent (50%) of the Purchase
Price Cap) and (ii) eighty percent (80%) of the Pre-Closing Loss Sharing Claim
Payments and Loss Sharing Reserves (for the portion, if any, of the aggregate
Pre-Closing Loss Sharing Claim Payments and Loss Sharing Reserves that are
less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Purchase Price Cap). In the event
that a Covered Loss would be eligible for indemnity under either Section
12.03(a) or Section 12.03(c), such Covered Loss shall be recoverable only
under Section 12.03(a).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

66  

  

 

 

 

  

  

12.04 Limitations on Liability of Sellers. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement:

  

  

(a) Seller shall not be liable under Section 12.02(a) until the aggregate
amount of Covered Losses under Section 12.02(a) for which notice was timely
received in accordance with Section 12.01 exceeds one percent (1%) of the
Purchase Price Cap (the "Aggregate Basket Amount"), at which time Seller shall
be liable for all such Covered Losses (including all Covered Losses included
within such Aggregate Basket Amount); except that claims related to any breach
of or inaccuracy in the (i) Seller Fundamental Representations or (ii) the
representations and warrants set forth in Section 3.09 (Taxes), in each case,
shall not be subject to any such limits.

  

  

(b) Seller shall have no liability for Covered Losses arising under Section
12.02(a) in excess of twenty percent (20%) of the Purchase Price Cap, except
that claims related to any breach of or inaccuracy in the Seller Fundamental
Representations shall not be subject to any such limit.

  

  

(c) Subject to the last sentence of Section 12.02, Seller shall have no
liability under this Agreement to any Purchaser Indemnified Party for Covered
Losses in respect of Loss Sharing Claims other than pursuant to Section
12.02(c).

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any
Covered Losses arising from fraud, intentional misrepresentation based on the
representations and warranties set forth in Article III or willful and
malicious breaches of this Agreement by Seller, shall not be subject to this
Section 12.04 or any other limitation set forth in this Agreement.

  

  

12.05 Limitations on Liability of Purchaser. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement:

  

  

(a) Purchaser shall not be liable under Section 12.03(a): until the aggregate
amount of Covered Losses under Section 12.03(a) for which notice was timely
received in accordance with Section 12.01 exceeds the Aggregate Basket Amount,
at which time Purchaser shall be liable for all such Covered Losses (including
all Covered Losses included within such Aggregate Basket Amount); except that
claims related to any breach of or inaccuracy in the Purchaser Fundamental
Representations shall not be subject to any such limits.

  

  

(b) Purchaser shall have no liability for Covered Losses arising under Section
12.03(a) in excess of twenty percent (20%) of the Purchase Price Cap, except
that claims related to any breach of or inaccuracy in the Purchaser
Fundamental Representations shall not be subject to any such limit.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

67  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any
Covered Losses arising from fraud, intentional misrepresentation based on the
representations and warranties set forth in Article IV or willful and
malicious breaches of this Agreement by Purchaser, shall not be subject to
this Section 12.05 or any other limitation set forth in this Agreement.

  

  

12.06 Claims. As promptly as is reasonably practicable after becoming aware of
a claim for indemnification under this Agreement that does not involve a Third
Party Claim, the indemnified party shall give notice to the indemnifying party
of such claim, which notice shall specify the provision of this Agreement
pursuant to which indemnity is sought, the facts alleged to constitute the
basis for such claim (taking into account the information then available to
the indemnified party), the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements alleged to have been breached (if applicable) and the amount (if
then determinable) that the indemnified party seeks hereunder from the
indemnifying party; provided, that the failure of an indemnified party to
notify the indemnifying party will not affect the indemnification provided
hereunder except to the extent that the indemnifying party's defense or other
rights available to it is actually prejudiced as a result of such failure, and
then only to the extent of such prejudice.

  

  

12.07 Notice of Third Party Claims; Assumption of Defense.

  

  

(a) The indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as is reasonably
practicable, and in no event later than ten (10) Business Days, after
receiving notice thereof, to the indemnifying party of the assertion of any
claim, or the commencement of any Action by any Person not a party hereto in
respect of which indemnity may be sought under this Agreement (a "Third Party
Claim"), which notice shall specify the provision of this Agreement pursuant
to which indemnity is sought and shall further specify in reasonable detail
the nature and amount of such claim including the identity of the Persons
bringing such claim or Action, and the provision of Law or Contract alleged to
have been breached. The failure to give such notification will not affect the
indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the indemnifying
party's defense or other rights available to it is actually prejudiced as a
result of such failure, and then only to the extent of such prejudice.

  

  

(b) Seller shall have the sole power, at its option, to direct and control the
defense of any Loss Sharing Claim for which it will have at least a majority
of the expected financial responsibility or claim with respect to a Retained
Liability by giving written notice thereof to Purchaser; provided, that Seller
shall thereafter consult with Purchaser upon Purchaser's reasonable request
for such consultation from time to time with respect to such Loss Sharing
Claim or Retained Liability. If Seller assumes such defense, Purchaser shall
have the right (but not the obligation) to participate in (but not control)
the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own cost and expense,
separate from the counsel employed by Seller. Notwithstanding anything in this
Section 12.07(b) to the contrary, in the event that Seller denies that Seller
has any obligation to indemnify Purchaser hereunder with respect to any such
Loss Sharing Claim or claim with respect to a Retained Liability, Seller shall
no longer have the right to direct and control the defense of such Loss
Sharing Claim or claim with respect to a Retained Liability, and thereafter
Purchaser shall have the sole power, at its option, to direct and control the
defense of any such Loss Sharing Claim or claim with respect to a Retained
Liability.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

68  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Purchaser shall have the sole power, at its option, to direct and control
the defense of any Loss Sharing Claim for which it will have at least a
majority of the expected financial responsibility by giving written notice
thereof to Seller; provided, that Purchaser shall thereafter consult with
Seller upon Seller's reasonable request for such consultation from time to
time with respect to such Loss Sharing Claim. If Purchaser assumes such
defense, Seller shall have the right (but not the obligation) to participate
in (but not control) the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own
cost and expense, separate from the counsel employed by Purchaser.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 12.07(c) to the contrary, in the
event that Purchaser denies that Purchaser has any obligation to indemnify
Seller hereunder with respect to any such Loss Sharing Claim, Purchaser shall
no longer have the right to direct and control the defense of such Loss
Sharing Claim, and thereafter Seller shall have the sole power, at its option,
to direct and control the defense of any such Loss Sharing Claim.

  

  

(d) The indemnifying party shall have the have the sole power, at its option,
to direct and control the defense of any Third Party Claim for which
indemnification may be sought under Section 12.02(a), 12.02(b), 12.03(a) or
12.03(b) by giving written notice thereof to the indemnified party; provided,
that the indemnifying party shall thereafter consult with the indemnified
party upon the indemnified party's reasonable request for such consultation
from time to time with respect to such Third Party Claim. If the indemnifying
party assumes such defense, the indemnified party shall have the right (but
not the obligation) to participate in (but not control) the defense thereof
and to employ counsel, at its own cost and expense, separate from the counsel
employed by the indemnified party. Notwithstanding anything in this Section
12.07(d) to the contrary, in the event that the indemnifying party denies that
such indemnifying party has any obligation to indemnify the indemnified party
hereunder with respect to any Third Party Claim for which indemnification may
be sought under Section 12.02(a), 12.02(b), 12.03(a) or 12.03(b), the
indemnifying party shall no longer have the right to direct and control the
defense of any such Third Party Claim, and thereafter the indemnified party
shall have the sole power, at its option, to direct and control the defense of
any such Third Party Claim.

  

  

(e) If the Person entitled to elect to defend a Third Party Claim pursuant to
paragraph (b), (c) or (d) of this Section 12.07 elects not to do so, the other
Party hereto shall have the right but not the obligation to assume the defense
thereof. The Party who assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim is
referred to herein as the "Controlling Party" and the other Party with respect
to any such Third Party Claim is referred to herein as the "Non-Controlling
Party".

  

  

(f) If Third Party Claim is a criminal claim (a "Criminal Third Party Claim"),
the subject of such Third Party Claim may elect to assume the defense of such
claim. If a Seller Indemnified Party and a Purchaser Indemnified Party are
each subjects of such criminal Third Party Claim, each Party may elect to
defend the claims against it, no Party shall be deemed to be the Controlling
Party and no Party shall have the right to make any settlement, compromise or
offer to settle or compromise such Third Party Claim as it relates to the
other Party.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

69  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(g) Other than with respect to Criminal Third Party Claims, any Non-
Controlling Party may become the Controlling Party with respect to any Third
Party Claim by releasing the initial Controlling Party from any and all
Liability under this Article XII with respect to such Third Party Claim and
indemnifying the initial Controlling Party against any and all Losses that may
be incurred by the initial Controlling Party in connection with such Third
Party Claim; provided, however, that if a Third Party Claim alleges wrongdoing
by the Controlling Party or its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries) or involves other reputational matters relating to the
Controlling Party or its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries), the Non-Controlling Party may only become the Controlling Party
with the consent of the initial Controlling Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

  

  

(h) The provisions of Section 7.03 shall apply with respect to any Third Party
Claim for which indemnification is sought under this Article XII.

  

  

12.08 Settlement or Compromise. The Controlling Party with respect to any
Third Party Claim shall have the right to make any settlement, compromise,
judgment or offer to settle or compromise such Third Party Claim with the
prior written consent of the Non-Controlling Party (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld), binding upon such Non-Controlling Party in the same
manner as if a final judgment or decree had been entered by a court of
competent jurisdiction in the amount of such settlement or compromise;
provided, however, that such written consent of the Non-Controlling Party
shall not be required in the event (i) such settlement, compromise, judgment
or offer to settle or compromise such Third Party Claim does not (A) involve
any finding or admission of any violation of Law or admission of any
wrongdoing by the Non-Controlling Party or (B) materially encumber any of the
assets of any Non-Controlling Party or adversely affect in any material
respect the post-Closing operation of the business of the Non-Controlling
Party or its Affiliates in any manner (provided that any settlement or
compromise with a Governmental Authority that imposes terms or conditions not
substantially more onerous to the Company or its Subsidiaries than the terms
and conditions imposed by such Governmental Authority in settlements or
compromises with other mortgage servicers shall not be deemed to adversely
affect in any material respect the post-Closing operation of the business of
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates in any manner), and (ii) the Controlling
Party shall (A) pay or cause to be paid all amounts required to be paid by it
under this Article XII arising out of such settlement or judgment with the
effectiveness of such settlement or judgment, and (B) obtain, as a condition
of any settlement, compromise, judgment or offer to settle or compromise, or
other resolution, an appropriate release of each Non-Controlling Party from
any and all corresponding liabilities in respect of such Third Party Claim or
the applicable portion thereof.

  

  

12.09 Exclusive Remedy. From and after the Closing, the exclusive remedy of
Seller, the Seller Indemnified Parties, Purchaser and the Purchaser
Indemnified Persons in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, whether under this Agreement or arising under common law
or any other Law, shall be as provided in this Article XII. In furtherance of
the foregoing, each of Purchaser, on behalf of itself and each other Purchaser
Indemnified Party, and Seller, on behalf of itself and each other Seller
Indemnified Party, hereby waives, from and after the Closing, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all rights, claims and causes
of action (other than claims of, or causes of action arising from, intentional
fraud) it may have against Seller or any of its Affiliates or representatives
and Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or representatives, as the case may be,
arising under or based upon this Agreement or any certificate delivered in
connection herewith, whether under this contract or arising under common law
or any other Law except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth
in this Article XII. Nothing in this Section 12.09 shall operate to interfere
with or impede the operation of the provisions of Section 2.04, Article VIII,
Article IX or any Ancillary Agreement or the rights of either Party to seek
equitable remedies to enforce any covenant of a Party to be performed after
the Closing.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

70  

  

 

 

 

  

  

12.10 Net Losses; Subrogation; Mitigation; No Set-Off.

  

  

(a) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the amount of
any Covered Losses incurred or suffered by an indemnified party shall be
calculated after giving effect to (i) any insurance proceeds received by the
indemnified party (or any of its Affiliates) with respect to such Losses and
(ii) any recoveries obtained by the indemnified party (or any of its
Affiliates) from any other third party in respect of such Covered Loss. The
indemnified party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such
proceeds, benefits and recoveries. If any such proceeds or recoveries are
received by an Indemnified Party (or any of its Affiliates) with respect to
any Covered Losses after an indemnifying party has made a payment to the
indemnified party with respect thereto, the indemnified party (or such
Affiliate) shall pay to the indemnifying party the amount of such proceeds or
recoveries (up to the amount of the indemnifying party's payment). The
indemnified party will use its commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any
actual or potential Covered Loss, in each case to the same extent as it would
if such Covered Loss were not subject to indemnification pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement. No indemnified party will be entitled to recover from an
indemnifying party more than once in respect of the same Covered Losses.

  

  

(b) In the event any payment is made in respect of Covered Losses, the
indemnifying party who made such payment will be subrogated to the extent of
such payment to any related rights of recovery of the indemnified party
receiving such payment against any third party. Such indemnified party (and
its Affiliates) and indemnifying party shall execute upon request all
instruments reasonably necessary to evidence or further perfect such
subrogation rights.

  

  

(c) Neither Purchaser nor Seller shall have any right to set off any
indemnification claim pursuant to this Article XII against any payment due
pursuant to Article II or any Ancillary Agreement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, no Purchaser Indemnified Party (including the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries) shall have the right to set off an
indemnification claim pursuant to this Article XII against any amount due
pursuant to the Full Seller Advance Facility or Partial Seller Advance
Facility.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

71  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) Except as expressly provided in this Section 12.10, in the event the
Closing occurs and Seller (either before or after Closing) has made (or is
required to make) any payment to any Purchaser Indemnified Party in
satisfaction of all or some of its indemnification claims hereunder, in no
event shall Seller or any Seller Indemnified Party be entitled to seek
indemnification or contribution (or any similar theory) from the Company or
its Subsidiaries (including any shareholders and Affiliates of the Company or
its Subsidiaries and, except with respect to claims against them that are not
subject to indemnification under the organizational documents of the Company
or its Subsidiaries or otherwise under any Contract in effect as of the date
hereof, officers, directors, employees and agents of the Company or its
Subsidiaries) in respect of any such payments made (or required to be made) by
Seller pursuant to this Agreement.

  

  

(e) No indemnified party shall be entitled to payments under this Article XII
except with respect to Covered Losses that are due and payable by, or have
been paid by, such indemnified party; provided, that, with respect to Covered
Losses for loss in value pursuant to Section 12.02(a), the indemnified party
shall be entitled to payment under this Article XII when such Covered Losses
have been incurred.

other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege.

upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns; provided, however, neither this Agreement, nor any
right hereunder, may be assigned (in whole or in part) by either Party without

13.05 Governing Law. This Agreement, all transactions contemplated by this

directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party
expressly waives and foregoes any right to recover punitive, exemplary,
consequential or similar damages and any diminution in value or lost profits
in any Action directly or indirectly arising out or related to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby against the Financing Sources,
regardless of whether such remedy sought is at law, in equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise.

  

  

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE

MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

Indemnified Parties and Purchaser Indemnified Parties under Article XII (and,
with respect to the Financing Sources, Section 13.07 and 13.08, which shall be
for the benefit of, among others, the Financing Sources, and the Financing

Liabilities hereunder upon any Person (including any current or former
employee of Seller, either Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, Purchaser, any Affiliate thereof or any other Person) other than
the Parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and permitted
assigns. No provision of this Agreement is intended to constitute or create an

13.10 Entire Agreement. The Transaction Agreements, together with the Seller

75  

  

 

 

 

  

  

13.11 Disclosure Schedules. The inclusion of any item in a section of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule or Purchaser Disclosure Schedule (collectively, the
"Disclosure Schedules") (i) does not represent a determination by the
disclosing Party that such item is "material" or could have a Material Adverse
Effect and (ii) shall not constitute an admission by the disclosing Party that
such disclosure is required to be made pursuant to any of the representations
and warranties contained in this Agreement. When any matter is disclosed in
any place in the Disclosure Schedules, such matter shall be deemed to have
been disclosed with respect to any other sections of such Disclosure Schedule
so long as its relevance to such other sections is reasonably apparent from
the face of such disclosure. The Disclosure Schedules are qualified in their
entirety by reference to the provisions of this Agreement. Matters reflected
in the Disclosure Schedules are not necessarily limited to matters required by
this Agreement to be reflected in such Disclosure Schedule. To the extent any
such additional matters are included, they are included for informational
purposes and do not necessarily include other matters of a similar nature. The
Disclosure Schedules shall not be construed as, are not intended to
constitute, and shall not be construed as constituting, representations or
warranties of the disclosing Party except to the extent provided in this
Agreement, nor shall the Disclosure Schedules be construed as expanding the
scope of any of the representations or warranties of any Party except as
expressly contemplated therein. The information contained the Disclosure
Schedules was not prepared or disclosed with a view that it would be disclosed
to any Person that is not a Party and the disclosing Party does not assume any
responsibility to any such Person that is not a Party for any inaccuracies
contained in the Disclosure Schedules or otherwise. The information contained
in the Disclosure Schedules is disclosed in confidence solely for the purposes
contemplated in this Agreement and is subject to the Confidentiality
Agreement.

  

  

13.12 Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement will
be interpreted so as to be effective and valid under applicable Law, but if
any provision or portion of any provision of this Agreement is held invalid,
illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable Law, then such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect the validity,
legality or enforceability of any other provision or portion of any provision
of this Agreement, and this Agreement will be re-formed, construed and
enforced in such manner as will effect as nearly as lawfully possible the
purposes and intent of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or
portion of any provision of this Agreement.
