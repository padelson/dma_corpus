Section 2.05 Adjustment to the Purchase Price.

(a)The purpose of the Purchase Price adjustment set forth in this Section 2.05

Closing Date Sellers Expenses and Indebtedness of the Company from the target
or estimated amounts used to determine the Purchase Price at the Closing to
the actual amounts of Cash Equivalents, Net Working Capital, Closing Date
Sellers Expenses and Indebtedness of the Company as of the Closing on the same
accounting basis consistently applied to reflect the transactions or events up
to, and conditions existing as of, the Closing. At least five (5) Business

Company as of the Closing (the "Estimated Closing Balance Sheet"), which shall
include estimates of: (i) Cash Equivalents ("Estimated Cash Equivalents"),
(ii) Net Working Capital ("Estimated Net Working Capital"), (iii) Closing Date
Sellers Expenses ("Estimated Closing Date Sellers Expenses") and (iv)

as are reasonably requested by Buyer, it being understood that all such
estimates and any requests for revisions thereto will be made in accordance
with the Closing Balance Sheet Policies and consistent with the accounting
methods, policies, practices, procedures, conventions, classifications,
definitions, principles, judgments, assumptions, techniques, and estimation
methodologies used by the Company in the preparation of the Financial
Statements. At such time, Sellers shall also deliver Exhibit B to Buyer, which shall set
forth the Estimated Closing Date Sellers Expenses and Estimated Indebtedness
and wire instructions for paying such amounts. The Estimated Cash Equivalents,
Estimated Net Working Capital, Estimated Indebtedness, and the Estimated
Closing Date Sellers Expenses set forth on Exhibit B shall be used to
determine the Purchase Price, for purposes of Section 2.02. Both prior to and
after the Closing, Sellers will make available to Buyer and its auditors (if
any) all records and work papers relating to the Company and their calculation
of Estimated Cash Equivalents, Estimated Net Working Capital, Estimated
Closing Date Sellers Expenses, and Estimated Indebtedness that Buyer and its
auditors (if any) request, and Sellers will make available to Buyer and its
auditors (if any) all of Sellers' Representatives responsible for or otherwise
involved in the preparation of the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, Estimated
Cash Equivalents, Estimated Net Working Capital, Estimated Closing Date
Sellers Expenses, and Estimated Indebtedness (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, any Persons involved in providing any information used or considered in
the preparation of the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, Estimated Cash
Equivalents, Estimated Net Working Capital, Estimated Closing Date Sellers
Expenses, and Estimated Indebtedness) in order to fully respond to any
questions Buyer and its auditors (if any) may have. Sellers shall, upon
request by Buyer, promptly provide a list of all such Persons, specifying the
information provided by and all other work performed by such Persons in
preparation of the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, and the Estimated Cash
Equivalents, Estimated Net Working Capital, Estimated Closing Date Sellers
Expenses, and Estimated Indebtedness.

(b)Delivery of Closing Balance Sheet. Within ninety (90) days following the
Closing, Buyer will, in good faith and in accordance with the terms of this
Section 2.05, prepare and deliver to Sellers Buyer's good faith calculation of
the Purchase Price based on Buyer's determination of the actual amounts of
Final Cash Equivalents, Final Net Working Capital, Closing Date Sellers
Expenses, and actual Final Indebtedness, in each case, of the Company (the
"Final Closing Statement"), and a balance sheet of the Company as of the
Closing (the "Final Closing Balance Sheet").

(i)Calculation of the Final Closing Statement and the Final Closing Balance
Sheet shall be calculated in a manner consistent with GAAP, and, to the extent
consistent with GAAP, on a basis consistent with the accounting methods,
policies, practices, procedures, conventions, classifications, definitions,
principles, judgments, assumptions, techniques, and estimation methodologies,
including with respect to the nature of accounts, level of reserves, and level
of accruals, used to calculate the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, Estimated
Cash Equivalents, Estimated Net Working Capital, Estimated Closing Date
Sellers Expenses, Estimated Indebtedness, and Target Net Working Capital and
such calculations shall be consistent with the methods used in preparing the
Financial Statements, except that such statements, estimates, calculations and
determinations: (i) shall not include any purchase accounting or other
adjustment arising out of the consummation of the transaction, (ii) shall
follow the defined terms contained in this Agreement whether or not such terms
are consistent with GAAP, (iii) shall calculate any reserves, accruals or
other non-cash expense items on a pro rata (as opposed to monthly accrual)
basis to account for a Closing that occurs on any date other than the last day
of a calendar month, and (iv) shall be consistent with Exhibit C (the "Closing
Balance Sheet Policies"). Sellers represent and warrant that the Closing
Balance Sheet Policies are consistent, in all material respects, with the
accounting methods, policies, practices, procedures, conventions,
classifications, definitions, principles, judgments, assumptions, techniques,
and estimation methodologies, including with respect to the nature of accounts, level of reserves, and level of
accruals, which have been employed in preparation of the Financial Statements.

(ii)The calculation of the Purchase Price Adjustment as set forth in this
Section 2.05 does not, except as required by GAAP and the Closing Balance
Sheet Policies: (A) permit the introduction of different accounting methods,
policies, practices, procedures, conventions, classifications, definitions,
principles, judgments, assumptions, techniques, or estimation methodologies,
including with respect to the nature of accounts, level of reserves, or level
of accruals; or (B) permit the introduction of new or removal of existing
balance sheet accounts or line items, in each case of (A) and (B), from those
set forth in the Closing Balance Sheet Policies or used in determining the
amount of the Estimated Net Working Capital and the Target Net Working
Capital, it being the agreement of the parties that the Final Net Working
Capital shall be calculated consistent with the Estimated Net Working Capital
and the Target Net Working Capital in order to allow a meaningful comparison
of the Final Net Working Capital to the Estimated Net Working Capital and the
Target Net Working Capital.

(iii)The Final Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared, and the Final Net
Working Capital shall be determined, in accordance with: (A) the accounting
methods, policies, practices, procedures, conventions, categorizations,
definitions, principles, judgments, assumptions, techniques, and estimation
methods with respect to financial statements, their classification or
presentation, or otherwise (including with respect to the nature of accounts,
level of reserves, and level of accruals) that are consistent with the
calculation of the Target Net Working Capital, (B) to the extent not
inconsistent with the foregoing clause (A), accounting methods, policies,
practices, procedures, conventions, categorizations, definitions, principles,
judgments, assumptions, techniques, and estimation methods with respect to
financial statements, their classification or presentation, or otherwise
(including with respect to the nature of accounts, level of reserves, or level
of accruals) adopted in connection with the balance sheets included in the
Financial Statements, and (C) to the extent not inconsistent with the
foregoing clauses (A) or (B), GAAP.

(iv)The Final Closing Statement, the Final Closing Balance Sheet, and the Net
Working Capital, Cash Equivalents, and Indebtedness reflected therein shall:
(A) exclude the impact of any decisions made or actions taken or omitted by
Buyer or the Company after Closing, (B) not reflect changes in assets or
Liabilities as a result of purchase accounting adjustments or reflect any
events, conditions, or circumstances which arise as a result of the change of
control or ownership of the Company contemplated by this Agreement, and (C)
ignore events taking place at or after the Closing. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, (y) to the extent that the Final Closing
Balance Sheet corrects an error or an inconsistency in, or noncompliance with,
an accounting method, policy, practice, procedure, convention, categorization,
definition, principle, judgment, assumption, asset recognition base,
technique, or estimation method (including in respect of management's exercise
of judgment) that was used in the calculation of the Target Net Working
Capital, then either the Final Net Working Capital or the Target Net Working
Capital shall be reduced or increased as a result of such error,
inconsistency, or noncompliance, as appropriate, to reflect such error,
inconsistency, or noncompliance; and (z) if the same item would be reflected
differently on the Final Closing Balance Sheet than in the calculation of the
Target Net Working Capital in accordance with the Closing Balance Sheet
Policies, the parties will equitably adjust the calculation of either the Final Net Working Capital or Target Net Working
Capital so as to result in consistent treatment.

(c)Review of Final Closing Balance Sheet; Objection. Sellers shall have thirty
(30) days from the date of receipt of the Final Closing Balance Sheet to
review the computations of Final Cash Equivalents, Final Net Working Capital,
Closing Date Sellers Expenses, and Final Indebtedness reflected on the Final
Closing Balance Sheet and the Final Closing Statement.

(i)In connection with such review, Buyer will make available to Sellers and
their auditors (if any) all records and work papers relating to the Company
and their calculation of Final Cash Equivalents, Final Net Working Capital,
Closing Date Sellers Expenses, and Final Indebtedness that Sellers and their
auditors (if any) request in reviewing the Final Closing Balance Sheet, and
Buyer will make available to Sellers and their auditors (if any) all of
Buyer's Representatives responsible for or otherwise involved in the
preparation of the Final Closing Balance Sheet and the Final Closing Statement
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Persons involved in providing any
information used or considered in the preparation of the Final Closing Balance
Sheet and the Final Closing Statement) in order to fully respond to any
questions Sellers and its auditors (if any) may have. Buyer shall, upon
request by Sellers, promptly provide a list of all such Persons, specifying
the information provided by and all other work performed by such Persons in
preparation of the Final Closing Balance Sheet and the Final Closing
Statement.

(ii)If Sellers disagree with Buyer's calculation of the Purchase Price,
Sellers shall deliver written notice (an "Objection Notice") of such
disagreement, in reasonable detail, to Buyer on or before the thirty (30) days
after Sellers' receipt of the Final Closing Balance Sheet. If Sellers fails to
provide an Objection Notice within the period specified in this paragraph,
Buyer's calculation of the Purchase Price as set forth in the Final Closing
Statement delivered pursuant to Section 2.05(b) will be final, conclusive, and
non-appealable.

(iii)If Sellers timely deliver an Objection Notice to Buyer, Buyer and Sellers
will endeavor to resolve any disagreements noted in the Objection Notice in
good faith as soon as practicable after the delivery of the Objection Notice,
but if they do not reach a final resolution within thirty (30) days after
Buyer has received the Objection Notice, then they shall, within five (5) days
thereafter, commence the process to jointly retain the Independent Accountant
(or, if the Independent Accountant is unable to serve as the Independent
Accountant for any reason whatsoever, including for reasons of conflict of
interest, Buyer and Sellers shall, within five (5) days thereafter, jointly
retain another nationally recognized public accounting firm mutually
acceptable to them to act as the Independent Accountant for purposes of this
Agreement solely in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, to resolve
any remaining disagreements; provided, that if Buyer and Sellers cannot agree
on a mutually acceptable replacement accounting firm (if the Independent
Accountant is not able to serve), a replacement shall be selected in
accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
Association). In connection with engaging the Independent Accountant, Buyer
and Sellers agree, if requested by the Independent Accountant, to work with
the Independent Accountant to negotiate and execute an engagement letter on
terms reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and Sellers. Buyer, Sellers, and their
respective Representatives will cooperate with the Independent Accountant
during its resolution of any disagreements included in the Objection Notice. (iv)Unless otherwise agreed by Buyer and Sellers in writing, the Independent
Accountant shall make its determination in accordance with the guidelines and
procedures set forth in this Agreement and on Exhibit C; provided, that any
delay in delivering such determination shall not invalidate the award or
otherwise deprive the Independent Accountant of jurisdiction. The Independent
Accountant will consider only those items and amounts set forth in the
Objection Notice that Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand,
are unable to resolve. In resolving any disputed item, the Independent
Accountant may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value
for such item claimed by Buyer or Sellers or less than the smallest value for
such item claimed by Buyer or Sellers. Except as otherwise specified herein,
the scope of the disputes to be determined by the Independent Accountant is
limited to whether the preparation of the Final Closing Balance Sheet and the
calculation of the Purchase Price were done in a manner consistent with
Section 2.05(b) and whether there were mathematical errors in the preparation
of the Final Closing Balance Sheet or the calculation of the Purchase Price,
and the Independent Accountant shall not make any other determination unless
jointly requested in writing by Buyer and Sellers. The Independent
Accountant's determination of the Purchase Price, including each of the
components thereof, shall be based solely on written materials submitted by
Buyer and Sellers (i.e., not on independent review) and on the definitions
included herein.

(v)The fees and disbursements of the Independent Accountant and the reasonable
attorneys' fees and expenses of the parties (collectively, the "Purchase Price
Adjustment Dispute Expenses") shall be borne: (A) by Buyer, on the one hand,
in the proportion that the aggregate dollar amount of the disputed items that
are successfully disputed by Sellers (as finally determined by the Independent
Accountant) bears to the aggregate dollar amount of all disputed items, and
(B) by the Sellers, severally in accordance with their respective Allocation
Percentages (and not jointly and severally), on the other hand, in the
proportion that the aggregate dollar amount of the disputed items that are
unsuccessfully disputed by Sellers (as finally determined by the Independent
Accountant) bears to the aggregate dollar amount of all disputed items. For
example, if Buyer and Sellers dispute $1,000,000 of a proposed Purchase Price
Adjustment to be paid to Sellers, the Independent Accountant determines that
such payment should be $400,000, and the Purchase Price Adjustment Dispute
Expenses are $100,000, then: (y) Buyer shall pay $40,000 (40%) of the Purchase
Price Adjustment Dispute Expenses, and (z) Sellers severally in accordance
with their respective Allocation Percentages (and not jointly and severally)
shall pay $60,000 (60%) of the Purchase Price Adjustment Dispute Expenses.

(vi)The determination of the Independent Accountant as to any disputed matters
shall be set forth in a written report of award delivered to Buyer and Sellers
and shall be deemed final, conclusive, and binding on the parties and shall
not be subject to collateral attack for any reason. The parties agree that
judgment may be entered upon the written report of award of the Independent
Accountant in any court having jurisdiction pursuant to Section 11.10. Prior
to the Independent Accountant's determination as provided for herein, (y)
Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand (in accordance with
their Allocation Percentages), will each pay fifty percent (50%) of any
retainer paid to the Independent Accountant; and (z) during the engagement of
the Independent Accountant, the Independent Accountant will bill fifty percent
(50%) of the total charges to each of Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers, on
the other hand (in accordance with their Allocation Percentages). In
connection with the Independent Accountant's determination as provided for
herein, the Independent Accountant shall also determine, in accordance with principle set forth in Section 2.05(c)(v), and taking into account all fees
and expenses already paid by each of Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers, on
the other hand, as of the date of such determination, the allocation of the
Purchase Price Adjustment Dispute Expenses between Buyer and Sellers, which
such determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties.

(d)Final and Binding Determination.

(i)The Final Closing Balance Sheet and Purchase Price, including the
calculations of Final Cash Equivalents, Final Net Working Capital, Closing
Date Sellers Expenses and Final Indebtedness of the Company, as agreed to by
Buyer and Sellers or as determined by the Independent Accountant, as
applicable, shall be conclusive and binding on all of the parties and shall be
deemed the "Actual Closing Balance Sheet" for all purposes under this
Agreement.

(ii)Upon completion of the calculation of the Actual Closing Balance Sheet,
Final Cash Equivalents, Final Net Working Capital, Closing Date Sellers
Expenses, and Final Indebtedness in accordance with this Section 2.05, the
Purchase Price shall be recalculated using the Final Cash Equivalents (rather
than the Estimated Cash Equivalents), Actual Net Working Capital Surplus
(rather than the Estimated Net Working Capital Surplus), Actual Net Working
Capital Deficit (rather than the Estimated Net Working Capital Deficit),
Closing Date Sellers Expenses (rather than Estimated Closing Date Sellers
Expenses), and Final Indebtedness (rather than the Estimated Indebtedness)
(collectively, the "Purchase Price Adjustment"), and the following payments
shall be made:

(A)If the Purchase Price Adjustment is greater than the Purchase Price
calculated using the Estimated Cash Equivalents, Estimated Net Working Capital
Surplus, Estimated Net Working Capital Deficit, Estimated Closing Date Sellers
Expenses and Estimated Indebtedness shown on the Estimated Closing Balance
Sheet, then Buyer shall pay such difference to Sellers for the benefit of the
Sellers (in accordance with the Allocation Percentages) on or before three (3)
Business Days following the determination of the Purchase Price Adjustment by
wire transfer in immediately available funds to the account(s) and in the
relative amounts designated by Sellers.

(B)If the Purchase Price Adjustment shown on the Actual Closing Balance Sheet
is less than the Purchase Price calculated using the Estimated Cash
Equivalents, Estimated Net Working Capital Surplus, Estimated Net Working
Capital Deficit, Estimated Closing Date Sellers Expenses and Estimated
Indebtedness shown on the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, Sellers shall pay
the amount of such difference to Buyer (severally, not jointly, in accordance
with their Allocation Percentages) on or before three (3) Business Days
following the determination of the Purchase Price Adjustment by wire transfer
in immediately available funds to the account(s) and in the relative amount
designated by Buyer.

(iii)Any payments made pursuant to this Section 2.05 shall constitute an
adjustment of the Purchase Price for Tax purposes and shall be treated as such
by the parties on their Tax Returns.

Section 2.06 Withholding. Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold (or
cause to be deducted and withheld) from any amount payable pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld under applicable Tax law. Amounts
withheld pursuant to this Section 2.06 and paid over to the appropriate taxing
authority shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made. Promptly upon becoming aware of any potential withholding required to be
made by Buyer (but in any case, at least three (3) days before withholding
with respect to any payment under this Agreement), Buyer shall notify Sellers
of such withholding in writing in reasonable detail and shall reasonably
cooperate with Sellers so that Sellers can establish any entitlement to a
reduction in or elimination of any such withholding that otherwise would be
required.

Section 2.07 Holdback. Buyer shall, within five (5) Business Days following
the expiration of the Holdback Period, deliver the Holdback Consideration to
BR Holdco for further distribution to the Filev Trust (or directly to the
Filev Trust if BR Holdco's rights, title, and interest in and to the Holdback
Consideration have been assigned or distributed to the Filev Trust).

restrict the ability of Buyer or its Affiliates to merge, amend, or terminate
any Benefit Plan, in each case, as a result of the execution of this

the operation of the businesses in which Buyer is engaged or proposed to be
engaged; and (c) Buyer is and will be able to pay its Liabilities, including
contingent and other Liabilities, as they mature. Assuming (i) the accuracy of
the representations and warranties set forth in Article III and Article IV of
this Agreement, (ii) the most recent financial forecasts relating to the
Company made available to Buyer have been prepared in good faith and on
assumptions that were reasonable at the time such forecasts were made and
continue to be reasonable as of the date hereof, and (iii) immediately prior
to the Closing the Company is solvent, taken as a whole, then immediately
after giving effect to all of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the payment of the Purchase Price, and all of the related fees and
expenses of Buyer and its Affiliates in connection therewith, (a) the value of
the assets of Buyer and the Company will exceed (i) the value of all
Liabilities of Buyer and the Company, including contingent and other
Liabilities, and (ii) the amount that will be required to pay the probable
Liabilities of Buyer and the Company on their existing debts (including
contingent Liabilities) as such debts become absolute and matured; (b) Buyer
and the Company will not have an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which they are
engaged or proposed to be engaged; and (c) Buyer and the Company will be able
to pay their Liabilities, including contingent and other Liabilities, as they
mature. For purposes of the foregoing, the phrases "not have an unreasonably
small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which they are
engaged or proposed to be engaged" and "able to pay their Liabilities,
including contingent and other Liabilities, as they mature" (or similar
phrases used above) mean that Buyer (and, if applicable, the Company) will be
able to generate enough cash from operations, asset dispositions, or
refinancing, or a combination thereof, to meet its or their obligations as
they become due. No transfer of property is being made, and no obligation is
being incurred, by Buyer in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement with the intent to hinder, delay, or defraud either present or
future creditors of any of Buyer or the Company. In connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, Buyer has not incurred debts beyond its
ability to pay as they become absolute and matured.

Section 5.06 Legal Proceedings. There are no Legal Proceedings pending or, to
Buyer's Knowledge, threatened against or by Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer
that challenge or seek to prevent, enjoin, or otherwise delay the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 5.07 Access; Independent Investigation. Buyer and its Representatives
have (a) been given access to the assets, books, records, Contracts, and
employees of the Company and have been given the opportunity to meet with
officers and other Representatives of the Company for the purpose of
investigating and obtaining information regarding the Company's business,
operations, and legal affairs, and (b) made their own inquiry and
investigation into, and based thereon Buyer has formed an independent judgment
concerning the Company. Buyer has conducted its own independent investigation
and review of the business, results of operations, prospects, condition
(financial or otherwise), and assets of the Company, and acknowledges that it
has been provided adequate access to the personnel, properties, assets,
premises, books and records, and other documents and data of Sellers and the
Company for such purpose. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall be
entitled to rely on the representations and warranties of Company and Sellers
set forth in Article III and Article IV of this Agreement.

ARTICLE VI

COVENANTS

Section 6.01 Conduct of Business Prior to the Closing. From the date hereof
until the Closing, Sellers shall, and shall cause the Company to: (a) conduct
the business of the Company in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice except: (i) as set forth on Section 6.01 of the Disclosure
Schedules, (ii) as otherwise specifically contemplated by this Agreement,
(iii) as required by applicable Law, or (iv) as otherwise consented to in
writing by Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed); and (b) use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain and preserve
substantially intact the current organization, business, and franchise of the
Company and to substantially preserve the rights, franchises, goodwill, and
relationships of its employees, customers, lenders, suppliers, regulators, and
others having business relationships with the Company. From the date hereof
until the Closing, Sellers shall not cause or permit the Company to take any
action that would cause any of the changes, events, or conditions described in
Section 3.06 to occur except (i) as set forth on Section 6.01 of the
Disclosure Schedules, (ii) as otherwise specifically contemplated by this
Agreement, (iii) as required by applicable Law, or (iv) as otherwise consented to in writing by Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed). Buyer acknowledges and agrees that nothing contained
herein shall give Buyer or any of its Affiliates, directly or indirectly, the
right to control or direct the operations of the Company prior to the Closing,
and prior to the Closing, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over
its operations. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Company is allowed to dividend or make a distribution of any or
all Cash Equivalents of the Company to its members at any time prior to
Closing, provided that all such dividends or distributions are fully reflected
in the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, Estimated Net Working Capital and
Estimated Cash Equivalents (whether such dividends and distributions occur
before or after the date of delivery of such estimates).

Section 6.02 Access to Information. From the date hereof until the Closing,
Sellers shall, and shall cause the Company to: (a) afford Buyer and its
Representatives reasonable access to and the right to inspect all of the Real
Property, properties, assets, premises, books, and records, Contracts, and
other documents and data related to the Company; (b) furnish Buyer and its
Representatives with such financial, operating, and other data and information
related to the Company as Buyer or any of its Representatives may reasonably
request; and (c) instruct the Representatives of Sellers and the Company to
cooperate with Buyer in its investigation of the Company; provided, however,
that any such investigation shall be conducted during normal business hours
upon reasonable advance notice to Sellers or the Company, under the
supervision of Sellers' or the Company's personnel, in such a manner as not to
interfere with the normal operations of the Company, at Buyer's expense, and
in a manner that maintains the confidentiality of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. All requests by Buyer for access
pursuant to this Section 6.02 shall be submitted or directed exclusively to
Momchil Filev, Rob Angel, Matt Harty, Denis Grosz, or such other individuals
as Momchil Filev, Rob Angel, Matt Harty, or Denis Grosz may designate in
writing from time to time. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, neither Seller nor the Company shall be required to disclose any
information to Buyer if such disclosure would, in either Seller's or the
Company's sole, reasonable discretion: (x) cause significant competitive harm
to Sellers, the Company, and their respective businesses if the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated; (y) jeopardize any
attorney-client or other privilege; or (z) contravene any applicable Law,
fiduciary duty, or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this
Agreement. Prior to the Closing, without first obtaining the written consent
of Sellers, which may be withheld by either Seller for any reason, Buyer shall
not contact any officer, director, manager, employee, customer, supplier,
distributor, vendor, or other business relation of the Company with respect to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby; provided, however,
that Buyer shall be permitted to continue contacts with Momchil Filev, Rob
Angel, Matt Harty, and Denis Grosz in order to exercise its rights under this
Agreement. Buyer shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, abide by the
terms of the NDA with respect to any access or information provided pursuant
to this Section 6.02. Buyer agrees that it will not, and it will cause its
Representatives not to, use any information obtained pursuant to this Section
6.02 for any purpose unrelated to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 6.03 Resignations. Sellers shall deliver to Buyer written
resignations, effective as of the Closing Date, of the officers and managers
of the Company requested by Buyer and set forth on Section 6.03 of the
Disclosure Schedules at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing. Section 6.04 Employees; Benefit Plans.

(a)During the period commencing at the Closing and ending on December 31, 2021
(or, if earlier, the date of the Employee's termination of employment with the
Company), Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company to, provide each Employee
who remains employed immediately after the Closing (each, a "Company
Continuing Employee") with: (i) a base salary or hourly wages which are no
less than the base salary or hourly wages provided by the Company to the
Company Continuing Employee immediately prior to the date hereof; (ii) target
bonus opportunities (excluding equity-based compensation), if any, which are
comparable in the aggregate (excluding equity-based compensation), as
determined in Buyer's sole discretion, to those provided by Buyer to its
similarly situated employees; (iii) retirement and welfare benefits (excluding
any defined benefit pension, equity or equity-based, nonqualified retirement
or deferred compensation, and post-termination or retiree health or welfare
benefits) that are comparable in the aggregate, as determined in Buyer's sole
discretion, to those provided by Buyer to its similarly situated employees;
and (iv) severance benefits that are no less favorable than the practice,
plan, or policy in effect for such Company Continuing Employee immediately
prior to the Closing, as set forth on Section 6.04 of the Disclosure
Schedules.

(b)With respect to any employee benefit plan (excluding any plan providing for
defined benefit pension, equity or equity-based, nonqualified retirement or
deferred compensation, and post-termination or retiree health or welfare
benefits) maintained by Buyer or its Affiliates (including, following the
Closing, the Company) and in which the Company Continuing Employees are
eligible to participate during the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs
(including any vacation, sick leave, and severance policies) (collectively,
"Buyer Benefit Plans"), Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company to, recognize
all service of the Company Continuing Employees with the Company (and its
Affiliates, if applicable), as if such service were with Buyer, for vesting,
entitlement (for vacation and severance benefits only), and eligibility
purposes in any Buyer Benefit Plan to the same extent and for the same purpose
as such service was recognized under the analogous Benefit Plan; provided,
however, such service shall not be recognized to the extent that: (i) such
recognition would result in a duplication of benefits or compensation, or (ii)
such service was not recognized under the corresponding Benefit Plan of the
Company. During the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs, Buyer shall,
or shall cause the Company to, use commercially reasonable efforts to allow
such Company Continuing Employees to participate in each Buyer Benefit Plan
providing group health benefits without regard to preexisting condition
limitations, waiting periods, evidence of insurability, or other exclusions or
limitations not imposed on the Company Continuing Employee by the
corresponding Benefit Plans of the Company immediately prior to the Closing
Date. Buyer shall cause the Company to continue to credit to each Company
Continuing Employee for all vacation and personal holiday pay that the Company
Continuing Employee is entitled to use, but has not used, as of the Closing
Date (including any earned vacation or personal holiday pay to be used in
future years), and shall assume all Liability for the payment of such amounts,
as set forth on Section 6.04 of the Disclosure Schedules, to the extent
reflected in Final Net Working Capital.

(c)This Section 6.04 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of
each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section 6.04,
express or implied, shall confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies
of any nature whatsoever (including any third-party beneficiary rights) under or by reason of this Section 6.04. Nothing in this
Section 6.04, express or implied, shall be construed to establish, amend, or
modify any Benefit Plan, Buyer Benefit Plan, or any other "employee benefit
plan," as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or any other benefit or
compensation plan, program, agreement, or arrangement, nor shall any provision
of this Agreement except Section 6.04(a) be construed to prohibit or otherwise
limit the ability of Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including, following the
Closing, the Company) to modify, amend or terminate any Benefit Plan, Buyer
Benefit Plan or other benefit or compensation plan, program, policy, agreement
or arrangement. The parties acknowledge and agree that the terms set forth in
this Section 6.04 shall not create any right in any Employee or any other
Person to any continued employment (or any particular term or condition of
employment) with the Company, Buyer, or any of their respective Affiliates or
compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever, and nothing in this
Agreement shall be construed to limit the ability of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (including, following the Closing, the Company) to modify or
terminate the employment or engagement of any Person at any time for any or no
reason; provided, however, that the foregoing sentence shall not be deemed to
reduce or diminish Buyer's and the Company's respective obligations in Section
6.04(a). Notwithstanding any other provision in this Section 6.04, Buyer's
obligations under this Section 6.04 shall not apply (i) to any individual who
is furloughed, temporarily laid off, or suffers a termination of employment or
reduction in hours or benefits at any time because of, in whole or in part,
COVID-19 related circumstances, or (ii) to limit Buyer's right, in its sole
discretion, to furlough, temporarily layoff, terminate the employment of, or
reduce the hours or benefits of, any employee because of, in whole or in part,
COVID-19 related circumstances.

Section 6.05 Director and Officer Indemnification and Insurance.

(a)From and after the Closing Date and for a period of six (6) years from the
Closing Date, Buyer and the Company (each, a "DandO Indemnifying Person") shall
indemnify, defend, and hold harmless each Person who is now, or has been at
any time prior to the Closing Date, an officer, manager, or employee of the
Company (collectively, the "Company Indemnified Agents") against all losses,
claims, damages, costs, expenses, Liabilities, or judgments, or amounts that
are paid in settlement with the approval of the DandO Indemnifying Person (which
approval shall not be unreasonably delayed, conditioned, or withheld) of or in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding, or investigation based in
whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such
Person is or was an officer, manager, or employee of the Company and arising
out of actions or omissions, occurring at or prior to the Closing Date, and
whether asserted or claimed prior to, or at or after, the Closing Date, but
only to the extent the Company would be required to do so as of the date of
this Agreement; provided, that the DandO Indemnifying Person shall only be
required to indemnify a Company Indemnified Agent pursuant to this this
Section 6.05 to the extent permitted under the Law of the state of its
formation to indemnify directors, officers, managers and employees, as the
case may be, or those of a direct or indirect subsidiary (and Buyer and the
Company, as the case may be, will pay expenses in advance of the final
disposition of any such action or proceeding to each Company Indemnified Agent
to the fullest extent permitted by Law). In addition, after Closing, the
Organizational Documents of the Company and their successors and assigns shall
contain provisions with respect to indemnification no less favorable to the
former officers, managers, or employees than those in effect in the
Organizational Documents of the Company with respect to current officers,
managers, employees, or members as in effect on the date of this Agreement. (b)Each Company Indemnified Agent under this Section 6.05 will, promptly after
the receipt of notice of the commencement of any action or other proceeding
against such Company Indemnified Agent in respect of which indemnity may be
sought from a DandO Indemnifying Person under this Section 6.05, notify the DandO
Indemnifying Person in writing of the commencement thereof. The omission of
any Company Indemnified Agent to notify a DandO Indemnifying Person of any such
action shall not relieve such DandO Indemnifying Person from any Liability that
it may have to such Company Indemnified Agent, unless, and only to the extent
that, such omission actually and materially prejudices the DandO Indemnifying
Person. In case any such action or other proceeding shall be brought against
any Company Indemnified Agent and it shall notify the DandO Indemnifying Person
of the commencement thereof, the DandO Indemnifying Person shall be entitled to
participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, to assume the defense
thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Company Indemnified
Agent; provided, however, that any Company Indemnified Agent may, at its own
expense, retain separate counsel to participate in such defense.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in any action or proceeding in which both the
DandO Indemnifying Person and a Company Indemnified Agent are, or are reasonably
likely to become, a party, such Company Indemnified Agent shall have the right
to employ separate counsel at the DandO Indemnifying Person's expense and to
control its own defense of such action or proceeding if, in the reasonable
written opinion of counsel to such Company Indemnified Agent, (i) there are or
may be legal defenses available to such Company Indemnified Agent or to other
Company Indemnified Agents that are different from or additional to those
available to the DandO Indemnifying Person, or (ii) any conflict or potential
conflict exists between the DandO Indemnifying Person and such Company
Indemnified Agent that would make such separate representation advisable. The
DandO Indemnifying Person shall not, without the consent of the Company
Indemnified Agent, consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving
by the claimant or plaintiff to such Company Indemnified Agent of a release
from all Liability in respect to such claim or litigation or which requires
action by the Company Indemnified Agent. The rights accorded to Company
Indemnified Agents hereunder shall be in addition to any rights that any
Company Indemnified Agent may have at common law, by separate agreement or
otherwise.

(c)The Company shall, and Buyer shall cause the Company to: (i) maintain in
effect for a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date, if available on a
commercially reasonable basis, the current policies of directors' and
officers' liability insurance maintained by the Company immediately prior to
the Closing Date (provided that the Company may substitute therefor policies
of at least the same coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions
that are not materially less advantageous to the managers and officers of the
Company when compared to the insurance maintained by the Company as of the
date hereof), or (ii) obtain as of the Closing Date "tail" insurance policies
with a claims period of six (6) years from the Closing Date with at least the
same coverage and amounts, and containing terms and conditions that are not
materially less advantageous to the managers and officers of the Company, in
each case with respect to claims arising out of or relating to events which
occurred on or prior to the Closing Date (including in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement). Buyer shall cause the Company to
pay any applicable premiums for such insurance.

(d)The obligations of Buyer and the Company under this Section 6.05 shall not
be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any manager
or officer to whom this Section 6.05 applies without the consent of such affected manager or
officer (it being expressly agreed that the managers and officers to whom this
Section 6.05 applies shall be third-party beneficiaries of this Section 6.05,
each of whom may enforce the provisions of this Section 6.05). The provisions
of this Section 6.05 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each Company Indemnified Agent, his or her heirs, and his or
her Representatives.

(e)In the event Buyer, the Company, or any of their respective successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving Person in such consolidation or merger, or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, and in either such case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Buyer or the Company, as the case may be, shall
assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 6.05.

Section 6.06 Confidentiality. Buyer acknowledges and agrees to the terms and
conditions of the NDA and acknowledges and agrees that the NDA remains in full
force and effect notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the NDA and, in
addition, covenants and agrees to keep confidential, in accordance with the
provisions of the NDA, information provided to Buyer pursuant to or in
connection with this Agreement. If this Agreement is terminated prior to the
Closing for any reason, the NDA and the provisions of this Section 6.06 shall
nonetheless continue in full force and effect. Upon the Closing, the NDA shall
automatically terminate as to Buyer's confidentiality obligations thereunder,
and from and after the Closing, Sellers agree, and agree to cause their
Representatives to, keep confidential, in accordance with the provisions of
the NDA, all confidential or proprietary information of or relating to the
Company that remains in their possession after the Closing.

Section 6.07 Best Efforts; Governmental Approvals; Third-Party Consents.

(a)Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
except to the extent otherwise required by applicable Law and otherwise
provided in this Section 6.07, each of the Sellers, Company and Buyer agree to
use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other
parties in doing, all things necessary, proper, or advisable to consummate and
make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the purchase and
sale of the Membership Units, and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and to satisfy all of the conditions set forth in Article VII,
including (i) preparing and filing all forms, registrations, and notices
required to be filed, performing all necessary actions or nonactions, and
obtaining all necessary waivers, consents, and approvals from Governmental
Authorities and making all necessary registrations and filings (including
filings with Governmental Authorities) and taking all reasonable steps as may
be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or
proceeding by, any Governmental Authority; (ii) obtaining all necessary
consents, approvals, or waivers from third parties; and (iii) executing and
delivering any additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, nothing in this Agreement will be deemed to (A) require Buyer,
Company, Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates (i) to agree to any
material amendment to the terms of any Contract to obtain a third-party
consent; (ii) to propose, negotiate, effect or agree to, the sale,
divestiture, license, holding separate, or other disposition of any assets or
businesses of any party to this Agreement or their Affiliates or the imposition of any material limitation on the ability of such
party to freely conduct its business or own such assets; or (iii) to commence,
settle, or defend any Legal Proceedings or (B) impose any material limitation
on the ability of such party or its Affiliates to freely conduct its business
or own such assets.

(b)Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as soon as may be
reasonably practicable, and in no event later than five (5) Business Days
after the date hereof, Buyer and Sellers each shall file with the United
States Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the Antitrust Division of the
United States Department of Justice (the "DOJ") Notification and Report Forms
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as may be required
by the HSR Act. Subject to applicable Laws and the preservation of any
applicable attorney-client privilege, Buyer and Sellers each shall promptly:
(i) provide an appropriate response, as advisable, to any request for
information which may be made in order to effectuate such filings; (ii) supply
any additional information which reasonably may be required by the FTC or the
DOJ, and each of Buyer and Sellers will use reasonable efforts to obtain the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period; and (iii) make any
further filings pursuant thereto that may be necessary, proper, or advisable
in connection therewith. Buyer shall pay all filing fees for the filings under
the HSR Act.

(c)The parties commit to instruct their respective counsel to cooperate with
each other and use their best efforts to facilitate and expedite the
identification and resolution of any issues arising under the HSR Act and any
other Law at the earliest practicable dates. Such efforts and cooperation
include counsel's undertaking: (i) to keep each other appropriately informed
of communications from and to personnel of the reviewing Governmental
Authorities, and (ii) to confer with each other regarding appropriate contacts
with and response to personnel of such Governmental Authorities and the
content of any such contacts or presentations. Neither Sellers nor Buyer shall
participate in any meeting or discussion with any Governmental Authority in
respect of any such filings, applications, investigation, or other inquiry
without giving the other party prior notice of the meeting or discussion and,
to the extent permitted by the relevant Governmental Authority, the
opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting or discussion. Sellers
and Buyer shall each approve the content of any presentations, white papers,
or other written materials to be submitted to any Governmental Authority in
advance of any such submission. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Buyer shall, on behalf of the parties hereto, be entitled to
reasonably direct negotiations and strategy with respect to obtaining the
expiration or termination of all applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act.

(d)Sellers and Company shall give all notices to, and use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain all consents from, all third parties that are
described in Section 3.04 or Section 4.02 of the Disclosure Schedules;
provided, however, that Sellers, Buyer and Company shall not be obligated to
pay any consideration therefor to any third party from whom consent or
approval is requested. Without the prior written consent of Buyer, Company
shall not, and Sellers shall not permit Company to, agree to pay any
consideration or make any material amendment to the terms of any Contract to
obtain a third-party consent.

Section 6.08 Books and Records.

(a)In order to facilitate the resolution of any claims made against or
incurred by Sellers prior to the Closing, or for any other reasonable purpose,
for a period of seven (7) years after the Closing, Buyer shall: (i) retain the books and records (including
personnel files) of the Company relating to periods prior to the Closing in a
manner reasonably consistent with the prior practices of the Company; and (ii)
upon reasonable notice, afford the Representatives of Sellers reasonable
access (including the right to make, at Buyer's or the Company's expense,
photocopies), during normal business hours, to such books and records.

(b)Each Seller shall have the right to retain copies of all books and records
of the Company relating to periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date;
provided, that such books and records shall be treated as confidential
information of the Company in accordance with Section 6.06.

(c)Notwithstanding anything else contained herein, neither Buyer nor any
Seller shall be obligated to provide any other party with access to any books
or records (including personnel files) pursuant to this Section 6.08 where
such access would violate any Law or Contract.

Section 6.09 Closing Conditions. From the date hereof until the Closing, each
party hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take such actions as
are necessary to expeditiously satisfy the closing conditions set forth in
Article VII hereof.

Section 6.10 Public Announcements. Following the date hereof, the parties
shall cooperate to make a mutually agreeable announcement regarding the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, except to the extent
otherwise required by applicable Law, regulation (including the rules of any
stock exchange on which a party's common stock or other securities may be
listed) or legal process, none of Sellers, Buyer, or the Company may issue any
press release or make any public statement in deviation or contravention of
the contents of such mutually agreeable announcement without the approval of
Buyer, in the case of any disclosure by Sellers or their respective
Affiliates, or Sellers, in the case of a disclosure by Buyer or its Affiliates
(including the Company from and after the Closing). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no press release or public statement may be made until after the
Closing, except as agreed to by the parties hereto or to the extent otherwise
required by applicable Law, regulation (including the rules of any stock
exchange on which a party's common stock or other securities may be listed) or
legal process.

Section 6.11 Buyer's Due Diligence Investigation.

(a)Buyer acknowledges and agrees that none of Sellers or the Company nor any
of their respective Affiliates or Representatives has made any representations
or warranties regarding Sellers, the Company, the Company's business
operations or assets, the Membership Units, or otherwise in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other than the
representations and warranties set forth in Article III and Article IV.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer acknowledges and
agrees that no projections, forecasts, predictions, estimates, data, financial
information, documents, reports, statements (oral or written), summaries,
abstracts, descriptions, presentations (including any management presentation
or facility tour), memoranda, or offering material with respect to the
Company's business or the Membership Units is or shall be deemed to be a
representation or warranty by Sellers or the Company to Buyer under this
Agreement or otherwise and that Buyer has not relied thereon in determining to
execute this Agreement and proceed with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Buyer further acknowledges and agrees that: (i) materials it and
its Representatives have received from Sellers, the Company, and their
respective Affiliates or Representatives, including Piper Sandler, include projections, forecasts, and predictions relating to the Company's business;
(ii) there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such projections,
forecasts, and predictions; (iii) Buyer is familiar with such uncertainties
and is taking full responsibility for making its own evaluation of the
adequacy and accuracy of all projections, forecasts, predictions, and
information so furnished; (iv) Buyer shall not have any claims against
Sellers, the Company, or their respective Affiliates or Representatives,
including Piper Sandler, with respect thereto; and (v) Buyer has not relied
thereon. Buyer acknowledges that, except for the representations and
warranties set forth in Article III and Article IV, no Person has been
authorized by the Company or Sellers to make any representation or warranty
regarding Sellers, the Company, the Company's business, assets or operations,
the Membership Units, or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and,
if made, such representation or warranty may not be relied upon as having been
authorized by the Company or either Seller.

(b)Buyer acknowledges and agrees that it: (i) has made its own inquiry and
investigation into, and, based thereon and on the representations and
warranties set forth in Article III and Article IV, has formed an independent
judgment concerning, the Company, its business, and the Membership Units, and
(ii) has conducted such investigation of the Company, its business, and the
Membership Units as Buyer deems necessary to satisfy itself as to the
operations and conditions thereof, and will rely solely on such investigations
and inquiries, and the representations and warranties set forth in Article III
and Article IV. Buyer further acknowledges and agrees that it will not at any
time assert any claim against Sellers or the Company or any of their
respective present and former Affiliates or Representatives, including Piper
Sandler, or attempt to hold any of such Persons liable, for any inaccuracies,
misstatements, or omissions with respect to the information furnished by such
Persons concerning Sellers, the Company, the Company's business, or the
Membership Units, other than any inaccuracies or misstatements in the
representations and warranties set forth in Article III and Article IV.

(c)Buyer acknowledges that the Purchase Price has been negotiated based on
Buyer's express agreement that, if the Closing occurs, Buyer will acquire the
Company and its businesses, properties, assets, and Liabilities in an "as is"
condition and on a "where is" basis, without any representation or warranty of
any kind, express or implied, except such representations and warranties set
forth in Article III and Article IV. Further, without limiting any
representation or warranty set forth in Article III and Article IV, any
condition to closing set forth in Article VII, or its rights pursuant to
Section 6.02, Buyer acknowledges that it has waived and hereby waives as a
condition to Closing or otherwise any further due diligence reviews,
inspections, or examinations with respect to the Company and the Membership
Units, including with respect to financial, operational, regulatory, and legal
compliance matters.

Section 6.12 GDPR. Prior to the Closing, to become compliant with the European
Union's General Data Protection Regulation, the Company shall update its
privacy policy and add a cookie banner with opt-in consent to use of cookies
(without use of pre-checked options) to be displayed upon users located in the
European Union visiting http://www.bestreviews.com.

Section 6.13 Further Assurances. Following the Closing, each of the parties
hereto shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, execute and

(a)All representations and warranties and pre-Closing covenants of the Company
or either Seller and any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement,
including, but not limited to, those certificates of Sellers or the Company
required by Section 7.02 shall terminate upon, and shall not survive, the
Closing, and none of the Company, the Sellers, nor any of their respective
Affiliates, nor any of their respective directors, officers, employees,
equityholders, partners, members, managers, trustees, beneficiaries, or
Representatives shall have any Liability whatsoever with respect to any such
representations and warranties, pre-Closing covenants, or certificates and no
claim for breach of any such representation, warranty, pre-Closing covenant,
or certificate or any claim for detrimental reliance or other right or remedy
(whether in contract, in tort, or at law or in equity) may be brought after
the Closing with respect thereto against any Seller, any Affiliate of any
Seller, or any director, officer, employee, equityholder, partner, member,
manager, trustee, beneficiary, or Representative of any Seller or any
Affiliate of any Seller. Recovery by Buyer in respect of all losses arising or

party to this Agreement who committed such Fraud.

(b)Except in the case of Fraud (in which case Buyer shall have recourse only

RandW Insurance Policy is the sole and exclusive remedy of Buyer for any breach
of the representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement, pre-Closing
covenants set forth in this Agreement, and those certificates of Sellers or
the Company required by Section 7.02, including, but not limited to, those
caused by any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty or
breach, nonfulfillment, or default in the performance of any of the pre-
Closing covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement. The parties to

any further indemnification rights or other claims of any nature whatsoever in
respect thereof (whether by contract, common law, statute, law, regulation, or
otherwise, including, but not limited to, under the Racketeer Influence and
Corrupt Organizations Act of 1970), all of which the parties to this Agreement
hereby waive. In furtherance of the foregoing, Buyer hereby waives and
releases to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, the Sellers and
each of their respective Non‑Recourse Parties, whether in any individual,
corporate, or any other capacity, from and against any and all other rights,
claims, and causes of action Buyer may have against the Sellers or any of
their respective Non‑Recourse Parties relating (directly or indirectly) to the
subject matter of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any other Transaction Document (including relating to any
Exhibit, Schedule, or other document delivered pursuant to this Agreement),

ARTICLE IX

TERMINATION

Section 9.01 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Closing:

(a)by mutual written agreement of Sellers, the Company, and Buyer;

(b)by Buyer by written notice to Sellers if:

(i)Buyer is not then in material breach of any provision of this Agreement and
there has been a material breach, inaccuracy in, or failure to perform any
representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement made by a Seller or the
Company pursuant to this Agreement that would give rise to the failure of any
of the conditions specified in Article VII and such breach, inaccuracy, or
failure cannot be cured by Sellers or the Company by December 31, 2020 (the
"Drop Dead Date"); provided, however, that, if such material breach is curable
through the exercise of commercially reasonable efforts, then as long as
Sellers continue to exercise such commercially reasonable efforts (or cause
the Company to exercise such commercially reasonable efforts), Buyer may not
terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.01(b)(i); provided, further,
that the Drop Dead Date shall be automatically extended (for all purposes
under and provisions of this Agreement) on a day-for-day basis for each day of
any shutdown or closure or other delay to applicable waiting or review
periods, or any extension thereof, of any Governmental Authority arising or
resulting from COVID-19 or a lapse in government funding that would have the
effect of delaying or preventing the regulatory review of the transaction; or

(ii)any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.01 or Section 7.02 shall not
have been fulfilled by the Drop Dead Date, unless such failure shall be due to
the failure of Buyer to perform or comply with any of the covenants,
agreements, or conditions hereof to be performed or complied with by it prior
to the Closing;

(c)by Sellers (only if jointly delivered and not independently) by written
notice to Buyer if:

(i)Sellers and the Company are not then in material breach of any provision of
this Agreement and there has been a material breach, inaccuracy in, or failure
to perform any representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement made by Buyer
pursuant to this Agreement that would give rise to the failure of any of the
conditions specified in Article VII and such breach, inaccuracy, or failure
cannot be cured by Buyer by the Drop Dead Date; or

(ii)any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.01 or Section 7.03 shall not
have been fulfilled by the Drop Dead Date, unless such failure shall be due to
the failure of a Seller or the Company to perform or comply with any of the covenants, agreements, or
conditions hereof to be performed or complied with by them prior to the
Closing; or

(d)by Buyer, or Sellers (only if jointly delivered and not independently), in
the event that:

(i)there shall be any Law that makes consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement illegal or otherwise prohibited; or

(ii)any Governmental Authority shall have issued an Order restraining or
enjoining the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and such Order
shall have become final and non-appealable.

Section 9.02 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with this Article IX, this Agreement shall forthwith
become void and there shall be no Liability on the part of any party hereto
except: (a) the provisions of Article I, the confidentiality provisions of
Section 6.02, Section 6.06, Section 6.10, this Article IX, and Article XI
shall survive; and (b) nothing herein shall relieve any party hereto from
Liability for any intentional breach of any provision hereof. For the
avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that if Buyer does not close the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in circumstances in which all of
the closing conditions set forth in Section 7.01 and Section 7.02 have been
satisfied or waived (other than conditions to be performed by the parties at
the Closing), such failure or refusal to close shall be deemed to be an
intentional breach of this Agreement by Buyer, and if Sellers and Company do
not close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in circumstances in
which all of the closing conditions set forth in Section 7.01 and Section 7.03
have been satisfied or waived (other than conditions to be performed by the
parties at the Closing), such failure or refusal to close shall be deemed to
be an intentional breach of this Agreement by Sellers and Company. Nothing in
this Section 9.02 shall relieve or release any party of any Liability or
damages (which the parties acknowledge and agree shall not be limited to
reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and may include to the
extent proven the benefit of the bargain lost by a party's equityholders
(taking into consideration relevant matters, including other combination
opportunities and the time value of money, which shall be deemed in such event
to be damages of such party)) arising out of such party's willful breach of
this Agreement.

ARTICLE X

TAX MATTERS

Section 10.01 Sellers Returns. Sellers shall prepare, or cause to be prepared,
(a) all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to the
Company on or prior to the Closing Date, and (b) all Pass-Through Tax Returns
of the Company for any Tax period that ends on or before the Closing Date.
Buyer shall cooperate with Sellers in the preparation and timely filing of
such Tax Returns. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent
with the past practice of the Company, except as otherwise required by
applicable Law or to the extent solely relating to a Pass-Through Tax Return
for a Tax period that ends on or before the Closing Date. No later than thirty
(30) days prior to filing any such Tax Return, except for any Pass-Through Tax
Return for a Tax period that ends on or before the Closing Date, Sellers shall
deliver or cause to be delivered to Buyer such Tax Return (other than a Tax
Return that is required to be filed contemporaneous with, or promptly after, the close of a Tax period, without any available extension,
in which case such Tax Return shall be provided as soon as reasonably
practicable) and any related work papers, will permit Buyer to review and
comment on such Tax Return and will make such revisions to such Tax Return as
are reasonably requested by Buyer prior to the filing thereof.

Section 10.02 Allocation of Taxes. For purposes of this Agreement, in the case
of any Straddle Period, (a) the amount of any sales or use Taxes, withholding
Taxes, employment Taxes, Taxes imposed on specific transactions, or Taxes
based on or measured by income, profits, or receipts for the Pre-Closing Tax
Period shall be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the
close of business on the Closing Date (provided that any items that accrue on
an annual basis, such as depreciation deductions, shall be allocated in
accordance with the methodology described in Section 10.02(b)), and (b) the
amount of other Taxes, such as real and personal property and other ad valorem
Taxes, which relate to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the
amount of such Taxes for the entire period multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days in the period ending on the Closing
Date, and the denominator of which is the total number of days in the period.
For purposes of this Agreement, Transaction Tax Deductions shall be treated as
relating to the Pre-Closing Tax Period, and in preparing Tax Returns, the
parties hereto and their Affiliates shall allocate any Transaction Tax
Deductions to Pre-Closing Tax Periods to the extent permitted by applicable
Law.

Section 10.03 Post-Closing Actions. None of Buyer, the Company, or any
Affiliate thereof shall (or shall cause or permit the Company to), in each
case to the extent affecting a Pass-Through Tax Return of the Company that
includes a Pre-Closing Tax Period, without the prior written consent of
Sellers, (a) amend, re-file, or otherwise modify any Tax Return, (b) make any
voluntary disclosure to any Governmental Authority, (c) enter into any closing
agreement, (d) file any private letter ruling, (e) extend or waive the
limitation period applicable to any Tax claim or assessment, (f) surrender any
right to claim a refund of Taxes, (g) make, change, or revoke any Tax election
with retroactive effect, or (h) take any other similar action, or omit to take
any action relating to the filing of any Tax Return or the payment of any Tax.
Buyer and its Affiliates shall not take (as relates to the Company) or cause
the Company to take any action on or after the Closing that is outside of the
ordinary course of business.

Section 10.04 Cooperation and Records Retention. The parties hereto and their
Affiliates shall, in each case as it relates to the Company: (a) provide each
other with such assistance as may be reasonably requested by any of them in
connection with the preparation of any Tax Return or Tax Proceeding, which
shall include access to personnel responsible for preparing, maintaining, and
interpreting information relevant to Taxes on a mutually convenient basis, (b)
retain and provide each other with any records or other information that may
be relevant to such Tax Return or Tax Proceeding, and (c) provide each other
with copies of any final determination of any Tax Proceeding, to the extent
that it affects any such other Person's Taxes or Tax Returns required to be
paid or filed after any such determination. Without limiting the generality of
the immediately preceding sentence, Buyer shall retain, and shall cause the
Company to retain, until sixty (60) days after the applicable statutes of
limitations (including any extensions) have expired, copies of all Tax
Returns, supporting work schedules, and other records or information that may
be relevant to such Tax Returns for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods and shall not
destroy or otherwise dispose of any such records without first providing
Sellers and their respective Affiliates with a reasonable opportunity to review and copy the same. The parties hereto and their Affiliates further
agree, upon request, to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any
certificate or other document from any Governmental Authority or any other
Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce, or eliminate any Tax that
could be imposed on any of the other parties or their Affiliates in connection
with the Company or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
other Transaction Documents. The parties hereto and their respective
Affiliates shall each bear their own expenses in complying with the provisions
of this Section 10.04; provided that, if any action requested by a party will
require the other party to incur more than de minimus out of pocket expenses,
the other party may, without breach of this Agreement, condition its
compliance on payment or reimbursement of such expenses by the requesting
party.

Section 10.05 Tax Proceedings. Buyer or the Company shall provide Sellers with
written notice of any Tax Proceedings relating to any Pass-Through Tax Return
of the Company prepared by Sellers under Section 10.01, along with any written
correspondence received from the relevant Governmental Authority with respect
thereto, within fifteen (15) days of receipt by Buyer, the Company, or any of
their Affiliates. Sellers shall control any such Tax Proceeding, and Buyer,
the Company, and their respective Affiliates shall execute any power of
attorney or other documents reasonably requested by Sellers to enable Sellers
to control any such Tax Proceeding. With respect to any Tax Proceeding that
relates to a Pass-Through Tax Return for a Straddle Period, Sellers shall, (a)
provide the Company with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any
written submissions to a Governmental Authority in connection with such Tax
Proceeding, (b) keep the Company reasonably informed of all material actions
taken and other material developments, and (c) promptly notify the Company
following receipt of any notice of any material conversation, meeting,
information exchange, negotiation, dialogue, or other proceeding. None of the
parties hereto or their Affiliates shall settle, abandon, or otherwise
compromise any Tax Proceeding relating to a Pass-Through Tax Return for a
Straddle Period without the prior written consent of Buyer and Sellers, in
each case such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or
delayed. In the event of an inconsistency between this Section 10.05 and any
other provision of this Agreement, this Section 10.05 shall control.

Section 10.06 Transfer Taxes. All transfer, conveyance, recording,
documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration, value added, and other such
Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection
with this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents (including any real
property transfer Tax and any other similar Tax) shall be borne and paid by
Buyer when due. Buyer shall, at its own expense, timely file any Tax Return or
other document with respect to such Taxes or fees (and Sellers shall cooperate
with respect thereto as necessary), and shall provide a true, correct, and
complete copy of any such Tax Return to Sellers promptly after the filing
thereof.

Section 10.07 Tax Treatment; Purchase Price Allocation. For U.S. federal
income tax purposes, the parties agree that acquisition by Buyer of the
Membership Units pursuant to this Agreement shall be governed by IRS Revenue
Ruling 99-6, 1999-1 C.B. 432 (Situation 2) and, pursuant thereto (i) with
respect to Sellers, Sellers shall be treated as selling their Membership
Interests in a taxable sale of partnership interests and (ii) with respect to
Buyer, the Company shall be deemed to make a liquidating distribution of its
assets to Sellers and Buyer shall be deemed to acquire, by taxable purchase,
all such assets of the Company. Within ninety (90) days of the final
determination of the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.05, Buyer shall
deliver to Sellers an allocation of the Purchase Price (and the relevant Liabilities of the Company
and any other relevant items) among the assets of the Company in accordance
with Section 1060 of the Code, the applicable Treasury Regulations thereunder,
and the methodology set forth on Exhibit D. If Sellers disagree with Buyer's
allocation and provide written notice of such disagreement to Buyer within
thirty (30) days after Sellers' receipt of such allocation, Buyer and Sellers
shall negotiate in good faith to finalize such allocation no later than sixty
(60) days prior to the earliest due date (taking into account, for these
purposes, any applicable extension of a due date) for the filing of a Tax
Return to which such allocation is relevant. If the parties are unable to
mutually agree to such allocation, then the parties shall have no further
obligation under this Section 10.07, and each party shall make its own
determination of such allocation for financial and Tax reporting purposes,
which determination shall not be binding on the other party. Buyer shall have
no liability to Sellers, and Sellers shall have no liability to Buyer, for any
additional Taxes that may be imposed by any Governmental Authority relating to
Taxes to the extent such Liability arises solely as a result of
inconsistencies between separate allocations described in the previous
sentence.

Section 11.11 Specific Performance. The parties agree that irreparable damage
may occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with its specific terms or is otherwise breached and that money damages or
other legal remedies may not be an adequate remedy for any such damages.
Accordingly, the parties acknowledge and hereby agree that in the event of any
breach or threatened breach by Sellers, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the
other hand, of any of their respective covenants or obligations set forth in
this Agreement, any Seller, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other hand,
shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain
breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the other (as
applicable), without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of monetary
damages and without the necessity of posting a bond or other security, and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants and obligations of the other under this Agreement, and this right
shall include the right of either Seller to cause the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated. Each party hereby agrees not
to raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of
specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of
this Agreement by such party, and to specifically enforce the terms and
provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or
to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of such party under
this Agreement. The parties further agree that: (a) by seeking the remedies
provided for in this Section 11.11, a party shall not in any respect waive its
right to seek any other form of relief that may be available under this
Agreement (including monetary damages) if this Agreement has been terminated
or if the remedies provided for in this Section 11.11 are not available or
otherwise are not granted, and (b) nothing set forth in this Section 11.11
shall require any party to institute any proceeding for (or limit any party's
right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance under this Section
11.11 prior or as a condition to exercising any termination right under
Article IX (and pursuing damages after such termination), nor shall the
commencement of any Legal Proceeding pursuant to this Section 11.11 or
anything set forth in this Section 11.11 restrict or limit any party's right
to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of Article IX or
pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or
thereafter.

Section 11.12 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall be
deemed to be one and the same agreement. A signed copy of this Agreement
delivered by e-mail (including via DocuSign or equivalent software) or other
means of electronic transmission shall be deemed to have the same legal effect
as delivery of an original signed copy of this Agreement. The exchange of
copies of this Agreement and of signature pages by e-mail transmission
(including via DocuSign or equivalent software) or other means of electronic
transmission shall constitute effective execution and delivery of this
Agreement as to the parties and may be used in lieu of the original Agreement
for all purposes.

Section 11.13 Non-Recourse. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and
any Legal Proceeding based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement,
or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement may only be
brought against the entities that are expressly named as parties hereto and
then only with respect to the specific obligations set forth herein with such party, except in the case of Fraud committed by a Non-Recourse Party
(which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not give rise to any enforcement or
Legal Proceeding against or involving any other Non-Recourse Party which has
not committed Fraud). Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or
otherwise, the parties agree on their own behalf and on behalf of their
respective Affiliates that no Non‑Recourse Party of a party shall have any
Liability relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement except (a) to the extent agreed to in writing by such
Non‑Recourse Party or (b) in the case of Fraud committed by such Non-Recourse
Party; provided, that in the case of Fraud committed by such Non-Recourse
Party, Liability related thereto shall be limited to such Non-Recourse Party,
and no other Non-Recourse Party shall have any Liability whatsoever for such
Fraud committed by such Non-Recourse Party).

Section 11.14 Disclosures Generally. All schedules attached hereto (including
the Disclosure Schedules) are incorporated in and expressly made a part of
this Agreement as though completely set forth herein. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in the Disclosure Schedules or in this Agreement,
the information and disclosures contained in any section of the Disclosure
Schedules shall be deemed to be disclosed and incorporated by reference in any
other section of the Disclosure Schedules or representation or warranty
contained in Article III or Article IV, as applicable, as though fully set
forth in such Disclosure Schedules or representation or warranty for which the
applicability of such information and disclosure is reasonably apparent on the
face of such information and disclosure notwithstanding the absence of a cross
reference contained therein. The information set forth in the Disclosure
Schedules is disclosed solely for the purposes of this Agreement, and no
information set forth therein shall be deemed to be an admission by any party
to any third party of any matter whatsoever, including of any violation of Law
or breach of any Contract. The specification of any dollar amount or the
inclusion of any item in the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement, the Disclosure Schedules, or Exhibits is not intended to imply that
the amounts, or higher or lower amounts, or the items so included, or other
items, are or are not required to be disclosed (including whether such amounts
or items are required to be disclosed as material or threatened) or are within
or outside of the ordinary course of business of the Company, and no party
shall use the fact of the setting of the amounts or the fact of the inclusion
of any item in this Agreement, the Disclosure Schedules, or Exhibits in any
dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation, item,
or matter not set forth or included in this Agreement, the Disclosure
Schedules, or Exhibits is or is not required to be disclosed (including
whether the amount or items are required to be disclosed as material or
threatened) or is within or outside of the ordinary course of business of the
Company for purposes of this Agreement. In addition, matters reflected in the
Disclosure Schedules are not necessarily limited to matters required by this
Agreement to be reflected in the Disclosure Schedules. Such additional matters
are set forth for informational purposes only and do not necessarily include
other matters of a similar nature. Nothing in the Disclosure Schedules is
intended to broaden the scope of any representation or warranty contained in
this Agreement or create any covenant. Such information and the dollar
thresholds set forth herein shall not be used as a basis for interpreting the
terms "material" or "Material Adverse Effect" or other similar terms in this
Agreement.

Section 11.15 Attorneys' Fees. In the event any suit or other Legal Proceeding
is brought for the enforcement of any of the provisions of this Agreement (for
the avoidance of doubt, any suit or other Legal Proceeding seeking declaratory
relief shall be deemed to be brought for the enforcement of this Agreement),
the parties agree that the prevailing party or parties shall be entitled to recover from the non-prevailing party or parties upon final non-appealable
judgment from a court of competent jurisdiction on the merits reasonable
attorneys' fees, including attorneys' fees for any appeal, and costs incurred
in bringing or defending such suit or Legal Proceeding; provided, that if a
defending party prevails in part, and loses in part, in any such Legal
Proceeding, the court, arbitrator, or other adjudicator presiding over such
Legal Proceeding shall award a reimbursement of the fees, costs, and expenses
incurred by the defending party on an equitable basis.

Section 11.16 Legal Representation. In any Legal Proceeding by or against
Buyer wherein Buyer asserts or prosecutes any claim under, or otherwise seeks
to enforce, this Agreement, Buyer agrees in connection with such proceeding:
(a) neither Buyer nor counsel therefor will move to seek disqualification of
Holland and Knight LLP ("HandK") or Honigman LLP ("Honigman"), (b) to waive any
right Buyer may have to assert the attorney-client privilege against HandK,
Honigman, or Sellers or any of their Affiliates with respect to any
communication or information contained in HandK's or Honigman's possession or
files relating to Pre-Closing Communications, and (c) to consent to the
representation of any of Sellers and their Affiliates by HandK and/or Honigman,
as applicable, notwithstanding that HandK or Honigman, as applicable, has or may
have represented one or more of Sellers or any of their Affiliates (including
the Company) as counsel in connection with any matter, including any
transaction (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement),
negotiation, investigation, or Legal Proceeding, prior to the Closing. This
consent and waiver extends to HandK and/or Honigman, as applicable, representing
any Seller against Buyer or the Company in litigation, arbitration, or
mediation in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. In addition, all communications between or among Sellers,
the Company, and their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and HandK and/or
Honigman, as applicable, on the other hand, related to this or any other
proposed sale of the Membership Units, this Agreement, or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be deemed to be attorney-client
confidences that belong solely to such Seller or Affiliate thereof, as
applicable (and not the Company) (the "Pre-Closing Communications").
Accordingly, neither the Company nor Buyer shall have access to any such Pre-
Closing Communications or to the files of HandK or Honigman relating to such
engagement from and after the Closing, and all books, records, and other
materials of the Company in any medium (including electronic copies)
containing or reflecting any of the Pre-Closing Communications or the work
product of legal counsel with respect thereto, including any related
summaries, drafts, or analyses, and all rights with respect to any of the
foregoing, are hereby retained by, assigned, and transferred to the applicable
Seller or Affiliate thereof effective as of the Closing. Such material and
information shall be excluded from the transfer contemplated by this Agreement
and shall be delivered to the applicable Seller or Affiliate thereof at the
Closing with no copies thereof retained by the Company, Buyer, or any of
Buyer's Affiliates or Representatives. From and after the Closing, Buyer and
the Company shall maintain the confidentiality of all such material and
information. From and after the Closing, none of Buyer, the Company, and their
respective Affiliates and Representatives shall access or in any way, directly
or indirectly, use or rely upon any such materials or information. To the
extent that any such materials or information are not delivered to the
applicable Seller or Affiliate thereof prior to the Closing, they will be held
for the benefit of the applicable Seller or Affiliate thereof, and Buyer, the
Company, and their Affiliates will deliver all such material and information
to the applicable Seller or Affiliate thereof promptly upon discovery thereof,
without using or retaining copies thereof. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, from and after the Closing, (i) Sellers and their respective
Affiliates (and not the Company) shall be the sole holders of the attorney-
client privilege with respect to such engagement and the Pre-Closing Communications, and the Company shall not be a holder
thereof, (ii) to the extent that files of HandK or Honigman in respect of such
engagement and with respect to the Pre-Closing Communications constitute
property of the client, only the applicable Seller or Affiliate thereof (and
not the Company) shall hold such property rights, and (iii) neither HandK nor
Honigman shall have any duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such
attorney-client communications, files, or the Pre-Closing Communications to
the Company by reason of any attorney-client relationship between HandK and the
Company, Honigman and the Company, or otherwise. As to Pre-Closing
Communications, Buyer and its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the
Company) and Sellers, together with any of their respective Affiliates,
successors or assigns, agree that no such Person may use or rely on any of the
Pre-Closing Communications in any action or claim against or involving any of
the parties or any of their respective Non‑Recourse Parties after the Closing.
Buyer further agrees that, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Company), HandK's retention by the Company
shall be deemed completed and terminated without any further action by any
Person effective as of the Closing. Buyer hereby acknowledges and confirms
that it has had the opportunity to review and obtain adequate information
regarding the significance and risks of the waivers and other terms and
conditions of this Section 11.16, including the opportunity to discuss with
counsel such matters and reasonable alternatives to such terms. This Section
11.16 is for the benefit of Sellers, HandK, and Honigman, and HandK and Honigman
are intended third party beneficiaries of this Section 11.16. This Section
11.16 shall be irrevocable, and no term of this Section 11.16 may be amended,
waived or modified, without the prior written consent of Sellers, HandK, and
Honigman. The covenants and obligations set forth in this Section 11.16 shall
survive for ten (10) years following the Closing Date.

Section 11.17 Deliveries. Buyer agrees and acknowledges that all documents or
other items delivered to Buyer or its Representatives in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or uploaded and made available in
the Data Room at least one (1) day prior to the date hereof and remaining
available for viewing as of the date hereof shall be deemed to have been
delivered, provided, or made available to Buyer or its Representatives for all
purposes hereunder.

Section 11.18 Relationship of Parties. Nothing in this Agreement shall be
deemed to constitute the parties as joint venturers, alter egos, partners, or
participants in an unincorporated business or other separate entity, nor
create any principal agent, fiduciary, or other special relationship between
the parties. No party shall have any duties (including fiduciary duties)
towards any other party hereto except as specifically set forth herein.
