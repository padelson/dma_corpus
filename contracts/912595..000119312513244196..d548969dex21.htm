limited to, the Mid-America Parties and the Colonial Parties._ TABLE OF CONTENTS

and an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of MAA LP after the Mergers (such
merger transaction, the "Partnership Merger" and, together with the Parent
Merger, the "Mergers"), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement and in accordance with the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited
Partnership Act (as amended, the "DRULPA");

WHEREAS, each of the MAA Board and the Colonial Board has taken all actions
required for the execution of this Agreement by MAA and Colonial,

WHEREAS, as an inducement to the MAA Parties to enter into this
Agreement, certain of Colonials shareholders listed on _Schedule A_ hereto
have entered into a voting agreement, dated as of the date hereof, in the form

WHEREAS, the Parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and

this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a "plan of reorganization"
with respect to the Parent Merger for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the

virtue of the Parent Merger and without any further action on the part of MAA,
Colonial, or the holders of any securities of MAA or Colonial:

(a) Cancellation of Colonial Common Shares. Each Colonial Common Share issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Parent Merger Effective Time that is
held by MAA, any MAA Subsidiary or any wholly owned Colonial Subsidiary shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be retired and shall cease to
exist, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

Colonial Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Parent
Merger Effective Time (other than shares to be cancelled in accordance with

_Section 3.7_)) shall automatically be converted into the right to receive
0.360 (as the same may be adjusted pursuant to _Section 3.3_, the "Exchange
Ratio") validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of MAA Common
Stock (the "Merger Consideration"), without interest. All Colonial Common
Shares, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of a certificate (a "Certificate") or book-entry share registered in
the transfer books of Colonial (a "Book-Entry Share") that immediately prior
to the Parent Merger Effective Time represented Colonial Common Shares shall
cease to have any rights with respect to such Colonial Common Shares other
than the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section
3.5_, including the right, if any, to receive, pursuant to _Section 3.9_,
cash in lieu of fractional shares of MAA Common Stock into which such
Colonial Common Shares have been converted pursuant to this _Section 3.1(b)_
(the "Fractional Share Consideration"), together with the amounts, if any,
payable pursuant to _Section 3.5(d)_.

(c) Share Transfer Books. At the Parent Merger Effective Time, the share
transfer books of Colonial shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no
further registration of transfers of the Colonial Common Shares. From and

Shares immediately prior to the Parent Merger Effective Time shall cease to
have rights with respect to such shares, except as otherwise provided for
herein. On or after the Parent Merger Effective Time, any Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares of 

 



15  Colonial presented to the Exchange Agent, MAA or the transfer agent for any
reason shall be exchanged as provided in this _Article III_ with respect to
the Colonial Common Shares formerly represented thereby.

each holder of New MAA OP Units shall be admitted as a limited partner of MAA
LP in accordance with the terms of the limited partnership agreement of MAA
LP following the Partnership Merger Effective Time.

Section 3.3 _Adjustments_. Without limiting the other provisions of this
Agreement and subject to _Section 6.1(b)(ii)_ and _Section 6.1(b)(iii)_, if
at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the
Partnership Merger Effective Time, Colonial should split, combine or
otherwise reclassify the Colonial Common Shares, or make a dividend or other
distribution in Colonial Common Shares (including any dividend or other
distribution of securities convertible into Colonial Common Shares), or
engage in a reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or exchange or
other like change, then (without limiting any other rights of the other
Parties hereunder), the Exchange Ratio shall be ratably adjusted to reflect
fully the effect of any such change. Without limiting the other provisions of
this Agreement and subject to _Section 6.2(b)(ii)_ and _Section
6.2(b)(iii)_, if at any time during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Partnership Merger Effective Time, MAA should split,

Section 3.4 _Colonial Options and Restricted Stock_.

(a) At the Parent Merger Effective Time, each outstanding Colonial Option,
whether or not exercisable at the Parent Merger Effective Time, will be
assumed by MAA by virtue of the Parent Merger and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof. Subject to, and in accordance with, the terms of
the applicable Colonial Equity Incentive Plan and award agreement or other
agreement or other document evidencing Colonial Options, from and after the
Parent Merger Effective Time, each Colonial Option so assumed by MAA under
this Agreement will otherwise continue to have, and be subject to, the same
terms and conditions (including vesting schedule) as were applicable to the
corresponding Colonial Option immediately prior to the Parent Merger Effective
Time as set forth in the applicable Colonial Equity Incentive Plan (including
any applicable award agreement, other agreement or other document evidencing
such Colonial Option) immediately prior to the Parent Merger Effective Time,
except that, from and after the Parent Merger Effective Time, (A) each
Colonial Option, when exercisable, will be exercisable for that number of
whole shares of MAA Common Stock equal to the product of the number of
Colonial Common Shares that were subject to such Colonial Option immediately
prior to the Parent Merger Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio,
rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of MAA Common Stock and (B)
the per share exercise price for the shares of MAA Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of such assumed Colonial Option will be equal to the quotient
determined by dividing the exercise price of each Colonial Common Share
subject to such assumed Colonial Option by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to
the nearest whole cent.

(b) Any and all Colonial Common Shares subject to Colonial Restricted Share
Awards that are converted into the right to receive MAA Common Stock pursuant
to _Section 3.1(b)_ shall be converted into the right to receive shares of
MAA Common Stock that are subject to the same vesting and forfeiture
conditions and other terms and conditions as are applicable to the Colonial
Restricted Share Award immediately prior to the Parent Merger Effective Time.

(c) Prior to the Parent Merger Effective Time, Colonial and MAA agree that
Colonial shall, and shall be permitted under this Agreement to, take all
corporate action necessary to effectuate the provisions of this _Section
3.4_. From and after the Parent Merger Effective Time, unless the
compensation committee of the MAA Board determines otherwise, all references
to Colonial in the Colonial Equity Incentive Plans and in each agreement
evidencing any Colonial Options or any other Colonial equity-based award,
shall be deemed (A) for all purposes relating to employment, consultancy or
directorship (or words of similar meaning) to refer to MAA and its
Subsidiaries and (B) for all other purposes, to refer to MAA.

 



17 Section 3.5 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) Not less than five (5) days prior to dissemination of a joint proxy
statement in preliminary and definitive form relating to the Colonial
Shareholder Meeting and the MAA Shareholder Meeting (together with any
amendments or supplements thereto, the "Joint Proxy Statement"), MAA shall
appoint a bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to Colonial to act
as exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") for the payment and delivery of the
Merger Consideration and the Fractional Share Consideration, as provided in
_Section 3.1(b)_ and _Section 3.9_. On or before the Partnership Merger
Effective Time, MAA shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange
Agent (i) evidence of MAA Common Stock in book-entry form issuable pursuant to
_Section 3.1(b)_ equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration, and (ii) cash
in immediately available funds in an amount sufficient to pay the Fractional
Share Consideration and any dividends under _Section 3.5(d)_ (such evidence
of book-entry shares of MAA Common Stock and cash amounts, together with any
dividends or other distributions with respect thereto, the "Exchange Fund"),
in each case, for the sole benefit of the holders of Colonial Common Shares.
MAA shall cause the Exchange Agent to make, and the Exchange Agent shall make
delivery of the Merger Consideration, payment of the Fractional Share
Consideration and any amounts payable in respect of dividends or other
distributions on shares of MAA Common Stock in accordance with  _Section
3.5(d)_ out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this Agreement. The
Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

(b) The cash portion of the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Exchange
Agent as directed by MAA. Interest and other income on the Exchange Fund shall
be the sole and exclusive property of MAA. No investment of the Exchange Fund
shall relieve MAA or the Exchange Agent from making the payments required by
this _Article_ III, and following any losses from any such investment, MAA
shall promptly provide additional funds to the Exchange Agent to the extent
necessary to satisfy MAAs obligations hereunder for the benefit of the
holders of Colonial Common Shares at the Parent Merger Effective Time, which
additional funds will be deemed to be part of the Exchange Fund. 

(c) Exchange Procedures.

(i) As promptly as practicable following the Parent Merger Effective Time (but
in no event later than two (2) Business Days thereafter), MAA shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail (and to make available for collection by hand) to each
holder of record of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share (A) a letter of
transmittal (a "Letter of Transmittal") which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares shall pass only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent,
which Letter of Transmittal shall be in such form and have such other
customary provisions as MAA and Colonial may reasonably agree upon, and (B)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration into which the number
of Colonial Common Shares previously represented by such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement, together
with any amounts payable in respect of the Fractional Share Consideration in
accordance with  _Section 3.9_ and dividends or other distributions on
shares of MAA Common Stock in accordance with _Section 3.5(d)_.

 



18 (ii) Upon surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share (or affidavit
of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent, together with a Letter of
Transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required
by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for
each Colonial Common Share formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share pursuant to the provisions of this  _Article_ III plus any
Fractional Share Consideration that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to the provisions of _Section 3.9_ and any amounts that such holder
has the right to receive in respect of dividends or other distributions on
shares of MAA Common Stock in accordance with _Section 3.5(d)_ to be mailed
or delivered by wire transfer, within two (2) Business Days following the
later to occur of (A) the Parent Merger Effective Time or (B) the Exchange
Agents receipt of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof),
and the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) so surrendered
shall be forthwith cancelled. The Exchange Agent shall accept
such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) upon compliance
with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to
effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with customary exchange
practices. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.5_, each
Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed, at any time after the Parent
Merger Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive, upon such
surrender, the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this _Article_ III. No
interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration or the
Fractional Share Consideration payable upon the surrender of the Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares and any distributions to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to _Section 3.5(d)_ hereof.

(iii) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Colonial Common Shares that
is not registered in the transfer records of Colonial, it shall be a condition
of payment that any Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered in accordance
with the procedures set forth in this _Section 3.5(c)_ shall be properly
endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the
Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer Taxes and other
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share
surrendered or shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of MAA
that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable.

(d) Dividends with Respect to MAA Common Stock. No dividends or
other distributions with respect to MAA Common Stock with a record date after
the Parent Merger Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of MAA Common Stock
issuable hereunder, and all such dividends and other distributions shall be
paid by MAA to the Exchange Agent and shall be included in the Exchange Fund,
in each case until the surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share (or
affidavit of 

 



19  loss in lieu thereof) in accordance with this Agreement. Subject to
applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) there shall be paid to the
holder thereof, without interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Parent Merger Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such shares of MAA Common Stock to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Parent Merger Effective Time but prior to such
surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with
respect to such shares of MAA Common Stock.

(e) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including
any Fractional Share Consideration and any applicable dividends or other
distributions with respect to MAA Common Stock) which remains undistributed to
the holders of Colonial Common Shares for twelve (12) months after the Parent
Merger Effective Time shall be delivered to MAA, upon demand, and any former
holders of Colonial Common Shares prior to the Parent Merger who have not
theretofore complied with this _Article III_ shall thereafter look only to
MAA for payment of the Merger Consideration.

(f) No Liability. None of the MAA Parties, the Colonial Parties, the Exchange
Agent, or any employee, officer, director, agent or Affiliate thereof, shall
be liable to any person in respect of the Merger Consideration, as applicable,
if the Exchange Fund has been delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any amounts remaining
unclaimed by holders of any such shares immediately prior to the time at which
such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any
Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of MAA, free and clear of any claims or interest of such
holders or their successors, assigns or personal representatives previously
entitled thereto.

 

Section 3.6 _Withholding Rights_. The Parties, Colonial LP, MAA LP, OP Merger
Sub, the respective Affiliates of the foregoing and the Exchange Agent, as
applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration and Fractional Share Consideration (and any other consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement or deemed paid for
Tax purposes), such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to such payments under the Code or any other provision of state, local
or foreign Law. Any such amounts so deducted and withheld shall be paid over
to the applicable Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law
and shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 

Section 3.7 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Colonial Common Shares that are outstanding immediately prior
to the Parent Merger Effective Time and that are held by any Person who is
entitled to dissent and properly perfects such Persons dissenters rights of
appraisal with respect to such Colonial Common Shares (the "Dissenting
Shares") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section
10A-2-13.01 _et seq._ of the ABNEC ("ABNEC Article 13") shall not be converted
into shares of MAA Common Stock as provided in _Section 3.1(b)_, but rather
the holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to payment by MAA of the
"fair value" (as defined in ABNEC Article 13) of such Dissenting 

 



20  Shares plus accrued interest in accordance with ABNEC Article 13; _provided_
, _however_ , that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall
waive, withdraw or lose the right to dissent under ABNEC Article 13, then the
right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Dissenting
Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been
converted as of the Parent Merger Effective Time into, and shall have become
exchangeable solely for the right to receive, shares of MAA Common Stock as
provided in _Section 3.1(b)_. Colonial shall serve prompt written notice to
MAA of any demand received by Colonial from a holder of Colonial Common
Shares pursuant to Section 13.21 of ABNEC Article 13, and MAA shall have the
right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any
such demand. Prior to the Parent Merger Effective Time, Colonial shall not,
without the prior written consent of MAA (not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned), make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer
to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 

Section 3.8 _Structure_. Each party hereto shall cooperate reasonably in the
consideration of any reasonable changes requested by the other Parties
regarding the structure of the transactions contemplated herein; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no such change shall (a) alter or change the amount or kind
of the consideration to be issued to holders of Colonial Common Shares or
Colonial OP Units as currently contemplated in this Agreement, (b) reasonably
be expected to impose any material impediment or delay, or condition to,
consummation of the Mergers, (c) adversely affect, including with respect to
federal income tax treatment, any of the parties hereto or the holders of
Colonial Common Shares or Colonial OP Units in connection with the Mergers,
(d) require submission to or approval by holders of Colonial Common Shares
after the Colonial Shareholder Approval, (e) require submission to or
approval by holders of Colonial OP Units (other than to the extent solely from
Colonial, as general partner and/or limited partner of Colonial LP) or (f)
provide for any modifications to the provisions of the Amended Partnership
Agreement that are noted on _Exhibit E_ as being "In The Form"; and _provided_
_further_ that such change also shall be subject to the written consent of the
other Parties (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, or conditioned
or delayed). In the event that the Parties mutually agree to make such a
change, the Parties agree to execute appropriate documents, including entering
into appropriate amendments to this Agreement, to reflect the change.

Section 3.9 _Fractional Shares_. No certificate or scrip representing
fractional shares of MAA Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for
exchange of Certificates or the transfer of Book-Entry Shares, and such
fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any other rights of a shareholder of MAA. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement, each holder of Colonial Common Shares converted pursuant to
the Parent Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction
of a share of MAA Common Stock shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash, without
interest, in an amount equal to such fractional part of a share of MAA Common
Stock multiplied by the VWAP of MAA Common Stock.

 

Section 3.10 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by MAA, the posting by such Person of

 



21  a bond in such reasonable amount as MAA may direct, as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration, Fractional Share Consideration and any
distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this _Article III_.

Parent Merger, to receipt of the Colonial Shareholder Approval, and to the
filing of the articles of merger with the Office of the Secretary of State for
the State of Alabama. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
Colonial and assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by each of
Colonial LP, MAA, MAA LP and OP Merger Sub, constitutes a legally valid and
binding obligation of Colonial enforceable against Colonial in accordance with
its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
similar Laws affecting creditors rights generally and by general principles
of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding
in equity or at law). 

(b) The Colonial Board, at a duly held meeting, has, by unanimous vote, (i)
duly and validly authorized the execution and delivery of, and adopted, this
Agreement and declared advisable the consummation of the Mergers and the other

State of the State of Delaware. This Agreement has been duly executed
and delivered by Colonial LP, and assuming due authorization, execution and
delivery by each of Colonial, MAA, MAA LP and OP Merger Sub, constitutes a
legally valid and binding

 



26  obligation of Colonial LP, enforceable against Colonial LP in accordance
with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws
affecting creditors rights generally and by general principles of equity

termination, acceleration or cancellation (with or without notice or the lapse
of time or both) of, or give rise to any right of purchase, first offer or
forced sale under or result in the creation of a Lien on any property or asset
of Colonial or any Colonial Subsidiary pursuant to, any note, bond, debt
instrument, indenture, contract, agreement, ground lease, license, permit or
other legally binding obligation to which Colonial or any Colonial Subsidiary
is a party, except, as to clauses (i)(C), (ii) and (iii), respectively, for
any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences
which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
have a Colonial Material Adverse Effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
representations and warranties shall be deemed to have been made under 
_Section 4.5(a)(iii)_ with respect to the agreements (other than the Colonial
LP Agreement) listed on Section 4.12(g) of the Colonial Disclosure Letter.

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of Colonial and
Colonial LP does not, and the performance of this Agreement by each of

in full force and effect, except where the failure to be in possession of, or
the failure to be valid or in full force and effect of, any of the Colonial

timely basis with the appropriate Governmental Authority, and all other
filings required to have been made with respect to such Colonial Permits have
been duly made on a timely basis with the appropriate Governmental Authority,
except in each case for failures to file which, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Colonial Material
Adverse Effect. Neither Colonial nor any Colonial Subsidiary has received any
claim or notice nor has any Knowledge indicating that Colonial or any Colonial
Subsidiary is currently not in compliance with the terms of any such Colonial
Permits, except where the failure to be in compliance with the terms of any
such Colonial Permits, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to have a Colonial Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) Neither Colonial nor any Colonial Subsidiary is or has been in conflict
with, or in default or violation of (i) any Law applicable to Colonial or any

Colonial Material Adverse Effect.

the SEC or otherwise) a true and complete copy of each report, schedule,
registration statement and definitive proxy statement filed or furnished by

not misleading, except to the extent such statements have been modified or

incorporated by reference in the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement that

S-X under the Exchange Act) and fairly presented, in all material respects, in
accordance with applicable requirements of GAAP and the applicable rules and
regulations of the SEC (subject, in the case of the unaudited statements, to

financial position of Colonial and the Colonial Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, as of their respective dates and the consolidated statements of income

30 Section 4.12 _Taxes_.

 

(a) Colonial and each Colonial Subsidiary has timely filed with the
appropriate Governmental Authority all Tax Returns required to be filed,
taking into account any extensions of time within which to file such Tax
Returns, and all such Tax Returns were complete and correct in all material
respects. Colonial and each Colonial Subsidiary has duly paid (or there has
been paid on their behalf), or made adequate provisions for, all material
Taxes required to be paid by them, whether or not shown on any Tax return.

(b) Colonial (i) for all taxable years commencing with Colonials formation
and through December 31, 2012, has been subject to taxation as a real estate
investment trust within the meaning of Sections 856 and 857 of the Code (a
"REIT") and has satisfied all requirements for qualification and taxation as a
REIT for such years; (ii) has operated since January 1, 2013 and will operate
to the Parent Merger Effective Time in a manner consistent with the
requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT (without taking into
account the effects of the Partnership Merger); (iii) intends to continue to
operate in such a manner as to qualify as a REIT for its taxable year ending
with the Parent Merger; and (iv) has not taken or omitted to take any action
that could reasonably be expected to result in a challenge by the IRS to its
status as a REIT (without taking into account the effects of the Partnership
Merger), and to the Knowledge of Colonial, no such challenge is pending or
threatened. No entity in which Colonial owns an interest is a corporation for
United States federal income tax purposes, other than a corporation
that qualifies as a "qualified REIT subsidiary" within the meaning of Section
856(i)(2) of the Code ("Qualified REIT Subsidiary") or a "taxable REIT
subsidiary" within the meaning of Section 856(l) of the Code ("Taxable REIT
Subsidiary"). Section 4.12(b) of the Colonial Disclosure Letter sets forth a
list of each Qualified REIT Subsidiary and Taxable REIT Subsidiary of
Colonial, and each Colonial Subsidiary not set forth in Section 4.12(b) of

Time, Colonial will have distributed cash to its shareholders in its taxable
year ending with the Parent Merger in an amount equal to or in excess of
the amount required to be distributed pursuant to Section 857(a) of the Code
in respect of its taxable year ending with the Parent Merger, and Colonial
will not be subject to Tax under Sections 857(b) or 4981 of the Code in
respect of its taxable year ending with the Parent Merger.

(c) (i) There are no audits, investigations by any Governmental Authority or
other proceedings ongoing or, to the Knowledge of Colonial, threatened with
regard to any Taxes or Tax Returns of Colonial or any Colonial Subsidiary;
(ii) no deficiency for Taxes of Colonial or any Colonial Subsidiary has been
claimed, proposed or assessed in writing or, to the Knowledge of Colonial,
threatened, by any Governmental Authority, which deficiency has not yet been
settled, except for such deficiencies which are being contested in good faith
or with respect to which the failure to pay, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Colonial Material
Adverse Effect; (iii) except as set forth in Section 4.12(c)(iii) of the
Colonial Disclosure Letter, neither Colonial nor any Colonial Subsidiary has
waived any statute of limitations with respect to the assessment of Taxes or
agreed to any extension of time with respect to any Tax assessment or
deficiency for any open tax year or is the beneficiary of an extension of time
to file any Tax Return except for any such waivers or

 



31  extensions relating to an extension of time to file any non-income Tax
Return in respect of a taxable year or period ending in 2012 or 2013; and (iv)
except as set forth in Section 4.12(c)(iv) of the Colonial Disclosure Letter,

"closing agreement" as described in Section 7121 of the Code (or any
corresponding or similar provision of state, local or foreign income Tax
Law).

the disposition of which would be subject to (or to rules similar to) Section
1374 of the Code.

(e) Beginning with its taxable year ended December 31, 2009, (i) Colonial and
the Colonial Subsidiaries have not incurred any liability for material Taxes
under Sections 857(b)(1), 857(b)(6)(A), 860(c) or 4981 of the Code which have
not been previously paid and shall not incur any such liability for such
Taxes in the taxable year ending on the Closing Date, and (ii) neither
Colonial nor any Colonial Subsidiary has incurred any material liability for
Taxes other than (x) in the ordinary course of business or consistent with
past practice, or (y) transfer or similar Taxes arising in connection with a
sale, exchange, or other transfer of property. No event has occurred, and no
condition or circumstance exists, which presents a material risk that any
material Tax described in the preceding sentence will be imposed upon Colonial
or the Colonial Subsidiaries.

 

(f) Colonial and the Colonial Subsidiaries have complied, in all material
respects, with all applicable Laws, rules and regulations relating to the
payment and withholding of Taxes (including withholding of Taxes pursuant to
Sections 1441, 1442, 1445, 1446 and 3402 of the Code or similar provisions
under any state and foreign Laws) and have duly and timely withheld and, in
each case, have paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority all
material amounts required to be so withheld and paid over on or prior to the
due date thereof under all applicable Laws.

 

(g) Except as set forth on Section 4.12(g) of the Colonial Disclosure Letter,
there are no Colonial Tax Protection Agreements in force at the date of this
Agreement, and, as of the date of this Agreement, no person has raised in

risk of loss with respect to debt, (B) to retain or not to dispose of assets,
or engage in transactions of comparable tax effect, (C) to make or refrain

manner. As used herein, "Colonial Subsidiary Partnership" means a Colonial
Subsidiary that is a partnership for United States federal income tax
purposes.

Colonial Subsidiary except Liens for Taxes not yet due and payable or that
are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which

(2) years prior to the date of this Agreement or (B) in a distribution which
could otherwise constitute part of a "plan" or "series of related
transactions" (within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code) in
conjunction with transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(n) Except as set forth in Section 4.12(n) of the Colonial Disclosure Letter,
no written power of attorney that has been granted by Colonial or any of the
Colonial Subsidiaries (other than to Colonial or a Colonial Subsidiary)
currently is in force with respect to any matter relating to Taxes.

(o) This _Section 4.12_ contains the sole and exclusive representations and

is a party, except, as to clauses (i)(C), (ii) and (iii), respectively, for
any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences
which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
have a MAA Material Adverse Effect.

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of MAA, MAA LP and OP

LP and OP Merger Sub will not, require any consent, approval, authorization

Permits"), and all such MAA Permits are valid and in full force and
effect, except where the failure to be in possession of, or the failure to be
valid or in full force and effect of, any of the MAA Permits, individually or

MAA Subsidiary is currently not in compliance with the terms of any such MAA
Permits, except where the failure to be in compliance with the terms of any

any MAA Permits (except for the MAA Permits addressed in _Section 5.17_ or

whether or not shown on any Tax Return.

December 31, 2012, has been subject to taxation as REIT and has satisfied all
requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT for such years; (ii)

Effective Time in a manner consistent with the requirements for qualification

the failure to pay, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a MAA Material Adverse Effect; (iii) except as set forth
in Section 5.12(c)(iii) of the MAA Disclosure Letter, neither MAA nor any MAA
Subsidiary has waived any statute of limitations with respect to the
assessment of Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with respect to any Tax
assessment or deficiency for any open tax year or is the beneficiary of an
extension of time to file any Tax Return except for any such waivers or
extensions relating to an extension of time to file any non-income Tax Return
in respect of a taxable year or period ending in 2012 or 2013; and (iv)

circumstance exists, which presents a material risk that any material Tax
described in the preceding sentence will be imposed upon MAA or the MAA
Subsidiaries.

(f) MAA and the MAA Subsidiaries have complied, in all material respects, with
all applicable Laws, rules and regulations relating to the payment and
withholding of Taxes (including withholding of Taxes pursuant to Sections

state and foreign Laws) and have duly and timely withheld and, in each case,
have paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority all material amounts
required to be so withheld and paid over on or prior to the due date thereof
under all applicable Laws.

written ruling of a Governmental Authority, or has entered into any written
agreement with a Governmental Authority with respect to any Taxes.

with respect to which MAA or any MAA Subsidiary is a party (other than
customary arrangements under commercial contracts or borrowings entered into

the prior written consent of such other Party ( _provided_ that, for the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section 7.2(a)_ shall be deemed to
restrict a Party and its respective Representatives and Affiliates from
contacting such parties in pursuing its own business activities (operating in
the ordinary course)).

(b) Each of Colonial and MAA will hold, and will cause its respective
Representatives and Affiliates to hold, any nonpublic information, including
any information exchanged pursuant to this _Section 7.2_, in confidence to
the extent required by and in accordance with, and will otherwise comply with,
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall remain in full force
and effect pursuant to the terms thereof notwithstanding the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the termination thereof.

 



86 (c) Each of Colonial and MAA will give prompt written notice to the other upon
becoming aware of the occurrence or impending occurrence of any event or
circumstance relating to it or any of the Colonial Subsidiaries or the MAA
Subsidiaries, respectively, which could reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Colonial Material Adverse Effect or a MAA
Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be.

(d) Each Party shall cooperate and participate, as reasonably requested by
the other Party from time to time, in efforts to oversee the integration of
the Parties operations in connection with, and taking effect upon
consummation of, the Mergers subject to applicable Law, including, without
limitation, providing such reports on operational matters and participating on
such teams and committees as the Parties shall mutually agree.

Section 7.3 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the
Parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts (subject to, and in
accordance with, applicable Law) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
and to do promptly, or cause to be done promptly, and to assist and cooperate
with each other in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Law to consummate and make effective, as promptly as practicable,
the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including preparing and filing as promptly as practicable all
documentation to effect all required filings, notices, petitions, statements,
registrations, submissions of information, applications and other documents
necessary to consummate the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each
of the Parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
cooperate with the other Party in determining which filings are required to
be made prior to the Closing with, and which consents, clearances, approvals,
permits or authorizations are required to be obtained prior to the Closing
from, any Governmental Authority in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and in timely making all such filings, (ii)
promptly furnish the other Party, subject in appropriate cases to
appropriate confidentiality agreements to limit disclosure to outside lawyers
and consultants, with such information and reasonable assistance as such other
Party and its Affiliates may reasonably request in connection with their
preparation of necessary filings, registrations and submissions of
information to any Governmental Authority with respect to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) supply as promptly as reasonably
practicable and to the extent necessary any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested pursuant to any applicable Laws by
any Governmental Authority, and (iv) take or cause to be taken all other
actions necessary, proper or advisable to obtain applicable clearances,
consents, authorizations, approvals or waivers and cause the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting periods with respect to the Mergers
under any applicable Laws as promptly as reasonably practicable and, in any
event, no later than the Outside Date.

 



87 (b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the Parties
hereto shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in _Section 5.3(a)_,
use its reasonable best efforts to: (i) cooperate in all respects with each
other in connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including any
proceeding initiated by a private party with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby; (ii) promptly notify the other Party of any
material communication concerning this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby to that Party from or with any Governmental Authority and
consider in good faith the views of the other Party and keep the other Party
reasonably informed of the status of matters related to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including furnishing the other with copies of
any written notices or other material communications received by such Party
from, or given by such Party to, any U.S. or foreign Governmental Authority
and of any material communication received or given in connection with any
proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, except that any materials concerning one Partys
valuation of the other Party may be redacted; and (iii) to the extent
reasonably practicable, permit the other Party to review in draft any
proposed written communication to be submitted by it to any Governmental
Authority with reasonable time and opportunity to comment, and consult with
each other in advance of any in-person or telephonic meeting or conference
with any Governmental Authority or, in connection with any proceeding by a
private party with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, with any other Person, and, to the extent permitted by the applicable
Governmental Authority or Person, use reasonable best efforts not to
participate in any meeting or discussion with any Governmental Authority
relating to any filings or investigations concerning this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby unless it consults with the other Party
and its Representatives in advance and so long as it is acceptable to the
Governmental Authority invites the other Partys Representatives to attend in
accordance with applicable Laws. The Parties may, as they deem advisable and
necessary, designate competitively sensitive information provided to the other
under this _Section 7.3_ as "outside counsel only." Such materials and the
information contained therein shall be given only to outside counsel of the
recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees,
officers, or directors of the recipient without the advance written consent of
the Party providing such materials.

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the Parties hereto shall (i)
use its reasonable best efforts to resolve objections, if any, as may be
asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under
any Laws, including defending any lawsuits or other legal proceedings,
whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (including seeking to
have any stay, temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction entered
by any court or other Governmental Authority vacated or reversed), and (ii)
take, or cause to be taken, all such further reasonable actions as may be
necessary to resolve such objections, if any, as any Governmental Authority or
any other Person may assert under any Law with respect to the Mergers and the
other transactions contemplated hereby, and to avoid or eliminate each and
every impediment under any Law so as to enable the Closing to occur as
promptly as reasonably practicable and, in any event, no later than the
Outside Date , including (but only with the prior written consent of the other
Party) (x) proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent
decree, hold 

 



88  separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, license or disposition
of any assets of MAA, Colonial or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates, and (y) otherwise taking or committing to take any actions that
after the Closing would limit the freedom of MAA, Colonial or their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates freedom of action with respect to one or more of
MAAs, Colonials or their Subsidiaries businesses or assets, in each case
as may be required in order to effect the satisfaction of the conditions to
the Mergers set forth in _Article VIII_ and to avoid the entry of, or to
effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or
other order in any suit or proceeding that would otherwise have the effect of
preventing or delaying the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither MAA
nor Colonial shall be required to become subject to, or consent or agree to
or otherwise take any action with respect to, any Order, requirement,
condition, understanding or agreement of or with a Governmental Authority to
sell, to license, to hold separate or otherwise dispose of, or to conduct,
restrict, operate, or otherwise change their assets or businesses, unless such
Order, requirement, condition, understanding or agreement is conditioned upon
the occurrence of the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other
provision of this Agreement, nothing in this _Section 7.3_ shall limit a
Partys right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1_ so long
as such Party has, prior to such termination, been complying with its
obligations under this _Section 7.3_.

(d) Each of MAA and Colonial shall, if any Takeover Statute becomes applicable
to this Agreement, the Mergers, or any other transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby, grant approvals and use all reasonable best efforts to ensure that
the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby or
thereby and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Takeover Statute on this
Agreement, the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 7.4 _Acquisition Proposals; Changes in Recommendation_.

 

(a) Each of MAA and Colonial agrees that it shall not, nor shall it permit any
of its Subsidiaries to, authorize or permit any of its officers, trustees,
directors or employees to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its and its Subsidiaries Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any
inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer by or with a Third Party with
respect to (A) any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination
or similar transaction involving it or any of its Subsidiaries, (B) any sale,
lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, license, transfer or other disposition,
directly or indirectly, by merger, consolidation, sale of equity interests,
share exchange, joint venture, business combination or otherwise, of any of
its assets or that of its Subsidiaries (including stock or other ownership
interests of its Subsidiaries) representing twenty percent (20%) or more of
consolidated assets, as determined on a book-value basis, (C) any issue, sale
or other disposition of (including by way of merger, consolidation, joint
venture, business combination, share exchange or any similar transaction)
securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or securities
convertible into, such securities) representing twenty percent (20%) or more
of its voting power, (D) any tender offer or exchange offer in which any
Person or "group" (as such term is defined in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act) shall seek to acquire beneficial ownership (as such term is
defined in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under

 



89  the Exchange Act), or the right to acquire beneficial ownership, of twenty
percent (20%) or more of the outstanding shares of any class of its voting
securities, or (E) any recapitalization, restructuring, liquidation,
dissolution or other similar type of transaction in which a Third Party shall
acquire beneficial ownership of twenty percent (20%) or more of the
outstanding shares of any class of its voting securities (any such proposal,
offer or transaction (other than a proposal or offer made by one Party to this
Agreement or an Affiliate thereof) being hereinafter referred to as an
"Acquisition Proposal"), (ii) engage in any negotiations concerning, or
provide any confidential information or data to any person relating to an
Acquisition Proposal, or knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make or
implement an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) approve or execute or enter into any
letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement, asset purchase or
share exchange agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement related
to any Acquisition Proposal (an "Acquisition Agreement"), or (iv) propose
publicly or agree to do any of the foregoing.

(b)

 

(i) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Colonial Board and MAA Board shall each
be permitted, prior to its respective meeting of shareholders to be held
pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)_ or _(d)_ , as applicable, and subject to
compliance with the other terms of this _Section 7.4_ and to first entering
into a confidentiality agreement having provisions that are no less favorable
to such party than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, to engage
in discussions and negotiations with, or provide any nonpublic information or
data to, any Person in response to an unsolicited bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal by such Person made after the date of this Agreement
(that did not result from a breach of this _Section 7.4_) and which the
Colonial Board or the MAA Board, as applicable, concludes in good faith
(after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors)
constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, if and
only to the extent that the directors of MAA or the trustees of Colonial, as
applicable, conclude in good faith (after consultation with outside legal
counsel) that failure to do so would be inconsistent with their duties under
applicable Law. Colonial and MAA, as applicable, shall provide the other with
a copy of any nonpublic information or data provided to a third party
pursuant to the prior sentence prior to or simultaneously with furnishing such
information to such third party.

(ii) Each Party shall notify the other Party promptly (but in no event later
than one Business Day) after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, or any
request for nonpublic information relating to such Party or any of its
Subsidiaries by any person that informs such Party or any of its Subsidiaries
that it is considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal, or any
inquiry from any person seeking to have discussions or negotiations with such
Party relating to a possible Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall be made
orally and confirmed in writing, and shall indicate the identity of the person
making the Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request and the material terms
and conditions of any inquiries, proposals or offers (including a copy
thereof if in writing and any related documentation or correspondence). Each
Party shall also promptly, and in any event within one Business Day, notify
the other Party, orally and in writing, if it

 



90  enters into discussions or negotiations concerning any Acquisition Proposal
or provides nonpublic information or data to any person in accordance with
this _Section 7.4(b)_ and keep the other Party informed in all material
respects of the status and terms of any such proposals, offers, discussions or
negotiations on a current basis, including by providing a copy of all material
documentation or correspondence relating thereto. 

(iii) Except as provided in _Section 7.4(b)(iv)_ or _Section 7.4(b)(v)_,
neither the Colonial Board, the MAA Board, nor any committee thereof shall
withhold, withdraw or modify in any manner adverse to the other Party, or
propose publicly to withhold, withdraw or modify in any manner adverse to the
other Party, the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by
the Colonial Board or the MAA Board, as applicable, or any such committee
thereof with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
(a "Change in Colonial Recommendation" or a "Change in MAA Recommendation,"
respectively).

(iv) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, with respect
to an Acquisition Proposal, the Colonial Board or the MAA Board, as
applicable, may make a Change in Colonial Recommendation or a Change in MAA
Recommendation, as applicable (and in the event that the Colonial Board or
the MAA Board, as applicable, determines such Acquisition Proposal to be a
Superior Proposal, in accordance with this _Section 7.4_, terminate this
Agreement pursuant to  _Section 9.1_), if and only if (A) an unsolicited
bona fide written Acquisition Proposal (that did not result from a breach of
this _Section 7.4_) is made to Colonial or MAA, as applicable, and is not
withdrawn, (B) the Colonial Board or the MAA Board, as applicable, has
concluded in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and
financial advisors) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal, (C) the trustees of Colonial or the directors of MAA, as
applicable, have concluded in good faith (after consultation with outside
legal counsel) that failure to do so would be inconsistent with their duties
under applicable Law, (D) four (4) Business Days (the "Notice Period") shall
have elapsed since the Party proposing to take such action has given written
notice to the other Party advising such other Party that the notifying Party
intends to take such action and specifying in reasonable detail the reasons
therefor, including the terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal
that is the basis of the proposed action (a "Notice of Recommendation
Change"), (E) during such Notice Period, the notifying Party has considered
and, at the reasonable request of the other Party, engaged in good faith
discussions with such Party regarding, any adjustment or modification of the
terms of this Agreement proposed by the other Party, and (F) the directors or
trustees, as applicable, of the Party proposing to take such action, following
such Notice Period, again reasonably determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel, and taking into account
any adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement proposed by the
other Party) that failure to do so would be inconsistent with their duties
under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that (1) if, during the Notice
Period, any material revisions are made to the Superior Proposal (it being
understood that a material revision shall include, without limitation, any
change in the purchase price or form of consideration in such Superior
Proposal), the Colonial Board or the MAA Board, as applicable, shall give a

 



91  new written notice to the other Party and shall comply with the requirements
of this _Section 7.4(b)(iv)_ with respect to such new written notice and (2)
in the event the Colonial Board or the MAA Board, as applicable, does not
determine that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, but
thereafter determines to make a Change in Colonial Recommendation or a Change
in MAA Recommendation, as applicable, pursuant to this  _Section 7.4_ with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal, the foregoing procedures referred to in
this _Section 7.4(b)(iv)_ shall apply anew and shall also apply to any
subsequent withdrawal, amendment or change with respect thereto.

(v) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in
circumstances not involving or relating to an Acquisition Proposal, the
Colonial Board or the MAA Board, as applicable, may make a Change in Colonial
Recommendation or a Change in MAA Recommendation, as applicable, if and only
if (A) a material development or change in circumstances has occurred or
arisen after the date of this Agreement that was neither known to such Party
nor reasonably foreseeable as of the date of this Agreement (and which change
or development does not relate to an Acquisition Proposal), (B) the directors
or trustees, as applicable, of the Party proposing to take such action have
first reasonably determined in good faith (after consultation with outside
legal counsel) that failure to do so would be inconsistent with their duties
under applicable Law, (C) four (4) Business Days (the "Intervening Event
Notice Period") shall have elapsed since the Party proposing to take such
action has given a Notice of Recommendation Change to the other Party
advising that the notifying Party intends to take such action and specifying
in reasonable detail the reasons therefor, (D) during such four-Business-Day
period, the notifying Party has considered and, at the reasonable request of
the other Party, engaged in good faith discussions with such Party regarding,
any adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement proposed by the
other Party, and (E) the directors or trustees, as applicable, of the Party
proposing to take such action, following such Intervening Event Notice
Period, again reasonably determine in good faith (after consultation with
outside legal counsel, and taking into account any adjustment or modification
of the terms of this Agreement proposed by the other Party) that failure to
do so would be inconsistent with their duties under applicable Law; _provided_
, _however_ , that in the event the Colonial Board or the MAA Board, as
applicable, does not make a Change in Colonial Recommendation or a Change in
MAA Recommendation, as applicable, following such four-Business-Day period,
but thereafter determines to make a Change in Colonial Recommendation or a
Change in MAA Recommendation, as applicable, pursuant to this  _Section 7.4_
in circumstances not involving an Acquisition Proposal, the foregoing
procedures referred to in this _Section 7.4(b)(v)_ shall apply anew and shall
also apply to any subsequent withdrawal, amendment or change. 

(vi) Nothing contained in this _Section 7.4_ shall prohibit either Party or
its Subsidiaries from taking and disclosing to its respective shareholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or
from making a statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule
14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and
listen" statement pending

 



92  disclosure of its position thereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that
compliance with such rules shall not in any way limit or modify the effect
that any action taken pursuant to such rules has under any other provision of
this Agreement, including _Section 7.1(c)_ or _(d)_ , as applicable, and
_provided_ , _further_ , that any such disclosure that addresses the approval,
recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Colonial Board or the
MAA Board, as applicable, with respect to this Agreement or an Acquisition
Proposal shall be deemed to be a Change in Colonial Recommendation or Change
in MAA Recommendation, as applicable, unless the Colonial Board or the MAA
Board, as applicable, of such party, in connection with such communication
publicly states that its recommendation with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby has not changed or refers to the prior
recommendation of such party, without disclosing any Change in Colonial
Recommendation or Change in MAA Recommendation, as applicable.

(c) For purposes of this _Section 7.4_ and this Agreement, "Superior
Proposal" means a written bona fide Acquisition Proposal (except that, for
purposes of this definition, the references in the definition of "Acquisition
Proposal" to "twenty percent (20%)" shall be replaced by "fifty percent
(50%)") made by a Third Party on terms that the Colonial Board or the MAA
Board, as applicable, determines in its good faith judgment, after
consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors, taking into
account all financial, legal, regulatory and any other aspects of the
transaction described in such proposal and such other relevant factors
(including, without limitation, the identity of the Person making such
proposal, any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions, conditions to
consummation and feasibility and certainty of consummation (including
whether consummation is reasonably capable of being completed on a timely
basis on the terms proposed), as well as any changes to the financial terms of
this Agreement proposed by the other Party in response to such proposal or
otherwise), would, if consummated, be more favorable to Colonial and its
shareholders, or to MAA and its shareholders, as applicable, from a financial
point of view than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(d) Each of Colonial and MAA agrees that (i) it will and will cause its
Subsidiaries, and its and their Representatives to, cease immediately and
terminate any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with
any third parties conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal, and (ii) it will not release any third party from, or waive
any provisions of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.
Each of Colonial and MAA agrees that it will use its reasonable best efforts
to promptly inform its and its Subsidiaries respective Representatives of
the obligations undertaken in this _Section 7.4_.

(e) 

(i) Notwithstanding any Change in Colonial Recommendation or Change in MAA
Recommendation, as applicable, unless such Change in Colonial Recommendation
or Change in MAA Recommendation, as applicable, is with respect to a Superior
Proposal and this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 9.1_, each of
Colonial and MAA shall cause the adoption of this Agreement to be submitted
to a vote of its respective shareholders at the Colonial Shareholder Meeting
and the MAA Shareholder Meeting, respectively.

 



93 (ii) Without the prior written consent of each of Colonial and MAA
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), or
otherwise as set forth on Section 7.4(e)(ii) of the Colonial Disclosure Letter
or MAA Disclosure Letter, adoption of this Agreement and approval of the
Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby is the only matter,
other than any say-on-golden parachute vote that may be required pursuant to
Section 14A(b)(2) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-21(c) thereunder and a
proposal to approve the adjournment of the Colonial Shareholders Meeting or
the MAA Shareholders Meeting, as applicable, if necessary, to solicit
additional proxies, in the event that there are not sufficient votes at the
time of the Colonial Shareholders Meeting or the MAA Shareholders Meeting, as
applicable, to obtain the approval of Colonials shareholder or MAAs
shareholders, as applicable, which either Colonial or MAA, as applicable,
shall propose to be acted on by its respective shareholders at the
Colonial Shareholders Meeting or the MAA Shareholders Meeting, as applicable.

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this _Section
7.4_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, if either Colonial or MAA, as applicable,
receives a written Acquisition Proposal from any third Person following the
date hereof, and not as a result of a violation of this _Section 7.4_, then
Colonial or MAA, as applicable, or its respective Representatives, may contact
such third Person in writing solely for the purpose of clarifying such
Acquisition Proposal (the "Clarification Request"); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Colonial shall deliver a copy of all Clarification Requests to MAA, and
MAA shall deliver a copy of all Clarification Requests to Colonial, in each
case concurrently with the delivery of such Clarification Requests to any
third Person.

(f) References in this _Section 7.4_ to the Colonial Board or the MAA Board
shall mean the board of trustees of Colonial or the board of directors of MAA,
as applicable, or a duly authorized committee thereof.

(g) Neither party shall submit to the vote of its respective shareholders any
Acquisition Proposal other than the Mergers prior to the termination of this
Agreement.

 

Section 7.5 _Public Announcements_. Except with respect to any Change in
Colonial Recommendation, Change in MAA Recommendation or any action taken by
Colonial or the Colonial Board, or by MAA or the MAA Board, pursuant to and in
accordance with _Section_ _7.4_ , so long as this Agreement is an effect,
the Parties hereto shall consult with each other before issuing any press
release or otherwise making any public statements or filings with respect to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
none of the Parties shall issue any such press release or make any
such public statement or filing prior to obtaining the other Parties consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed);
_provided_ , _however_ , that a Party may, without obtaining the other
Parties consent, issue such press release or make such public statement or
filing as may be required by Law, Order or the applicable rules of any stock
exchange if for any reason it is not reasonably practicable to 

 



94  consult with the other Party before making any public statement with respect
to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
The Parties have agreed upon the form of a joint press release announcing the
Mergers and the execution of this Agreement and shall make such joint press
release no later than one (1) Business Day following the date on which this
Agreement is signed.

 

Section 7.6 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any manager, director,
officer, trustee, agent, or fiduciary may have under any indemnification
agreement or under the Colonial Declaration of Trust, the Colonial Bylaws, the
Colonial LP Agreement or, if applicable, similar organizational documents or
agreements of any Colonial Subsidiary (the "Organizational Documents") from
and after the Parent Merger Effective Time, MAA and MAA LP (the "Indemnifying
Parties"), jointly and severally, shall: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each
person who is at the date hereof, was previously, or during the period from
the date hereof through the date of the Parent Merger Effective Time, serving
as a manager, director, officer, trustee or fiduciary of Colonial or any of
the Colonial Subsidiaries and acting in such capacity (collectively, the
"Indemnified Parties") to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by
applicable Law, as now or hereafter in effect, in connection with any Claim
and any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, Claim Expenses,
judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all
interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or
in respect of any thereof) relating to or resulting from such Claim; and (ii)
promptly pay on behalf of or, within ten (10) Business Days after any request
for advancement, advance to each of the Indemnified Parties, to the fullest
extent authorized or permitted by applicable Law, as now or hereafter in
effect, any Claim Expenses incurred in defending, serving as a witness with
respect to or otherwise participating with respect to any Claim in advance of
the final disposition of such Claim, including payment on behalf of or
advancement to the Indemnified Party of any Claim Expenses incurred by such
Indemnified Party in connection with enforcing any rights with respect to such
indemnification and/or advancement, in each case without the requirement of
any bond or other security, but subject to MAAs receipt of an undertaking by
or on behalf of such Indemnified Party to repay such Claim Expenses if it is
ultimately determined under applicable Laws or any of the Organizational
Documents that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified;
_provided_ , _however_ , that none of the Indemnifying Parties shall be liable
for any amounts paid in settlement effected without MAAs prior written
consent and shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than
one counsel (selected by a plurality of the applicable Indemnified Parties)
for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction with respect to any single
Claim except to the extent an Indemnified Party is advised by counsel that
such Indemnified Party has conflicting interests with one or more other
Indemnified Parties in the outcome of such action (in which event such
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to engage separate counsel, the fees and
expenses for which the Indemnifying Parties shall be liable); _provided_ ,
_further_ , that if, at any time prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the
Partnership Merger Effective Time, any Indemnified Party delivers to MAA or
MAA LP a written notice asserting that indemnification is required in
accordance with this _Section 7.6_ with respect to a Claim, then the
provisions for indemnification contained in this _Section 7.6_ with respect
to such Claim shall survive the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Partnership
Merger Effective Time until

 



95  such time as such Claim is fully and finally resolved. The indemnification
and advancement obligations of the Indemnifying Parties pursuant to this
_Section 7.6(a)_ shall extend to acts or omissions occurring at or before
the Parent Merger Effective Time and any Claim relating thereto (including
with respect to any acts or omissions occurring in connection with the
approval of this Agreement, the Mergers and the consummation of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the consideration and
approval thereof and the process undertaken in connection therewith and any
Claim relating thereto), and all rights to indemnification and advancement
conferred hereunder shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a
director, officer, trustee, employee, agent, or fiduciary of Colonial or any
of the Colonial Subsidiaries after the date hereof and shall inure to the
benefit of such persons heirs, executors and personal and legal
representatives. As used in this _Section 7.6(a)_: (x) the term "Claim" means
any threatened, asserted, pending or completed Action or inquiry, whether
civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or otherwise, including any
arbitration or other alternative dispute resolution mechanism, and whether
instituted by any Party hereto, any Governmental Authority or any other Person
arising out of or pertaining to matters that relate to such Indemnified
Partys duties (including with respect to any acts or omissions occurring in
connection with the approval of this Agreement, the Mergers and the
consummation of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the consideration and approval thereof and the process undertaken in
connection therewith and any Claim relating thereto) or service as a manager,
director, officer, trustee, employee, agent or fiduciary of Colonial or, any
of the Colonial Subsidiaries or, to the extent such person is or was serving
at the request or for the benefit of Colonial or any of the Colonial
Subsidiaries, any other entity or any Employee Benefit Plan maintained by any
of the foregoing at or prior to the Parent Merger Effective Time; and (y) the
term "Claim Expenses" means reasonable attorneys fees and all other
reasonable costs, expenses and obligations (including experts fees, travel
expenses, court costs, retainers, transcript fees, duplicating, printing and
binding costs, as well as telecommunications, postage and courier charges)
paid or incurred in connection with investigating, defending, being a witness
in or participating in (including on appeal), or preparing to investigate,
defend, be a witness in or participate in, any Claim, including any Action
relating to a claim for indemnification or advancement brought by an
Indemnified Party as contemplated in this _Section 7.6_. No Indemnifying
Party shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in, or
seek termination with respect to, any actual or threatened Claim in respect of
which indemnification may be sought by an Indemnified Party hereunder
unless such settlement, compromise or judgment includes an unconditional
release of such Indemnified Parties from all liability arising out of such
Claim. No Indemnified Party shall be liable for any amounts paid in any
settlement effected without its prior express written consent.

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, MAA agrees that all rights to
indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Parent Merger Effective Time now existing in
favor of the current or former trustees, directors, officers, agents or
fiduciaries of Colonial or any of the Colonial Subsidiaries as provided in
the Organizational Documents and indemnification agreements of Colonial shall
survive the Parent Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms. For a period of six (6) years from the Parent
Merger Effective Time, (i) MAA shall and shall cause the MAA Subsidiaries
(including MAA LP) to honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations of MAA
and

 



96  the MAA Subsidiaries (including MAA LP) to the Indemnified Parties under the
Organizational Documents and any indemnification agreement of Colonial or any
Colonial Subsidiary entered into prior to the Partnership Merger Effective
Time and (ii) the MAA charter and bylaws and the limited partnership agreement
of MAA LP and the organizational documents of any applicable Colonial
Subsidiary shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification and limitations on liability of directors and officers than
are set forth in the Organizational Documents, which provisions shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from
the Parent Merger Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely
the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the Parent Merger
Effective Time, were directors, officers, trustees, agents or fiduciaries of
Colonial or any of the Colonial Subsidiaries, unless such modification shall
be required by applicable Law and then only to the minimum extent required by
applicable Law.

(c) Prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time, Colonial shall purchase,
and MAA shall cause to be maintained in full force and effect (and the
obligations under to be honored), during the six (6) year period beginning on
the date of the Partnership Merger Effective Time, a "tail" prepaid insurance
policy or policies (which policy or policies by their respective express terms
shall survive the Mergers), of at least the same coverage and amounts and
containing terms and conditions that are no less favorable to the directors,
officers, agents or fiduciaries of Colonial or any of the Colonial
Subsidiaries as Colonials and the Colonial Subsidiaries existing policy or
policies, for the benefit of the current and former trustees, directors,
officers, agents or fiduciaries of Colonial and each Colonial Subsidiary with
a claims period of six (6) years from the Partnership Merger Effective Time
with respect to directors and officers liability insurance for Claims
arising from facts or events that occurred on or prior to the Partnership
Merger Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the
aggregate premium payable for such "tail" insurance policy for its entire
period exceed an amount per year of coverage equal to 300% of the current
annual premium paid by Colonial for such insurance (such amount being the
"Maximum Premium"). If Colonial is unable to obtain the "tail" insurance
described in the first sentence of this _Section 7.6(c)_ for an amount equal
to or less than the Maximum Premium, Colonial shall be entitled to obtain
as much comparable "tail" insurance as possible for an amount equal to the
Maximum Premium. If Colonial is unable to purchase such "tail" insurance
contemplated in the two preceding sentences, MAA shall, at Colonials
request, purchase, and maintain in full force and effect (and honor the
obligations under), during the six (6) year period beginning on the date of
the Partnership Merger Effective Time, a "tail" insurance policy from one or
more insurance carriers believed to be sound and reputable with respect to
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
of at least the same coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions
no less favorable to directors, officers, agents, or fiduciaries of Colonial
or any of the Colonial Subsidiaries as Colonial or any of the Colonial
Subsidiaries existing policy or policies for the benefit of the current and
former directors, officers, agents or fiduciaries of Colonial or any Colonial
Subsidiary with a claims period of six (6) years from the Partnership Merger
Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall MAA be
required to pay more than the Maximum Premium as the aggregate premium for
such "tail" insurance policies for its entire period, in which case MAA will
obtain as much comparable "tail" insurance as possible for an amount equal to
the Maximum Premium.

 



97 (d) If any of MAA, MAA LP or any of their respective successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with or into any other Person and
shall not be the continuing or surviving company, partnership or other entity
of such consolidation or merger or (ii) liquidates, dissolves or winds-up, or
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of MAA or MAA LP, as applicable, shall assume
the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.6_.

(e) MAA shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys
fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Person in enforcing the
indemnity and other obligations provided in this _Section 7.6_; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such Indemnified Person provides an undertaking to repay such
expenses if it is determined by a final and non-appealable judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction that such Person is not legally entitled to
indemnification under Law.

(f) The provisions of this _Section 7.6_ are intended to be for the express
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person (who are
intended to be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 7.6_), his or her
heirs and his or her personal representatives, shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of MAA and Colonial, and shall not be amended in a
manner that is adverse to the Indemnified Person (including his or her
successors, assigns and heirs) without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Person (including the successors, assigns and heirs) affected
thereby. The exculpation and indemnification provided for by this _Section
7.6_ shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights
to indemnification or exculpation which an Indemnified Person is entitled,
whether pursuant to applicable Law, contract or otherwise.

 

(g) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Colonial or any of the Colonial Subsidiaries for any of their respective
trustees, directors, managers, officers or other employees, it
being understood and agreed that (i) the indemnification provided for in this
_Section 7.6_ is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under
such policies; _(ii)_ the indemnification provided by Colonial, MAA and
MAA LP under this _Section 7.6_ with respect to any Claim shall be
specifically excess of any valid and collectible insurance available to such
Persons for such Claim; and (iii) to the extent that any Indemnified Party
receives any payment with respect to a Claim under any insurance maintained
by Colonial, MAA or MAA LP after payment by Colonial, MAA or MAA LP of any
amounts with respect to indemnification provided for in this _Section 7.6_,
such Indemnified Party shall promptly pay the duplicative portion of such
insurance payment to Colonial, MAA or MAA LP, as applicable.

 

Section 7.7 _Appropriate Action; Consents_

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
Colonial and MAA shall, and shall cause the Colonial Subsidiaries and the MAA
Subsidiaries, respectively, to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist
and cooperate with the other Party in doing, all things

 



98  necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or pursuant to any
contract or agreement to consummate and make effective, as promptly as
practicable, the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including (i) the taking of all actions necessary to cause the
conditions to Closing set forth in _Article VIII_ to be satisfied, (ii) the
obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and
approvals from Persons (other than Governmental Authorities, which are
addressed in _Section 7.3_) necessary in connection with the consummation of
the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the making of all necessary registrations and filings and the taking of all
reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or
to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Authority or other
Persons necessary in connection with the consummation of the Mergers and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) subject to _Section
7.8(e)_, the defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether
judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of
the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by
any court or other Governmental Authority vacated or reversed, so as to
enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible, and (iv) the
execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate
the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to
fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

(b) In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, each of MAA and
Colonial shall use its reasonable best efforts to give (or shall cause the MAA
Subsidiaries or the Colonial Subsidiaries, respectively, use its reasonable
best efforts to give) any notices to third parties, and each of MAA and
Colonial shall use, and cause each of their respective Affiliates to use, its
reasonable best efforts to obtain any third party consents not covered by

Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(a) The Colonial Parties shall give prompt notice to the MAA Parties, and the
MAA Parties shall give prompt notice to the Colonial Parties, of any notice
or other communication received by such Party from any Person alleging that
the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement such that
the failure to obtain such consent would result in a failure of the condition
in _Section 8.1(e)_.

(b) The Colonial Parties shall give prompt notice to the MAA Parties, and the
MAA Parties shall give prompt notice to the Colonial Parties, if (i) any
representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement becomes
untrue or inaccurate such that it would be reasonable to expect that the
applicable closing conditions would be incapable of being satisfied by the
Outside Date or (ii) it fails to comply with or satisfy in any material
respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it under this Agreement such that it would be reasonable to expect that the
applicable closing conditions would be incapable of being satisfied by the
Outside Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall affect
the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the Parties or the

 



99  conditions to the obligations of the Parties under this Agreement. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Colonial Parties shall give prompt notice to the
MAA Parties, and the MAA Parties shall give prompt notice to the Colonial
Parties, if, to the Knowledge of such Party, the occurrence of any state of
facts, change, development, event or condition would cause, or would
reasonably be expected to cause, any of the conditions to Closing set forth
herein not to be satisfied or satisfaction to be materially delayed.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the failure
by the Colonial Parties or the MAA Parties to provide notice under _Section
7.8(a)_, _Section 7.8(b)_ or _Section 7.8(d)_ shall not constitute a breach
of covenant for purposes of  _Section 8.2(b)_ or _Section 8.3(b)_.

(d) Each of the Parties hereto agrees to give prompt written notice to the
other Parties upon becoming aware of the occurrence or impending occurrence of
any event or circumstance relating to it or any of the other Colonial

MAA Parties shall give prompt notice to the Colonial Parties, of any Action
commenced or, to such Partys Knowledge, threatened against, relating to or
involving such Party or any of the other Colonial Subsidiaries or the other
MAA Subsidiaries, respectively, which relates to this Agreement, the Mergers
or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Colonial
Parties shall give the MAA Parties the opportunity to reasonably participate
in the defense and settlement of any litigation against the Colonial Parties
and/or their trustees relating to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, and no such settlement shall be agreed to without MAAs
prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). The MAA Parties shall give the Colonial Parties the
opportunity to reasonably participate in the defense and settlement of any
litigation against the MAA Parties and/or their directors relating to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and no such settlement
shall be agreed to without Colonials prior written consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(a) Each of MAA and Colonial shall use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts (before and, as relevant, after the Parent Merger Effective
Time) to cause the Parent Merger to qualify as a reorganization within the

the opinion of counsel referred to in _Section 8.3(f)_ and MAA shall have
received the opinion of counsel referred to in _Section 8.2(f)_, the Parties
shall treat the Parent Merger as a "reorganization" under Section 368(a) of

Shares or Colonial OP Units, all Transfer Taxes.

(c) The Parties agree and acknowledge that the income, assets, and operations
of MAA LP and certain MAA Subsidiaries will affect the ability of Colonial to
qualify as a REIT for its taxable year ending at the Parent Merger Effective
Time. The Parties shall cooperate (and shall cause their Affiliates, agents,
and advisors to cooperate) and to take such actions (or, as applicable,
refrain from taking actions) as reasonably deemed necessary by Colonial or MAA
to permit Colonial to qualify as a REIT for its taxable year ending at the
Parent Merger Effective Time including, without limiting the foregoing, filing
elections to treat each corporation in which Colonial acquires an interest as

on or prior to the Closing Date of the Parent Merger.

interest in MAA or any MAA Subsidiary as a result of such purchase or
the exercise of such rights at or after the Partnership Merger Effective
Time.

(c) The Colonial Board shall adopt such resolutions or take such other
actions as may be required to provide that with respect to the Colonial ESPP:
(A) participants in the Colonial ESPP ("ESPP Participants") may not increase
their payroll deductions under the Colonial ESPP from those in effect on the
date of this Agreement; (B) no new ESPP Participants may commence
participation in the Colonial ESPP following the date of this Agreement; (C)
all participation in and purchases under the Colonial ESPP shall be suspended
effective as of June 30, 2013 (the "ESPP Suspension Date"), such that the
offering period in effect as of the date of this Agreement will be the final
offering period under the Colonial ESPP until otherwise determined by the MAA
Board after the Partnership Merger Effective Time; and (D) with respect to any
offering period under the Colonial ESPP in effect as of the date of the
Agreement, Colonial shall ensure that such offering period ends at the ESPP
Suspension Date and that each ESPP Participants accumulated contributions for
such offering period are applied to the purchase of Colonial Common Shares in
accordance with the terms of the Colonial ESPP unless the ESPP Participant
has previously withdrawn from such offering period in accordance with the
terms of the Colonial ESPP. Any cash remaining in the Colonial ESPP after
purchases occurring on the ESPP Suspension Date shall be refunded to Colonial
ESPP participants promptly following the ESPP Suspension Date.

(d) If requested by MAA, Colonial shall (or shall cause each applicable
Colonial Subsidiary to) terminate each Colonial Employee Benefit Plan intended
to be qualified within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code as of the day
prior to the Closing Date (but contingent upon the occurrence of the Mergers)
and adopt all required compliance amendments pursuant to written resolutions,
the form and substance of which shall be reasonable satisfactory to MAA.

(a) Prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time, the MAA Board shall adopt
resolutions (subject to and effective immediately following the Partnership
Merger Effective Time), and the MAA Board shall take all other actions
necessary so that, effective immediately following the Partnership Merger
Effective Time, the number of directors that will comprise the full MAA Board
shall be 12 as set forth in, and in accordance with, _Section 2.5_. The
current chairman of the MAA Board shall remain chairman of the MAA Board after
the Partnership Merger Effective Time. After the Partnership Merger Effective
Time, the headquarters of MAA will remain at MAAs current headquarters in
Memphis, Tennessee, and the NYSE ticker symbol of MAA will remain MAAs
current NYSE ticker symbol of "MAA".

 

(b) By written notice to MAA within two weeks from the date hereof, Colonial

benefits, or (ii) such service was not recognized under the corresponding

benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever, (iii) constitute or be treated as
an amendment, modification, adoption, suspension or termination of any
employee benefit plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement of Colonial,
the Colonial Subsidiaries, MAA, or the MAA Subsidiaries, or (iv) alter or
limit the ability of Colonial, the Colonial Subsidiaries, MAA, or the MAA

funds to an account designated by MAA, not later than the consummation

(iii) by either MAA or Colonial pursuant to  _Section 9.1(e)_ because the
MAA Shareholder Approval shall not have been obtained, by either MAA or
Colonial pursuant to _Section 9.1(h)_ because the MAA Partner Approval shall
not have been obtained, or by Colonial pursuant to  _Section 9.1(d)_, then
MAA shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Colonial the Expense Amount (by wire
transfer to an account designated by Colonial) within two (2) Business Days of
such termination;

 

(iv) by either MAA or Colonial pursuant to _Section 9.1(e)_ because the

113  (vi) by Colonial pursuant to _Section 9.1(f)_(ii), then MAA shall pay, or

(ii) neither MAA nor Colonial shall be required to pay any amount in excess of
the sum of the Termination Fee and the Expense Amount, except as set forth in
_Section 9.3(c)_ or in the case of such Partys fraud or intentional breach
of this Agreement.

(c) Each of the Parties hereto acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained
in this _Section 9.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (ii) neither the Termination Fee nor the Expense Amount is
a penalty, and (iii) without these agreements, the Parties would not enter

fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to this _Section 9.3_ and, in
order to obtain such payment, either MAA or Colonial, as the case may be,
commences a suit that results in a judgment against the other Party for the
payment of any amount set forth in this  _Section 9.3_, such paying Party
shall pay the other Party its costs and Expenses in connection with such suit,
together with interest on such amount at the annual rate of the prime rate of
Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date of payment for the period from the date
such payment was required to be made through the date such payment was
actually received, or such lesser rate as is the maximum permitted by
applicable Law

 

(d) Limitations on Payment

(i) If one Party to this Agreement (the "Fee Payor") is required to pay
another Party to this Agreement (the "Fee Payee") an Expense Amount and/or
Termination Fee, such Expense Amount and/or Termination Fee, as applicable,
shall be paid into escrow on the date such payment is required to be paid by
the Fee Payor pursuant to this Agreement by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an escrow 

 



114   account designated in accordance with this _Section 9.3(d)_. In the event
that the Fee Payor is obligated to pay the Fee Payee the Expense Amount and/or
Termination Fee, as applicable, the amount payable to the Fee Payee in any
tax year of the Fee Payee shall not exceed the lesser of (i) the Expense
Amount and/or Termination Fee, as applicable, of the Fee Payee, and (ii) the
sum of (A) the maximum amount that can be paid to the Fee Payee without
causing the Fee Payee to fail to meet the requirements of Section 856(c)(2)
and (3) of the Code for the relevant tax year, determined as if the payment of
such amount did not constitute income described in Sections 856(c)(2) or
856(c)(3) of the Code ("Qualifying Income") and the Fee Payee has income from
unknown sources during such year in an amount equal to 1% of its gross income
which is not Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or anticipated
income which is not Qualifying Income), in each case, as determined by the Fee
Payees independent accountants, plus (B) in the event the Fee Payee receives
either (x) a letter from the Fee Payees counsel indicating that the Fee
Payee has received a ruling from the IRS as described below in this _Section
9.3(d)_ or (y) an opinion from the Fee Payees outside counsel as described
below in this _Section 9.3(d)_, an amount equal to the excess of the Expense
Amount and/or the Termination Fee, as applicable, less the total amount paid
under clause (A) above.

(ii) To secure the Fee Payors obligation to pay these amounts, the Fee Payor
shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash equal to the Expense Amount or the
Termination Fee, as applicable, with an escrow agent selected by the Fee
Payor on such terms (subject to this _Section 9.3(d)_) as shall be mutually
agreed upon by the Fee Payor, the Fee Payee and the escrow agent. The payment
or deposit into escrow of the Expense Amount or the Termination Fee, as
applicable, pursuant to this _Section 9.3(d)_ shall be made at the time the
Fee Payor is obligated to pay the Fee Payee such amount pursuant to _Section
9.3_ by wire transfer. The escrow agreement shall provide that the Expense
Amount or the Termination Fee, as applicable, in escrow or any portion thereof
shall not be released to the Fee Payee unless the escrow agent receives any
one or combination of the following: (i) a letter from the Fee Payees
independent accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid by the
escrow agent to the Fee Payee without causing the Fee Payee to fail to meet
the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as
if the payment of such amount did not constitute Qualifying Income and the
Fee Payee has income from unknown sources during such year in an amount equal
to 1% of its gross income which is not Qualifying Income (in addition to any
known or anticipated income which is not Qualifying Income), in which case
the escrow agent shall release such amount to the Fee Payee, or (ii) a letter
from the Fee Payees counsel indicating that (A) the Fee Payee received a
ruling from the IRS holding that the receipt by the Fee Payee of the Expense
Amount and/or Termination Fee, as applicable, would either constitute
Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of
Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code or (B) the Fee Payees outside counsel
has rendered a legal opinion to the effect that the receipt by the Fee Payee
of the Expense Amount and/or the Termination Fee, as applicable, should either
constitute Qualifying Income or should be excluded from gross income within
the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, in which case the
escrow agent shall release the remainder

 



115   of the Expense Amount and/or the Termination Fee, as applicable, to the Fee
Payee. The Fee Payor agrees to amend this _Section 9.3(d)_ at the reasonable
request of the Fee Payee in order to (i) maximize the portion of the Expense
Amount and/or the Termination Fee, as applicable, that may be distributed to
the Fee Payee hereunder without causing the Fee Payee to fail to meet the
requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, (ii) improve the Fee
Payees chances of securing a favorable ruling described in this _Section
9.3(d)_ or (iii) assist the Fee Payee in obtaining a favorable legal opinion
from its outside counsel as described in this _Section 9.3(d)_. Any amount
of the Expense Amount and/or the Termination Fee, as applicable, that remains
unpaid as of the end of a taxable year shall be paid as soon as possible
during the following taxable year, subject to the foregoing limitations of
this _Section 9.3(d)_, _provided_ , that the obligation of the Fee Payor to
pay the unpaid portion of the Expense Amount and/or the Termination Fee, as
applicable, shall terminate on the December 31 following the date which is
five (5) years from the date of this Agreement. Any costs and expenses of the
escrow agent shall be borne solely by the Fee Payee.

 

Any payment due to a Party described in _Section 9.3(c)_ shall be subject to
the same limitations on payment as set forth in this _Section 9.3(d)_.

(e) Except as set forth in this _Section 9.3_, all fees and expenses incurred
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be paid by the Party incurring such expenses whether or not the Mergers
are consummated.

Section 9.4 _Amendment_. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, this
Agreement may be amended by the Parties hereto, by action taken or authorized
by the Colonial Board or the MAA Board, as applicable, at any time before or
after approval of the matters presented in connection with the Mergers by the
shareholders of MAA, shareholders of Colonial or holders of MAA OP Units, but,
after any such approval, no amendment shall be made which by Law requires
further approval by such shareholders or holders without such further approval
by such shareholders or holders. This Agreement may not be amended except by
an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the Parties hereto. 

Section 9.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Partnership Merger
Effective Time, the Parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by the
Colonial Board or the MAA Board, as applicable, may, to the extent legally
allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
other acts of the other Party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of the other Party contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a
Party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth
in a written instrument signed on behalf of such Party. The failure of a Party
to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not
constitute a waiver of those rights. No single or partial exercise of any
right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder shall preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or
privilege. Any waiver shall be effective only in the specific instance and
for the specific purpose for which given and shall not constitute a waiver to
any subsequent or other exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege
hereunder.

Section 10.3 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and
delivered to each other Party (including by means of electronic delivery), it
being understood that the Parties need not sign the same

 



118   counterpart. Signatures to this Agreement transmitted by facsimile
transmission, by electronic mail in "portable document format" (".pdf"), or by
any other electronic means intended to preserve the original graphic and
pictorial appearance of a document, will have the same effect as physical
delivery of the paper document bearing the original signature.

 

Section 10.4 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
(including the schedules, documents and the instruments referred to herein)
constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, between the Parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof, other than the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall
survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement. Nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any person
(other than the Parties hereto) any right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement except for (i) the rights,
benefits and remedies granted to the Indemnified Parties under _Section 7.6_,
(ii) after the Partnership Merger Effective Time, the rights of the holders of
MAA OP Units to receive the consideration set forth in _Article III_ in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement; (iii) after the Parent
Merger Effective Time, the rights of the holders of Colonial Common Shares to
receive the Merger Consideration, and the rights of holders of Colonial
Options and Colonial Restricted Share Awards to receive the consideration
specified in _Article III_ in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement, and (iv) the right of Colonial and MAA, on behalf of its
respective shareholders, to pursue claims for damages and other relief,
including equitable relief, for the other Parties intentional breach of this
Agreement, to the extent recovery is otherwise permitted under  _Section
9.2_. The representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an
allocation among the Parties of risks associated with particular matters
regardless of the knowledge of any of the Parties. Accordingly, Persons other
than the Parties may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this
Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date
of this Agreement or as of any other date.

 

Section 10.5 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is
invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability and,
unless the effect of such invalidity or unenforceability would prevent the
Parties from realizing the major portion of the economic benefits of the
Mergers that they currently anticipate obtaining therefrom, shall not render
invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement
or affect the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of
this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement
is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be
only so broad as is enforceable.

 

Section 10.6 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations of the Parties hereunder shall be assigned by any of
the Parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the
prior written consent of the other Parties, and any attempt to make any such
assignment without such consent shall be null and void. Subject to
the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors
and permitted assigns.

 



119  Section 10.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all claims or causes of
actions (whether at Law, in contract or in tort) that may be based upon,
arise out of or related to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to agreements entered into
and performed entirely therein by residents thereof, without regard to any
provisions relating to choice of laws among different jurisdictions, except
that (i) the laws of the State of Alabama (including the provisions of the
AREITL and the ABNEC applicable to the Parent Merger) will apply to the Parent
Merger and to the discharge of the fiduciary duties of the Colonial Board or
any committee thereof in connection herewith, and (ii) the laws of the State
of Tennessee (including the provisions of the TBCA applicable to the Parent
Merger) will apply to the Parent Merger and the Partnership Merger and to the
discharge of the fiduciary duties of the MAA Board or any committee thereof
in connection herewith.

Section 10.8 _Specific Performance; Venue_. The Parties agree
that irreparable damage would occur if any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be
an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that, prior to the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_ , the Parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the
Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the
State of Delaware (unless the Delaware Court of Chancery shall decline to
accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, in which case, in any federal
court within the State of Delaware), and each Party hereto hereby waives any
requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such
remedy, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at Law or in equity. Each of the Parties irrevocably agrees that any legal
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by
any other Party or its successors or assigns shall be brought and determined
in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom
within the State of Delaware (unless the Delaware Court of Chancery shall
decline to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, in which case, in any
federal court within the State of Delaware), and each of the Parties hereby
irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts for
itself and with respect to its property, generally and unconditionally, with
regard to any such action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the Parties agrees
not to commence any action, suit or proceeding relating thereto except in the
courts described above in Delaware, other than actions in any court
of competent jurisdiction to enforce any judgment, decree or award rendered
by any such court in Delaware as described herein. Each of the Parties further
agrees that notice as provided herein shall constitute sufficient service of
process and the Parties further waive any argument that such service is
insufficient. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion or as a defense,
counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (a) any
claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the courts in
Delaware as described herein for any reason, (b) that it or its property is
exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process
commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior
to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution
of judgment or otherwise)

 



120   and (c) that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in any such court is brought
in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is
improper, or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be
enforced in or by such courts.

Section 10.9  _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY HERETO (A)
CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY
OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR
PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT
AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT,
BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION
10.9_.

Section 10.10 _Authorship_. The Parties agree that the terms and language of
this Agreement are the result of negotiations between the Parties and their
respective advisors and, as a result, there shall be no presumption that any
ambiguities in this Agreement shall be resolved against any Party. Any
controversy over construction of this Agreement shall be decided without
regard to events of authorship or negotiation.

2\. _The Parent Merger_. As of the Parent Merger Effective Time (as defined
herein), Colonial shall be merged with and into MAA, with MAA being
the surviving business entity in the merger. The Parent Merger will have the
effects set forth in the AREITL and the TBCA.

 



2 3\. _Effective Time of the Parent Merger_. The Parent Merger shall become
effective upon the later of such time as the articles of merger have been
accepted for record by the Office of the Secretary of State for the State of
Alabama or the effective time of the Parent Merger in Tennessee (the "Parent
Merger Effective Time"). 

4\. _Effects of Merger on Colonial Common Shares_. At the Parent Merger
Effective Time and by virtue of the Parent Merger and without any further
action on the part of MAA, Colonial, or the holders of any securities of MAA
or Colonial:

(a) _Cancellation of Certain Colonial Common Shares_. Each Colonial Common
Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Parent Merger Effective
Time that is held by MAA, any MAA Subsidiary or any wholly owned Colonial
Subsidiary shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be retired
and shall cease to exist, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

(b) _Conversion of Certain Colonial Common Shares_. Except as indicated
otherwise herein, each Colonial Common Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Parent Merger Effective Time (other than shares to be
cancelled in accordance with _Section 4(a)_ and any Dissenting Shares (as
defined in and to the extent provided in _Section 4(c)_)), shall
automatically be converted into the right to receive [0.360] (as the same may
be adjusted pursuant to _Section 4(g)_, the "Exchange Ratio") validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of MAA Common Stock ( the "Merger
Consideration"), without interest.

(c) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
Colonial Common Shares that are outstanding immediately prior to the Parent
Merger Effective Time and that are held by any Person who is entitled to
dissent and properly perfects such Persons dissenters rights of appraisal
with respect to such Colonial Common Shares (the "Dissenting Shares") pursuant
to, and who complies in all respects with, Section 10A-2-13.01 et. seq. of
the ABNEC shall not be converted into shares of MAA Common Stock as provided
in _Section 4(b)_, but rather the holders of Dissenting Shares shall be
entitled to payment by MAA of the fair value (as provided in Section
10A-2-13.01 et. seq. of the ABNEC ("ABNEC Article 13")) of such Dissenting
Shares in accordance with ABNEC Article 13; _provided_ , _however_ , that if
any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or
lose the right to dissent under ABNEC Article 13, then the right of such
holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Dissenting Shares shall
cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of
the Parent Merger Effective Time into, and shall have become exchangeable
solely for the right to receive, shares of MAA Common Stock as provided in
_Section 4(b)_.

(d) _Fractional Colonial Common Shares_. No certificate or scrip representing
fractional shares of MAA Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for
exchange of certificates or the transfer of book-entry shares registered in
the transfer books of Colonial, and such fractional share interests shall not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of
MAA. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, each holder of Colonial
Common Shares converted pursuant to the Parent Merger who would otherwise have
been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of MAA Common Stock shall
receive, in lieu thereof, cash, without interest, in an amount equal to
such fractional part of a share of MAA Common Stock multiplied by the volume
weighted average price of MAA Common Stock for the ten (10) trading days
immediately prior to the Closing Date, starting with the opening of trading on
the first trading day to the closing of the second to last trading day prior
to the Closing Date, as reported by Bloomberg (the "Fractional Share
Consideration").

 



3 (e) _Conversion of Restricted Colonial Common Shares_. Any and all Colonial
Common Shares subject to Colonial Restricted Share Awards that are converted
into the right to receive MAA Common Stock pursuant to _Section 4(b)_ shall
be converted into the right to receive shares of MAA Common Stock that are
subject to the same vesting and forfeiture conditions and other terms and
conditions as are applicable to the Colonial Restricted Share Award
immediately prior to the Parent Merger Effective Time.

(f) _Conversion of Colonial Options_. Each outstanding Colonial Option,
whether or not exercisable at the Parent Merger Effective Time, shall be
assumed by MAA by virtue of the Parent Merger and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof. Subject to, and in accordance with, the terms of
the applicable Colonial Equity Incentive Plan and award agreement or other
agreement or other document evidencing Colonial Options, from and after the
Parent Merger Effective Time, each Colonial Option so assumed by MAA pursuant
to the Parent Merger will otherwise continue to have, and be subject to, the
same terms and conditions (including vesting schedule) as were applicable to
the corresponding Colonial Option immediately prior to the Parent Merger
Effective Time as set forth in the applicable Colonial Equity Incentive Plan
(including any applicable award agreement, other agreement or other document
evidencing such Colonial Option) immediately prior to the Parent Merger
Effective Time, except that, from and after the Parent Merger Effective Time,
(A) each Colonial Option, when exercisable, will be exercisable for that
number of whole shares of MAA Common Stock equal to the product of the number
of Colonial Common Shares that were subject to such Colonial Option
immediately prior to the Parent Merger Effective Time multiplied by the
Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of
MAA Common Stock and (B) the per share exercise price for the shares of MAA
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed Colonial Option will be
equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price of each
Colonial Common Share subject to such assumed Colonial Option by the Exchange
Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent.

(g) _Adjustments_. If at any time during the period between the date of this
Plan of Merger and the effective time of the Partnership Merger (the
"Partnership Merger Effective Time"), Colonial should split, combine or
otherwise reclassify the Colonial Common Shares, or make a dividend or other
distribution in Colonial Common Shares (including any dividend or other
distribution of securities convertible into Colonial Common Shares), or engage
in a reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or exchange or other
like change, then (without limiting any other rights of the other Parties
hereunder), the Exchange Ratio shall be ratably adjusted to reflect fully the
effect of any such change. If at any time during the period between the date
of this Plan of Merger and the Partnership Merger Effective Time, MAA should
split, combine or otherwise reclassify the MAA Common Stock, or make a
distribution in shares of MAA Common Stock (including any dividend or other
distribution of securities convertible into MAA Common Stock), or engage in a
reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or exchange or other like
change (without limiting any other rights of the other Parties hereunder),
then the Exchange Ratio shall be ratably adjusted to reflect any such change.

 



4 (h) _Withholding Rights_. The Parties, Colonial LP, MAA LP, the respective
affiliates of the foregoing and the bank or trust company appointed by MAA to
act as exchange agent for the payment and delivery of the Merger Consideration
and the Fractional Share Consideration, as applicable, shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration and Fractional Share
Consideration (and any other consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Plan of Merger or deemed paid for tax purposes), such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to such payments under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or any other provision of state,
local or foreign law. Any such amounts so deducted and withheld shall be paid
over to the applicable governmental authority in accordance with applicable
law and shall be treated for all purposes of this Plan of Merger as having
been paid to the person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

(i) _Governing Documents_. The charter and bylaws of MAA as in effect
immediately prior to the Parent Merger Effective Time shall be the charter and
bylaws of MAA immediately following the Parent Merger Effective Time, until
further amended in accordance with applicable law.

(j) _Termination; Abandonment_. At any time prior to the Parent Merger
Effective Time, this Plan of Merger may be terminated or abandoned by the
Board of Directors of MAA or the Board of Trustees of Colonial. In the event
of such termination or abandonment, this Plan of Merger shall become void
and neither MAA nor Colonial nor their respective shareholders, trustees,
directors or officers shall be liable in respect to such termination or
abandonment.

5\. _Effects of Merger on MAA Common Stock_. The presently outstanding MAA
Common Stock shall remain outstanding, and the present holders of the MAA
Common Stock shall retain their present rights therein.

6\. _Counterparts_. This Plan of Merger may be executed in counterparts, all
of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and
delivered to each other Party, it being understood that the Parties need not
sign the same counterpart.

 

7\. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Plan of Merger, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any person (other than the
