 (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with  _Section 9.01_, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) commence the Offer to purchase all of the Shares at the Per Share Amount as promptly as practicable after the date hereof but no later than six (6) Business Days after the date hereof. The obligation of Purchaser to accept for payment and pay for all Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer will be subject to the satisfaction of each of the conditions set forth in  _Annex A_. Purchaser expressly reserves the right to waive any such condition, to increase the price per Share payable in the Offer and to make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer, subject, in each case, to the provisions of _Section 2.01(b)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall not be 

   ##### 

  

    

required to commence the Offer if, immediately prior to such commencement,
anything shall have occurred that gives rise to a right of (1) Parent to
terminate this Agreement or (2) Purchaser, pursuant to clause (a)(4) or (b)
of _Annex A_ hereto, to not accept for payment or pay for the Shares;
_provided_ , that for purposes of clause (2) above, references to any other
date in clause (a)(4) and (b) of _Annex A_ shall be deemed to be the date of
the commencement of the Offer; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if Purchaser
has not commenced the Offer in accordance with clause (1) or (2) above
within forty-five (45) days of the date hereof, the Company shall have the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01(e)_. 

   

 (b) Purchaser shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, (1) decrease the Per Share Amount or change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (2) reduce the maximum number of Shares to be purchased in the Offer, (3) impose conditions to the Offer in addition to those set forth in _Annex A_ , (4) modify, waive or change the Minimum Condition, (5) amend or modify any other term of the Offer in a manner adverse to the Companys shareholders, or (6) extend the Offer in a manner other than in accordance with this Agreement. 

   

 (c) Purchaser shall from time to time extend the Offer beyond the initial scheduled expiration date, which shall be twenty (20) Business Days following the commencement of the Offer, for five (5) Business Days in each instance (or for such different period to which the Company agrees in its reasonable discretion) if, at the scheduled expiration of the Offer (or any extension thereof), any of the conditions to Purchasers obligation to accept Shares for payment is not satisfied or waived. In addition, Purchaser shall extend the Offer for any period or periods required by applicable Law or applicable interpretations or positions of the SEC or its staff. Further, if all of the conditions to the Offer are satisfied or waived but the number of Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn, together with the Shares held by Parent and Purchaser, if any, is less than ninety percent (90%) of the Fully Diluted Shares, then upon the expiration date of the Offer (or any extension thereof), Purchaser may provide "subsequent offering periods," as such term is defined in, and in accordance with, Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act, for an aggregate period not to exceed twenty (20) Business Days (for all such extensions) and, if such subsequent offering periods are provided, Purchaser shall (1) give the required notice of such subsequent offering period and (2) immediately accept and promptly pay for all Shares tendered as of such applicable expiration date. 

   

 (d) Promptly upon the satisfaction or waiver (subject to _Section 2.01(b)_ ) by Purchaser of the conditions set forth in _Annex A_ , Purchaser shall accept for payment and pay for all Shares as promptly as practicable after the expiration date of the Offer (or any extension thereof) (the date of acceptance for payment, the " _Acceptance Date_ "). On or prior to the date that Purchaser becomes obligated to pay for Shares pursuant to the Offer, Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Purchaser the funds necessary to pay for all Shares that Purchaser becomes so obligated to pay pursuant to the Offer. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (e) Purchaser shall pay the Per Share Amount (less any Taxes required by applicable Law to be withheld) net to the seller in cash, without interest, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer. Purchaser shall pay for all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn promptly following the acceptance of Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence and subject to the applicable rules of the SEC and the terms and conditions of the Offer, Purchaser expressly reserves the right to delay payment for Shares in order to comply in whole or in part with applicable Laws. Any such delay shall be effected in compliance with Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act. If the payment is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate formerly evidencing Shares is registered on the stock transfer books of the Company, it will be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered be endorsed properly or otherwise be in proper form for transfer, and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid all transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Per Share Amount to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall have established to the satisfaction of Purchaser that such Taxes either have been paid or are inapplicable. 

   

 (f) As promptly as reasonably practicable on the date of commencement of the Offer, Purchaser shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO (together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Schedule TO_") with respect to the Offer. The Schedule TO will contain or incorporate by reference an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to Purchase_ ") and forms of the related letter of transmittal and other customary documents (the Schedule TO, the Offer to Purchase and such other documents, together with all supplements and amendments thereto, being referred to herein collectively as the " _Offer Documents_ "). Parent, Purchaser and the Company agree to correct promptly any information provided by any of them for use in the Offer Documents that shall have become false or misleading, and Parent and Purchaser further agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule TO, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC, and the other Offer Documents, as so corrected, to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable U.S. federal securities Laws to give effect to the Offer. Purchaser shall give the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the Offer Documents and all amendments and supplements thereto prior to their filing with the SEC. In addition, Parent and Purchaser shall provide the Company and its counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall inform them of any oral comments, that Parent, Purchaser or their counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents promptly after receipt of such comments, and any written or oral responses thereto. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review any such written responses and Parent and Purchaser shall give due consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Company and its counsel. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (g) In the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 9.01_ prior to the Acceptance Date, Parent and Purchaser shall promptly terminate the Offer without accepting any Shares previously tendered and Purchaser shall promptly return, and shall cause any depository acting on behalf of Purchaser to return, all tendered Shares to the registered holders thereof.

The Company shall give Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the Schedule 14D-9 and all amendments and supplements thereto prior to their filing with the SEC. In addition, the Company shall provide Parent and Purchaser and their counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall inform them of any oral comments, that the Company or its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of such comments, and any written or oral responses thereto. Parent and Purchaser and their counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review any such written responses and the Company shall give due consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent and Purchaser and their counsel. 

   

 (c) The Company shall cause its transfer agent to furnish Purchaser with mailing labels or electronic files containing the names and addresses of all record holders of Shares and with security position listings of Shares held in stock depositories, each as of a recent date, together with all other available listings and computer files containing names, addresses and security position listings of record holders and beneficial owners of Shares. The Company shall furnish Purchaser with such additional information, including updated listings and computer files of the Companys shareholders, mailing labels and security position listings, and such other assistance in disseminating the Offer Documents to holders of Shares, as Parent or Purchaser may reasonably request, all at Purchasers expense. The Company, Parent and Purchaser 

   ##### 

  

    

agree to disseminate the Offer Documents and the Schedule 14D-9 to the holders
of Shares together in the same mailing or other form of distribution. Subject
to the requirements of applicable Law, and except for such steps as are
necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents
necessary to consummate the Offer or the Merger, Parent and Purchaser shall
treat the information contained in such labels, listings and files as
"Evaluation Materials" pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement. 

  

 2.03 Top-Up Option. 

   

 (a) _Grant of Top-Up Option_.

The Top-Up Option may be exercised, in whole but not in part, at any one time on or after the Acceptance Date and prior to the earlier to occur of (1) the Effective Time and (2) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article IX_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the obligation of the Company to deliver Top-Up Option Shares upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option is subject to the conditions that (A) no Law shall prohibit, or require any action, consent, approval, authorization or Permit of, or action by, filing with or notification to any Governmental Authority in connection with, the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the delivery of the Top-Up Option Shares in respect of such exercise, (B) the number of Top-Up Option Shares issued pursuant to the Top-Up Option shall in no event exceed the number of authorized and unissued Shares not otherwise reserved for issuance for outstanding Company Stock Options or other obligations of the Company, and (C) Purchaser has accepted for payment and paid for all Shares validly tendered in the Offer and not validly withdrawn. 

   

 (b) _Exercise of Top-Up Option_. Upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option in accordance with _Section 2.03(a)_, Purchaser shall so notify the Company and shall set forth in such notice (1) the number of Shares expected to be owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent or Purchaser immediately preceding the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares (2) a place and time for the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares and (3) Purchasers agreement to (and Parents agreement to cause Purchaser to) consummate the Merger in accordance with the NJBCA as contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable following issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares.

At the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, Purchaser shall pay the Company the aggregate purchase price required to be paid for the Top-Up Option Shares pursuant to this _Section 2.03_, and the Company shall cause to be issued 

   ##### 

  

    

to Purchaser a Certificate representing the Top-Up Option Shares, which may
include any legends required by applicable securities Laws, or, if the
Company does not then have certificated shares, the applicable number of
uncertificated shares represented by book-entry. At its election, Purchaser
may pay the aggregate purchase price payable for the Top-Up Option Shares
either (A) in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated by the Company or (B) by executing and delivering to the
Company a promissory note in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
the Company having a principal amount equal to the balance of the aggregate
purchase price for the Top-Up Option Shares and a per annum interest rate of
one hundred thirty percent (130%) of the short-term AFR applicable to notes
issued on the date that such promissory note is issued, which promissory note
shall be payable in full with accrued interest on the third (3rd) anniversary
of the date such promissory note is issued and shall be full recourse
against NDI and Purchaser, but shall not be recourse to any extent to Parent
(the " _Top-Up Option Note_ "). The Parties shall cooperate to ensure that
any issuance of Top-Up Option Shares is accomplished consistent with all
applicable Laws. 

   

 (c) _Securities Law Compliance_. Parent and Purchaser understand that the Shares that Purchaser may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be registered under the Securities Act, and will be issued in reliance upon an exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Parent and Purchaser represent and warrant to the Company that Purchaser is, and will be upon any exercise of the Top-Up Option, an "accredited investor" (as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act). Purchaser agrees that any Top-Up Option Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will be acquired for the purpose of investment and not with a view to or for resale in connection with any distribution thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act. In the event that the Top-Up Option Note is executed and delivered, the Company understands that the Top-Up Option Note will not be registered under the Securities Act, and will be issued in reliance upon an exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. The Company represents and warrants to Purchaser that the Company is, and will be upon the execution and delivery of the Top-Up Option Note, an "accredited investor" (as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act). The Company agrees that the delivery of the Top-Up Option Note will be for the purpose of investment and not with a view to or for resale in connection with any distribution thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act. 

   

 (d) _Adjustment upon Changes in Capitalization_. In the event of any change in the number of shares of outstanding Company Common Stock by reason of any stock dividend, stock split, recapitalization, combination, exchange of shares, merger, consolidation, reorganization or the like or any other change in the corporate or capital structure of the Company that would have the effect of diluting Purchasers rights under the Top-Up Option, the number of Top-Up Option Shares and the Top-Up Share Price will be adjusted appropriately so as to restore to Purchaser its rights hereunder with respect to the Top-Up Option as the same exists as of the date of this Agreement.

At the Effective Time, all Shares that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this _Section 3.07(a)_ will no longer be outstanding and will be canceled and will cease to exist, and each holder of a Certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such Shares will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration in exchange therefor upon the surrender of such Certificate. 

   

 (b) Each issued and outstanding share of Purchaser Common Stock will be converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, $.01 par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 3.08 Exchange of Certificates; Payment of the Merger Consideration. 

   

 (a) _Appointment of Disbursing Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with a disbursing agent appointed by Parent with the consent of the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) (the " _Disbursing Agent_ ") cash in an amount sufficient to allow the Disbursing Agent to make all payments that may be required pursuant to this _Article III_. Parent shall be obligated to, from time to time, deposit any additional funds necessary to make all payments that may be required by this _Article III_. Any such cash remaining in the possession of the Disbursing Agent twelve (12) months after the Effective Time (together with any earnings in respect thereof) will be delivered by the Disbursing Agent to Parent, and any holder of Certificates who has not theretofore exchanged such Certificates pursuant to this _Article III_ will thereafter be entitled to look exclusively to Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation, and only as a general creditor thereof, for the consideration to which such holder may be entitled upon exchange of such Certificates pursuant to this _Article III_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Disbursing Agent nor any Party will be liable to any holder of Certificates for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, but in no event more than two (2) Business Days thereafter, Parent shall cause the Disbursing Agent to mail or deliver to each Person who was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of Company Common Stock, a form of letter of transmittal (which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificates will pass, only upon proper delivery of such Certificates to the Disbursing Agent) containing instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates in exchange for the consideration to which such Person is entitled pursuant to this _Article III_. Upon surrender to the Disbursing Agent of a Certificate for cancellation together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of such Certificate will promptly be provided in exchange therefor cash in the amount to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this _Article III_, and the Certificate so surrendered will forthwith be canceled. No interest will accrue or be paid with respect to any consideration to be delivered upon surrender of Certificates. 

   

 (c) _Transfer to Holder other than Existing Holder_. If any cash payment is to be made in a name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will be a condition of such payment that the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the making of such payment in a name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or required for any other reason relating to such holder or requesting Person, or shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Disbursing Agent that such Tax has been paid or is inapplicable. 

   

 (d) _Transfers_. There will be no transfers registered at or after the Effective Time on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of Company Common Stock or Certificates that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation or the Disbursing Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation or the Disbursing Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Surviving Corporation or the Disbursing Agent shall, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, pay or cause to be paid the consideration deliverable in respect of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate pursuant to this  _Article III_. 

  

 3.09 Stock Incentives. 

   

 (a) Parent shall not assume or otherwise replace any options to purchase Company Common Stock granted under the Company Stock Plans (each, a " _Company Stock Option_ ") in connection with the Transactions. Upon the terms and subject to the 

   ##### 

  

    

conditions set forth in this Agreement, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Parent, Purchaser, the Company or the holders of
Company Stock Options, each Company Stock Option outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time will be canceled automatically at the
Effective Time and will thereafter, in consideration for the cancellation,
represent only the right to receive an amount of cash, if any,
without interest, equal to the product of (1) the excess, if any, of (A) the
Per Share Amount over (B) the exercise price per share of the Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Stock Option (it being understood and agreed
that such exercise price shall not actually be paid to the Company by the
holder of a Company Stock Option, and further understood and agreed that with
respect to each Company Stock Option for which the exercise price exceeds the
Per Share Amount, such Company Stock Option shall be cancelled and
extinguished without consideration) and (2) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Company Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time, regardless of the vested status of
such Company Stock Option. 

   

 (b) All amounts payable pursuant to this _Section 3.09_ will be subject to any required withholding of Taxes and shall be paid by Parent (or, at Parents direction, by the Company) at or as soon as practicable following the Effective Time, but in no event later than five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time, without interest. To the extent that amounts are deducted or withheld for Taxes, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid. 

   

 (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the Company Stock Plans) shall take all action necessary to effect the cancellation and, in consideration for the cancellation, cash-out of Company Stock Options upon the Effective Time, including taking such actions, at the reasonable request of Parent, which are necessary or appropriate to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this _Section 3.09_. Any notices, consents or other communications to holders of Company Stock Options will be subject to the review and approval of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

   

 (d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board or an appropriate committee of non-employee directors shall adopt a resolution consistent with the interpretative guidance of the SEC so that the disposition of Shares or Company Stock Options pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger by any officer or director of the Company who is a covered person of the Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act will be an exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act. 

  

 3.10 2008 Consultant Option. If the 2008 consultant option to purchase Shares referred to in _Section 3.10_ of the Disclosure Schedule (the " _2008 Consultant Option_ ") is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, it shall be canceled automatically at the 

   ##### 

  

    

Effective Time and shall thereafter represent only the right to receive an
amount of cash, if any, equal to the product of (1) the excess, if any, of
(A) the Per Share Amount over (B) the exercise price per share of such 2008
Consultant Option and (2) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such 2008 Consultant Option immediately prior to its
cancellation, regardless of the vested status of such 2008 Consultant
Option.

been maintained in good standing with, and is approved by, applicable
Governmental Authorities to the extent such approval is available; and (4) to

 (a) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or the earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, the Company will (and will cause its Subsidiaries to) afford Parent and Parents Representatives such access during normal business hours to the books, records (including Tax Returns and work papers of independent auditors), employees, Representatives and properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that such access shall not unreasonably disrupt the operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. All requests for such access shall be made to such agents of the Company as the Company may designate, who will be solely responsible for coordinating all such requests and all access permitted hereunder. Neither Parent, Purchaser nor any of their respective Representatives shall contact any of the employees, customers, landlords, licensors or suppliers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the Transactions, whether in person or by telephone, mail or other means of communication, without the specific prior authorization of such agents of the Company as the Company may designate, not to be unreasonably withheld. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will be required to afford access or disclose information that would jeopardize attorney-client privilege, contravene any binding agreement with any third party or violate any Law.

   ##### 

  

   

 (b) Each Party will hold any information provided in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions confidential and any such information will be deemed to be "Evaluation Materials" under the Confidentiality Agreement.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the previous sentence, prior to the Acceptance Date, the Company may furnish information to, or enter into discussions or negotiations with, any Person that has made an Acquisition Proposal if, and only to the extent that: (A) the receipt of such Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach of (1) clause (1) of the first sentence of this _Section 6.08(a)_ or (2) any other provision of this  _Section 6.08_ in any material respect; (B) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or the Company Board, after consulting with the Companys outside legal and financial advisors, determines in good faith that (1) such Acquisition Proposal, after furnishing such information and entering into such discussions or negotiations, could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal and (2) the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to the Companys shareholders under applicable Law; and (C) prior to furnishing such information, the Company receives from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement on customary terms that are no less favorable to the Company than the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Company may, after making the determination described in clause (B) above, enter into discussions or negotiations solely with respect to entering into such confidentiality agreement and will not be deemed to be in breach of this _Section 6.08_ as a result thereof. 

   

 (b) From the date hereof until the Closing or the earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Company shall promptly, but in any event within twenty-four (24) hours, notify Parent following receipt by the Company of any Acquisition Proposal, the material terms thereof and material conditions thereto and the identity of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal, as well as any material modification of or amendment thereto, or of any _bona fide_ communication by any 

   ##### 

  

    

Person that affirmatively states that it relates to, or could lead to, or that
any party is contemplating, a potential Acquisition Proposal, including the
identity of the Person making or on whose behalf such communication was made
and the other material facts of such communication, and the Company will keep
Parent reasonably apprised of any material developments, discussions and
negotiations with respect to such Acquisition Proposal or other
communication. 

   

 (c) The Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall promptly request that all confidential information previously provided to any such Persons be returned or destroyed in accordance with the confidentiality agreements in effect with such Persons that remain in effect as of the date of this Agreement and, subject to the second sentence of _Section 6.08(a)_ with respect to any Acquisition Proposal received after the date hereof and compliance with the procedures provided therein, shall deny access to any data room (virtual or actual) containing any confidential information to all such Persons. 

   

 (d) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.08_ prohibits or will be construed as prohibiting the Company or the Company Board from (1) taking and disclosing to the Companys shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or (2) making any disclosure to the Companys shareholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board after consultation with outside counsel, failure to make such disclosure would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law. 

   

 (e) Except as otherwise permitted hereby, from the date hereof until the Closing or the earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (1) approve or accept any Acquisition Proposal, (2) cause or permit the Company to agree to or enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, memorandum of understanding, term sheet, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, license agreement, stock purchase agreement or similar agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or (3) fail to make, withdraw, modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent or Purchaser, or agree or publicly propose to withdraw, modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent or Purchaser, the Company Board Recommendation, or recommend, or agree or publicly propose to recommend, an Acquisition Proposal, or announce that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal (each such action described in clause (3) being an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ "). 

   

 (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.08_, at any time prior to the Acceptance Date, the Company Board may, following receipt of an Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal, make an Adverse Recommendation Change or cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant 

   ##### 

  

    

to _Section 9.01(i)_ so as to concurrently with such termination enter into
a definitive agreement providing for the transactions contemplated by such
Superior Proposal, but only if (1) the Company promptly notifies Parent, in
writing, at least two (2) Business Days before taking such action, of its
intention to do so, attaching the most current version of the proposed
agreement under which such Acquisition Proposal is proposed to be consummated
or, where no such copy is available, a reasonably detailed description of
such Acquisition Proposal, and the identity of the third party making the
Acquisition Proposal, and (2) Parent does not make, within three (3) Business
Days (or two (2) Business Days in the case of any subsequent offer) after its
receipt of that written notification, an offer that the Company Board
determines, in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial and
legal advisors, is more favorable to the Companys shareholders than
such Acquisition Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any amendment
to the financial terms or other material terms of such Acquisition Proposal
shall require a new written notification from the Company, provided that a
two (2) Business Day period shall apply under clause (2) of this _Section
6.08(f)_). During any three (3) Business Day (or two (2) Business Day, in the
case of subsequent offers) period prior to its effecting an Adverse
Recommendation Change pursuant to this _Section 6.08(f)_ or
termination pursuant to _Section 9.01(i)_, the Company shall, and shall
cause its Representatives to, negotiate in good faith with Parent and its
Representatives regarding any revisions to the terms of the Transactions
proposed by Parent. 

  

 6.09 Takeover Laws and Provisions. From the date of this Agreement until the Closing or the earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, no Party will take any action that would cause the Transactions (a) to be subject to requirements imposed by any Takeover Law and each of them will take all necessary steps within its control to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the Transactions from, or if necessary challenge the validity or applicability of, any applicable Takeover Law, as now or hereafter in effect and (b) not to comply with any Takeover Provisions and each of them will take all necessary steps within its control to make such Transactions comply with (or continue to comply with) any Takeover Provisions. 

  

 6.10 No Financing Condition. For the avoidance of doubt, the obligation of Parent and Purchaser to close the Transactions is not conditioned upon the consummation of any financing transaction and, accordingly, the parties hereto agree that a failure of Parent and Purchaser to close the Transactions resulting from a failure or inability to consummate any financing transaction constitutes a breach for purposes of this Agreement. 

  

 6.11 Rule 14d-10(d)(1) Matters. If the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into, adopts, amends, modifies or terminates any Company Arrangement, all such amounts payable under such Company Arrangement shall (a) be paid or granted as compensation for past services performed, future services to be performed, or future services to be refrained from being performed, by the Covered Securityholders (and matters incidental thereto) and (b) 

   ##### 

  

    

shall not be calculated based on the number of Shares tendered or to be
tendered into the Offer by the applicable Covered Securityholder. 

  

 6.12 FIRPTA. At or prior to the Acceptance Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent a statement in accordance with the requirements of Treasury Regulation Sections 1.1445-2(c)(3) and 1.897-2(h) substantially in the form set forth in _Section 6.12_ of the Disclosure Schedule (the " _FIRPTA Certificate_ ") that the capital stock of the Company is not a United States Real Property Interest; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of the FIRPTA Certificate shall in no event be deemed to be a condition to the closing of the Offer or the Merger.

Each Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement of expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred in the defense of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation from each of the Parent and the Surviving Corporation to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, _provided_ ,  _however_ , that any Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, to the extent required by the NJBCA, to repay such advances if it is determined by final determination of a court of competent jurisdiction (which determination is not subject to appeal) that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification under applicable Law. Any claims for indemnification or advancement made prior to the expiration of the six-year period hereunder shall survive until the final resolution thereof. 

   

 (b) For a period of not less than six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors and officers of the Company for periods at or prior to the Effective Time than are currently set forth in the Companys certificate of

incorporation and bylaws. The indemnification agreements in existence on the

the Company, which are listed in _Section 7.01(b)_ of the Disclosure
Schedule, shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms following the Effective Time. 

   

 (c) For six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain for the benefit of the Companys directors and officers, as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Effective Time, an insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for events occurring prior to the Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance"_) that is substantially equivalent to and in any event not less favorable in the aggregate than the Companys existing policy (true and complete copies of which have been previously provided to Parent) or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay (and Parent shall not be required to cause the Surviving Corporation to pay) an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 200% of the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement (it being understood and agreed that in the event such DandO Insurance cannot be obtained for 200% of such last annual premium or less, in the aggregate, the Surviving Corporation shall remain obligated to provide the greatest DandO Insurance coverage as may be obtained for such amount). The provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been satisfied if prepaid "tail insurance" policies have been obtained prior to the Effective Time and remain in effect for an aggregate period of six (6) years, which policies provide such directors and officers with coverage for an aggregate period of six (6) years with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time, including in respect of the Transactions. If such prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain such policies in full force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder or if such policies are terminated or cancelled, obtain alternate DandO Insurance on the terms set forth above. 

   

 (d) In the event the Surviving Corporation (1) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (2) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then in either case proper provision shall be made so that such continuing or surviving corporation or entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.01_. The obligations under this _Section 7.01_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect in any material respect any indemnitee to whom this  _Section 7.01_ applies without the consent of such affected indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the indemnitees to whom this _Section 7.01_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 7.01_). 

   ##### 

  

  

 7.02 Employee Matters. 

   

 (a) From the Effective Time until the date that is twelve (12) months following the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation, to either (1) continue certain Benefit Arrangements, (2) permit employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who continue employment with Parent or the Surviving Corporation following the Effective Time (" _Continuing Employees_ ") and, as applicable, their eligible dependents, to participate in the employee welfare benefit plans, programs or policies (including any vacation, sick, personal time off plans or programs) of Parent or its affiliates and any plan of Parent intended to qualify within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code (collectively referred to as the " _Parent Plans_ "), or (3) a combination of clauses (1) or (2); provided, however, that the employee welfare and retirement benefits provided to Continuing Employees and, as applicable, their eligible dependents are comparable in the aggregate to the employee welfare and retirement benefits maintained for and provided to Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time. To the extent that Parent elects to have Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents participate in the Parent Plans, and to the extent permitted by applicable Law, applicable Tax qualification requirements, and the terms and conditions of each such Parent Plan, and subject to any applicable break in service or similar rule, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to: (A) recognize the prior service with the Company, including predecessor employers, of each Continuing Employee in connection with all Parent Plans in which Continuing Employees are eligible to participate for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting (but not for purposes of benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan, determination of level of benefits, to the extent that such recognition would result in duplication of benefits, or to the extent that such service was not recognized under a comparable Benefit Arrangement); (B) cause any pre-existing conditions or limitations and eligibility waiting periods under any group health plans of Parent or its affiliates to be waived with respect to Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents to the extent such Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents were not subject to such preexisting conditions and limitations and eligibility waiting periods under the comparable Benefit Arrangement as of the time immediately preceding the Closing, and (C) if any Benefit Arrangement of the Company or its Subsidiaries that is a group health plan is terminated prior to the end of such Benefit Arrangements plan year, provide each Continuing Employee with credit for any deductibles or out of pocket expenses paid under such Benefit Arrangement during the portion of the plan year, in effect at the time Continuing Employees are transitioned to Parent Plans, that overlaps the plan year of the Parent Plans in satisfying any applicable deductible or out of pocket requirements under the Parent Plans in which such Continuing Employees are eligible to participate to the same extent that such expenses were recognized under the comparable Benefit Arrangement. 

   

 (b) No provision in this _Section 7.02_ will (1) create or be deemed to create any third-party beneficiary or other rights in any Employee or any other Person other 

   ##### 

  

    

than the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns, (2)
constitute or create or be deemed to constitute or create an employment
agreement or (3) constitute or be deemed to constitute an amendment to any
employee benefit plan sponsored or maintained by Parent, the Company or any
of their respective Subsidiaries. 

  

 7.03 Board of Directors; Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act. 

   

 (a) Subject to applicable Law and if requested by Parent, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause a number of Purchasers designees to be elected to the Company Board immediately following the purchase by Purchaser of Shares pursuant to the Offer, as set forth in this _Section 7.03_. Purchaser will be entitled to designate up to such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Company Board as will give Purchaser representation on the Company Board equal to the product of the total number of directors on the Company Board (giving effect to the directors elected pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by the percentage that the aggregate number of votes represented by Shares beneficially owned by Purchaser or any affiliate of Purchaser following such purchase bears to the total number of votes represented by Shares then outstanding; _provided,_ _however_ , that prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board shall have at least two (2) Continuing Directors; and  _provided_ , _further_ , that neither Parent nor Purchaser shall be in breach of this _Section 7.03(a)_ by virtue of the Company Board having fewer than two (2) Continuing Directors due to the resignation of any Continuing Director. The Company shall, at such time, promptly take all actions necessary to cause Purchasers designees to be elected as directors of the Company, including securing the resignations of incumbent directors. At such time, the persons designated by Purchaser will, as nearly as practicable, constitute at least the same percentage as persons designated by Purchaser of the Company Board of (1) each committee of the Company Board, (2) each board of directors of each Subsidiary of the Company, and (3) each committee of each such board, in each case only to the extent permitted by applicable Law. From the consummation of the Offer until the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Purchaser and the Company to, provide director and officer insurance to the Continuing Directors upon terms that are substantially similar to those of the director and officer insurance provided by the Company immediately prior to the date hereof and shall reimburse each Continuing Director for his reasonable and documented expenses incurred in connection with attending any meeting of the Company Board. 

   

 (b) Subject to applicable Law, the Company shall promptly take all actions required pursuant to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder to fulfill its obligations under this _Section 7.03_, and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information as is required under such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 to fulfill such obligations. Parent or Purchaser shall supply to the Company, and be solely responsible for, any information with respect to either of them and their nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required by such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (c) Following the election of designees of Purchaser pursuant to this _Section 7.03_ and prior to the Effective Time or the earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, and provided that any Continuing Directors remain on the Company Board, (1) any amendment of this Agreement or the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company, (2) any termination of this Agreement by the Company, (3) any extension by the Company of the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of Parent or Purchaser hereunder, (4) any waiver of any of the Companys rights hereunder or (5) any action that would prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Merger, in each case, shall require the approval of a majority of the Continuing Directors. The approval of any such matter by a majority of the Continuing Directors shall constitute the approval of such matter by the Company Board, and no other action on the part of the Company or any other director of the Company shall be required to approve such matter. Until the Effective Time, the Continuing Directors shall have, and Parent shall cause the Continuing Directors to have, the authority to retain such counsel (which may include any law firm that was serving as counsel to the Company as of the date of this Agreement) and other advisors at the expense of the Company as determined in good faith by the Continuing Directors, and the authority to institute or commence any suit, action, investigation or proceeding or take any other action on behalf of the Company to enforce any provision of this Agreement. Following the Acceptance Date and prior to the Effective Time, neither Parent nor Purchaser shall take any action to remove any Continuing Director absent cause and, in such case, subject to the terms of the Companys certificate of incorporation and bylaws. 

  

ARTICLE VIII 

   

Conditions to the Merger 

  

 8.01 Conditions to Each Partys Obligation to Effect the Merger. The respective obligation of each Party to consummate the Merger is subject to the fulfillment or written waiver by the Parties before the Effective Time of each of the following conditions: 

   

 (a) _Shareholder Approval_. If and to the extent required by the NJBCA, this Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions shall have been approved and adopted by the affirmative vote of holders of at least a majority of the outstanding Shares; 

   

 (b) _No Order_. No Governmental Authority shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any Law (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that is then in effect and has the effect of making the acquisition of Shares by Parent or Purchaser or any affiliate of either of them illegal or otherwise restricting, preventing or prohibiting consummation of the Transactions; and 

   ##### 

  

   

 (c) _Purchase of Shares_. Purchaser shall have accepted for payment and paid for Shares pursuant to the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that this condition will be deemed to be satisfied with respect to the obligation of Parent and Purchaser to effect the Merger if Purchaser fails to accept for payment or pay for the Shares pursuant to the Offer in violation of the terms of the Offer or of this Agreement. 

  

ARTICLE IX 

   

Termination 

  

 9.01 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Effective Time and the Transactions may be abandoned for any reason provided in paragraphs (a) through (i) below. 

   

 (a) By mutual written consent of each of Parent and the Company, notwithstanding any approval and adoption of this Agreement by the shareholders of the Company. 

   

 (b) By either Parent or the Company if any Governmental Authority shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any injunction, order, decree or ruling (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that has become final and nonappealable and has the effect of making consummation of the Offer or the Merger illegal or otherwise preventing or prohibiting consummation of the Offer or the Merger; _provided_ that the Party seeking to terminate this Agreement shall have used its reasonable best efforts to remove or lift such injunction, order, decree or ruling. 

   

 (c) By Parent if there shall have been a material breach of any of the covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement, other than in _Section 6.08_, on the part of the Company such that any of the events set forth in clauses (b)(1) or (b)(2) of _Annex A_ would have occurred, which breach is not cured within thirty (30) days following written notice by Parent to the Company, or which breach, by its nature or timing, is incapable of being cured prior to the consummation of the Offer. 

   

 (d) By Parent, at any time prior to the Acceptance Date, if the Company (1) breaches clause (1) of the first sentence of _Section 6.08(a)_ or (2) breaches any other provision of _Section 6.08_ in any material respect; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if clause (1) of _Section 6.08(a)_ is breached solely by the actions of any Representative of the Company (other than any director, officer or employee of the Company) or an affiliate of the Company that is, in each case, acting without the authority of the Company or such affiliate, as applicable, then Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.01(d)_ as a result of such breach. 

    ##### 

 

    

 (e) By the Company if Purchaser fails to commence the Offer as provided in _Section 2.01(a)_. 

   

 (f) By Parent or the Company if (1) the Offer expires pursuant to its terms without any Shares being purchased thereunder or (2) Parent or Purchaser shall not have accepted for payment and paid for Shares pursuant to the Offer in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof on or before December 14, 2010 (the " _Termination Date_ "); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 9.01(f)_ shall not be available to any Party to the extent that such Partys failure to comply with any provision of this Agreement, has resulted in the failure of any of the conditions set forth on _Annex A_ to be satisfied prior to the Termination Date. 

   

 (g) By the Company if there shall have been a material breach of any of the covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part of Purchaser or Parent, which breach would reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to the Parents or Purchasers ability to purchase and pay for the Shares (assuming all Shares were validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer) and has not been cured within thirty (30) days following written notice by the Company to Parent, or which breach, by its nature or timing, is incapable of being cured prior to the consummation of the Offer. 

   

 (h) By Parent if (1) at any time prior to the Acceptance Date the Company Board shall have effected an Adverse Recommendation Change, (2) at any time prior to the Acceptance Date the Company shall have delivered to Parent the notice contemplated by _Section 6.08(f)_ of its intention to make an Adverse Recommendation Change or (3) the Company shall have entered into any agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement permitted by  _Section 6.08)_ with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. 

   

 (i) By the Company, at any time prior to the Acceptance Date and after complying with the terms of _Section 6.08(f)_, in order to enter into a transaction that constitutes a Superior Proposal. 

  

 9.02 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 9.01_, this Agreement will forthwith become void and there will be no liability on the part of any Party or any of its affiliates, directors, officers or shareholders except that the provisions contained in _Article I_ (Definitions; Interpretation), _Section 6.06_ (Press Releases), this _Section 9.02_ (Effect of Termination), _Section 9.03_ (Termination Fee), _Article X_ (Miscellaneous) (as applicable) and the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement will each survive any such termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein relieves the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Purchaser, on the other hand, from any liability for damages arising out of any (1) knowing material breach of any of its representations and warranties in this Agreement or (2) deliberate material breach of any covenant in this Agreement, and including as damages, in the case of a termination of this 

   ##### 

  

    

Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01(g)_, the non-refundable portion of any
premium paid by the Company (in an amount not to exceed $1,363,950), and any
other reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred, in connection
with the procurement of the Tax Insurance Policies. The Parties hereby
acknowledge and agree that the damages referred to in the immediately
preceding sentence shall not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-
of-pocket costs, and may include any damages to which the non-breaching party
is entitled under applicable Law. For purposes of this _Section 9.02_, (A) a
"knowing" breach of a representation and warranty shall be deemed to have
occurred only if, in the case of the Companys breach, the Company had
Knowledge of such breach as of the date hereof, or, in the case of Parents
or Purchasers breach, the senior executive officers of Parent or Purchaser
had actual knowledge of such breach as of the date hereof and (B) a
"deliberate" breach of any covenant shall be deemed to have occurred only if
the breaching Party took or failed to take action with actual knowledge that
the action so taken or omitted to be taken constituted or would constitute a
breach of such covenant. 

  

 9.03 Termination Fee. 

   

 (a) In the event that: 

   

 (1) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01(d)_ or  _Section 9.01(h)_ or (2) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 9.01(i)_, the Company shall pay to Parent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, $7,500,000 in cash (the " _Termination Fee_ ") within three (3) Business Days after such termination, in the case of a termination by Parent, and immediately prior to or concurrently with, and as a condition to, such termination, in the case of a termination by the Company. 

   

 (b) If (1) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 9.01(c)_, (2) after the date of this Agreement and prior to such termination, an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced or shall have been otherwise communicated to the Company Board and (3) neither Parent nor Purchaser is in material breach of its agreements or representations and warranties contained in this Agreement pursuant to which the Company would have had the right to terminate this Agreement, then the Company shall pay to Parent in immediately available funds the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses and fees (including the reasonable and documented fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, experts and consultants to Parent and Purchaser, all filing fees and all printing and advertising costs) actually incurred or accrued by Purchaser and Parent in connection with the evaluation of the Transactions, negotiation, preparation, execution and performance of this Agreement and related agreements, the consummation of the Transactions and related matters, which in no event shall exceed an aggregate amount equal to $4,500,000 (" _Expenses_ "). Payment of the Expenses shall be made not later than three (3) Business Days after delivery to the Company of notice of demand for payment setting forth in reasonable detail all such Expenses. If, following the occurrence of the events described in clauses (1) and (2) in 

   ##### 

  

   

the immediately preceding sentence and the nonoccurrence of the events
described in clause (3) in the immediately preceding sentence, the Company
consummates any Acquisition Proposal (for purposes of this sentence, the term
"Acquisition Proposal" shall have the meaning ascribed thereto in _Section
1.01_, except that each reference to "ten percent (10%)" in the definition of
Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a reference to "a majority")
within nine (9) months following the date of the termination of
this Agreement, then the Company shall pay to Parent in immediately available
funds the Termination Fee (minus any amount of Expenses previously reimbursed
by the Company to Parent and Purchaser) prior to or concurrently with the
consummation of such Acquisition Proposal. 

   

 (c) If (1) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to  _Section 9.01(f)_, (2) after the date of this Agreement and prior to such termination, an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced or shall have been otherwise communicated to the Company Board, (3) neither Parent nor Purchaser is in material breach of its agreements or representations and warranties contained in this Agreement pursuant to which the Company would have had the right to terminate this Agreement, and (4) the Company consummates an Acquisition Proposal within nine (9) months following the date of the termination of this Agreement, then the Company shall pay to Parent in immediately available funds the Termination Fee prior to or concurrently with the consummation of such Acquisition Proposal. For purposes of this _Section 9.03(c)_, the term "Acquisition Proposal" shall have the meaning ascribed thereto in Section 1.01, except that each reference to "ten percent (10%)" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a reference to "a majority". 

   

 (d) The Parties acknowledge that the Termination Fee and this _Section 9.03_ are an integral part of the Transactions and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement. In the event that Parent shall receive a Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 9.03(a)_ (other than as a result of a termination pursuant to  _Section 9.01(d)_) or _Section 9.03(c)_, the receipt of such Termination Fee shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent or Purchaser in connection with any matter forming the basis for such termination, and neither Parent nor Purchaser shall be entitled to bring or maintain any other claim, action or proceeding against the Company arising out of any matters forming the basis for such termination, in each case, other than in the event of (1) a knowing material breach of any of its representations and warranties in this Agreement or (2) a deliberate material breach of any covenant of this Agreement, in each case as defined in  _Section 9.02_.

This Agreement and the agreements, instruments and documents contemplated hereby and all disputes between the Parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the facts and circumstances leading to its execution and delivery, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, will be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of New Jersey, without giving effect to conflicts of laws principles that would result in the application of the Law of any other State. Any claim, action or dispute against any party to this Agreement arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be brought in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey sitting in Trenton, New Jersey or in the event (but only in the event) that the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey sitting in Trenton, New Jersey does not have subject matter jurisdiction over such claim, action or dispute, in the New Jersey Superior Court in Mercer County. Each of the Parties irrevocably consents to and agrees to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts, agrees that process may be served upon them in any manner authorized by the Laws of the State of New Jersey, and hereby waives, and agrees not to assert in any such dispute, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any claim that (a) such Party is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of such courts, (b) such Party and such Partys property is immune from any legal process issued by such courts or (c) any litigation commenced in such courts is brought in an inconvenient forum. Each Party irrevocably consents to the service of process outside the territorial jurisdiction of the courts referred to in this  _Section 10.04_ in any such action or proceeding by mailing copies thereof by registered or certified United States mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to such Partys address as specified in or pursuant to _Section 10.08_ hereof. However, the foregoing shall not limit the right of a party to effect service of process on the other party by any other legally advisable method.

and each Party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the
obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.
Without limiting the foregoing, if a court of competent jurisdiction has
declined to specifically enforce the obligations of a Party under this
Agreement, the non-breaching Party may pursue any other remedy available to
it at law or in equity, including monetary damages as contemplated by
_Section 9.02_. 

  

 10.06 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

If any provision of this Agreement or the application thereof to any Person or circumstance is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remaining provisions, or the application of such provision to Persons or circumstances other than those as to which it has been held invalid or unenforceable, will remain in full force and effect and will in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated thereby, so long as the economic or legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon any such determination, the Parties will negotiate in good faith in an effort to agree upon a suitable and equitable substitute provision to effect the original intent of the Parties.

 10.11 Assignment; Successors. No Party may assign either this Agreement or any of its rights or interests, or delegate any of its duties, hereunder, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of the other Parties, except that Parent may assign all or any of its rights and obligations hereunder to any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that such assignment shall not relieve Parent or Purchaser of its obligations under this Agreement, enlarge, alter or change any obligation of any other Party or prejudice the rights of shareholders to receive payment for Shares validly tendered and accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer or Shares converted into the right to receive the Per Share Amount. Any attempt to make any such assignment without such consent will be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentences of this _Section 10.11_, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. 

  

 10.12 No Recourse. No past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, individual shareholder, agent, attorney or representative of the Company or its Subsidiaries has or will have any liability for any liability or obligation of the Company under this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the Transactions. 

  

 10.13 Expenses. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions will be paid by the Party incurring such expenses, whether or not the Offer or the Merger is consummated. 

  

 10.14 Further Assurances. From time to time, at the request of Parent or Purchaser, in the case of the Company, or at the request of the Company, in the case of Parent and Purchaser, and without further consideration, each Party shall execute and deliver or cause to be executed and delivered such additional documents and instruments and take all such further action as may be reasonably necessary or desirable to consummate the Transactions. In furtherance of the Shareholders Agreement, the Company agrees to, and will cause its Representatives to, notify the Companys transfer agent that there is a stop transfer order with respect to all of the Shares held by the parties to the Shareholders Agreement, and that such stop transfer order only shall be removed and only shall be of no further force and effect in accordance with the terms of the Shareholders Agreement.

 _ANNEX A_  

   

 _CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER_  

   

 Notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer, Purchaser shall not be required to accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c) promulgated under the Exchange Act (relating to Purchasers obligation to pay for or return tendered Shares promptly after termination or withdrawal of the Offer), pay for, and (subject to any such rules or regulations) Purchaser may, but only to the extent expressly permitted by this Agreement, delay the acceptance for payment for, or the payment for, any Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, 

   

 (a) unless, at the expiration of the Offer (as extended): 

   

 (1) there shall have been validly tendered and not withdrawn a number of Shares that, together with any other Shares beneficially owned by Parent or its Subsidiaries, constitutes more than a majority of all the Fully Diluted Shares of the Company (the " _Minimum Condition_ "); 

   

 (2) any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act shall have expired or been terminated; 

   

 (3) any approval or consent of any Governmental Authority that is necessary for the Transactions to be consummated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, or any relevant statutory, regulatory or other governmental waiting periods, whether domestic, foreign or supranational, the failure of which to be obtained or to be in full force and effect or to have expired, as applicable, would, upon the purchase of the Shares pursuant to the Offer, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, shall have been obtained or be in full force and effect or shall have expired, as applicable; and 

   

 (4) the Tax Insurance Policies shall remain in full force and effect, and the Company shall not have taken any action, or failed to take any action, which (with or without the lapse of time or notice or both) would result in the termination of, or a modification materially adverse to the Company of the terms of, any of the Tax Insurance Policies or give any third party the right to cause any such termination or modification, or 

   

 (b) if, at the expiration of the Offer (as extended), any of the following conditions shall occur and be continuing: 

   

 (1) any of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement shall not be true and correct in each case at and as of the date of this Agreement and at and as of the Acceptance Date as though made at and as of the Acceptance Date (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in 

  

Exhibit A-i 

    ##### 

  

   

which case solely as of such date), in each instance, except as would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company; 

   

 (2) the Company shall have failed to perform or comply in any material respect with any of its agreements, obligations or covenants under this Agreement; 

   

 (3) this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms; 

   

 (4) any event, change, effect or occurrence that has had a Material Adverse Effect on the Company; 

   

 (5) Purchaser and the Company shall have agreed that Purchaser shall terminate the Offer or postpone the acceptance for payment of Shares thereunder; or 

   

 (6) a Governmental Authority shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any Law (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that is then in effect and has the effect of making the acquisition of Shares by Parent or Purchaser or any affiliate of either of them illegal or otherwise preventing or prohibiting consummation of the Transactions. 

 

The foregoing conditions, other than the Minimum Condition, may be waived by
Purchaser in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in its sole
discretion. The failure by Purchaser at any time to exercise any of the
foregoing rights will not be deemed a waiver of any such right, and
the waiver of any such right with respect to particular facts and
circumstances will not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and
circumstances.
