Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time held by a
holder who has not voted in favor of adoption of this Agreement or consented

rights under the DGCL with respect to such Company Stock) shall not be
converted into a right to receive the consideration set forth in _Section
3.01(a)_ or _Section 3.01(b)_, but instead shall be entitled to only to
receive payment of the appraised value of such share of Company Stock held by
them in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_

applicable, without interest thereon. The Company shall provide Acquiror, as

in respect of such Company Option, (ii) a Base Acquiror Option, with respect

Earnout Acquiror Options denoted as "Time-Vesting" on the Spreadsheet (the "
_Time-Vesting Options_ ") shall be unvested as of the Effective Time and
shall vest in equal annual installments on the first four anniversaries of
the Closing Date, subject to the continued employment of the holder thereof

shall accelerate in full upon a Change in Control (as defined in the 2017

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b)  Immediately prior to the Effective Time and after taking
into account any vesting pursuant to this _Section 3.04_ , pursuant to the
terms of the Company Option Plan, each Company Option (each, a " _Former
Service Provider Option_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by any individual who no longer provides services to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (each, a "
_Former Service Provider_ ") shall, without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, be canceled and automatically be converted, with respect to
each Former Service Provider into the number of Company Common Shares set

Agreement.

  



  

(c)  All payments of Closing Per Option Cash Consideration shall

Forfeiture Date in the event of the failure of the satisfaction of the
threshold set forth in _Section 3.10(a)_ on or prior to the Forfeiture Date
and (ii) the remaining fifty percent (50%) of the Earnout Acquiror Options
shall be forfeited on the Forfeiture Date in the event of the failure of the
satisfaction of the threshold set forth in _Section 3.10(b)_ on or prior to
the Forfeiture Date; _provided_ , _further_ , that no such forfeiture shall
occur if an Acceleration Event occurs prior to the Forfeiture Date. Following
the earlier of the Forfeiture Date and an Acceleration Event, any Earnout
Acquiror Options that were not forfeited pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence shall no longer be subject to forfeiture, except pursuant
to the service-based vesting conditions described in _Section 3.04(a)_ to the
extent such Earnout Acquiror Options are Time-Vesting Options. Upon exercise
of any Earnout Acquiror Option prior to the earlier of the Forfeiture Date and
an Acceleration Event, the shares of Acquiror Common Stock otherwise issuable
upon such exercise shall be held by Acquiror on behalf of the
exercising optionholder (and such shares shall not be transferable) until
such time as the Earnout Shares are issued to Company Stockholders pursuant
to _Section 3.10_ (and if the Earnout Shares are not so issued, then the

(a)  Following the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time,
Acquiror shall, at the Company's sole cost and expense, appoint an exchange
agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") to act

the Effective Time in such a manner that will result in costs or expenses to
the Company to be paid by the Company prior to the Effective Time or in the
event that the Merger Agreement is terminated, in each case in  _clause (ii)_
, absent the written consent of the Company. Promptly after the appointment of
the Exchange Agent, Acquiror shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each
holder of record of Company Stock (including Former Service Provider Shares
and after giving effect to the conversion of the AFC Convertible Note
pursuant to _Section 3.05_ and the automatic exercise of the AFC Warrant

Options and the Earnout Acquiror Options), at the Company's sole cost and
expense, a letter of transmittal (which shall be in the form and substance
reasonably acceptable to the Company) (a " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") and
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the certificates evidencing
such Company Stock, in physical or electronic form, as the case may be (the "
_Certificates_ "), to the extent such Company Stock is represented by the
Certificates, in exchange for the applicable portion of Closing Date Merger
Consideration payable to such holder. The Exchange Agent shall (A) at or
promptly following the Effective Time, issue to each holder of record of
Company Stock entitled to receive a portion of the Closing Date Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.01_ that has delivered a Certificate
(only to the extent such Company Stock is represented by a Certificate)
(together with a Letter of Transmittal duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto and customary tax forms that the
Exchange Agent may reasonably require in connection therewith) at least three
(3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the portion of the Closing Date
Merger Consideration with respect to such Certificate (or any Company Stock
not represented by a Certificate) so surrendered and the Certificate shall
forthwith be canceled; and (B) following the Effective Time, with respect to
any holder of record of Company Stock entitled to receive a portion of
the Closing Date Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.01_ that did

the preceding _clause (A)_ , no later than three (3) Business Days after
receipt of a Certificate (only to the extent such Company Stock is
represented by a Certificate) (together with a Letter of Transmittal duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto
and any customary tax forms that the Exchange Agent may reasonably require in
connection therewith), issue to the holder of such Certificate (or any Company
Stock not represented by a Certificate) the Closing Date Merger Consideration
with respect to such Certificate (or any Company Stock not represented by a
Certificate) so surrendered and the Certificate shall forthwith be canceled.
The Exchange Agent shall deliver (x) the Stock Merger Consideration into
which such Company Common Shares and Company Preferred Shares, as applicable,
have been converted pursuant to _Section 3.01(a)_ (after giving effect to
_Section 3.01(d)_, _Section 3.05_ and _Section 3.06_) and _Section
3.01(b)_, respectively, as reflected in the Stockholder Ownership Allocation,

Stockholder's Letter of Transmittal and (z) the Liquidation Preference Amount
to the Company Preferred Stockholder in immediately available funds

Preferred Stockholder's Letter of Transmittal. Unless otherwise provided
herein, no interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any Closing Date Merger
Consideration payable upon surrender of any Certificate (or any Company Stock
not represented by a Certificate). Until so surrendered, each outstanding
Certificate (or any Company Stock not represented by a Certificate) that
prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Company Stock (other than
for Dissenting Shares and other shares to be canceled pursuant to _Section
3.01(d)_) shall be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all
purposes, to evidence only the right to receive the portion of the Merger
Consideration. If after the Effective Time, any Certificate (or any Company
Stock not represented by a Certificate) is presented to the Exchange Agent,
it shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Section 3.07(a)_.

(b)  If any portion of the Closing Date Merger Consideration is
to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate (or any Company Stock not represented by a Certificate) is
registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) such Certificate
shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer,
and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent
any transfer or other Tax required as a result of such payment to a
Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate (or any Company
Stock not represented by a Certificate) or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.

  



  

(c)  No dividends or other distributions declared or made after
the Effective Time with respect to the Acquiror Common Stock with a record

consideration for the surrender of such Certificate (or Company Stock not
represented by a Certificate) until the holder of such Certificate
(or Company Stock not represented by a Certificate) shall surrender such
Certificate (or Company Stock not represented by a Certificate). Subject to
the effect of escheat, tax or other applicable Laws, following surrender of
any such Certificate (or Company Stock not represented by a Certificate),
there shall be paid to the holder of the certificates representing shares of
Acquiror Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time and theretofore paid with respect to such shares of
Acquiror Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount
of dividends or other distributions, with a record date after the Effective

(d)  Any Closing Date Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed
by Company Stockholders three (3) years after the Effective Time (or such
earlier date, immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority) shall become, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of Acquiror free and
clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(e)  If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of loss and indemnity by
the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Company or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of
a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Company may direct, as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such

or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of
the Company Shares formerly represented by such Certificate in accordance
with this Agreement.

split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock
dividend or distribution paid in stock, the number of shares of Acquiror
Common Stock to be issued as the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately
adjusted to reflect such change.

after the Effective Time any further action is reasonably necessary or
desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the
Surviving Company with full right, title and possession to all assets,

_Forfeiture Date_ ") the closing share price of the Acquiror Common Stock is
greater than $12.50 over any twenty (20) Trading Days within any thirty (30)
Trading Day period, the Acquiror shall promptly issue to each Company

(c)  To the extent a fractional share of Acquiror Common Stock
is issuable as part of the allocable Earnout Shares to a Company Stockholder

otherwise would be allocable to such Company Stockholder, in respect of his,
her or its Earnout Shares, such fraction shall be rounded up to one whole
share of Acquiror Common Stock.

  



  

(d)   The Acquiror Common Stock price targets in _clauses_ (a)

judgment, and (ii) make changes in their respective sole discretion to their
respective operations, organization, personnel, accounting practices and
other aspects of their respective businesses, including actions that may have
an impact on whether any thresholds in respect of Earnout Shares have been
met, and none of the Company Stockholders will have any right to claim any
damages as a result of such decisions or the failure to satisfy any of the
thresholds set forth in Sections _3.10(a)_  or _(b)_.

(f)  If, prior to the end of the Forfeiture Date, there is a
Change of Control that will result in the holders of Acquiror Common Stock

equitably adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, special cash dividends,
reorganizations, combinations, recapitalizations and similar transactions
affecting the Acquiror Common Stock after the date of this Agreement) (an "

the HSR Act as soon as practicable and to avoid the imposition of any
Governmental Order that adversely affects the ability of the parties hereto
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement has been issued, to have such Governmental Order vacated or lifted;
_provided_ , that no party hereto nor any of their respective Affiliates shall
be obligated in the exercise of such efforts to propose, negotiate, commit to

pursuant to written consents of the Company Stockholders in a form reasonably
acceptable to Acquiror (the " _Written Consent_ ") as promptly as
practicable, and in any event within ten (10) Business Days following the date
on which the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC. The
materials submitted to the Company Stockholders in connection with the
Written Consent shall include the Company Board Recommendation; _provided,
however_ , that the Company Board may withdraw or modify the Company Board
Recommendation with respect to the Written Consent if the Company Board
reasonably determines, after consultation with outside counsel, that failure
to do so would violate its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law.
Reasonably promptly following receipt of the Written Consent, the Company
shall deliver a copy of such Written Consent to Acquiror.

  



  

(b)  Reasonably promptly following receipt of the Written
Consent, the Company shall prepare and mail a notice (the "

approved and adopted this Agreement, the Merger, the Pre-Closing Company
Charter Amendment and the other Transactions, (ii) provide the Company
Stockholders to whom it is sent with notice of the actions taken in the
Written Consent, including the approval and adoption of this Agreement, the

in accordance with Section 228(e) of the DGCL and the bylaws of the Company
and (iii) notify such Company Stockholders of their dissent and appraisal
rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. The Stockholder Notice shall be
accompanied by a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL and all such other
information as Acquiror shall reasonably request, and shall be sufficient in
form and substance to start the twenty (20) day period during which a Company
Stockholder must demand appraisal of such Company Stockholder's shares of
Company Stock as contemplated by Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL, if required.
All materials submitted to the Company Stockholders in accordance with this
_Section 6.08(b)_ shall be subject to Acquiror's advance review and
reasonable approval (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)
which must be taken promptly.

for the purposes of (A) registering under the Securities Act the Stock Merger
Consideration and the Earnout Shares (together, the " _Registration Shares_
"), (B) providing Acquiror Stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their
shares of Acquiror Common Stock in connection with the Merger, (C) soliciting
proxies from Acquiror Stockholders to obtain the requisite approval of the
Transactions and the other matters to be voted on at a meeting of the holders
of Acquiror Common Stock to be called and held for such purpose (the "
_Acquiror Stockholders ' Meeting_") and (D) soliciting the written consent of
the Company's shareholders to, among other things, the Transactions. As
promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution of this Agreement,
Acquiror shall prepare and file any other filings required under the Exchange
Act, the Securities Act or any other Laws relating to the Transactions
(collectively, the " _Other Filings_ "). Each of Acquiror and the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement, the
Proxy Statement and the Consent Solicitation Statement to comply with the
rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, to have the Registration
Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
practicable after such filing and to keep the Registration Statement effective
as long as is necessary to consummate the Transactions. Each of Acquiror and
the Company shall notify the other promptly upon the receipt of any comments
from the SEC or its staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff or any
other Governmental Authority for amendments or supplements to the
Registration Statement, the Proxy Statement, or any Other Filing or for
additional information. As promptly as practicable after receipt thereof,
each of Acquiror and the Company shall provide the other and its counsel with
copies of all written correspondence between Acquiror, the Company or any of
their respective representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, or its staff
or other government officials, on the other hand, with respect to the
Registration Statement, the Proxy Statement, or any Other Filing. Each of
Acquiror and the Company and their respective counsel shall review the
Registration Statement, the Proxy Statement, and any exhibits, amendments or
supplements thereto, as well as any Other Filings, and shall consult with
each other and their respective advisors concerning any comments from the SEC
with respect thereto; _provided_ , _further_ that each of Acquiror and the
Company shall reasonably consider and take into account the reasonable
suggestions, comments or opinions of the Company, Acquiror and their
respective advisors, and neither Acquiror nor the Company shall file the
Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement, or any exhibits, amendments or
supplements thereto or any response letters to any comments from the
SEC without the prior written consent of the other, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Whenever any event occurs
which would reasonably be expected to result in the Registration Statement or
the Proxy Statement containing any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitting to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements
made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, Acquiror or the Company, as the case may be, shall promptly
inform the other party hereto of such occurrence and cooperate in filing with
the SEC or its staff or any other government officials, and/or mailing to
Acquiror Stockholders, an amendment or supplement to the Registration
Statement and/or the Proxy Statement.

of Acquiror Common Stock to vote at the Acquiror Stockholders' Meeting in
favor of: (i) the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger

the Acquiror Stockholder Approval, including setting a record date, calling

Stockholder Approval as provided hereunder shall apply notwithstanding any

6.10   _Director and Officer Indemnification_.

  



  

(a)  From and after the Effective Time, Acquiror and the
Surviving Company agree that they shall indemnify and hold harmless each
present and former director and officer of Acquiror, Merger Sub and each
Company Entity (each, a " _Indemnified Person_ ") against any costs or
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any Action,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or
pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time,
to the fullest extent that the Acquiror, Merger Sub or any Company Entity, as
the case may be, would have been permitted under applicable Law and their
respective Organizational Documents to indemnify such Indemnified Person
(including the advancing of expenses as incurred to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law). Without limiting the foregoing, Acquiror
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company to, (i) maintain for a period of
not less than six (6) years from the Effective Time provisions in its
certificate of incorporation, bylaws and other Organizational Documents
concerning the indemnification and exoneration (including provisions relating
to expense advancement) of officers and directors that are no less favorable
to those Indemnified Persons than the provisions in the Company's or the
Acquiror's Organizational Documents, as applicable, and (ii) not amend,
repeal or otherwise modify such provisions in any respect that would
adversely affect the rights of those Persons thereunder, in each case, except
as required by Law. Acquiror shall assume, and be liable for, and shall cause
the Surviving Company to honor, each of the covenants in this _Section
6.10_.

Acquiror shall, or shall cause one or more of its Subsidiaries to, maintain
in effect directors' and officers' liability insurance covering those Persons
who are currently covered by the Company's or any Company Entity's directors'
and officers' liability insurance policies (each, a " _Company Insured
Person_ ") on terms not less favorable than the terms of such current
insurance coverage, except that in no event shall Acquiror or its
Subsidiaries be required to pay an annual premium for such insurance in excess
of 300% of the aggregate annual premium payable by the Company Entities for
such insurance policy for the year ended December 31, 2019; provided, however,
that (i) Acquiror may cause coverage to be extended under the current
directors' and officers' liability insurance by obtaining a six (6)-year
"tail" policy containing terms not materially less favorable than the terms of
such current insurance coverage with respect to claims existing or occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time and (ii) if any claim is asserted or
made within such six (6)-year period, any insurance required to be maintained
under this _Section 6.10(b)_ shall be continued in respect of such claim
until the final disposition thereof.

  



  

(c)  For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time,
Acquiror shall maintain in effect a directors' and officers' liability
insurance "tail" policy covering those Persons who are currently covered by
the Acquiror's directors' and officers' liability insurance policies (each,
an " _Acquiror Insured Person_ ") on terms not less favorable than the terms
of such current insurance coverage, and if any claim is asserted or made
within such six (6)-year period, any insurance required to be maintained
under this _Section 6.10(c)_ shall be continued in respect of such claim
until the final disposition thereof.

  



  

(d)  Acquiror and the Company shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to ensure that Acquiror shall, with effectiveness as of

the contrary, this _Section 6.10_ shall survive the consummation of the
Merger indefinitely and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on Acquiror
and the Surviving Company and all successors and assigns of Acquiror and the
Surviving Company. In the event that Acquiror, the Surviving Company or any of
their respective successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, Acquiror and the Surviving Company shall ensure that proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Acquiror or the
Surviving Company, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set
forth in this _Section 6.10_. The obligations of Acquiror and the Surviving
Company under this _Section 6.10_ shall not be terminated or modified in
such a manner as to materially and adversely affect any present and former

the Company shall prepare the press release announcing the consummation of
the Transactions (" _Press Release_ "). Promptly following the Closing,
Acquiror shall file the Transaction Form 8-K with the SEC and distribute the
Press Release; _provided_ that Acquiror shall accept such reasonable comments
of the Company to the Transaction Form 8-K prior to filing.

Management Trust Agreement dated on or about February 21, 2019, by and between
Acquiror and Trustee (the " _Trust Agreement_ ") to be so delivered and to

(iii) the payment of expenses to the third parties to which they are owed and
(iv) the balance of the assets in the Trust Account, after payment of the
amounts required under subsections (i), (ii) and (iii), to be disbursed to
Acquiror.

  



  

(b)  Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, the
Company acknowledges that it has received a copy of Acquiror's final
prospectus dated February 22, 2019 (the " _Prospectus_ ") and understands that
Acquiror has established the Trust Account containing the proceeds of its
initial public offering and the overallotment shares acquired by its
underwriters and from certain private placements occurring simultaneously
with the initial public offering (including interest accrued from time to
time thereon) for the benefit of Acquiror's public stockholders (including
overallotment shares acquired by Acquiror's underwriters, the " _Public
Stockholders_ "), and that, except as otherwise described in the Prospectus,
Acquiror may disburse monies from the Trust Account only: (i) to the Public
Stockholders in the event they elect to redeem their Acquiror shares in
connection with the consummation of Acquiror's business combination (as
defined in the Prospectus, the " _Business Combination_ ") or in connection
with an extension of its deadline to consummate a Business Combination, (ii)
to the Public Stockholders if Acquiror fails to consummate such a Business

of Acquiror's initial public offering, (iii) with respect to any interest

franchise or income taxes, or (iv) to Acquiror after or concurrently with the
consummation of a Business Combination. For and in consideration of Acquiror
entering into this Agreement, and for good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Company hereby
agrees, on behalf of the Company, its Subsidiaries, and their respective
officers, directors, managers, shareholders, members, partners, Affiliates,
agents and other representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ "), that
the Company and its Representatives do not have (other than their rights upon
Closing) any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies
in the Trust Account or distributions therefrom, or make any claim against the
Trust Account (including any distributions therefrom), regardless of whether
such claim arises based on contract, tort, equity or any other theory of
legal liability (any and all such claims are collectively referred to
hereafter as the " _Released Claims_ "). The Company on behalf of itself and
its affiliates hereby irrevocably waives any Released Claims that the Company
or any of its affiliates may have against the Trust Account (including
distributions therefrom) prior to Closing or in the future as a result of, or
arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with Acquiror and
will not prior to Closing seek recourse against the Trust Account for any
reason whatsoever; provided that (x) nothing herein shall serve to limit or
prohibit the Company's and its Representatives' right to pursue a claim
against Acquiror for legal relief against monies or other assets held outside
the Trust Account or for specific performance or other equitable relief
(including a claim for Acquiror to specifically perform its obligations under
this Agreement and a claim for Acquiror to specifically perform its
obligations under the Trust Agreement, including distribution of funds from
the Trust Account upon the Closing in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement), and (y) nothing herein shall serve to limit or prohibit any
claims that the Company or its Representatives may have in the future against
Acquiror's assets or funds that are not held in the Trust Account (including
any funds that have been released from the Trust Account, other than to
Public Stockholders, and any assets that have been purchased or acquired with
any such funds) or for specific performance or other equitable relief in
connection with this Agreement or the Transactions. The Company agrees and
acknowledges that such irrevocable waiver is material to this Agreement and
specifically relied upon by Acquiror and its affiliates to induce Acquiror to
enter in this Agreement, and the Company further intends and understands such
waiver to be valid, binding and enforceable against the Company and each of
its affiliates under applicable law. This _Section 6.12(b)_ shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and will not expire and may not be altered in
any way prior to the Closing without the express written consent of Acquiror.

Agreements in any manner other than (i) as expressly provided for by the
terms of the Subscription Agreements or (ii) to reflect any permitted
assignments or transfers of the Subscription Agreements by the applicable
PIPE Investors pursuant to the Subscription Agreements, without the prior
written consent of the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed; provided that the parties acknowledge that any
proposed amendment, modification or waiver of the Subscription Agreements that
affects the offering price of the Acquiror Common Stock pursuant to the
Subscription Agreements, that reduces the aggregate amount of proceeds to be
received by Acquiror under the Subscription Agreements or that adds
additional conditions to the obligations of the PIPE Investors to consummate
the transactions contemplated by the Subscription Agreements may be rejected
by the Company in its sole discretion). Acquiror shall use its reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the Subscription Agreements on the terms and
conditions described therein. Without limiting the generality of the

three (3) Business Days) written notice: (A) of any proposed amendment to any
Subscription Agreement; (B) of any breach or default (or any event
or circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could
give rise to any breach or default) by any party to any Subscription
Agreement known to Acquiror; and (C) of the receipt of any written notice or
other written communication from any party to any Subscription Agreement with
respect to any actual, potential or claimed expiration, lapse, withdrawal,
breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to any Subscription
Agreement or any provisions of any Subscription Agreement. If any
Subscription Agreement expires or is terminated, withdrawn or repudiated by
any party thereto prior to the Closing, such that the aggregate amount of
PIPE Investment as of the Closing is expected to be below $125,000,000,
Acquiror shall use its reasonable best efforts, prior to the Closing, to
procure one or more investors to enter into Subscription Agreements with
Acquiror for PIPE Investment in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
the Company and on the same terms and in an amount at least equal to the
amount of the PIPE Investment under the Subscription Agreement that has
expired or been terminated, withdrawn or repudiated.

invalid or unenforceable with a valid and enforceable provision giving effect
to the intent of the parties.

  



  

9.12   _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with the terms hereof and it is accordingly agreed
that the parties hereto will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in any court specified in _Section 9.06_, in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity.
Each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief as provided

reason at Law or equity. Each party hereto further agrees that no party
hereto shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar
instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtain any remedy referred
to in this _Section 9.12_, and each party hereto irrevocably waives any right
it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond
or similar instrument.

 _ARTICLE III_

  

BUSINESS PURPOSE

  



  

The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for
which a corporation may be organized under the DGCL.

  



  

 _ARTICLE IV_

  

CAPITAL STOCK

  



  

Section 1. Authorized Stock. The total number of all classes of stock that
the Corporation shall have the authority to issue is 510,000,000, of which
500,000,000 shall be shares of Class A Common Stock of the Corporation, par
value $0.01 per share ( _" Common Stock"_), and 10,000,000 shall be shares of
Preferred Stock, at a par value of $0.01 per share ( _" Preferred Stock"_).

  



  

Section 2. Preferred Stock. Shares of Preferred Stock may be issued from time
to time in one or more series. The Board is hereby authorized at any time, and
from time to time, to provide for the issuance of shares of Preferred Stock
in one or more series, without approval of the stockholders of the
Corporation (except as otherwise provided in this Second Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation), by filing a certificate pursuant to the
applicable law of the State of Delaware (hereinafter referred to as a "
_Preferred Stock Designation_ "), to establish from time to time the number of
shares to be included in each such series, and to fix the designations,
powers (including voting powers, if any), preferences and relative,
participating, optional or other special rights, if any, of the shares of
each such series, and the qualifications, limitations and
restrictions thereof, if any, including but not limited to the fixing or
alteration of the dividend rights, dividend rate, conversion rights, voting
rights, rights and terms of redemption (including sinking fund provisions),
the redemption price or prices, and the liquidation preferences of any wholly
unissued series or shares of Preferred Stock. Each such series of Preferred
Stock shall have such voting powers, full or limited, or no voting powers, as
shall be authorized by the Board and stated in the applicable Preferred
Stock Designation. The powers, preferences and relative, participating,
optional and other special rights of each series of Preferred Stock, and the
qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, if any, may be different
from those of any and all other series at any time outstanding. Except as
otherwise expressly provided in the authorization providing for the
establishment of any series of Preferred Stock, no vote of the holders of
shares of Preferred Stock or Common Stock shall be a prerequisite to the
issuance of any shares of any series of the Preferred Stock so authorized in
accordance with this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation. Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Designation
establishing a series of Preferred Stock, the Board may, by resolution or
resolutions, increase or decrease (but not below the number of shares of such
series then outstanding) the number of shares of such series and, if the
number of shares of such series shall be so decreased, the shares constituting
such decrease shall resume the status that they had prior to the adoption of
the resolution originally fixing the number of shares of such series. The
Corporation shall, from time to time and in accordance with applicable law,
increase the number of authorized shares of Common Stock if at any time the
number of shares of Common Stock remaining unissued and available for issuance
shall not be sufficient to permit the conversion of any series of Preferred
Stock that, as provided for or fixed pursuant to the provisions of this
Article IV, Section 2, is otherwise convertible into Common Stock.

Section 3. Common Stock.

  



  

 _(a) _Voting__ : Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or the
relevant Preferred Stock Designation of any class or series of Preferred Stock
or required by law, the holders of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall
have the exclusive right to vote for the election of directors and on all
other matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Corporation.
Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or required by law, each holder
of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to one vote in
respect of each share of Common Stock held thereby of record on the books of
the Corporation for the election of directors and on all other matters
submitted to a vote of stockholders of the Corporation. Except as otherwise
required by law, shares of Common Stock shall not entitle the holders thereof
to vote on any amendment to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation (including to a Preferred Stock Designation) that alters
or changes the powers, preferences, rights or other terms of solely one or
more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected
series are entitled, separately or together with the holders of one or more
other such series, to vote on such amendment pursuant to this Second Amended
and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including a Preferred Stock
Designation) or pursuant to the DGCL, or if no vote of stockholders is
required pursuant to the DGCL.

  



  

 _(b)  _Dividends_ :_ Subject to applicable law, the holders of Common Stock
shall be entitled to receive dividends out of funds legally available
therefor at such times and in such amounts as the Board may determine in its
sole discretion, subject to any preferential dividend rights of outstanding
Preferred Stock as expressly set forth herein or in the relevant Preferred
Stock Designation

  



  



  

 _ARTICLE V_

  

BOARD OF DIRECTORS

  



  

For the management of the business and for the conduct of the affairs of the
Corporation it is further provided that:

  



  

Section 1.

  



  

(a) __General Powers_ :_ The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be
managed by or under the direction of the Board.

  



  

(b) __Number of Directors__ : Subject to the rights of the holders of shares
of any series of Preferred Stock to elect additional directors and subject to
the applicable requirements of the Stockholders Agreement dated [●] by and
among the Corporation and certain stockholders of the Corporation from time to
time party thereto (as the same may be amended, restated, supplemented and/or
otherwise modified from time to time in accordance with its terms, the "
_Stockholders Agreement_ "), the number of directors which shall constitute
the whole Board shall be fixed from time to time by resolution of the Board.

  



  

(c) __Classified Board Structure; Election of Directors_ :_ Except as
otherwise fixed by or pursuant to the provisions of Article IV hereof
relating to the rights of the holders of shares of any series of Preferred
Stock to separately elect additional directors, which additional directors
are not required to be classified pursuant to the terms of such series of
Preferred Stock (the " _Preferred Stock Directors_ ") and subject to the
applicable requirements of the Stockholders Agreement, the Board shall be and
is divided into three classes, designated as Class I, Class II and Class III.
Each class will consist, as nearly as possible, of a number of directors
equal to one-third (1/3) of the total number of members of the Board (other
than the Preferred Stock Directors, if any) authorized as provided in Article
V, Section 1(b) hereof. The Board is authorized to assign members of the Board
already in office to such classes at the time the classification of the Board
becomes effective pursuant to this Article V, Section 1(c). The term of
office of the initial Class I directors will expire at the annual meeting of
stockholders in 2021; the term of office of the initial Class II directors
will expire at the annual meeting of stockholders in 2022; and the term of
office of the initial Class III directors will expire at the annual meeting of
stockholders in 2023. At each annual meeting of stockholders of the
Corporation the successors of that class of directors whose term expires at
that meeting will be elected to hold office in accordance with this Article
V, Section 1(c) for a term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders
held in the third year following the year of their election. The directors of
each class will hold office until the expiration of the term of such class
and until their respective successors are elected and qualified or until such
director's earlier death, resignation or removal.

  



  

   

 | 3| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) __Written Ballot Not Required__. Unless and except to the extent that the
Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Corporation (the " _Bylaws_ ") so require,
the election of directors of the Corporation need not be written by ballot.

  



  

(e) __Removal__ : Subject to the rights of the holders of one or more series
of Preferred Stock with respect to such series of Preferred Stock and the
rights granted pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, any director, or the
entire Board, may be removed from office at any time, but only for cause and
only by the affirmative vote of the holders of sixty-six and two-thirds
percent (66-2/3%) of the voting power of all the then outstanding shares of
voting stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at an election of directors
(the " _Voting Stock_ "), represented in person or by proxy at a meeting for
the election of directors duly called pursuant to the Bylaws.

  



  

(f) __Vacancies:__ Subject to applicable law, the rights of the holders of
shares of one or more series of Preferred Stock with respect to such series of
Preferred Stock, and the rights granted pursuant to the Stockholders
Agreement, any vacancies on the Board resulting from death,
disability, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal from office
of a director or from any other cause, or any newly created
directorships that increase the number of directors shall be filled only by
the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office, even if
less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director. Any director appointed in
accordance with the preceding sentence shall hold office for a term that
shall coincide with the remaining term of the class to which the director
shall have been appointed and until such director's successor shall have been
elected and qualified or until his or her earlier death, resignation or
removal. If the number of directors is changed, any increase or decrease shall
be apportioned among the classes as determined by a majority of the Board so
as to maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly equal as
possible, and any additional director of any class elected to fill a newly
created directorship shall hold office for the remaining term of that class
until such director's successor is duly elected and qualified (or until such
director's earlier death, resignation or removal), but in no case shall a
decrease in the number of directors shorten the term of any incumbent
director.

  



  

(g) In addition to the powers and authority herein or by statute expressly
conferred upon them, the directors are hereby empowered to exercise all such
powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the
Corporation, subject to the provisions of the DGCL, this Second Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws; _provided_ , _however_
, that no Bylaws hereafter adopted shall invalidate any prior act of the
directors that would have been valid if such Bylaws had not been adopted.

  



  

 _ARTICLE VI_

  

STOCKHOLDERS

  



  

Section 1. Subject to the special rights of the holders of one or more series
of Preferred Stock with respect to such series of Preferred Stock, any action
required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must
be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of the stockholders of
the Corporation, and may not be effected by any consent in writing by such
stockholders, _provided_ , _however_ , that the taking of any action that is
required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation at
any annual or special meeting of stockholders may be effected by written
consent of stockholders in lieu of a meeting if such action and the taking of
such action by written consent of stockholders in lieu of a meeting have each
been expressly approved in advance by the Board.

rights of the holders of one or more series of Preferred Stock, special

 _ARTICLE VII_

  

LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION

  



  

Section 1. Right to Indemnification of Directors and Officers. The
Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law as it presently exists or may hereafter be
amended, any person (an " _Indemnified Person_ ") who was or is made or is
threatened to be made a party or is otherwise involved in any action, suit or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a _"
Proceeding"_), by reason of the fact that such person, or a person for whom
such person is the legal representative, is or was a director or officer of
the Corporation or, while a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was
serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or
agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, limited
liability company, trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity, including service
with respect to employee benefit plans, against all liability and loss
suffered and expenses (including attorneys\' fees) reasonably incurred by such
Indemnified Person in such Proceeding. Notwithstanding the preceding
sentence, except as otherwise provided in Section 3 of this Article VII, the
Corporation shall be required to indemnify an Indemnified Person in
connection with a Proceeding (or part thereof) commenced by such
Indemnified Person only if the commencement of such Proceeding (or part
thereof) by the Indemnified Person was authorized in advance by the Board.

  



  

Section 2. Prepayment of Expenses of Directors and Officers. The Corporation
shall pay the expenses (including attorneys\' fees) incurred by an Indemnified
Person in defending any Proceeding in advance of its final disposition,
provided, however, that, to the extent required by law, such payment of
expenses in advance of the final disposition of the Proceeding shall be made
only upon receipt of an undertaking by the Indemnified Person to repay all
amounts advanced if it should be ultimately determined that the Indemnified
Person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article VII or otherwise.

  



  

Section 3. Claims by Directors and Officers. If a claim for indemnification
or advancement of expenses under this Article VII is not paid in full within
30 days after a written claim therefor by the Indemnified Person has been
received by the Corporation, the Indemnified Person may file suit to recover
the unpaid amount of such claim and, if successful in whole or in part, shall
be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim. In any such
action the Corporation shall have the burden of proving that the Indemnified
Person is not entitled to the requested indemnification or advancement of
expenses under applicable law.

  



  

Section 4. Indemnification of Employees and Agents. The Corporation may
indemnify and advance expenses to any person who was or is made or is
threatened to be made or is otherwise involved in any Proceeding by reason of
the fact that such person, or a person for whom such person is the legal
representative, is or was an employee or agent of the Corporation or, while
an employee or agent of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of
the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, limited liability company,
trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity, including service with respect to
employee benefit plans, against all liability and loss suffered and expenses
(including attorney\'s fees) reasonably incurred by such person in connection
with such Proceeding. The ultimate determination of entitlement to
indemnification of persons who are non-director or officer employees
or agents shall be made in such manner as is determined by the Board in its
sole discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the Corporation
shall not be required to indemnify a person in connection with a Proceeding
initiated by such person if the Proceeding was not authorized in advance by
the Board.

  



  

Section 5. Advancement of Expenses of Employees and Agents. The Corporation
may pay the expenses (including attorney\'s fees) incurred by an employee or
agent in defending any Proceeding in advance of its final disposition on such
terms and conditions as may be determined by the Board.

  



  

Section 6. Non-Exclusivity of Rights. The rights conferred on any person by
this Article VII shall not be exclusive of any other rights which such person
may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of this Second
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, by-laws, agreement, vote
of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

  



  

   

 | 5| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 7. Other Indemnification. The Corporation\'s obligation, if any, to
indemnify any person who was or is serving at its request as a director,
officer or employee of another Corporation, partnership, limited liability
company, joint venture, trust, organization or other enterprise shall
be reduced by any amount such person may collect as indemnification from such
other Corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture,
trust, organization or other enterprise.

  



  

Section 8. Insurance. The Board may, to the full extent permitted by
applicable law as it presently exists, or may hereafter be amended from time
to time, authorize an appropriate officer or officers to purchase and
maintain at the Corporation\'s expense insurance: (i) to indemnify the
Corporation for any obligation which it incurs as a result of the
indemnification of directors, officers and employees under the provisions of
this Article VII; and (ii) to indemnify or insure directors, officers and
employees against liability in instances in which they may not otherwise be
indemnified by the Corporation under the provisions of this Article VII.

  



  

Section 9. Amendment or Repeal. Any repeal or modification of the foregoing
provisions of this Article VII shall not adversely affect any right or
protection hereunder of any person in respect of any act or omission occurring
prior to the time of such repeal or modification. The rights provided
hereunder shall inure to the benefit of any Indemnified Person and such
person\'s heirs, executors and administrators.

  



  

Section 10. Severability. If any provision or provisions of this Article VII
shall be held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason
whatsoever: (i) the validity, legality, and enforceability of the remaining
provisions of this Article VII (including, without limitation, each portion
of any paragraph or clause containing any such provision held to be invalid,
illegal, or unenforceable, that is not itself held to be invalid, illegal, or
unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby; and (ii)
to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Article VII
(including, without limitation, each such portion of any paragraph or
clause containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal, or
unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the
intent manifested by the provision held invalid, illegal, or unenforceable.

  



  

Section 11. Contract Rights. The rights provided to Indemnified Persons
pursuant to this Article VII shall be contract rights and such rights
shall continue as to an Indemnified Person who has ceased to be a director,
officer, agent or employee and shall inure to the benefit of such Indemnified
Person's heirs, executors and administrators.

  



  

Any amendment, repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this
Article VII shall not adversely affect any right or protection of any
director, officer or other agent of the Corporation existing at the time of
such amendment, repeal or modification.

  



  

 _ARTICLE VIII_

Section 1.

  



  

(a) In recognition and anticipation that (i) certain directors, principals,
officers, employees and/or other representatives of the Stockholder Parties
and their Affiliates (each, as defined in this Article VIII, and together,
the " _Identified Persons_ ") may serve as directors of the Corporation and
(ii) the Identified Persons may now engage and may continue to engage in the
same or similar activities or related lines of business as those in which the
Corporation, directly or indirectly, may engage or propose to engage
and/or other business activities that overlap with or compete with those in
which the Corporation or any of its Affiliates, directly or indirectly, may
engage or propose to engage, the provisions of this Article VIII are set forth
to regulate and define the conduct of certain affairs of the Corporation with
respect to certain classes or categories of business opportunities as they may
involve any of the Identified Persons and the powers, rights, duties and
liabilities of the Corporation and its directors, officers and stockholders
in connection therewith.

  



  

(b) No Identified Persons shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, have
any duty to refrain from directly or indirectly (i) engaging in the same or
similar business activities or lines of business in which the Corporation or
any of its Affiliates now engages or proposes to engage or (ii)
otherwise competing with the Corporation or any of its Affiliates, and, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, no Identified Person shall be liable to
the Corporation or its stockholders or to any Affiliate of the Corporation for
breach of any fiduciary duty solely by reason of the fact that such
Identified Person engages in any such activities. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, the Corporation hereby renounces any interest or expectancy

(c) Without limiting the foregoing renunciation in Section 1(a) hereof, the
Corporation on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries (i) acknowledges that the
Stockholder Parties are in the business of making investments in, and have or
may have investments in, other businesses that may be similar to and that may
compete with the businesses of the Corporation and its subsidiaries ("
_Competing Businesses_ ") and (b) agrees that the Stockholder Parties shall
have the unfettered right to make investments in or have relationships with
other Competing Businesses independent of their investments in the
Corporation.

  



  

(d) In addition to and notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
Article VIII, a potential corporate opportunity shall not be deemed to be a
corporate opportunity for the Corporation if it is a business opportunity
that (i) the Corporation is neither financially or legally able, nor
contractually permitted to undertake, (ii) from its nature, is not in the
line of the Corporation's business or is of no practical advantage to the
Corporation or (iii) is one in which the Corporation has no interest or
reasonable expectancy.

  



  

(d) Any amendment, repeal or modification of this Article VIII, or the
adoption of any provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation inconsistent with this Article VIII, shall not adversely affect
any right or protection of an Identified Person with respect to any act or
omission occurring prior to such amendment, repeal, modification or adoption.

  



  

(e) For purposes of this Article VIII,  " _Affiliate_ " shall mean (a) in
respect of any Stockholder Party, any person that, directly or indirectly, is
controlled by a Stockholder Party, controls a Stockholder Party or is under
common control with a Stockholder Party and shall include any principal,
member, director, partner, stockholder, officer, employee or other
representative of any of the foregoing (other than the Corporation and any
entity that is controlled by the Corporation), (b) in respect of a non-
employee Director, any person that, directly or indirectly, is controlled by
such non-employee Director (other than the Corporation and any entity that is
controlled by the Corporation) and (c) in respect of the Corporation, any
person that, directly or indirectly, is controlled by the Corporation.

  



  

(f) For purposes of this Article VIII,  " _control, "_ including the terms "
_controlling_ _,_ " " _controlled by_ " and " _under common control with_ _,_
" means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or
cause the direction of the management and policies of a person, whether
through the ownership of voting stock, by contract, or otherwise. A person
who is the owner of 20% or more of the outstanding voting stock of any
corporation, partnership, unincorporated association or other entity shall be
presumed to have control of such entity, in the absence of proof by a
preponderance of the evidence to the contrary. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
a presumption of control shall not apply where such person holds voting
stock, in good faith and not for the purpose of circumventing this Section, as
an agent, bank, broker, nominee, custodian or trustee for one or more owners
who do not individually or as a group have control of such entity.

  



  

(g) For the purposes of this Article VIII,  " _Stockholder Party_ " shall

Delaware (or, in the event that the Chancery Court does not have jurisdiction,
the federal district court for the District of Delaware or other state courts
of the State of Delaware) shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be
the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action, suit or
proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (ii) any action, suit or
proceeding asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any
director, officer or stockholder of the Corporation to the Corporation or to
the Corporation's stockholders, (iii) any action, suit or proceeding arising
pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or this Second Amended and Restated

to time) or (iv) any action, suit or proceeding asserting a claim against the
Corporation governed by the internal affairs doctrine; and (b) subject to the
preceding provisions of this Article IX, the federal district courts of the
United States of America shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of

scope of clause (a) of the immediately preceding sentence is filed in a court
other than the courts in the State of Delaware (a " _Foreign Action_ ") in the
name of any stockholder, such stockholder shall be deemed to have consented
to (x) the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in the
State of Delaware in connection with any action brought in any such court to
enforce the provisions of clause (a) of the immediately preceding sentence
and (y) having service of process made upon such stockholder in any such
action by service upon such stockholder's counsel in the Foreign Action as

Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any
security of the Corporation shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to

Article IX shall not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty
created by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any other
claim for which the federal courts of the United States have
exclusive jurisdiction.

  



  

If any provision or provisions of this Article IX shall be held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable as applied to any circumstance for any
reason whatsoever, (a) the validity, legality and enforceability of such
provisions in any other circumstance and of the remaining provisions of
this Article IX (including, without limitation, each portion of any paragraph
of this Article IX containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal
or unenforceable that is not itself held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby and (b)
the application of such provision to other persons or entities and
circumstances shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

  



  

 _ARTICLE X 
 _BYLAWS

  



  

In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by statute, the

 _ARTICLE XI_

  

AMENDMENTS

Certificate of Incorporation or any provision of law which might otherwise
permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any affirmative vote of
the holders of any particular class or series of the Voting Stock required by
law or by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
(including any Certificate of Designation in respect of one or more series of
Preferred Stock), the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six
and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the voting power of all of the then-

the Bylaws.

  



  

 _ARTICLE XII_

  



  

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, if any provision of this
Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation becomes or is
declared on any ground by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal,
unenforceable or void, portions of such provision, or such provision in its
entirety, to the extent necessary, shall be severed from this Second Amended
and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, and the court will replace such
illegal, void or unenforceable provision of this Second Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation with a valid and enforceable provision
that most accurately reflects the Corporation's intent, in order to achieve,
to the maximum extent possible, the same economic, business and other purposes
of the illegal, void or unenforceable provision. To the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, the balance of this Second Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation shall be enforceable in accordance with its
terms.

2.1   _Place of Meetings_

  



  

All meetings of the stockholders of the Corporation (the " _stockholders_ ")
shall be held at such place, if any, within or outside the State of Delaware,
designated by the Board. The Board may, in its sole discretion, determine that
a meeting of stockholders shall not be held at any place, but may instead be

_DGCL__ "). In the absence of any such designation or determination,
stockholders' meetings shall be held at the Corporation's principal executive

The annual meeting of the stockholders for the election of directors and for

any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board.

  



  

   



 



    



  

2.4   _Notice of Stockholders ' Meetings_

by electronic transmission pursuant to this Section 2.5 shall be deemed given:
(i) if by facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a facsimile
telecommunication number at which the stockholder has consented to receive
notice; (ii) if by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail
address at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (iii) if by
posting on an electronic network together with separate notice to the
stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later of (A) such posting and
(B) the giving of such separate notice; and (iv) if by any other form of
electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder. An affidavit of
the secretary or an assistant secretary or of the transfer agent or other
agent of the Corporation that notice has been given pursuant to this Section
2.5 shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts
stated therein. Notice shall be deemed to have been given to all stockholders
of record who share an address if notice is given in accordance with the

Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "), and Section 233 of the
DGCL.

Unless otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these
Bylaws, the holders of a majority in voting power of the stock issued and

communication, if applicable, or represented by proxy, shall constitute
a quorum for the transaction of business at all meetings of the stockholders.
Except as otherwise required by applicable law, by the Certificate of
Incorporation, or by these Bylaws, where a separate vote by one or more series
or classes of capital stock of the Corporation is required, the holders of a
majority of the voting power of the shares of such one or more series or
classes of capital stock of the Corporation issued and outstanding and
entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall
constitute a quorum entitled to take action with respect to the vote on such
matter. A quorum, once established, shall not be broken by the withdrawal of
enough votes to leave less than a quorum.

  



  

If, _however_ , a quorum is not present or represented at any meeting of the
stockholders, then _either_ (i) the chairperson of the meeting or (ii) the
holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares of capital stock of
the Corporation entitled to vote at the meeting, present in person, or by
remote communication, if applicable, or represented by proxy, shall have power
to adjourn the meeting to another place (if any), date or time, without
notice other than as specified in Section 2.7.

  



  

   

 | 2|

2.7   _Adjourned Meeting; Notice_

  



  

When an annual or special meeting of stockholders is adjourned to another
time or place, if any, date or time, unless these Bylaws otherwise require,
notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the date, time, place,
if any, thereof, and the means of remote communications, if any, by which
stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person, or by
remote communication, if applicable, and vote at such adjourned meeting are
announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At any adjourned
meeting, the Corporation may transact any business which might have been
transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than
thirty (30) days, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each
stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. If after the
adjournment a new record date for determination of stockholders entitled to
vote is fixed for the adjourned meeting, the Board shall fix a new record
date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting
the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders
entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and shall give notice of the
adjourned meeting to each stockholder of record as of the record date so fixed
for notice of such adjourned meeting.

  



  

2.8   _Conduct of Business_

  



  

(i)  At each meeting of the stockholders, the chairperson of
the Board, or, in the absence of the chairperson of the Board, the CEO, or in
the absence of the chairperson of the Board and the CEO, such person as shall
be selected by the Board, shall act as chairperson of the meeting. The order
of business at each such meeting shall be as determined by the chairperson of
the meeting. The chairperson of the meeting shall have the right and
authority to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all
such acts and things as are necessary or desirable for the proper conduct of
the meeting, including, without limitation, the establishment of procedures
for the maintenance of order and safety, limitations on the time allotted to
questions or comments on the affairs of the Corporation, restrictions on
entry to such meeting after the time prescribed for the commencement
thereof and the opening and closing of the voting polls.

  



  

(ii)  The date and time of the opening and the closing of the
polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at a meeting
shall be announced at the meeting by the chairperson of the meeting. The Board
may adopt by resolution such rules and regulations for the conduct of any
meeting of stockholders as it shall deem appropriate, provided such rules and
regulations are not inconsistent with any other provision of these Bylaws,
the Certificate of Incorporation or applicable law. Except to the extent
inconsistent with such rules and regulations as adopted by the Board, the
chairperson of any meeting of stockholders shall have the right and authority
to convene and (for any or no reason) to recess and/or adjourn the meeting
(whether or not a quorum is present), to prescribe such rules, regulations
and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such
chairperson, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting. Such
rules, regulations or procedures, whether adopted by the Board or prescribed
by the chairperson of the meeting, may include, among other things, the
following: (i) the establishment of an agenda or order of business for
the meeting; (ii) rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting
and the safety of those present; (iii) limitations on attendance at or
participation in the meeting to stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting,
their duly authorized and constituted proxies or such other persons as the
chairperson of the meeting shall determine; (iv) restrictions on entry to the
meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof; (v) restrictions
on the dissemination of solicitation materials and use of audio or
visual recording devices at the meeting; and (vi) limitations on the time
allotted to questions or comments by participants and on
stockholder proposals. Unless and to the extent determined by the Board or
the chairperson of the meeting, meetings of stockholders shall not be
required to be held in accordance with the rules of parliamentary procedure.

  



  

(iii)  The chairperson of any meeting of stockholders shall have
the power and duty to determine all matters relating to the conduct of the
meeting, including determining whether any nomination or item of business has
been properly brought before the meeting in accordance with these Bylaws
(including whether the stockholder or beneficial owner, if any, on whose
behalf the nomination is made or proposal solicited or is part of a group
that solicited or did not so solicit, as the case may be, proxies in support
of such stockholder's nominee or proposal in compliance with such
stockholder's representation as required by Section 2.13(i)(c)(3)(I)). If the
chairperson of the meeting determines and declares that any nomination or item
of business has not been properly brought before a meeting of stockholders,
then such nomination shall be disregarded and such business shall not be
transacted or considered at such meeting. Unless and to the extent determined
by the Board or the chairperson of the meeting, meetings of stockholders
shall not be required to be held in accordance with the rules of parliamentary
procedure. The chairperson of the meeting shall act in his or her absolute
discretion, and his or her rulings shall not be subject to appeal.

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

2.9   _Voting_

  



  

Except as may be otherwise provided by law or by the Certificate of
Incorporation, each stockholder of record of any series of Preferred Stock
shall be entitled at each meeting of the stockholders to such number of
votes, if any, for each share of such stock as may be fixed in the
Certificate of Incorporation (or relevant Certificate of Designation) or in
the resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board providing for the issuance
of such stock, and each stockholder of record of Class A Common Stock of the
Corporation (the " _Common Stock_ ") shall be entitled to one (1) vote for
each share of capital stock held by such stockholder.

  



  

At each meeting of stockholders, each stockholder having the right to vote
shall be entitled to vote in person, by remote communication (if
applicable), or by proxy. Each stockholder shall be entitled to vote each
share of stock that has voting power and is registered in such
stockholder's name on the books of the Corporation on the record date fixed
for determination of stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting.

  



  

Directors shall be elected by a plurality in voting power of the shares
present in person or represented by proxy at a meeting of the
stockholders and entitled to vote in the election of directors, and _except_
as otherwise required by applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation or
these Bylaws, all other matters shall be determined by the affirmative vote of
the holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares of capital stock
of the Corporation present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting
and entitled to vote on the subject matter.

  



  

2.10   _Record Date for Stockholder Meetings and Other Purposes_

  



  

Except as otherwise required by applicable law, in order that the Corporation
may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at
any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof or entitled to receive
payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or
entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or
exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board
may fix, in advance, a record date, which record date shall not precede the
date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board
and, in the case of determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote
at any meeting of stockholder or any adjournment thereof, which record date
shall not be more than sixty (60) days nor less than ten (10) days before the
date of such meeting, nor in the case of any other action, more than sixty
(60) days prior to such other action; _provided_ , that the Board may
determine, at the time it fixes the record date for notice of any meeting of
stockholders, that a later date on or before the date of the meeting shall be
the date for making a determination as to which stockholders will be entitled
to vote at any such meeting of stockholders. If no record date is fixed by the
Board, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or
to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the
next day preceding the day on which notice is first given, or, if notice is
waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which
the meeting is held. Except as otherwise required by applicable law, the
record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose shall be at
the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the
resolution relating thereto. A determination of stockholders of record
entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to
any adjournment of the meeting; _provided_ , however, that the Board may fix a
new record date for the adjourned meeting; and in such case shall also fix as
the record date for stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting
the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders
entitled to vote in accordance herewith at the adjourned meeting.

  



  

   

 | 4| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Unless determined by the chairperson of the meeting to be advisable, the vote
on any matter, including, without limitation, the election of directors, need
not be by written ballot. On a vote by written ballot, each ballot shall be
signed by the stockholder voting, or by such stockholder's proxy, and shall
state the number of shares voted and such other information as may be required
under the procedure established for the meeting or otherwise by the
chairperson of the meeting.

  



  

2.11   _Proxies_

  



  

Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders may authorize
another person or persons to act for such stockholder by an instrument in
writing or by an electronic transmission permitted by applicable law filed
with the secretary, but, no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after
three (3) years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period.
Execution of a proxy may be accomplished by the stockholder or the
stockholder's authorized officer, director, employee, or agent signing such
writing or causing such person's signature to be affixed to such writing by
any reasonable means including, but not limited to, by manual
signature, typewriting, facsimile or electronic transmission or otherwise. A
proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and
only so long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support
an irrevocable power. Proxies need not be filed with the secretary until the
meeting is called to order, but shall be filed before being voted. A
stockholder may also authorize another person or persons to act for such
stockholder as proxy by transmitting or authorizing the transmission or
electronic transmission to the person or persons who will be the holder of
the proxy or to an agent of the proxyholder(s) duly authorized by such
proxyholder(s) to receive such transmission; _provided_ , however, that any
such writing or electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted
with information from which it can be determined that the writing or
electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder. If it is
determined that any such writing or electronic transmission is valid, the
inspectors or, if there are no inspectors, such other persons making that
determination, shall specify the information upon which they relied. Any
copy, facsimile telecommunication, or other reliable reproduction of a writing
or electronic transmission authorizing a person or persons to act as proxy
for a stockholder may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing
or electronic transmission for any and all purposes for which the original
writing or electronic transmission could be used; _provided_ , however,
that such copy, facsimile telecommunication, or other reproduction shall be a
complete reproduction of the entire original writing or electronic
transmission. Except as otherwise provided therein, a proxy that entitles the
agent authorized thereby to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall entitle
such agent to vote at any adjournment or postponement of such meeting but
shall not be valid after final adjournment of such meeting.

  



  

2.12   _Maintenance and Inspection of Records_

  



  

(i)  The Corporation shall, either at its principal executive
offices or at such place or places as designated by the Board, keep a record
of its stockholders listing their names and addresses and the number and class
or series of shares of capital stock of the Corporation held by each
stockholder, a copy of these Bylaws as amended to date, accounting books,
minutes of all meetings of its stockholders, the Board and any committees
thereof, a record of all actions taken by the Board or any committees
thereof without a meeting and other records.

(ii)  The Corporation shall prepare, at least ten (10) days
before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the
stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting ( _provided_ , however, that if
the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote is less
than ten (10) days before the date of the meeting, the list shall reflect the
stockholders entitled to vote as of the tenth (10th) day before the meeting
date), arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each
stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each
stockholder. The Corporation shall not be required to include electronic
mail addresses or other electronic contact information on such list. Such
list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose
germane to the meeting for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the
meeting: (i) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, _provided_ that
the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the
notice of the meeting, or (ii) during ordinary business hours, at the
Corporation's principal executive office. In the event that the
Corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic network,
the Corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is
available only to stockholders of the Corporation. If the meeting is to be
held at a place, then the list shall be produced and kept at the time and
place of the meeting during the whole time thereof and may be inspected by any
stockholder who is present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of
remote communication, then the list shall also be open to the examination of
any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably
accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such
list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting. Such list shall
presumptively determine the identity of the stockholders entitled to vote at
the meeting and the number of shares held by each of them. Except as otherwise
provided by applicable law, the stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to
who are the stockholders entitled to examine the list of
stockholders required by this Section 2.12 or to vote in person or by proxy
at any meeting of stockholders.

  



  

(iii)  Except to the extent otherwise required by law, or by the
Certificate of Incorporation, or by these Bylaws, the Board shall determine
from time to time whether and, if allowed, when and under what conditions and
regulations the stock ledger, books, records, and accounts of the
Corporation, or any of them, shall be open to inspection by the stockholders
and the stockholders' rights, if any, in respect thereof. Except as otherwise
provided by law, the stock ledger shall be the only evidence of the identity
of the stockholders entitled to examine the stock ledger, the books, records,
or accounts of the Corporation.

other information as it may reasonably require to determine the eligibility

(d) Notwithstanding anything in clause (c) of Section 2.13(i) to the

if it is received by the secretary at the principal executive offices of the
Corporation not later than the close of business on the 10th day following
the day on which such public announcement is first made by the
Corporation (it being understood that such notice must nevertheless comply
with the requirements of clause c of this Section 2.13(i).

commitment or assurance to, any person as to how such potential nominee, if
elected as a director, will act or vote on any issue or question that has not
been disclosed in such questionnaire; (b) is not and will not become a party
to any agreement, arrangement or understanding with any person other than the
Corporation with respect to any direct or indirect compensation,

full term for which such person is standing for election.

  



  

(iii)  Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting
of stockholders as has been specified in the notice of meeting (or any

Section 2.4. Nominations of persons for election to the Board may be made at
a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected

at the meeting and upon such election and who complies with the requirements
set forth in Sections Section 2.13(i)(c) and 2.13(ii) as if such requirements
referred to such special meeting of stockholders; _provided_ , however, that
to be considered timely notice under this clause (iii), a stockholder's
notice must be received by the secretary at the principal executive offices
of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the 10th day
following the day on which public announcement of the date of such special
meeting was first made. This clause (iii) shall be the exclusive means for a
stockholder to make nominations or other business proposals before a special
meeting of stockholders (other than matters properly brought under Rule 14a-8
under the Exchange Act and included in the Corporation's notice of meeting).

  



  

   

 | 9|

(iv)  Only such persons who are nominated for election or re-
election as a director of the Corporation in accordance with the procedures,
and who meet the other qualifications, set forth in Section 2.13 (i) and (ii)
shall be eligible to stand for election as directors and only such business
shall be conducted at a meeting of stockholders as has been brought before the
meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in these Bylaws.

  



  

(v)  Without limiting the applicability of the foregoing
provisions of this Section 2.13, a stockholder who seeks to have any proposal
or potential nominee included in the Corporation's proxy materials must
provide notice as required by and otherwise comply with the applicable
requirements of the rules and regulations under the Exchange Act. Except for
the immediately preceding sentence, nothing in this Section 2.13 shall be
deemed to affect any rights of (a) stockholders to request inclusion of
proposals in the Corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under
the Exchange Act; or (b) the holders of any outstanding class or series of
Preferred Stock, voting as a class separately from the holders of Common
Stock, to elect directors pursuant to any applicable provisions of such
series of Preferred Stock or the Certificate of Incorporation. Subject to Rule
14a-8 under the Exchange Act, nothing in these Bylaws shall be construed to
permit any stockholder, or give any stockholder the right, to include or have
disseminated or described in the Corporation's proxy statement any nomination
of director or directors or any other business proposal.

  



  

(vi)  For purposes of this Section 2.13, "public announcement"
means disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service,

Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section
13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

  



  

2.14   _Requirement to Appear_

  



  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 2.13 if a
stockholder that has provided timely notice of a nomination or item of
business in accordance with Section 2.13 (or a qualified representative of
such stockholder) does not appear at the annual or special meeting of
stockholders to present such nomination or item of business, such nomination
shall be disregarded and such proposed business shall not be transacted,
notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by
the Corporation. For purposes of this Section 2.14, to be considered a
qualified representative of a stockholder, a person must be a duly authorized
officer, manager or partner of such stockholder or must be authorized by a
writing executed by such stockholder or an electronic transmission delivered
by such stockholder to act for such stockholder as proxy at the meeting of
stockholders and such person must produce such writing or electronic
transmission, or reliable reproduction of the writing or electronic
transmission, at the meeting of stockholders.

  



  

2.15   _Inspectors of Election_

  



  

Before any meeting of stockholders, the Corporation shall appoint one or more
inspectors of election to act at the meeting or any adjournment thereof and
make a written report thereof. The Corporation may designate one or more
persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. If
any person appointed as inspector or any alternate fails to appear or fails or
refuses to act, then the chairperson of the meeting shall appoint a person to
fill that vacancy. Such inspectors shall:

  



  

(i)  determine the number of shares outstanding and the
voting power of each, the number of shares represented at the meeting and the
validity of any proxies and ballots;

the disposition of any challenges made to any determination by the
inspector(s); and

  



  

(v)  certify its or their determination of the number of shares
represented at the meeting and its or their count of all votes and ballots.

  



  

Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of the duties of
inspector, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of
inspection with strict impartiality and according to the best of such
inspector's ability. Any report or certificate made by the inspectors of
election is prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. The inspectors
of election may appoint such persons to assist them in performing their
duties as they determine.

  



  

2.16   _Remote Communication_

  



  

For the purposes of these Bylaws, if authorized by the Board in its sole
discretion, and subject to such guidelines and procedures as the Board
may adopt, stockholders and proxyholders may, by means of remote
communication:

  



  

(i)  participate in a meeting of stockholders; and

  



  

(ii)  be deemed present in person and vote at a meeting of
stockholders whether such meeting is to be held at a designated place or
solely by means of remote communication, _provided_ that (a) the Corporation
shall implement reasonable measures to verify that each person deemed present
and permitted to vote at the meeting by means of remote communication is a
stockholder or proxyholder; (b) the Corporation shall implement reasonable
measures to provide such stockholders and proxyholders a reasonable
opportunity to participate in the meeting and to vote on matters submitted to
the stockholders, including an opportunity to read or hear the proceedings of
the meeting substantially concurrently with such proceedings; and (c) if any
stockholder or proxyholder votes or takes other action at the meeting by
means of remote communication, a record of such vote or other action shall be
maintained by the Corporation.

these Bylaws and subject to the applicable provisions of the Stockholders
Agreement, when one or more directors so resigns and the resignation
is effective at a future date or upon the happening of an event to occur on a
future date, a majority of the directors then in office, including those who
have so resigned, shall have power to fill such vacancy or vacancies, the vote
thereon to take effect when such resignation or resignations shall become

director. Any director appointed in accordance with the preceding sentence
shall hold office for the remainder of the term of the class, if any, to which
the director is appointed and until such director's successor shall have been

Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, a written waiver
thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice, or a waiver by electronic
transmission by such person, whether before or after the time stated therein,
shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting
shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person

permitted by applicable law as it presently exists or may hereafter be
amended, any person (an "Indemnified Person") who was or is made or is
threatened to be made a party or is otherwise involved in any action, suit or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a
"Proceeding"), by reason of the fact that such person, or a person for whom
such person is the legal representative, is or was a director or officer of
the Corporation or, while a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was
serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or
agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, limited
liability company, trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity, including service
with respect to employee benefit plans, against all liability and loss
suffered and expenses (including attorneys\' fees) reasonably incurred by

sentence, except as otherwise provided in Section 3 of this Article Ninth,
the Corporation shall be required to indemnify an Indemnified Person in
connection with a Proceeding (or part thereof) commenced by such Indemnified
Person only if the commencement of such Proceeding (or part thereof) by the

---|---|--- 
  



   | 2.| _Prepayment of Expenses of Directors and Officers_. The
Corporation shall pay the expenses (including attorneys\' fees) incurred by
an Indemnified Person in defending any Proceeding in advance of its final
disposition, provided, however, that, to the extent required by law, such
payment of expenses in advance of the final disposition of the
Proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by the
Indemnified Person to repay all amounts advanced if it should be
ultimately determined that the Indemnified Person is not entitled to be
indemnified under this Article Ninth or otherwise. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 3.| _Claims by Directors and Officers_. If a claim for
indemnification or advancement of expenses under this Article Ninth is not
paid in full within 30 days after a written claim therefor by the Indemnified
Person has been received by the Corporation, the Indemnified Person may file
suit to recover the unpaid amount of such claim and, if successful in
whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting
such claim. In any such action the Corporation shall have the burden of
proving that the Indemnified Person is not entitled to the requested
indemnification or advancement of expenses under applicable law. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 4.| _Indemnification of Employees and Agents_. The Corporation may
indemnify and advance expenses to any person who was or is made or is
threatened to be made or is otherwise involved in any Proceeding by reason of
the fact that such person, or a person for whom such person is the legal
representative, is or was an employee or agent of the Corporation or, while
an employee or agent of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of
the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, limited liability company,
trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity, including service with respect to
employee benefit plans, against all liability and loss suffered and expenses
(including attorney\'s fees) reasonably incurred by such person in connection
with such Proceeding. The ultimate determination of entitlement to
indemnification of persons who are non-director or officer employees or
agents shall be made in such manner as is determined by the Board of
Directors in its sole discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the
Corporation shall not be required to indemnify a person in connection with a
Proceeding initiated by such person if the Proceeding was not authorized in
advance by the Board of Directors. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   



 



    



   | 5.| _Advancement of Expenses of Employees and Agents_. The
Corporation may pay the expenses (including attorney\'s fees) incurred by an
employee or agent in defending any Proceeding in advance of its final
disposition on such terms and conditions as may be determined by the Board of
Directors.

   | 6.| _Non-Exclusivity of Rights_. The rights conferred on any person
by this Article Ninth shall not be exclusive of any other rights which such
person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of this
Certificate of Incorporation, by-laws, agreement, vote of stockholders or
disinterested directors or otherwise. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 7.| _Other Indemnification_. The Corporation\'s obligation, if any,
to indemnify any person who was or is serving at its request as a director,
officer or employee of another Corporation, partnership, limited liability
company, joint venture, trust, organization or other enterprise shall be
reduced by any amount such person may collect as indemnification from such
other Corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture,
trust, organization or other enterprise. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 8.| _Insurance_. The Board of Directors may, to the full extent
permitted by applicable law as it presently exists, or may hereafter be
amended from time to time, authorize an appropriate officer or officers to
purchase and maintain at the Corporation\'s expense insurance: (a) to
indemnify the Corporation for any obligation which it incurs as a result of
the indemnification of directors, officers and employees under the provisions
of this Article Ninth; and (b) to indemnify or insure directors, officers and
employees against liability in instances in which they may not otherwise be
indemnified by the Corporation under the provisions of this Article Ninth. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 9.| _Amendment or Repeal_. Any repeal or modification of the
foregoing provisions of this Article Ninth shall not adversely affect any
right or protection hereunder of any person in respect of any act or omission
occurring prior to the time of such repeal or modification. The rights
provided hereunder shall inure to the benefit of any Indemnified Person and
such person\'s heirs, executors and administrators.

TENTH: The Corporation renounces any interest or expectancy of the
Corporation in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any
Excluded Opportunity. An "Excluded Opportunity" is any matter, transaction or
interest that is presented to, or acquired, created or developed by, or which
otherwise comes into the possession of, any director of the Corporation who is

"Covered Persons"), unless such matter, transaction or interest is presented
to, or acquired, created or developed by, or otherwise comes into the
possession of, a Covered Person expressly and solely in such Covered
Person\'s capacity as a director of the Corporation.

BYLAWS

  



  

OF

  



  

CARLOTZ SUB, INC.

  



  



  



  

ARTICLE I 
  
  _Meetings of Stockholders_

  



  

Section 1.1.   _Annual Meetings_. If required by applicable law, an
annual meeting of stockholders of CarLotz Sub, Inc. (the  " _Corporation_ ")
shall be held for the election of directors at such date, time and place, if
any, either within or without the State of Delaware, as may be designated by
resolution of the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the " _Board of
Directors_ ") from time to time. Any other proper business may be transacted
at the annual meeting. The Board of Directors may postpone, reschedule or
cancel any annual meeting of stockholders previously scheduled by the Board of
Directors.

  



  

Section 1.2.   _Special Meetings_. Special meetings of stockholders
for any purpose or purposes may be called at any time by the Board of
Directors, but such special meetings may not be called by any other person or
persons. Business transacted at any special meeting of stockholders shall be
limited to the purposes stated in the notice. The Board of Directors may
postpone, reschedule or cancel any special meeting of stockholders previously
scheduled by the Board of Directors.

  



  

Section 1.3.   _Notice of Meetings_. Whenever stockholders are
required or permitted to take any action at a meeting, a notice of the
meeting shall be given that shall state the place, if any, date and hour of
the meeting, the means of remote communications, if any, by which
stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote
at such meeting, the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to
vote at the meeting (if such date is different from the record date for
stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting) and, in the case of a special
meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. Unless
otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation
(as may be amended from time to time, the  " _Certificate of Incorporation_
") or these Bylaws, the notice of any meeting shall be given not less
than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting to
each stockholder entitled to vote at the meeting as of the record date for
determining the stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting. If mailed,
such notice shall be deemed to be given when deposited in the United States
mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at such stockholder\'s
address as it appears on the records of the Corporation.

  



  

Section 1.4.   _Adjournments_. Any meeting of stockholders, annual or
special, may adjourn from time to time to reconvene at the same or some other
place, and notice need not be given of any such adjourned meeting if the time
and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is
taken. At the adjourned meeting the Corporation may transact any business
which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment
is for more than thirty (30) days, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be
given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. If after
the adjournment a new record date for determination of stockholders entitled
to vote is fixed for the adjourned meeting, the Board of Directors shall fix
as the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of such
adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination
of stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and shall give
notice of the adjourned meeting to each stockholder of record as of
the record date so fixed for notice of such adjourned meeting.

  



  

   



 



    



  

Section 1.5.   _Quorum_. Except as otherwise provided by law, the
Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, at each meeting of stockholders
the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority in voting
power of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote at the meeting
shall be necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum. In the absence of a
quorum, the stockholders so present may, by a majority in voting power
thereof, adjourn the meeting from time to time in the manner provided in
Section 1.4 of these Bylaws until a quorum shall attend. Shares of its own
stock belonging to the Corporation or to another Corporation, if a majority
of the shares entitled to vote in the election of directors of such other
Corporation is held, directly or indirectly, by the Corporation, shall
neither be entitled to vote nor be counted for quorum purposes; provided,
however, that the foregoing shall not limit the right of the Corporation or
any subsidiary of the Corporation to vote stock, including but not limited to
its own stock, held by it in a fiduciary capacity.

  



  

Section 1.6.   _Organization_. Meetings of stockholders shall be
presided over by the Chairperson of the Board of Directors, if any, or in his
or her absence by the Vice Chairperson of the Board of Directors, if any, or
in his or her absence by the President, or in his or her absence by a Vice
President, or in the absence of the foregoing persons by a chairperson
designated by the Board of Directors, or in the absence of such designation
by a chairperson chosen at the meeting. The Secretary shall act as
secretary of the meeting, but in his or her absence the chairperson of the
meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting.

  



  

Section 1.7.   _Voting; Proxies_. Except as otherwise provided by or
pursuant to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, each
stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be entitled
to one vote for each share of stock held by such stockholder which has voting
power upon the matter in question. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a
meeting of stockholders or to express consent to corporate action in writing
without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for
such stockholder by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon
after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer
period. A proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and
if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to
support an irrevocable power. A stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not
irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by delivering to
the Secretary of the Corporation a revocation of the proxy or a new proxy
bearing a later date. Voting at meetings of stockholders need not be by
written ballot. At all meetings of stockholders for the election of directors
at which a quorum is present a plurality of the votes cast shall be sufficient
to elect. All other elections and questions presented to the stockholders at
a meeting at which a quorum is present shall, unless otherwise provided by
the Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws, the rules or regulations of
any stock exchange applicable to the Corporation, applicable law or pursuant
to any regulation applicable to the Corporation or its securities, be decided
by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the
shares of stock of the Corporation which are present in person or by
proxy and entitled to vote thereon.

Section 1.8.   _Fixing Date for Determination of Stockholders of
Record_.

  



  

(a)  In order that the Corporation may determine the
stockholders entitled to notice of any meeting of stockholders or any
adjournment thereof, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which
record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the
record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date shall,
unless otherwise required by law, not be more than sixty (60) nor less than
ten (10) days before the date of such meeting. If the Board of Directors so
fixes a date, such date shall also be the record date for determining the
stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting unless the Board of Directors
determines, at the time it fixes such record date, that a later date on or
before the date of the meeting shall be the date for making
such determination. If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the
record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at
a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next
preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the
close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is
held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to
vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the
meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record
date for determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned
meeting, and in such case shall also fix as the record date for stockholders
entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as
that fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to vote in accordance
herewith at the adjourned meeting.

  



  

(b)  In order that the Corporation may determine the
stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other
distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights
in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose
of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date,
which shall not be more than sixty (60) days prior to such other action. If
no such record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for
any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the
Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.

  



  

(c)  Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of
Incorporation, in order that the Corporation may determine the
stockholders entitled to express consent to corporate action in writing
without a meeting, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record
date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record
date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date shall not be
more than ten (10) days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the
record date is adopted by the Board of Directors. If no record date for
determining stockholders entitled to express consent to corporate action in
writing without a meeting is fixed by the Board of Directors, (i) when no
prior action of the Board of Directors is required by law, the record date
for such purpose shall be the first date on which a signed written consent
setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the
Corporation in accordance with applicable law, and (ii) if prior action by the
Board of Directors is required by law, the record date for such purpose shall
be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts
the resolution taking such prior action.

Section 1.9.   _List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote_. The officer
who has charge of the stock ledger shall prepare and make, at least ten (10)
days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders
entitled to vote at the meeting (provided, however, if the record date for
determining the stockholders entitled to vote is less than ten (10) days
before the date of the meeting, the list shall reflect the stockholders
entitled to vote as of the tenth day before the meeting date), arranged in
alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number
of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open
to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting
at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting (i) on a reasonably accessible
electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to
such list is provided with the notice of meeting or (ii) during ordinary
business hours at the principal place of business of the Corporation. If the
meeting is to be held at a place, then a list of stockholders entitled to vote
at the meeting shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the
meeting during the whole time thereof and may be examined by any stockholder
who is present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote
communication, then the list shall also be open to the examination of any
stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible
electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be
provided with the notice of the meeting. Except as otherwise provided by law,
the stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders
entitled to examine the list of stockholders required by this Section 1.9 or
to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of stockholders.

  



  

Section 1.10.   _Action By Written Consent of Stockholders_. Unless
otherwise restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation, any action required
or permitted to be taken at any annual or special meeting of the stockholders
may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a
consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be
signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum
number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a
meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted
and shall be delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered
office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or an
officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which
minutes of proceedings of stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the
Corporation\'s registered office shall be by hand or by certified or
registered mail, return receipt requested. Prompt notice of the taking of the
corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent
shall, to the extent required by law, be given to those stockholders who have
not consented in writing and who, if the action had been taken at a meeting,
would have been entitled to notice of the meeting if the record date for
notice of such meeting had been the date that written consents signed by a
sufficient number of holders to take the action were delivered to the
Corporation.

  



  

Section 1.11.   _Inspectors of Election_. The Corporation may, and shall
if required by law, in advance of any meeting of stockholders, appoint one or
more inspectors of election, who may be employees of the Corporation, to act
at the meeting or any adjournment thereof and to make a written report
thereof. The Corporation may designate one or more persons as alternate
inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. In the event that no
inspector so appointed or designated is able to act at a meeting of
stockholders, the person presiding at the meeting shall appoint one or more
inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before entering upon the
discharge of his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath to execute
faithfully the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to
the best of his or her ability. The inspector or inspectors so appointed or
designated shall (i) ascertain the number of shares of capital stock of the
Corporation outstanding and the voting power of each such share, (ii)
determine the shares of capital stock of the Corporation represented at the
meeting and the validity of proxies and ballots, (iii) count all votes and
ballots, (iv) determine and retain for a reasonable period a record of the
disposition of any challenges made to any determination by the inspectors,
and (v) certify their determination of the number of shares of capital stock
of the Corporation represented at the meeting and such inspectors' count of
all votes and ballots. Such certification and report shall specify such other
information as may be required by law. In determining the validity and
counting of proxies and ballots cast at any meeting of stockholders of the
Corporation, the inspectors may consider such information as is permitted by
applicable law. No person who is a candidate for an office at an election may
serve as an inspector at such election.

Section 1.12.   _Conduct of Meetings_. The date and time of the opening
and the closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will
vote at a meeting shall be announced at the meeting by the person presiding
over the meeting. The Board of Directors may adopt by resolution such rules
and regulations for the conduct of the meeting of stockholders as it shall
deem appropriate. Except to the extent inconsistent with such rules and
regulations as adopted by the Board of Directors, the person presiding
over any meeting of stockholders shall have the right and authority to
convene and (for any or no reason) to recess and/or adjourn the meeting, to
prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as,
in the judgment of such presiding person, are appropriate for the proper
conduct of the meeting. Such rules, regulations or procedures, whether adopted
by the Board of Directors or prescribed by the presiding person of the
meeting, may include, without limitation, the following: (i) the establishment
of an agenda or order of business for the meeting; (ii) rules and procedures
for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present; (iii)
limitations on attendance at or participation in the meeting to stockholders
entitled to vote at the meeting, their duly authorized and constituted
proxies or such other persons as the presiding person of the meeting shall
determine; (iv) restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for
the commencement thereof; and (v) limitations on the time allotted to
questions or comments by participants. The presiding person at any meeting of
stockholders, in addition to making any other determinations that may be
appropriate to the conduct of the meeting, shall, if the facts warrant,
determine and declare to the meeting that a matter or business was not
properly brought before the meeting and if such presiding person should so
determine, such presiding person shall so declare to the meeting and any such
matter or business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be
transacted or considered. Unless and to the extent determined by the Board of
Directors or the person presiding over the meeting, meetings of stockholders
shall not be required to be held in accordance with the rules of parliamentary
procedure.

The Plan is further intended to provide flexibility to the Company in its

required to avoid the imposition of additional taxes under Section 409A, the

ARTICLE 3 
 SHARES SUBJECT TO THE PLAN

  



  

3.1   _Number of Shares_.

  



   | (a)| Subject to Sections 3.1(b) and 12.2 the aggregate number of
Shares which may be issued or transferred pursuant to Awards under the Plan
is [●]1. The number of Shares available for issuance under the Plan will be
automatically increased on the first day of each fiscal year beginning with
the 2022 fiscal year, in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) two percent (2)%
of the outstanding Shares on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal
year and (ii) such number of Shares determined by the Board. Any Shares
distributed pursuant to an Award may consist, in whole or in part, of
authorized and unissued Common Stock, treasury Common Stock or Common Stock
purchased on the open market. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the aggregate
number of Shares which may be issued or transferred pursuant to Awards under
the Plan in the form of Incentive Stock Options shall be [●]2. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| If any Shares subject to an Award are forfeited or expire, are
converted to shares of another person in connection with a recapitalization,
reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination,
exchange of shares or other similar event, or such Award is settled for cash
(in whole or in part) (including Shares repurchased by the Company
under Section 7.4 at the same price paid by the Holder), the Shares subject
to such Award shall, to the extent of such forfeiture, expiration, conversion
or cash settlement, again be available for future grants of Awards under the
Plan. In addition, the following Shares shall be added to the Shares
authorized for grant under Section 3.1(a) and shall be available for future
grants of Awards: (i) Shares tendered by a Holder or withheld by the Company
in payment of the exercise price of an Option; (ii) Shares tendered by
the Holder or withheld by the Company to satisfy any tax withholding
obligation with respect to an Award; (iii) Shares subject to a Stock
Appreciation Right or other stock-settled Award (including Awards that may be
settled in cash or stock) that are not issued in connection with the
settlement or exercise, as applicable, of the Stock Appreciation Right or
other stock-settled Award; and (iv) Shares purchased on the open market by
the Company with the cash proceeds received from the exercise of Options. Any
Shares repurchased by the Company under Section 7.4 at the same price paid by
the Holder so that such Shares are returned to the Company shall again be
available for Awards. The payment of Dividend Equivalents in cash in
conjunction with any outstanding Awards shall not be counted against the
Shares available for issuance under the Plan. Notwithstanding the provisions
of this Section 3.1(b), no Shares may again be optioned, granted or awarded
if such action would cause an Incentive Stock Option to fail to qualify as an
incentive stock option under Section 422 of the Code. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (c)| Substitute Awards may be granted on such terms as the
Administrator deems appropriate, notwithstanding limitations on Awards in the
Plan. Substitute Awards shall not reduce the Shares authorized for grant under
the Plan, except as may be required by reason of Section 422 of the Code, and
Shares subject to such Substitute Awards shall not be added to the
Shares available for Awards under the Plan as provided in Section 3.1(b)
above. Additionally, in the event that a company acquired by the Company or
any Subsidiary or with which the Company or any Subsidiary combines has shares
available under a pre-existing plan approved by its stockholders and not
adopted in contemplation of such acquisition or combination, the shares
available for grant pursuant to the terms of such pre-existing plan (as
adjusted, to the extent appropriate, using the exchange ratio or other
adjustment or valuation ratio or formula used in such acquisition or
combination to determine the consideration payable to the holders of common
stock of the entities party to such acquisition or combination) may subject to
Applicable Law, be used for Awards under the Plan and shall not reduce the
Shares authorized for grant under the Plan (and Shares subject to such Awards
shall not be added to the Shares available for Awards under the Plan as
provided in Section 3.1(b) above); _provided_ that Awards using
such available Shares shall not be made after the date awards or grants could
have been made under the terms of the pre-existing plan, absent the
acquisition or combination, and shall only be made to individuals who were not
employed by or providing services to the Company or its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to such acquisition or combination. 
---|---|---

Award Agreement that sets forth the terms, conditions and limitations for
such Award as determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion
(consistent with the requirements of the Plan and any applicable Program).
Award Agreements evidencing Incentive Stock Options shall contain such terms
and conditions as may be necessary to meet the applicable provisions of
Section 422 of the Code.

  



  

4.3   _Limitations Applicable to Section 16 Persons_.
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the Plan, and any Award

Exchange Act, shall be subject to any additional limitations set forth in any
applicable exemptive rule under Section 16 of the Exchange Act (including Rule
16b-3 of the Exchange Act and any amendments thereto) that are requirements
for the application of such exemptive rule. To the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, the Plan and Awards granted or awarded hereunder shall be
deemed amended to the extent necessary to conform to such
applicable exemptive rule.

4.4   _At-Will Service_. Nothing in the Plan or in any Program or
Award Agreement hereunder shall confer upon any Holder any right to continue
in the employ of, or as a Director or Consultant for, the Company or any
Subsidiary, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the
Company and any Subsidiary, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to
discharge any Holder at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without
cause, and with or without notice, or to terminate or change all other terms
and conditions of employment or engagement, except to the extent expressly
provided otherwise in a written agreement between the Holder and the Company
or any Subsidiary.

  



  

4.5   _Foreign Holders_. Notwithstanding any provision of the
Plan or applicable Program to the contrary, in order to comply with the laws
in countries other than the United States in which the Company and its
Subsidiaries operate or have Employees, Non-Employee Directors or
Consultants, or in order to comply with the requirements of any foreign
securities exchange or other Applicable Law, the Administrator, in its sole
discretion, shall have the power and authority to: (a) determine which
Subsidiaries shall be covered by the Plan; (b) determine which Eligible
Individuals outside the United States are eligible to participate in the Plan;
(c) modify the terms and conditions of any Award granted to Eligible
Individuals outside the United States to comply with Applicable Law
(including, without limitation, applicable foreign laws or listing
requirements of any foreign securities exchange); (d) establish subplans and
modify exercise procedures and other terms and procedures, to the extent such
actions may be necessary or advisable; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no such
subplans and/or modifications shall increase the share limitation contained in
Section 3.1 or the Director Limit; and (e) take any action, before or after
an Award is made, that it deems advisable to obtain approval or comply with
any necessary local governmental regulatory exemptions or approvals or listing
requirements of any foreign securities exchange.

  



  

4.6   _Non-Employee Director Limit_. Notwithstanding any
provision to the contrary in the Plan, the grant date fair value (determined
as of the grant date in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board
Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, or any successor thereto) of
equity-based Awards and any cash-based Awards granted to a Non-Employee
Director during any calendar year shall not exceed $500,000 in the aggregate
(the " _Director Limit_ ").

  



  

ARTICLE 5 
 GRANTING OF OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS

  



  

5.1   _Granting of Options and Stock Appreciation Rights to
Eligible Individuals_. The Administrator is authorized to grant Options and
Stock Appreciation Rights to Eligible Individuals from time to time, in its
sole discretion, on such terms and conditions as it may determine, which
shall not be inconsistent with the Plan.

  



  

5.2   _Qualification of Incentive Stock Options_. The
Administrator may grant Options intended to qualify as Incentive
Stock Options only to employees of the Company, any of the Company's present
or future "parent corporations" or "subsidiary corporations" as defined in
Sections 424(e) or 424(f) of the Code, respectively, and any other entities
the employees of which are eligible to receive Incentive Stock Options under
the Code. No person who qualifies as a Greater Than 10% Stockholder may be
granted an Incentive Stock Option unless such Incentive Stock Option conforms
to the applicable provisions of Section 422 of the Code. To the extent that
the aggregate fair market value of stock with respect to which "incentive
stock options" (within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, but without
regard to Section 422(d) of the Code) are exercisable for the first time by a
Holder during any calendar year under the Plan, and all other plans of the
Company and any parent corporation or subsidiary corporation thereof (as
defined in Sections 424(e) and 424(f) of the Code, respectively), exceeds
$100,000, the Options shall be treated as Non-Qualified Stock Options to the
extent required by Section 422 of the Code. The rule set forth in the
immediately preceding sentence shall be applied by taking Options and other
"incentive stock options" into account in the order in which they were
granted and the fair market value of stock shall be determined as of the time
the respective options were granted. Any interpretations and rules under the
Plan with respect to Incentive Stock Options shall be consistent with the
provisions of Section 422 of the Code. Neither the Company nor the
Administrator shall have any liability to a Holder, or any other person,
(a) if an Option (or any part thereof) which is intended to qualify as an
Incentive Stock Option fails to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option or (b)
for any action or omission by the Company or the Administrator that causes an
Option not to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option, including without
limitation, the conversion of an Incentive Stock Option to a Non-Qualified
Stock Option or the grant of an Option intended as an Incentive Stock Option
that fails to satisfy the requirements under the Code applicable to
an Incentive Stock Option.

---|--- 

 



    



  

5.3   _Option and Stock Appreciation Right Exercise Price_. The
exercise price per Share subject to each Option and Stock Appreciation Right
shall be set by the Administrator, but, for any such Award granted to a Holder
subject to taxation in the United States, shall not be less than 100% of the
Fair Market Value of a Share on the date the Option or Stock Appreciation
Right, as applicable, is granted (or, as to Incentive Stock Options, on the
date the Option is modified, extended or renewed for purposes of Section
424(h) of the Code). In addition, in the case of Incentive Stock Options
granted to a Greater Than 10% Stockholder, such price shall not be less than
110% of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date the Option is granted (or
the date the Option is modified, extended or renewed for purposes of Section
424(h) of the Code). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Option
or Stock Appreciation Right that is a Substitute Award, the exercise price per
share of the Shares subject to such Option or Stock Appreciation Right, as
applicable, may be less than the Fair Market Value per share on the date of
grant for the applicable Holder (whether or not such Holder is subject to
taxation in the United States); _provided_ that the exercise price of
any Substitute Award shall be determined in accordance with the applicable
requirements of Section 424 of the Code and Section 409A.

  



  

5.4   _Option and SAR Term_. The term of each Option (the "
_Option Term_ ") and the term of each Stock Appreciation Right (the " _SAR
Term_ ") shall be set by the Administrator in its sole discretion; _provided_
, _however_ , that the Option Term or SAR Term, as applicable, shall not be
more than (a) ten (10) years from the date the Option or Stock
Appreciation Right, as applicable, is granted to an Eligible Individual
(other than, in the case of Incentive Stock Options, a Greater Than 10%
Stockholder), or (b) five (5) years from the date an Incentive Stock Option is
granted to a Greater Than 10% Stockholder. Except as limited by the
requirements of Section 409A or Section 422 of the Code and regulations and
rulings thereunder or the first sentence of this Section 5.4 and without
limiting the Company's rights under Section 10.7, the Administrator may extend
the Option Term of any outstanding Option or the SAR Term of any outstanding
Stock Appreciation Right, and may extend the time period during which vested
Options or Stock Appreciation Rights may be exercised, in connection with any
Termination of Service of the Holder or otherwise, and may amend, subject to
Section 10.7 and 12.1, any other term or condition of such Option or Stock
Appreciation Right relating to such Termination of Service of the Holder or
otherwise.

  



  

   

 | 11 / 32 
---|--- 

 



    



  

5.5   _Option and SAR Vesting_. The period during which the right
to exercise, in whole or in part, an Option or Stock Appreciation Right vests
in the Holder shall be set by the Administrator and set forth in the
applicable Award Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing and unless
determined otherwise by the Administrator, in the event that on the last
business day of the term of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right (other than
an Incentive Stock Option) (a) the exercise of the Option or Stock
Appreciation Right is prohibited by Applicable Law, as determined by the
Administrator, or (b) Shares may not be purchased or sold by the
applicable Holder due to any Company insider trading policy (including
blackout periods) or a "lock-up" agreement undertaken in connection with an
issuance of securities by the Company, then in either case the term of the
Option or Stock Appreciation Right shall be extended until the date that is
thirty (30) days after the end of the legal prohibition, black-out period or
lock-up agreement, as determined by the Administrator; _provided_ , _however_
, in no event shall the extension last beyond the term of the applicable
Option or Stock Appreciation Right. Unless otherwise determined by the
Administrator in the Award Agreement, the applicable Program or by action of
the Administrator following the grant of the Option or Stock Appreciation
Right, (a) no portion of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right which is
unexercisable at a Holder's Termination of Service shall thereafter become
exercisable and (b) the portion of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right that
is unexercisable at a Holder's Termination of Service shall automatically
expire thirty (30) days following such Termination of Service.

  



  

5.6   _Substitution of Stock Appreciation Rights; Early Exercise
of Options_. The Administrator may provide in the applicable Program or Award
Agreement evidencing the grant of an Option that the Administrator, in its
sole discretion, shall have the right to substitute a Stock Appreciation
Right for such Option at any time prior to or upon exercise of such Option;
_provided_  that such Stock Appreciation Right shall be exercisable with
respect to the same number of Shares for which such substituted Option would
have been exercisable, and shall also have the same exercise price, vesting
schedule and remaining term as the substituted Option. The Administrator may
provide in the terms of an Award Agreement that the Holder may exercise an
Option in whole or in part prior to the full vesting of the Option in
exchange for unvested shares of Restricted Stock with respect to any unvested
portion of the Option so exercised. Shares of Restricted Stock acquired upon
the exercise of any unvested portion of an Option shall be subject to such
terms and conditions as the Administrator shall determine.

ARTICLE 6 
 EXERCISE OF OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS

  



  

6.1   _Exercise and Payment_. An exercisable Option or Stock
Appreciation Right may be exercised in whole or in part. However, unless the
Administrator otherwise determines, an Option or Stock Appreciation Right
shall not be exercisable with respect to fractional Shares and the
Administrator may require that, by the terms of the Option or Stock
Appreciation Right, a partial exercise must be with respect to a minimum
number of Shares. Payment of the amounts payable with respect to Options and
Stock Appreciation Rights pursuant to this Article 6 shall be in cash, Shares
(based on its Fair Market Value as of the date the Stock Appreciation
Right is exercised), or a combination of both, as determined by the
Administrator.

  



  

6.2   _Manner of Exercise_. Except as set forth in Section 6.3,
all or a portion of an exercisable Option or Stock Appreciation Right shall
be deemed exercised upon delivery of all of the following to the Secretary of
the Company, the stock plan administrator of the Company or such other person
designated by the Administrator, or his, her or its office, as applicable:

  



   | (a)| A written or electronic notice complying with the applicable
rules established by the Administrator stating that the Option or Stock
Appreciation Right, or a portion thereof, is exercised. The notice shall be
signed or otherwise acknowledged electronically by the Holder or other person
then entitled to exercise the Option or Stock Appreciation Right or
such portion thereof; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| Such representations and documents as the Administrator, in its
sole discretion, deems necessary or advisable to effect compliance with
Applicable Law; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (c)| In the event that the Option shall be exercised pursuant to
Section 10.3 by any person or persons other than the Holder, appropriate
proof of the right of such person or persons to exercise the Option or Stock
Appreciation Right, as determined in the sole discretion of the
Administrator; and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (d)| Full payment of the exercise price and applicable withholding
taxes for the Shares with respect to which the Option or Stock Appreciation
Right, or portion thereof, is exercised, in a manner permitted by the
Administrator in accordance with Sections 10.1 and 10.2. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

6.3   _Expiration of Option Term or SAR Term: Automatic Exercise
of In-The-Money Options and Stock Appreciation Rights_. Unless otherwise
provided by the Administrator in an Award Agreement or otherwise or as
otherwise directed by an Option or Stock Appreciation Rights Holder in
writing to the Company, each vested and exercisable Option and Stock
Appreciation Right outstanding on the Automatic Exercise Date with an
exercise price per Share that is less than the Fair Market Value per Share as
of such date shall automatically and without further action by the Option or
Stock Appreciation Rights Holder or the Company be exercised on the Automatic
Exercise Date. In the sole discretion of the Administrator, payment of the
exercise price of any such Option shall be made pursuant to Section 10.1(b)
or 10.1(c) and the Company or any Subsidiary shall be entitled to deduct or
withhold an amount sufficient to satisfy all taxes associated with such
exercise in accordance with Section 10.2. Unless otherwise determined by
the Administrator, this Section 6.3 shall not apply to an Option or Stock
Appreciation Right if the Holder of such Option or Stock Appreciation Right
incurs a Termination of Service on or before the Automatic Exercise Date. For
the avoidance of doubt, no Option or Stock Appreciation Right with an
exercise price per Share that is equal to or greater than the Fair Market
Value per Share on the Automatic Exercise Date shall be exercised pursuant to
this Section 6.3.

  



  

   

 | 13 / 32 
---|--- 

 



    



  

6.4   _Notification Regarding Disposition_. The Holder shall give
the Company prompt written or electronic notice of any disposition or other
transfer of Shares acquired by exercise of an Incentive Stock Option which
occurs within (a) two years from the date of granting (including the date the
Option is modified, extended or renewed for purposes of Section 424(h) of the
Code) such Option to such Holder, or (b) one year after the date of transfer
of such Shares to such Holder. Such notice shall specify the date of such
disposition or other transfer and the amount realized, in cash, other
property, assumption of indebtedness or other consideration, by the Holder in
such disposition or other transfer.

  



  

ARTICLE 7 
 AWARD OF RESTRICTED STOCK

  



  

7.1   _Award of Restricted Stock_. The Administrator is
authorized to grant Restricted Stock, or the right to purchase
Restricted Stock to Eligible Individuals, and shall determine the terms and
conditions, including the restrictions applicable to each award of Restricted
Stock, which terms and conditions shall not be inconsistent with the Plan or
any applicable Program, and may impose such conditions on the issuance of
such Restricted Stock as it deems appropriate. The Administrator shall
establish the purchase price, if any, and form of payment for Restricted
Stock; _provided_ , _however_ , that if a purchase price is charged, such
purchase price shall be no less than the par value, if any, of the Shares to
be purchased, unless otherwise permitted by Applicable Law. In all cases,
legal consideration shall be required for each issuance of Restricted Stock to
the extent required by Applicable Law.

  



  

7.2   _Rights as Stockholders_. Subject to Section 7.4, upon
issuance of Restricted Stock, the Holder shall have, unless otherwise
provided by the Administrator, all of the rights of a stockholder with respect
to said Shares, subject to the restrictions in the Plan, any applicable
Program and/or the applicable Award Agreement, including the right to vote and
the right to receive all dividends and other distributions paid or made with
respect to the Shares to the extent such dividends and other
distributions have a record date that is on or after the date on which the
Holder to whom such Shares are granted becomes the record holder of such
Restricted Stock; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in the sole discretion of the
Administrator, any extraordinary distributions with respect to the Shares may
be subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 7.3. In addition,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, with respect to a share of
Restricted Stock, dividends which are paid prior to vesting shall accrue or
be reinvested, at the Administrator's sole discretion, and shall only be paid
out to the Holder to the extent and at such time that the share of Restricted
Stock vests.

  



  

   

 | 14 / 32 
---|--- 

 



    



  

7.3   _Restrictions_. All shares of Restricted Stock (including
any shares received by Holders thereof with respect to shares of Restricted
Stock as a result of stock dividends, stock splits or any other form of
recapitalization) shall be subject to such restrictions and vesting
requirements as the Administrator shall provide in the applicable Program or
Award Agreement. By action taken after the Restricted Stock is issued, the
Administrator may, on such terms and conditions as it may determine to be
appropriate, accelerate the vesting of such Restricted Stock by removing any
or all of the restrictions imposed by the terms of the applicable Program or
Award Agreement.

  



  

7.4   _Repurchase or Forfeiture of Restricted Stock_. Except as
otherwise determined by the Administrator, if no price was paid by the Holder
for the Restricted Stock, upon a Termination of Service during the applicable
restriction period, the Holder's rights in unvested Restricted Stock then
subject to restrictions shall lapse, and such Restricted Stock shall be
surrendered to the Company and cancelled without consideration on the date of
such Termination of Service. If a price was paid by the Holder for the
Restricted Stock, upon a Termination of Service during the applicable
restriction period, the Company shall have the right to repurchase from the
Holder the unvested Restricted Stock then subject to restrictions at a cash
price per share equal to the price paid by the Holder for such Restricted
Stock or such other amount as may be specified in the applicable Program or
Award Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrator, in its
sole discretion, may provide that upon certain events, including, without
limitation, the Holder's death, retirement or disability or any other
specified Termination of Service or any other event, the Holder's rights in
unvested Restricted Stock then subject to restrictions shall not lapse, such
Restricted Stock shall vest and cease to be forfeitable and, if applicable,
the Company shall cease to have a right of repurchase.

  



  

7.5   _Section 83(b) Election_. If a Holder makes an election
under Section 83(b) of the Code to be taxed with respect to the Restricted
Stock as of the date of transfer of the Restricted Stock rather than as of the
date or dates upon which the Holder would otherwise be taxable under Section
83(a) of the Code, the Holder shall be required to deliver a copy of such
election to the Company promptly after filing such election with the Internal
Revenue Service along with proof of the timely filing thereof with the
Internal Revenue Service.

  



  

ARTICLE 8

  

AWARD OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS

  



  

8.1   _Grant of Restricted Stock Units_. The Administrator is
authorized to grant Awards of Restricted Stock Units to any Eligible
Individual selected by the Administrator in such amounts and subject to such
terms and conditions as determined by the Administrator. A Holder will have
no rights of a stockholder with respect to Shares subject to any Restricted
Stock Unit unless and until the Shares are delivered in settlement of the
Restricted Stock Unit.

---|--- 

 



    



  

8.2   _Vesting of Restricted Stock Units_. At the time of grant,

Stock Units shall become fully vested and nonforfeitable, and may specify such
conditions to vesting as it deems appropriate.

  



  

8.3   _Maturity and Payment_. At the time of grant, the
Administrator shall specify the maturity date applicable to each grant of
Restricted Stock Units, which shall be no earlier than the vesting date or
dates of the Award and may be determined at the election of the Holder (if
permitted by the applicable Award Agreement); _provided_ that, except as
otherwise determined by the Administrator, and subject to compliance with
Section 409A, in no event shall the maturity date relating to each
Restricted Stock Unit occur following the later of (a) the 15th day of the
third month following the end of the calendar year in which the applicable
portion of the Restricted Stock Unit vests; and (b) the 15th day of the third
month following the end of the Company's fiscal year in which the applicable
portion of the Restricted Stock Unit vests. On the maturity date, the Company
shall, in accordance with the applicable Award Agreement and subject to
Section 10.4(f), transfer to the Holder one unrestricted, fully
transferable Share for each Restricted Stock Unit scheduled to be paid out on
such date and not previously forfeited, or in the sole discretion of the
Administrator, an amount in cash equal to the Fair Market Value of such Shares
on the maturity date or a combination of cash and Common Stock as determined
by the Administrator.

  



  

8.4   _Payment upon Termination of Service_. An Award of
Restricted Stock Units shall be payable only while the Holder is an Employee,
a Consultant or a member of the Board, as applicable; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Administrator, in its sole discretion, may provide (in an Award
Agreement or otherwise) that a Restricted Stock Unit award may be paid
subsequent to a Termination of Service in certain events, including a Change
in Control, the Holder's death, retirement or disability or any other
specified Termination of Service.

  



  

ARTICLE 9 
 AWARD OF OTHER STOCK OR CASH BASED AWARDS AND DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS

  



  

9.1   _Other Stock or Cash Based Awards_. The Administrator is
authorized to grant Other Stock or Cash Based Awards, including awards
entitling a Holder to receive Shares or cash to be delivered immediately or in
the future, to any Eligible Individual. Subject to the provisions of the Plan
and any applicable Program, the Administrator shall determine the terms and
conditions of each Other Stock or Cash Based Award, including the term of the
Award, any exercise or purchase price, performance goals, transfer
restrictions, vesting conditions and other terms and conditions applicable
thereto, which shall be set forth in the applicable Award Agreement. Other
Stock or Cash Based Awards may be paid in cash, Shares, or a combination of
cash and Shares, as determined by the Administrator, and may be available as
a form of payment in the settlement of other Awards granted under the Plan, as
stand-alone payments, as a part of a bonus, deferred bonus, deferred
compensation or other arrangement, and/or as payment in lieu of compensation
to which an Eligible Individual is otherwise entitled.

  



  

   

 | 16 / 32 
---|--- 

 



    



  

9.2   _Dividend Equivalents_. Dividend Equivalents may be granted
by the Administrator, either alone or in tandem with another Award, based on
dividends declared on the Common Stock, to be credited as of dividend payment
dates during the period between the date the Dividend Equivalents are granted
to a Holder and the date such Dividend Equivalents terminate or expire, as
determined by the Administrator. Such Dividend Equivalents shall be converted
to cash or additional Shares by such formula and at such time and subject to
such restrictions and limitations as may be determined by the Administrator.
In addition, Dividend Equivalents with respect to an Award that are based on
dividends paid prior to the vesting of such Award shall only be paid out to
the Holder to the extent and at such time that the vesting conditions are
subsequently satisfied and the Award vests. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
Dividend Equivalents shall be payable with respect to Options or Stock
Appreciation Rights.

  



  

ARTICLE 10

  

ADDITIONAL TERMS OF AWARDS

  



  

10.1   _Payment_. The Administrator shall determine the method or
methods by which payments by any Holder with respect to any Awards granted
under the Plan shall be made, including, without limitation: (a) cash, wire
transfer of immediately available funds or check, (b) Shares, including,
without limitation, (i) in the case of payment of the exercise price of an
Award, Shares issuable pursuant to the exercise of the Award or (ii) Shares
held for such minimum period of time as may be established by
the Administrator, in each case having a Fair Market Value on the date of
delivery equal to the aggregate payments required, (c) delivery of a written
or electronic notice that the Holder has placed a market sell order with a
broker acceptable to the Company with respect to Shares then issuable upon
exercise or vesting of an Award, and that the broker has been directed to pay
a sufficient portion of the net proceeds of the sale to the Company in
satisfaction of the aggregate payments required; _provided_ that payment of
such proceeds is then made to the Company upon settlement of such sale, (d)
other form of legal consideration acceptable to the Administrator in its sole
discretion, or (e) any combination of the above permitted forms of payment.
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, no Holder
who is a Director or an "executive officer" of the Company within the meaning
of Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act shall be permitted to make payment with
respect to any Awards granted under the Plan, or continue any extension of
credit with respect to such payment, with a loan from the Company or a loan
arranged by the Company in violation of Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act.

  



  

10.2   _Tax Withholding_. The Company or any Subsidiary shall have
the authority and the right to deduct or withhold, or require a Holder to
remit to the Company, an amount sufficient to satisfy federal, state, local
and foreign taxes (including the Holder's FICA, employment tax or other
social security contribution obligation) required by law to be withheld with
respect to any taxable event concerning a Holder arising as a result of the
Plan or any Award. The Administrator may, in its sole discretion and in
satisfaction of the foregoing requirement, or in satisfaction of such
additional withholding obligations as a Holder may have elected, allow a
Holder to satisfy such obligations by any payment means described in Section
10.1 hereof, including without limitation, by allowing such Holder to elect
to have the Company or any Subsidiary withhold Shares otherwise issuable under
an Award (or allow the surrender of Shares). The number of Shares that may be
so withheld or surrendered shall be limited to the number of Shares that have
a fair market value on the date of withholding or repurchase no greater than
the aggregate amount of such liabilities based on the maximum statutory
withholding rates in such Holder's applicable jurisdiction for federal, state,
local and foreign income tax and payroll tax purposes that are applicable to
such taxable income. The Administrator shall determine the fair market value
of the Shares, consistent with applicable provisions of the Code, for tax
withholding obligations due in connection with a broker-assisted cashless
Option or Stock Appreciation Right exercise involving the sale of Shares to
pay the Option or Stock Appreciation Right exercise price or any tax
withholding obligation.

   | (a)| Except as otherwise provided in Sections 10.3(b) and 10.3(c): 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (i)| No Award under the Plan may be sold, pledged, assigned or
transferred in any manner other than (A) by will or the laws of descent and
distribution or (B) subject to the consent of the Administrator, pursuant to a
DRO, unless and until such Award has been exercised or the Shares underlying
such Award have been issued, and all restrictions applicable to such Shares
have lapsed; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (ii)| No Award or interest or right therein shall be liable for or
otherwise subject to the debts, contracts or engagements of the Holder or the
Holder's successors in interest or shall be subject to disposition by
transfer, alienation, anticipation, pledge, hypothecation, encumbrance,
assignment or any other means whether such disposition be voluntary or
involuntary or by operation of law by judgment, levy, attachment, garnishment
or any other legal or equitable proceedings (including bankruptcy) unless and
until such Award has been exercised, or the Shares underlying such Award have
been issued, and all restrictions applicable to such Shares have lapsed, and
any attempted disposition of an Award prior to satisfaction of these
conditions shall be null and void and of no effect, except to the extent that
such disposition is permitted by Section 10.3(a)(i); and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (iii)| During the lifetime of the Holder, only the Holder may exercise
any exercisable portion of an Award granted to such Holder under the Plan,
unless it has been disposed of pursuant to a DRO. After the death of the
Holder, any exercisable portion of an Award may, prior to the time when such
portion becomes unexercisable under the Plan or the applicable Program
or Award Agreement, be exercised by the Holder's personal representative or
by any person empowered to do so under the deceased Holder's will or under
the then-applicable laws of descent and distribution. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| Notwithstanding Section 10.3(a), the Administrator, in its sole
discretion, may determine to permit a Holder or a Permitted Transferee of
such Holder to transfer an Award other than an Incentive Stock Option (unless
such Incentive Stock Option is intended to become a Non-Qualified Stock
Option) to any one or more Permitted Transferees of such Holder, subject to
the following terms and conditions: (i) an Award transferred to a Permitted
Transferee shall not be assignable or transferable by the Permitted
Transferee other than (A) to another Permitted Transferee of the applicable
Holder or (B) by will or the laws of descent and distribution or, subject to
the consent of the Administrator, pursuant to a DRO; (ii) an Award transferred
to a Permitted Transferee shall continue to be subject to all the terms and
conditions of the Award as applicable to the original Holder (other than the
ability to further transfer the Award to any person other than another
Permitted Transferee of the applicable Holder); (iii) the Holder (or
transferring Permitted Transferee) and the receiving Permitted Transferee
shall execute any and all documents requested by the Administrator,
including, without limitation documents to (A) confirm the status of the
transferee as a Permitted Transferee, (B) satisfy any requirements for an
exemption for the transfer under Applicable Law and (C) evidence the
transfer; and (iv) the transfer of an Award to a Permitted Transferee shall
be without consideration. In addition, and further notwithstanding Section
10.3(a), hereof, the Administrator, in its sole discretion, may determine to
permit a Holder to transfer Incentive Stock Options to a trust that
constitutes a Permitted Transferee if, under Section 671 of the Code and other
Applicable Law, the Holder is considered the sole beneficial owner of the
Incentive Stock Option while it is held in the trust.

   | (c)| Notwithstanding Section 10.3(a), a Holder may, in the manner
determined by the Administrator, designate a beneficiary to exercise the
rights of the Holder and to receive any distribution with respect to any Award
upon the Holder's death. A beneficiary, legal guardian, legal representative,
or other person claiming any rights pursuant to the Plan is subject to all
terms and conditions of the Plan and any Program or Award Agreement applicable
to the Holder and any additional restrictions deemed necessary or appropriate
by the Administrator. If the Holder is married or a domestic partner in a
domestic partnership qualified under Applicable Law and resides in a
community property state, a designation of a person other than the
Holder's spouse or domestic partner, as applicable, as the Holder's
beneficiary with respect to more than 50% of the Holder's interest in the
Award shall not be effective without the prior written or electronic consent
of the Holder's spouse or domestic partner. If no beneficiary has been
designated or survives the Holder, payment shall be made to the person
entitled thereto pursuant to the Holder's will or the laws of descent and
distribution. Subject to the foregoing, a beneficiary designation may
be changed or revoked by a Holder at any time; _provided_ that the change or
revocation is delivered in writing to the Administrator prior to the Holder's
death. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

10.4   _Conditions to Issuance of Shares_.

  



   | (a)| The Administrator shall determine the methods by which Shares
shall be delivered or deemed to be delivered to Holders. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to issue or
deliver any certificates or make any book entries evidencing Shares pursuant
to the exercise of any Award, unless and until the Administrator has
determined that the issuance of such Shares is in compliance with Applicable
Law and the Shares are covered by an effective registration statement or
applicable exemption from registration. In addition to the terms and
conditions provided herein, the Administrator may require that a Holder make
such reasonable covenants, agreements and representations as the
Administrator, in its sole discretion, deems advisable in order to comply
with Applicable Law. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

 | 19 / 32 
---|--- 

 



    



   | (b)| All share certificates delivered pursuant to the Plan and all
Shares issued pursuant to book entry procedures are subject to any stop-
transfer orders and other restrictions as the Administrator deems necessary or
advisable to comply with Applicable Law. The Administrator may place legends
on any stock certificate or book entry to reference restrictions applicable
to the Shares (including, without limitation, restrictions applicable to
Restricted Stock). 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (c)| The Administrator shall have the right to require any Holder to
comply with any timing or other restrictions with respect to the settlement,
distribution or exercise of any Award, including a window-period limitation,
as may be imposed in the sole discretion of the Administrator. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (d)| Unless the Administrator otherwise determines, no fractional
Shares shall be issued and the Administrator, in its sole discretion, shall
determine whether cash shall be given in lieu of fractional Shares or whether
such fractional Shares shall be eliminated by rounding down. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (e)| The Company, in its sole discretion, may (i) retain physical
possession of any stock certificate evidencing Shares until any restrictions
thereon shall have lapsed and/or (ii) require that the stock certificates
evidencing such Shares be held in custody by a designated escrow agent (which
may but need not be the Company) until the restrictions thereon shall have
lapsed, and that the Holder deliver a stock power, endorsed in blank, relating
to such Shares. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (f)| Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, unless otherwise
determined by the Administrator or required by Applicable Law, the Company
shall not deliver to any Holder certificates evidencing Shares issued in
connection with any Award and instead such Shares shall be recorded in the
books of the Company (or, as applicable, its transfer agent or stock plan
administrator). 
---|---|--- 
  



  

10.5   _Forfeiture and Claw-Back Provisions_. All Awards (including
any proceeds, gains or other economic benefit actually or constructively
received by a Holder upon any receipt or exercise of any Award or upon the
receipt or resale of any Shares underlying the Award and any payments of a
portion of an incentive-based bonus pool allocated to a Holder) shall be
subject to the provisions of any claw-back policy implemented by the Company,
including, without limitation, any claw-back policy adopted to comply
with the requirements of Applicable Law, including, without limitation, the
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and any rules or
regulations promulgated thereunder, whether or not such claw-back policy was
in place at the time of grant of an Award, to the extent set forth in such
claw-back policy and/or in the applicable Award Agreement.

  



  

10.6   _Repricing_. Subject to Section 12.2, the Administrator shall
not, without the approval of the stockholders of the Company, (a) authorize
the amendment of any outstanding Option or Stock Appreciation Right to reduce
its price per Share, or (b) cancel any Option or Stock Appreciation Right in
exchange for cash or another Award when the Option or Stock Appreciation
Right price per Share exceeds the Fair Market Value of the underlying Shares.

  



  

   

 | 20 / 32 
---|--- 

 



    



  

10.7   _Amendment of Awards_. Subject to Applicable Law, the
Administrator may amend, modify or terminate any outstanding Award, including
but not limited to, substituting therefor another Award of the same or a
different type, changing the date of exercise or settlement, and converting
an Incentive Stock Option to a Non-Qualified Stock Option. The Holder's
consent to such action shall be required unless (a) the Administrator
determines that the action, taking into account any related action, would not
materially and adversely affect the Holder, or (b) the change is otherwise
permitted under the Plan (including, without limitation, under Sections 10.6,
12.2 or 12.10).

  



  

10.8   _Lock-Up Period_. The Company may, in connection with
registering the offering of any Company securities under the Securities Act,
prohibit Holders from, directly or indirectly, selling or otherwise
transferring any Shares or other Company securities during any period
determined by the underwriter or the Company. In order to enforce the
foregoing, the Company shall have the right to place restrictive legends on
the certificates of any securities of the Company held by the Holder and to
impose stop transfer instructions with the Company's transfer agent with
respect to any securities of the Company held by the Holder until the end of
such period.

  



  

10.9   _Data Privacy_. As a condition of receipt of any Award, each
Holder explicitly and unambiguously consents to the collection, use and
transfer, in electronic or other form, of personal data as described in this
Section 10.9 by and among, as applicable, the Company and its Subsidiaries
for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing the
Holder's participation in the Plan. The Company and its Subsidiaries may hold
certain personal information about a Holder, including but not limited
to, the Holder's name, home address and telephone number, date of birth,
social security or insurance number or other identification number, salary,
nationality, job title(s), any shares of stock held in the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries and details of all Awards, in each case, for the purpose of
implementing, managing and administering the Plan and Awards (the " _Data_
"). The Company and its Subsidiaries may transfer the Data amongst themselves
as necessary for the purpose of implementation, administration and management
of a Holder's participation in the Plan, and the Company and its Subsidiaries
may each further transfer the Data to any third parties assisting the Company
and its Subsidiaries in the implementation, administration and management of
the Plan. These recipients may be located in the Holder's country, or
elsewhere, and the Holder's country may have different data privacy laws and
protections than the recipients' country. Through acceptance of an Award, each
Holder authorizes such recipients to receive, possess, use, retain and
transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the purposes of
implementing, administering and managing the Holder's participation in the
Plan, including any requisite transfer of such Data as may be required to a
broker or other third party with whom the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or the Holder may elect to deposit any Shares. The Data related to a Holder
will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer, and manage
the Holder's participation in the Plan. A Holder may, at any time, view the
Data held by the Company with respect to such Holder, request
additional information about the storage and processing of the Data with
respect to such Holder, recommend any necessary corrections to the Data with
respect to the Holder or refuse or withdraw the consents herein in writing, in
any case without cost, by contacting his or her local human resources
representative. The Company may cancel the Holder's ability to participate in
the Plan and, in the Administrator's discretion, the Holder may forfeit any
outstanding Awards if the Holder refuses or withdraws his or her consents as
described herein. For more information on the consequences of refusal to
consent or withdrawal of consent, Holders may contact their local human
resources representative.

ARTICLE 11

  

ADMINISTRATION

  



  

11.1   _Administrator_. The Committee shall administer the Plan
(except as otherwise permitted herein). To the extent necessary to comply
with Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act, the Committee shall take all action with
respect to such Awards, and the individuals taking such action shall consist
solely of two or more Non-Employee Directors, each of whom is intended to
qualify as a "non-employee director" as defined by Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange
Act or any successor rule. Additionally, to the extent required by
Applicable Law, each of the individuals constituting the Committee shall be
an "independent director" under the rules of any securities exchange or
automated quotation system on which the Shares are listed, quoted or traded.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any action taken by the Committee shall be
valid and effective, whether or not members of the Committee at the time of
such action are later determined not to have satisfied the requirements for
membership set forth in this Section 11.1 or the Organizational
Documents. Except as may otherwise be provided in the Organizational
Documents or as otherwise required by Applicable Law, (a) appointment of
Committee members shall be effective upon acceptance of appointment, (b)
Committee members may resign at any time by delivering written or electronic
notice to the Board and (c) vacancies in the Committee may only be filled by
the Board. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the full Board, acting by a
majority of its members in office, shall conduct the general administration of
the Plan with respect to Awards granted to Non-Employee Directors and, with
respect to such Awards, the term "Administrator" as used in the Plan shall be
deemed to refer to the Board and (ii) the Board or Committee may delegate its
authority hereunder to the extent permitted by Section 11.6.

  



  

11.2   _Duties and Powers of Administrator_. It shall be the duty of
the Administrator to conduct the general administration of the Plan in
accordance with its provisions. The Administrator shall have the power to
interpret the Plan, all Programs and Award Agreements, and to adopt such
rules for the administration, interpretation and application of the Plan and
any Program as are not inconsistent with the Plan, to interpret, amend or
revoke any such rules and to amend the Plan or any Program or Award
Agreement;  _provided_ that the rights or obligations of the Holder of the
Award that is the subject of any such Program or Award Agreement are not
materially and adversely affected by such amendment, unless the consent of the
Holder is obtained or such amendment is otherwise permitted under Section
10.7 or Section 12.10. In its sole discretion, the Board may at any time and
from time to time exercise any and all rights and duties of the Committee in
its capacity as the Administrator under the Plan except with respect to
matters which under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act or any successor rule,
or any regulations or rules issued thereunder, or the rules of any securities
exchange or automated quotation system on which the Shares are listed, quoted
or traded are required to be determined in the sole discretion of the
Committee.

  



  

   

 | 22 / 32 
---|--- 

 



    



  

11.3   _Action by the Administrator_. Unless otherwise established by
the Board, set forth in any Organizational Documents or as required by
Applicable Law, a majority of the Administrator shall constitute a quorum and
the acts of a majority of the members present at any meeting at which a
quorum is present, and acts approved in writing by all members of the
Administrator in lieu of a meeting, shall be deemed the acts of the
Administrator. Each member of the Administrator is entitled to, in good faith,
rely or act upon any report or other information furnished to that member by
any officer or other employee of the Company or any Subsidiary, the Company's
independent certified public accountants, or any executive compensation
consultant or other professional retained by the Company to assist in the
administration of the Plan. Neither the Administrator nor any member or
delegate thereof shall have any liability to any person (including any
Holder) for any action taken or omitted to be taken or any determination made
in good faith with respect to the Plan or any Award.

  



  

11.4   _Authority of Administrator_. Subject to the Organizational
Documents, any specific designation in the Plan and Applicable Law, the
Administrator has the exclusive power, authority and sole discretion to:

  



   | (a)| Designate Eligible Individuals to receive Awards; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| Determine the type or types of Awards to be granted to each
Eligible Individual (including, without limitation, any Awards granted in
tandem with another Award granted pursuant to the Plan); 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (c)| Determine the number of Awards to be granted and the number of
Shares to which an Award will relate;

purchase price, any performance criteria, any restrictions or limitations on
the Award, any schedule for vesting, lapse of forfeiture restrictions or
restrictions on the exercisability of an Award, and accelerations or waivers
thereof, and any provisions related to non-competition and claw-back and
recapture of gain on an Award, based in each case on such considerations as
the Administrator in its sole discretion determines; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (e)| Determine whether, to what extent, and under what circumstances
an Award may be settled in, or the exercise price of an Award may be paid in
cash, Shares, other Awards, or other property, or an Award may be canceled,
forfeited, or surrendered; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (f)| Prescribe the form of each Award Agreement, which need not be
identical for each Holder;

restrictions of any Award or portion thereof at any time after the grant of
an Award, subject to whatever terms and conditions it selects and Section
12.2. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

11.5   _Decisions Binding_. The Administrator's interpretation of the
Plan, any Awards granted pursuant to the Plan, any Program or any Award
Agreement and all decisions and determinations by the Administrator with
respect to the Plan are final, binding and conclusive on all persons.

  



  

11.6   _Delegation of Authority_. The Board or Committee may from
time to time delegate to a committee of one or more members of the Board or
one or more officers of the Company the authority to grant or amend Awards or
to take other administrative actions pursuant to this Article 11; _provided_
, _however_ , that in no event shall an officer of the Company be delegated
the authority to grant Awards to, or amend Awards held by, the following
individuals: (a) individuals who are subject to Section 16 of the Exchange
Act, or (b) officers of the Company (or Directors) to whom authority to grant
or amend Awards has been delegated hereunder; _provided_ , _further_ , that
any delegation of administrative authority shall only be permitted to the
extent it is permissible under any Organizational Documents and Applicable
Law. Any delegation hereunder shall be subject to the restrictions and limits
that the Board or Committee specifies at the time of such delegation or that
are otherwise included in the applicable Organizational Documents, and the
Board or Committee, as applicable, may at any time rescind the authority so
delegated or appoint a new delegatee. At all times, the delegatee appointed
under this Section 11.6 shall serve in such capacity at the pleasure of the
Board or the Committee, as applicable, and the Board or the Committee may
abolish any committee at any time and re-vest in itself any previously
delegated authority.

  



  

ARTICLE 12

   | (a)| Except as otherwise provided in Section 12.1(b), the Plan may be
wholly or partially amended or otherwise modified, suspended or terminated at
any time or from time to time by the Board; _provided_ that, except as
provided in Section 10.7 and Section 12.10, no amendment, suspension or
termination of the Plan shall, without the consent of the Holder, materially
and adversely affect any rights or obligations under any Award theretofore
granted or awarded, unless the Award itself otherwise expressly so provides. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| Notwithstanding Section 12.1(a), the Board may not, except as
provided in Section 12.2, take any of the following actions without approval

---|---|--- 
  



  

   

 | 24 / 32 
---|--- 

 



    



   | (c)| No Awards may be granted or awarded during any period of
suspension or after termination of the Plan, and notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, in no event may any Award be granted under the Plan
after the tenth (10th) anniversary of the earlier of (i) the date on which
the Plan was adopted by the Board or (ii) the date the Plan was approved by
the Company's stockholders (such anniversary, the " _Expiration Date_ "). Any
Awards that are outstanding on the Expiration Date shall remain in force
according to the terms of the Plan, the applicable Program and the applicable
Award Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

12.2   _Changes in Common Stock or Assets of the Company, Acquisition
or Liquidation of the Company and Other Corporate Events_.

  



   | (a)| In the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or
exchange of shares, merger, consolidation or other distribution (other than
normal cash dividends) of Company assets to stockholders, or any other change
affecting the shares of the Company's stock or the share price of the
Company's stock other than an Equity Restructuring, the Administrator may
make equitable adjustments, if any, to reflect such change with respect to:
(i) the aggregate number and kind of Shares that may be issued under the Plan
(including, but not limited to, adjustments of the limitations in Section 3.1
on the maximum number and kind of Shares which may be issued under the Plan);
(ii) the number and kind of Shares (or other securities or property)
subject to outstanding Awards; (iii) the terms and conditions of any
outstanding Awards (including, without limitation, any applicable performance
targets or criteria with respect thereto); and (iv) the grant or exercise
price per share for any outstanding Awards under the Plan. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| In the event of any transaction or event described in Section
12.2(a), including, without limitation, a Change in Control, or any unusual
or nonrecurring transactions or events affecting the Company, any Subsidiary
of the Company, or the financial statements of the Company or any Subsidiary,
or of changes in Applicable Law or Applicable Accounting Standards, the
Administrator, in its sole discretion, and on such terms and conditions as it
deems appropriate, either by the terms of the Award or by action taken prior
to the occurrence of such transaction or event, is hereby authorized to take
any one or more of the following actions whenever the Administrator
determines that such action is appropriate in order to prevent dilution or
enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made
available under the Plan or with respect to any Award under the Plan, to
facilitate such transactions or events or to give effect to such changes in
Applicable Law or Applicable Accounting Standards: 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (i)| To provide for the termination of any such Award in exchange for
an amount of cash and/or other property with a value equal to the amount that
would have been attained upon the exercise of such Award or realization of the
Holder's rights (and, for the avoidance of doubt, if as of the date of the
occurrence of the transaction or event described in this Section 12.2 the
Administrator determines in good faith that no amount would have been attained
upon the exercise of such Award or realization of the Holder's rights, then
such Award may be terminated by the Company without payment); 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

 | 25 / 32 
---|--- 

 



    



   | (ii)| To provide that such Award be assumed by the successor or
survivor corporation, or a parent or subsidiary thereof, or shall be
substituted for by similar options, rights or awards covering the stock of the
successor or survivor corporation, or a parent or subsidiary thereof, with
appropriate adjustments as to the number and kind of shares and
applicable exercise or purchase price, in all cases, as determined by the
Administrator; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (iii)| To make adjustments in the number and type of Shares of the
Company's stock (or other securities or property) subject to such Award,
and/or in the terms and conditions of (including the grant or exercise price),
and the criteria included in, outstanding Awards and Awards which may be
granted in the future; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (iv)| To provide that such Award shall be exercisable or payable or
fully vested with respect to all Shares covered thereby, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in the Plan or the applicable Program or Award
Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that, in the event of a Change in
Control, the actions contemplated by this Section 12.2(b)(iv) may only be
taken to the extent that the successor corporation in a Change in Control
does not assume or substitute such Award (or any portion thereof); 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (v)| To replace such Award with other rights or property selected by
the Administrator; and/or 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (vi)| To provide that the Award cannot vest, be exercised or become
payable after such event. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (c)| In connection with the occurrence of any Equity Restructuring,
and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Sections 12.2(a) and 12.2(b): 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (i)| The number and type of securities subject to each outstanding
Award and the exercise price or grant price thereof, if applicable, shall be
equitably adjusted (and the adjustments provided under this Section 12.2(c)(i)
shall be nondiscretionary and shall be final and binding on the affected
Holder and the Company); and/or 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (ii)| The Administrator shall make such equitable adjustments, if any,
as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, may deem appropriate to reflect
such Equity Restructuring with respect to the aggregate number and kind of
Shares that may be issued under the Plan (including, but not limited to,
adjustments of the limitation in Section 3.1 on the maximum number and kind
of Shares which may be issued under the Plan). 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

 | 26 / 32 
---|--- 

 



    



   | (d)| Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, in the event of
a Change in Control, unless the Administrator elects to (i) terminate an
Award in exchange for cash, rights or property, or (ii) cause an Award to
become fully exercisable and no longer subject to any forfeiture restrictions
prior to the consummation of a Change in Control, in each case pursuant to
this Section 12.2, such Award shall continue in effect or be assumed or an
equivalent Award substituted by the successor corporation or a parent or
subsidiary of the successor corporation. In the event an Award continues in
effect or is assumed or an equivalent Award substituted, and a Holder incurs
a Termination of Service without "cause" (as such term is defined in the sole
discretion of the Administrator, or as set forth in the Award Agreement
relating to such Award) upon or within twelve (12) months following a Change
in Control, then such Holder shall be fully vested in such continued, assumed
or substituted Award. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (e)| Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, in the event of
a Change in Control, in the event that the successor corporation in a Change
in Control does not assume or substitute for an Award (or any portion
thereof), the Administrator may cause (i) any or all of such Award (or
portion thereof) to terminate in exchange for cash, rights or other
property pursuant to Section 12.2(b)(i) or (ii) any or all of such Award (or
portion thereof) to become fully exercisable immediately prior to the
consummation of such transaction and all forfeiture restrictions on any or all
of such Award to lapse. If any such Award is exercisable in lieu of
assumption or substitution in the event of a Change in Control, the
Administrator shall notify the Holder that such Award shall be fully
exercisable for a period of fifteen (15) days from the date of such notice,
contingent upon the occurrence of the Change in Control, and such Award shall
terminate upon the expiration of such period. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (f)| For the purposes of this Section 12.2, an Award shall be
considered assumed if, following the Change in Control, the Award confers the
right to purchase or receive, for each Share subject to the Award immediately
prior to the Change in Control, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or
other securities or property) received in the Change in Control by holders of
Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of the transaction (and
if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration
chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if such consideration received in the Change in Control was
not solely common stock of the successor corporation or its parent, the
Administrator may, with the consent of the successor corporation, provide for
the consideration to be received upon the exercise of the Award, for each
Share subject to an Award, to be solely common stock of the successor
corporation or its parent equal in fair market value to the per-share
consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the Change in Control. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (g)| The Administrator, in its sole discretion, may include such
further provisions and limitations in any Award, agreement or certificate, as
it may deem equitable and in the best interests of the Company that are not
inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

 | 27 / 32 
---|--- 

 



    



   | (h)| Unless otherwise determined by the Administrator, no adjustment
or action described in this Section 12.2 or in any other provision of the
Plan shall be authorized to the extent it would (i) cause the Plan to violate
Section 422(b)(1) of the Code, (ii) result in short-swing profits liability
under Section 16 of the Exchange Act or violate the exemptive conditions of
Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act, or (iii) cause an Award to fail to be exempt
from or comply with Section 409A. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (i)| The existence of the Plan, any Program, any Award Agreement
and/or the Awards granted hereunder shall not affect or restrict in any way
the right or power of the Company or the stockholders of the Company to make
or authorize any adjustment, recapitalization, reorganization or other change
in the Company's capital structure or its business, any merger or
consolidation of the Company, any issue of stock or of options, warrants or
rights to purchase stock or of bonds, debentures, preferred or prior
preference stocks the rights of which are superior to or affect the Common
Stock or the rights thereof or that are convertible into or exchangeable for
Common Stock, or the dissolution or liquidation of the Company, or any sale or
transfer of all or any part of its assets or business, or any other corporate
act or proceeding, whether of a similar character or otherwise. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (j)| In the event of any pending stock dividend, stock split,
combination or exchange of shares, merger, consolidation or other
distribution (other than normal cash dividends) of Company assets to
stockholders, or any other change affecting the Shares or the share price of
the Common Stock including any Equity Restructuring, for reasons of
administrative convenience, the Administrator, in its sole discretion, may
refuse to permit the exercise of any Award during a period of up to thirty
(30) days prior to the consummation of any such transaction. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

12.3   _Approval of Plan by Stockholders_. The Plan shall be
submitted for the approval of the Company's stockholders within twelve (12)
months after the date of the Board's initial adoption of the Plan.

  



  

12.4   _No Stockholders Rights_. Except as otherwise provided herein
or in an applicable Program or Award Agreement, a Holder shall have none of
the rights of a stockholder with respect to Shares covered by any Award until
the Holder becomes the record owner of such Shares.

  



  

12.5   _Paperless Administration_. In the event that the Company
establishes, for itself or using the services of a third party, an automated
system for the documentation, granting or exercise of Awards, such as a system
using an internet website or interactive voice response, then the paperless

12.6   _Effect of Plan upon Other Compensation Plans_. The adoption
of the Plan shall not affect any other compensation or incentive plans in
effect for the Company or any Subsidiary. Nothing in the Plan shall be
construed to limit the right of the Company or any Subsidiary: (a) to
establish any other forms of incentives or compensation for Employees,
Directors or Consultants of the Company or any Subsidiary, or (b) to grant or
assume options or other rights or awards otherwise than under the Plan in
connection with any proper corporate purpose including without limitation,

12.7   _Compliance with Laws_. The Plan, the granting and vesting of
Awards under the Plan and the issuance and delivery of Shares and the payment
of money under the Plan or under Awards granted or awarded hereunder are
subject to compliance with all Applicable Law (including but not limited to
state, federal and foreign securities law and margin requirements), and to
such approvals by any listing, regulatory or governmental authority as may,
in the opinion of counsel for the Company, be necessary or advisable in
connection therewith. Any securities delivered under the Plan shall be subject
to such restrictions, and the person acquiring such securities shall, if
requested by the Company, provide such assurances and representations to the
Company as the Company may deem necessary or desirable to assure compliance
with all Applicable Law. The Administrator, in its sole discretion, may take
whatever actions it deems necessary or appropriate to effect compliance with
Applicable Law, including, without limitation, placing legends on share
certificates and issuing stop-transfer notices to agents and registrars.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Administrator may not
take any actions hereunder, and no Awards shall be granted, that would violate
Applicable Law. To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the Plan and
Awards granted or awarded hereunder shall be deemed amended to the extent
necessary to conform to Applicable Law.

  



  

12.8   _Titles and Headings, References to Sections of the Code or
Exchange Act_. The titles and headings of the Sections in the Plan are for
convenience of reference only and, in the event of any conflict, the text of
the Plan, rather than such titles or headings, shall control. References to
sections of the Code or the Exchange Act shall include any amendment or
successor thereto.

  



  

12.9   _Governing Law_. The Plan and any Programs and Award
Agreements hereunder shall be administered, interpreted and enforced under
the internal laws of the State of Delaware without regard to conflicts of laws
thereof or of any other jurisdiction.

  



  

12.10   _Section 409A_. To the extent that the Administrator determines
that any Award granted under the Plan is subject to Section 409A, the Plan,
the Program pursuant to which such Award is granted and the Award Agreement
evidencing such Award shall incorporate the terms and conditions required by
Section 409A. In that regard, to the extent any Award under the Plan or any
other compensatory plan or arrangement of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is subject to Section 409A, and such Award or other amount is
payable on account of a Holder's Termination of Service (or any similarly
defined term), then (a) such Award or amount shall only be paid to the extent
such Termination of Service qualifies as a "separation from service" as
defined in Section 409A, and (b) if such Award or amount is payable to a
"specified employee" as defined in Section 409A then to the extent required
in order to avoid a prohibited distribution under Section 409A, such Award or
other compensatory payment shall not be payable prior to the earlier of (i)
the expiration of the six-month period measured from the date of the
Holder's Termination of Service, or (ii) the date of the Holder's death. To
the extent applicable, the Plan, the Program and any Award Agreements shall
be interpreted in accordance with Section 409A. Notwithstanding any provision
of the Plan to the contrary, in the event that following the Effective Date
the Administrator determines that any Award may be subject to Section 409A,
the Administrator may (but is not obligated to), without a Holder's consent,
adopt such amendments to the Plan and the applicable Program and Award
Agreement or adopt other policies and procedures (including amendments,
policies and procedures with retroactive effect), or take any other actions,
that the Administrator determines are necessary or appropriate to (A) exempt
the Award from Section 409A and/or preserve the intended tax treatment of the
benefits provided with respect to the Award, or (B) comply with the
requirements of Section 409A and thereby avoid the application of any penalty
taxes under Section 409A. The Company makes no representations or warranties
as to the tax treatment of any Award under Section 409A or otherwise. The
Company shall have no obligation under this Section 12.10 or otherwise to
take any action (whether or not described herein) to avoid the imposition of
taxes, penalties or interest under Section 409A with respect to any Award and
shall have no liability to any Holder or any other person if any
Award, compensation or other benefits under the Plan are determined to
constitute non-compliant, "nonqualified deferred compensation" subject to the
imposition of taxes, penalties and/or interest under Section 409A.

  



  

   

 | 29 / 32 
---|--- 

 



    



  

12.11   _Unfunded Status of Awards_. The Plan is intended to be an
"unfunded" plan for incentive compensation. With respect to any payments not
yet made to a Holder pursuant to an Award, nothing contained in the Plan or
any Program or Award Agreement shall give the Holder any rights that are
greater than those of a general creditor of the Company or any Subsidiary.

  



  

12.12   _Indemnification_. To the extent permitted under Applicable Law
and the Organizational Documents, each member of the Administrator (and each
delegate thereof pursuant to Section 11.6) shall be indemnified and held
harmless by the Company from any loss, cost, liability, or expense that may
be imposed upon or reasonably incurred by such member in connection with or
resulting from any claim, action, suit, or proceeding to which he or she may
be a party or in which he or she may be involved by reason of any action or
failure to act pursuant to the Plan or any Award Agreement and against and
from any and all amounts paid by him or her, with the Board's approval, in
satisfaction of judgment in such action, suit, or proceeding against him or
her; _provided_  that he or she gives the Company an opportunity, at its own
expense, to handle and defend the same before he or she undertakes to handle
and defend it on his or her own behalf and, once the Company gives notice of
its intent to assume such defense, the Company shall have sole control over
such defense with counsel of the Company's choosing. The foregoing right of
indemnification shall not be available to the extent that a court of
competent jurisdiction in a final judgment or other final adjudication,
in either case not subject to further appeal, determines that the acts or
omissions of the person seeking indemnity giving rise to the indemnification
claim resulted from such person's bad faith, fraud or willful criminal act or
omission. The foregoing right of indemnification shall not be exclusive of
any other rights of indemnification to which such persons may be entitled
pursuant to the Organizational Documents, as a matter of law, or otherwise,
or any power that the Company may have to indemnify them or hold them
harmless.

  



  

12.13   _Relationship to Other Benefits_. No payment pursuant to the Plan
shall be taken into account in determining any benefits under any pension,
retirement, savings, profit sharing, group insurance, welfare or other benefit
plan of the Company or any Subsidiary except to the extent otherwise
expressly provided in writing in such other plan or an agreement thereunder.

12.14   _Expenses_. The expenses of administering the Plan shall be borne
by the Company and its Subsidiaries.

2.1.1_ initiated by Michael W. Bor, or (iii) two (2) Registrations pursuant

Original Holder.

  



  

2.1.2 _Effective Registration_. Notwithstanding the provisions of
_subsection 2.1.1 _above or any other part of this Agreement, a Registration

to a Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration has been declared
effective by the Commission and (ii) the Company has complied with all of its
obligations under this Agreement with respect thereto; _provided_ , 
_further_ , _however_ , that if, after such Registration Statement has been
declared effective, an offering of Registrable Securities in a Registration

order or injunction of the Commission, federal or state court or any other
governmental agency, the Registration Statement with respect to such
Registration shall be deemed not to have been declared effective for purposes
of counting Registrations under _subsection 2.1.1 _above unless and until
(i) such stop order or injunction is removed, rescinded or otherwise
terminated, and (ii) a majority-in-interest of the Demanding Holders
initiating such Demand Registration thereafter affirmatively elect to continue
with such Registration and accordingly notify the Company in writing, but in
no event later than five (5) days, of such election; _provided_ ,  _further_
, _however_ , that the Company shall not be obligated or required to file
another Registration Statement until the Registration Statement that has been
previously filed with respect to a Registration pursuant to a Demand
Registration becomes effective or has been terminated.

  



  

2.1.3 _Underwritten Offering_. Subject to the provisions of
_subsection 2.1.4_ and _Section 2.4_ hereof, if the Demanding Holder
advises the Company as part of its Demand Registration that the offering of
the Registrable Securities pursuant to such Demand Registration shall be in
the form of an Underwritten Offering, then the right of such Demanding Holder
or any Demand Requesting Holder (if any) to include its Registrable
Securities in such Registration shall be conditioned upon such Holder's
participation in such Underwritten Offering and the inclusion of such
Holder's Registrable Securities in such Underwritten Offering to the extent
provided herein. All such Holders proposing to distribute their Registrable
Securities through an Underwritten Offering under this _subsection 2.1.3_
shall enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the
Underwriter(s) selected for such Underwritten Offering by the Company, which
Underwriter(s) shall be reasonably acceptable to the Demanding Holder
initiating the Demand Registration.

  



  

2.1.4 _Reduction of Underwritten Offering_. If the managing
Underwriter or Underwriters in an Underwritten Registration pursuant to a
Demand Registration, in good faith, advises the Company, the Demanding Holder
and any other Demand Requesting Holders (if any) in writing that the dollar
amount or number of Registrable Securities that the Demanding Holder and the
Demand Requesting Holders (if any) desire to sell, taken together with all
other Common Stock or other equity securities that the Company desires to sell
and the Common Stock, if any, as to which a Registration has been requested
pursuant to separate written contractual piggy-back registration rights held
by any other stockholders who desire to sell, exceeds the maximum dollar
amount or maximum number of equity securities that can be sold in the
Underwritten Offering without adversely affecting the proposed offering price,
the timing, the distribution method, or the probability of success of such
offering (such maximum dollar amount or maximum number of such securities, as
applicable, the "Maximum Number of Securities"), then the Company shall
include in such Underwritten Offering, as follows: (i) first, the Registrable
Securities of the Demanding Holder and the Demand Requesting Holders (if any)
(on a pro rata basis based on the respective number of Registrable Securities
then owned by such Demanding Holder and each Demand Requesting Holder (if
any) in relation to the aggregate number of Registrable Securities owned by
such Demanding Holder and each Demand Requesting Holder (if any) (such
proportion is referred to herein as "Pro Rata")) that can be sold without
exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; (ii) second, to the extent that
the Maximum Number of Securities has not been reached under the foregoing
clause (i), Common Stock or other equity securities that the Company desires
to sell, which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of
Securities; and (iii) third, to the extent that the Maximum Number of
Securities has not been reached under the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii),
Common Stock or other equity securities of other persons or entities that the
Company is obligated to register in a Registration pursuant to separate
written contractual arrangements with such persons and that can be sold
without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities.

  



  

   



 



    



  

2.1.5 _Demand Registration Withdrawal_. TRP, in the case of a
Registration under subsection 2.1.1 initiated by TRP, Michael W. Bor, in the
case of a Registration under subsection 2.1.1 initiated by Michael W. Bor, or
the Original Holder, in the case of a Registration under subsection 2.1.1
initiated by the Original Holder, as the case may be, or a majority-in-
interest of the Demand Requesting Holders (if any) shall have the right to
withdraw from a Registration pursuant to such Demand Registration for any or
no reason whatsoever upon written notification to the Company and the
Underwriter(s) (if any) of their intention to withdraw from such
Registration prior to the effectiveness of the Registration Statement filed
with the Commission with respect to the Registration of their
Registrable Securities pursuant to such Demand Registration (or, in the case
of an Underwritten Registration pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities
Act, at least two (2) business days prior to the time of pricing of the
applicable offering). If a Demanding Holder initiating a Demand Registration
withdraws from a proposed offering pursuant to this _Section 2.1.5_, then
such registration shall not count as a Demand Registration provided for in
_Section 2.1_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
the Company shall be responsible for the Registration Expenses incurred in
connection with a Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration prior to its
withdrawal under this _subsection 2.1.5_.

  



  

Section 2.2. Piggyback Registration.

  



  

2.2.1 _Piggyback Rights_. If the Company proposes to file a
Registration Statement under the Securities Act with respect to an
offering of equity securities, or securities or other obligations exercisable
or exchangeable for, or convertible into equity securities, for its own
account or for the account of stockholders of the Company (or by the Company
and by the stockholders of the Company including, without limitation,
pursuant to _Section 2.1_), other than a Registration Statement (i) filed in
connection with any employee stock option or other benefit plan, (ii) for an
exchange offer or offering of securities solely to the Company's existing
stockholders, (iii) for an offering of debt that is convertible into equity
securities of the Company or (iv) for a dividend reinvestment plan, then the
Company shall give written notice of such proposed registration to all of the
Holders of Registrable Securities as soon as practicable but no later than
(5) days following the initial filing date of such Registration Statement,
which notice shall (A) describe the amount and type of securities to be
included in such offering, the intended method(s) of distribution, and the
name of the proposed managing Underwriter(s), if any, in such offering, and
(B) offer to all of the Holders of Registrable Securities the opportunity to
register the sale of such number of Registrable Securities as such Holders
may request in writing within five (5) days after receipt of such written
notice (such Registration a "Piggyback Registration"). The Company shall, in
good faith, cause such Registrable Securities to be included in such
Piggyback Registration and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
managing Underwriter(s) of a proposed Underwritten Offering to permit the
Registrable Securities requested by the Holders pursuant to this _subsection
2.2.1_ to be included in a Piggyback Registration on the same terms and
conditions as any similar securities of the Company included in such
Registration and to permit the sale or other disposition of such Registrable
Securities in accordance with the intended method(s) of distribution thereof.
All such Holders proposing to distribute their Registrable Securities through
an Underwritten Offering under this  _subsection 2.2.1_ shall enter into an
underwriting agreement in customary form with the Underwriter(s) selected for
such Underwritten Offering by the Company.

  



  

   



 



    



  

2.2.2 _Reduction of Piggyback Registration_. If the managing
Underwriter(s) in an Underwritten Registration that is to be a Piggyback
Registration, in good faith, advises the Company and the Holders of
Registrable Securities participating in the Piggyback Registration in
writing that the dollar amount or number of shares of Common Stock that the
Company desires to sell, taken together with (i) the shares of Common Stock,
if any, as to which Registration has been demanded pursuant to separate
written contractual arrangements with persons or entities other than the
Holders of Registrable Securities hereunder, (ii) the Registrable Securities
as to which registration has been requested pursuant to _Section 2.2_
hereof, and (iii) the shares of Common Stock, if any, as to which
Registration has been requested pursuant to separate written contractual
piggy-back registration rights of other stockholders of the Company, exceeds
the Maximum Number of Securities, then:

  



   | (i)| If the Registration is undertaken for the Company's account, the
Company shall include in any such Registration (A) first, Common Stock or
other equity securities that the Company desires to sell, which can be
sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; (B) second, to the
extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been reached under the
foregoing clause (A), the Registrable Securities of Holders exercising their
rights to register their Registrable Securities pursuant to _subsection
2.2.1_ hereof (on a pro rata basis based on the respective number of
Registrable Securities then owned by each such requesting Holder in relation
to the aggregate number of Registrable Securities owned by all such
requesting Holders, which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of
Securities; and (C) third, to the extent that the Maximum Number of
Securities has not been reached under the foregoing clauses (A) and (B),
Common Stock, if any, as to which Registration has been requested pursuant to
written contractual piggy-back registration rights of other stockholders of
the Company, which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of
Securities; and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (ii)| If the Registration is pursuant to a request by persons or
entities other than the Holders of Registrable Securities, then the Company
shall include in any such Registration (A) first, Common Stock or other equity
securities, if any, of such requesting persons or entities, other than the
Holders of Registrable Securities, which can be sold without exceeding the
Maximum Number of Securities; (B) second, to the extent that the Maximum
Number of Securities has not been reached under the foregoing clause (A), the
Registrable Securities of Holders exercising their rights to register their
Registrable Securities pursuant to _subsection 2.2.1_ hereof (on a pro rata
basis based on the respective number of Registrable Securities then owned by
each such requesting Holder in relation to the aggregate number of Registrable
Securities owned by all such requesting Holders, which can be sold without
exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; (C) third, to the extent that the
Maximum Number of Securities has not been reached under the foregoing clauses
(A) and (B), Common Stock or other equity securities that the Company desires
to sell, which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities;
and (D) fourth, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not
been reached under the foregoing clauses (A), (B) and (C), Common Stock or
other equity securities for the account of other persons or entities that the
Company is obligated to register pursuant to separate written contractual
arrangements with such persons or entities, which can be sold without
exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

2.2.3 _Piggyback Registration Withdrawal_. Any Holder of Registrable
Securities shall have the right to withdraw from a Piggyback Registration for
any or no reason whatsoever upon written notification to the Company and the
Underwriter or Underwriters (if any) of his, her or its intention to withdraw
from such Piggyback Registration prior to the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement filed with the Commission with respect to such
Piggyback Registration. The Company (whether on its own good faith
determination or as the result of a request for withdrawal by persons
pursuant to separate written contractual obligations) may withdraw a
Registration Statement filed with the Commission in connection with a
Piggyback Registration at any time prior to the effectiveness of
such Registration Statement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, the Company shall be responsible for the Registration
Expenses incurred in connection with the Piggyback Registration prior to its
withdrawal under this _subsection 2.2.3_.

  



  

   



 



    



  

2.2.4 _Unlimited Piggyback Registration Rights_. For purposes of
clarity, any Registration effected pursuant to _Section 2.2_ hereof shall
not be counted as a Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration effected
under _Section 2.1_ hereof, and there shall be no limit on the number of
Piggyback Registrations.

  



  

2.2.5 _Right to Terminate Registration_. The Company shall have the
right to terminate or withdraw any registration initiated by it under this
_Section 2.2_ prior to the effectiveness of such registration whether or not
any Holder of Registrable Securities has elected to include securities in
such registration.

  



  

Section 2.3. Resale Shelf Registration Rights

  



  

2.3.1 _Registration Statement Covering Resale of Registrable
Securities_. The Company shall prepare and file or cause to be prepared and
filed with the Commission, no later than forty-five (45) days following the
Closing Date (the "Filing Deadline"), a Registration Statement for an
offering to be made on a continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 of the
Securities Act or any successor thereto registering the resale from time to
time by Holders of all of the Registrable Securities held by the Holders
(which may also include the PIPE Shares) (the "Resale Shelf Registration
Statement"). The Resale Shelf Registration Statement shall be on Form S-3
(or, if Form S-3 is not available to be used by the Company at such time, on
Form S-1 or another appropriate form permitting Registration of such
Registrable Securities for resale). If the Resale Shelf Registration
Statement is initially filed on Form S-1 and thereafter the Company becomes
eligible to use Form S-3 for secondary sales, the Company shall, as promptly
as practicable, cause such Resale Shelf Registration Statement to be amended,
or shall file a new replacement Resale Shelf Registration Statement, such
that the Resale Shelf Registration Statement is on Form S-3. The Company shall
use reasonable best efforts to cause the Resale Shelf Registration Statement
to be declared effective as soon as possible after filing but no later than
the earlier of (i) 90th day (or 120th day if the SEC notifies the Company that
it will "review" the Resale Shelf Registration Statement) following the
Closing Date and (ii) the 10th business day after the date the Company is
notified (orally or in writing, whichever is earlier) by the SEC that the
Resale Shelf Registration Statement will not be "reviewed" or will not be
subject to further review; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company's
obligations to include the Registrable Securities held by a Holder in the
Resale Shelf Registration Statement are contingent upon such Holder furnishing
in writing to the Company such information regarding the Holder, the
securities of the Company held by the Holder and the intended method of
disposition of the Registrable Securities as shall be reasonably requested by
the Company to effect the registration of the Registrable Securities, and the
Holder shall execute such documents in connection with such registration as
the Company may reasonably request that are customary of a selling
stockholder in similar situations. Once effective, the Company shall
use reasonable best efforts to keep the Resale Shelf Registration Statement
and Prospectus included therein continuously effective and to be supplemented
and amended to the extent necessary to ensure that such Registration Statement
is available or, if not available, to ensure that another Registration
Statement is available, under the Securities Act at all times until the
earliest of (i) the date on which all Registrable Securities and other
securities covered by such Registration Statement have been disposed of in
accordance with the intended method(s) of distribution set forth in such
Registration Statement and (ii) the date on which all Registrable Securities
and other securities covered by such Registration Statement have ceased to be
Registrable Securities. The Registration Statement filed with the Commission
pursuant to this _subsection 2.3.1_ shall contain a prospectus in such form as
to permit any Holder to sell such Registrable Securities pursuant to Rule 415
under the Securities Act (or any successor or similar provision adopted by
the Commission then in effect) at any time beginning on the effective date for
such Registration Statement (subject to lock-up restrictions provided in
_Section 5.1_ of this Agreement), and shall provide that such
Registrable Securities may be sold pursuant to any method or combination of
methods legally available to, and requested by, Holders.

  



  

2.3.2 _Notification and Distribution of Materials_. The Company shall
notify the Holders in writing of the effectiveness of the Resale Shelf
Registration Statement as soon as practicable, and in any event within five
(5) Business Days after the Resale Shelf Registration Statement becomes
effective, and shall furnish to them, without charge, such number of copies of
the Resale Shelf Registration Statement (including any amendments,
supplements and exhibits), the Prospectus contained therein (including each
preliminary prospectus and all related amendments and supplements) and any
documents incorporated by reference in the Resale Shelf Registration
Statement or such other documents as the Holders may reasonably request in
order to facilitate the sale of the Registrable Securities in the manner
described in the Resale Shelf Registration Statement (to the extent that any
of such documents is not available on EDGAR).

  



  

   



 



    



  

2.3.3 _Amendments and Supplements_. Subject to the provisions of
_Section 2.3.1_ above, the Company shall promptly prepare and file with the
Commission from time to time such amendments and supplements to the Resale
Shelf Registration Statement and Prospectus used in connection therewith as
may be necessary to keep the Resale Shelf Registration Statement effective and
to comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the
disposition of all the Registrable Securities. If any Resale Shelf
Registration Statement filed pursuant to _Section 2.3.1_ is filed on Form
S-3 and thereafter the Company becomes ineligible to use Form S-3 for
secondary sales, the Company shall promptly notify the Holders of such
ineligibility and use its best efforts to file a shelf registration on an
appropriate form as promptly as practicable to replace the shelf registration
statement on Form S-3 and have such replacement Resale Shelf Registration
Statement declared effective as promptly as practicable and to cause such
replacement Resale Shelf Registration Statement to remain effective, and to
be supplemented and amended to the extent necessary to ensure that such
Resale Shelf Registration Statement is available or, if not available, that
another Resale Shelf Registration Statement is available, for the resale of
all the Registrable Securities held by the Holders until all such Registrable
Securities have ceased to be Registrable Securities; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that at any time the Company once again becomes eligible to use Form S-3, the
Company shall cause such replacement Resale Shelf Registration Statement to be
amended, or shall file a new replacement Resale Shelf Registration Statement,
such that the Resale Shelf Registration Statement is once again on Form S-3.

  



  

2.3.4 _SEC Cutback_. Notwithstanding the registration obligations set
forth in this _Section 2.3_, in the event the Commission informs the Company
that all of the Registrable Securities cannot, as a result of the application
of Rule 415, be registered for resale as a secondary offering on a single
registration statement, the Company agrees to promptly (i) inform each of
the Holders thereof and use its reasonable best efforts to file amendments to
the Resale Shelf Registration Statement as required by the Commission and/or
(ii) withdraw the Resale Shelf Registration Statement and file a new
registration statement (a "New Registration Statement") on Form S-3, or if
Form S-3 is not then available to the Company for such
registration statement, on such other form available to register for resale
the Registrable Securities as a secondary offering; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that prior to filing such amendment or New Registration Statement, the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to advocate with the Commission for the
registration of all of the Registrable Securities in accordance with any
publicly-available written or oral guidance, comments, requirements or
requests of the Commission staff (the "SEC Guidance"). Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, if any SEC Guidance sets forth a limitation
on the number of Registrable Securities permitted to be registered on a
particular Registration Statement as a secondary offering (and notwithstanding
that the Company used diligent efforts to advocate with the Commission for
the registration of all or a greater number of Registrable Securities), unless
otherwise directed in writing by a Holder as to further limit its Registrable
Securities to be included on the Registration Statement, the number of
Registrable Securities to be registered on such Registration Statement will be
reduced on a pro rata basis based on the total number of Registrable
Securities held by the Holders, subject to a determination by the Commission
that certain Holders must be reduced first based on the number of Registrable
Securities held by such Holders. In the event the Company amends the
Resale Shelf Registration Statement or files a New Registration Statement, as
the case may be, under clauses (i) or (ii) above, the Company will use its
reasonable best efforts to file with the Commission, as promptly as allowed by
Commission or SEC Guidance provided to the Company or to registrants of
securities in general, one or more registration statements on Form S-3 or
such other form available to register for resale those Registrable Securities
that were not registered for resale on the Resale Shelf Registration
Statement, as amended, or the New Registration Statement.

  



  

2.3.5 _Underwritten Shelf Takedown_. At any time and from time to time
after a Resale Shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3 has been
declared effective by the Commission, any of the Demanding Holders may
request to sell all or any portion of the Registrable Securities in an
underwritten offering that is registered pursuant to such Resale Shelf
Registration Statement (each, an "Underwritten Shelf Takedown"); provided,
however, that the Company shall only be obligated to effect an Underwritten
Shelf Takedown if such offering shall include securities with a total
offering price (including piggyback securities and before deduction of
underwriting discounts) reasonably expected to exceed, in the aggregate,
$15,000,000. All requests for Underwritten Shelf Takedowns shall be made by
giving written notice to the Company, which shall specify the approximate
number of Registrable Securities proposed to be sold in the Underwritten
Shelf Takedown. Promptly upon receiving such notice (but no later than 10 days
after receipt of such notice), the Company shall notify all of the holders of
Registrable Securities regarding the potential Underwritten Shelf
Takedown. The Company shall include in any Underwritten Shelf Takedown the
securities requested to be included by any Holder (each a
"Takedown Requesting Holder") within 5 days of receipt of notice of such
Underwritten Shelf Takedown pursuant to written contractual piggyback
registration rights of such Holder (including those set forth herein). All
such Holders proposing to distribute their Registrable Securities through an
Underwritten Shelf Takedown under this _subsection 2.3.5_ shall enter into an
underwriting agreement in customary form with the Underwriter(s) selected for
such Underwritten Offering by the Company, with the consent of the Demanding
Holder who initiated the Underwritten Shelf Takedown.

  



  

   



 



    



  

2.3.6 _Reduction of Underwritten Shelf Takedown_. If the managing
Underwriter(s) in an Underwritten Shelf Takedown, in good faith, advise the
Company and the Takedown Requesting Holders in writing that the dollar amount
or number of Registrable Securities that the Takedown Requesting Holders
desire to sell, taken together with all other shares of the Common Stock or
other equity securities that the Company desires to sell, exceeds the Maximum
Number of Securities, then the Company shall include in such Underwritten
Shelf Takedown, as follows: (i) first, the Registrable Securities of the
Takedown Requesting Holders, on a Pro Rata basis, that can be sold without
exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; and (ii) second, to the extent
that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been reached under the foregoing
clause (i), the Common Stock or other equity securities that the Company
desires to sell, which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of
Securities.

  



  

2.3.7 Registrations effected pursuant to this _Section 2.3_ shall not
be counted as Demand Registrations effected pursuant to _Section 2.1_. Under
no circumstances shall the Company be obligated to effect more than an
aggregate of four (4) Underwritten Shelf Takedowns in any 12-month period.

  



  

2.3.8 _Block Trades_. If a Demanding Holder wishes to consummate an
overnight block trade (on either an SEC registered or non-registered basis),
then notwithstanding the time periods and piggyback rights otherwise provided
herein, such Demanding Holder shall, if it would like the assistance of the
Company, endeavor to give the Company sufficient advance notice in order to
prepare the appropriate documentation for such transaction. Such Demanding
Holder, if requesting an SEC registered underwritten block trade, (1)
shall give the Company written notice of the transaction and the anticipated
launch date of the transaction at least two (2) business days prior to the
anticipated launch date of the transaction, (2) the Company shall be required
to only notify the other Demanding Holders of the transaction and none of the
other Holders, (3) the other Demanding Holders shall have one (1) business day
prior to the launch of the transaction to determine if they wish to
participate in the block trade, and (4) the Company shall include in the
block trade only shares held by the Demanding Holders. Any Registration
effected pursuant to this Section 2.3.8 shall not be counted as Demand
Registrations effected pursuant to Section 2.1 but shall be deemed an
Underwritten Shelf Takedown and within the cap on Underwritten Shelf
Takedowns provided in Section 2.3.7.

  



  

Section 2.4. Restrictions on Registration Rights. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, the Company shall not be obligated to (but
may, at its sole option) file a Registration Statement pursuant to a Demand
Registration request made under Section 2.1 or effect an Underwritten Shelf
Takedown made pursuant to Section 2.3.5 within 90 days after any other
Demand Registration or Underwritten Shelf Takedown, provided that the Company
has delivered written notice to the Holders prior to receipt of a Demand
Registration pursuant to _subsection 2.1.1_ or a request for an Underwritten
Shelf Takedown pursuant to Section 2.3.5. and that the Company continues to
actively employ, in good faith, all reasonable efforts to cause the applicable
Registration Statement to become effective or Underwritten Shelf Takedown to
be consummated.

needs;

  



  

3.1.16 if a Registration relates to an Underwritten Offering with gross
proceeds in excess of $25,000,000, use its reasonable efforts to make
available senior executives of the Company to participate in customary "road
show" presentations that may be reasonably requested by the Underwriter(s) in
any Underwritten Offering; and

  



  

3.1.17 otherwise, in good faith, cooperate reasonably with, and take
such customary actions as may reasonably be requested by the Holders, in
connection with such Registration.

  



  

Section 3.2. Registration Expenses. All Registration Expenses shall be borne
by the Company, including as set forth in Section 2.1.5. It is acknowledged
by the Holders that the Holders shall pay the Underwriters' commissions and
discounts and, other than as set forth in the definition of "Registration
Expenses," all reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel representing
the Holders.

  



  

Section 3.3. Requirements for Participation in Underwritten Offerings. No
person may participate in any Underwritten Offering for equity securities of
the Company unless such person (i) agrees to sell such person's securities on
the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the Company
and (ii) completes and executes all customary questionnaires, powers of
attorney, indemnities, lock-up agreements, underwriting agreements and other
customary documents as may be reasonably required under the terms of such
underwriting arrangements.

  



  

   



 



    



  

Section 3.4. Suspension of Sales; Adverse Disclosure. The Company shall
promptly notify each of the Holders in writing if a Registration Statement or
Prospectus contains a Misstatement and, upon receipt of such written notice
from the Company, each of the Holders shall forthwith discontinue disposition
of Registrable Securities until he, she or it is advised in writing by the
Company that the use of the Prospectus may be resumed or has received copies
of a supplemented or amended Prospectus correcting the Misstatement, provided
that the Company hereby covenants promptly to prepare and file any required
supplement or amendment correcting any Misstatement promptly after the time
of such notice and, if necessary, to request the immediate effectiveness
thereof.  If the filing, initial effectiveness or continued use of a
Registration Statement or Prospectus included in any Registration
Statement at any time (a) would require the Company to make an Adverse
Disclosure, (b) would require the inclusion in such Registration Statement of
financial statements that are unavailable to the Company for reasons beyond
the Company's control, or (c) in the good faith judgment of the Board, which
judgment shall be documented in writing and provided to the Holders in the
form of a written certificate signed by the Chairman of the Board, such
filing, initial effectiveness or continued use of a Registration
Statement would materially adversely affect the Company, the Company shall
have the right to defer the filing, initial effectiveness or continued use of
any Registration Statement pursuant to (a), (b) or (c) for a period of not
more than sixty (60) consecutive days and the Company shall not defer any
such filing, initial effectiveness or use of a Registration Statement pursuant
to this Section 3.4 for more than three times or for more than a total of 120
days (in each case counting deferrals initiated pursuant to (a), (b) and (c)
in the aggregate) in any 12-month period.

  



  

Section 3.5. Reporting Obligations. As long as any Holder shall own
Registrable Securities, the Company, at all times while it shall be a
reporting company under the Exchange Act, covenants to file timely (or obtain
extensions in respect thereof and file within the applicable grace period)
all reports required to be filed by the Company after the date hereof pursuant
to  _Sections 13(a)_ or _15(d)_ of the Exchange Act and to promptly furnish
the Holders with true and complete copies of all such filings (unless such
filings are otherwise available on EDGAR). The Company further covenants that
it shall take such further action as any Holder may reasonably request, all
to the extent required from time to time to enable such Holder to sell shares
of Common Stock held by such Holder without registration under the Securities
Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rule 144 promulgated
under the Securities Act (or any successor rule promulgated thereafter by the
Commission), including providing any legal opinions. Upon the request of any
Holder, the Company shall deliver to such Holder a written certification of a
duly authorized officer as to whether it has complied with such requirements.

  



  

Section 3.6. Limitations on Registration Rights. The Company shall not
hereafter enter into any agreement with respect to its securities which is
inconsistent with or violates the rights granted to the Holders of Registrable
Securities in this Agreement and in the event of any conflict between any
such agreement or agreements and this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement
shall prevail.

  



  

Article IV 
 INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION

  



  

Section 4.1. Indemnification

  



  

4.1.1 The Company agrees to indemnify, to the extent permitted by law,
each Holder of Registrable Securities, its officers and directors and agents
and each person who controls such Holder (within the meaning of the Securities
Act) against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including
attorneys' fees) resulting from any untrue or alleged untrue statement of
material fact contained in any Registration Statement, Prospectus or
preliminary Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any
omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as
the same are caused by or contained in any information furnished in writing to
the Company by such Holder expressly for use therein. The Company shall
indemnify the Underwriter(s), their officers and directors and each
person who controls (within the meaning of the Securities Act) such
Underwriter(s) to the same extent as provided in the foregoing with respect
to the indemnification of the Holder.

  



  

   



 



    



  

4.1.2 In connection with any Registration Statement in which a Holder
of Registrable Securities is participating, such Holder shall furnish to the
Company in writing such information and affidavits as the Company reasonably
requests for use in connection with any such Registration Statement or
Prospectus and, to the extent permitted by law, shall indemnify the Company,
its directors and officers and agents and each person who controls (within
the meaning of the Securities Act) the Company against any losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and expenses (including without limitation reasonable
attorneys' fees) resulting from any untrue statement of material fact
contained in the Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus
or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any omission of a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading, but only to the extent that such untrue statement or omission
is contained in any information or affidavit so furnished in writing by such
Holder expressly for use therein; _provided_ , _however_ , that the obligation
to indemnify shall be several, not joint and several, among such Holders of
Registrable Securities, and the liability of each such Holder of Registrable
Securities shall be in proportion to and limited to the net proceeds received
by such Holder from the sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to such
Registration Statement. The Holders of Registrable Securities shall indemnify
the Underwriter(s), their officers, directors and each person who controls
(within the meaning of the Securities Act) such Underwriter(s) to the same
extent as provided in the foregoing with respect to indemnification of the
Company.

  



  

4.1.3 Any person entitled to indemnification herein shall (i) give
prompt written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to
which it seeks indemnification ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to
give prompt notice shall not impair any person's right to indemnification
hereunder to the extent such failure has not materially prejudiced the
indemnifying party) and (ii) unless in such indemnified party's reasonable
judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying
parties may exist with respect to such claim, permit such indemnifying party
to assume the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to
the indemnified party. If such defense is assumed, the indemnifying party
shall not be subject to any liability for any settlement made by the
indemnified party without its consent (but such consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). An indemnifying party who
is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the defense of a claim shall not
be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all
parties indemnified by such indemnifying party with respect to such claim,
unless in the reasonable judgment of any indemnified party a conflict of
interest may exist between such indemnified party and any other of such
indemnified parties with respect to such claim. No indemnifying party shall,
without the consent of the indemnified party, consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement which cannot be settled in all respects
by the payment of money (and such money is so paid by the indemnifying party
pursuant to the terms of such settlement) or which settlement does not
include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or
plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in
respect to such claim or litigation.

  



  

4.1.4 The indemnification provided for under this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on
behalf of the indemnified party or any officer, director or controlling person
of such indemnified party and shall survive the transfer of securities. The
Company and each Holder of Registrable Securities participating in an offering
also agrees to make such provisions as are reasonably requested by any
indemnified party for contribution (pursuant to _subsection 4.1.5_ ) to such
party in the event the Company's or such Holder's indemnification is
unavailable for any reason.

  



  

4.1.5 If the indemnification provided under _Section 4.1_ hereof from
the indemnifying party is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an
indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
expenses referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of
indemnifying the indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or
payable by the indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect
the relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party, as
well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative fault of
the indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference
to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue
or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission
to state a material fact, was made by, or relates to information supplied by,
such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the indemnifying party's
and indemnified party's relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such action; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the liability of any Holder under this _subsection 4.1.5_ shall be limited to
the amount of the net proceeds received by such Holder in such offering giving
rise to such liability. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of
the losses or other liabilities referred to above shall be deemed to
include, subject to the limitations set forth in _subsections 4.1.1_ ,
_4.1.2_ and _4.1.3_ above, any legal or other fees, charges or expenses
reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or
proceeding. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable
if contribution pursuant to this _subsection 4.1.5_ were determined by pro
rata allocation or by any other method of allocation, which does not take
account of the equitable considerations referred to in this  _subsection
4.1.5_. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning
of _Section 11(f)_ of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution
pursuant to this _subsection 4.1.5_ from any person who was not guilty of
such fraudulent misrepresentation.

Section 7.2. Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall

the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a
mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby

statement pursuant to the requirements of Section 12 of the Exchange Act or a
registration statement pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act in
respect of the Common Stock, the Company covenants that (i) so long as it
remains subject to the reporting provisions of the Exchange Act, it will
timely file the reports required to be filed by it under the Securities Act
or the Exchange Act (including, but not limited to, the reports under
Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act referred to in subparagraph
(c)(1)(i) of Rule 144 under the Securities Act, as such Rule may be amended
("Rule 144")) or, if the Company is not required to file such reports, it
will, upon the request of any Holder, make publicly available other
information so long as necessary to permit sales by such Holder under Rule
144 or any similar rules or regulations hereafter adopted by the SEC, and (ii)
it will take such further action as any Holder may reasonably request, all to
the extent required from time to time to enable such Holder to sell
Registrable Securities without registration under the Securities Act within
the limitation of the exemptions provided by (A) Rule 144 or (B) any similar
rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the SEC. Upon the request of any
Holder of Registrable Securities, the Company will deliver to such Holder a
written statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements.

  



  

Section 7.4. Entire Agreement; Assignment. This Agreement constitutes the
entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersedes all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral,
among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.
This Agreement shall not be assigned (whether pursuant to a merger,
by operation of law or otherwise), by any party without the prior express
written consent of the other parties hereto, except that a Holder may,
without consent, assign such Holder's rights under this Agreement to any
transferee of Common Stock permitted under Sections 5.2.2-5.2.7 (such
transferees, "Permitted Transferees").

  



  

Section 7.5. Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto (and its respective
permitted assigns), and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to or shall confer upon any other person any right, benefit or
remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 7.6. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to
contracts executed in and to be performed in that State. All legal actions and
proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard and
determined exclusively in any Delaware Chancery Court; _provided_ , _however_
, that if jurisdiction is not then available in the Delaware Chancery Court,
then any such legal action may be brought in any federal court located in the
State of Delaware or any other Delaware state court. The parties hereto hereby
(a) irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts
for themselves and with respect to their respective properties for the purpose
of any action arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by any
party hereto, and (b) agree not to commence any action relating thereto
except in the courts described above in Delaware, other than actions in any
court of competent jurisdiction to enforce any judgment, decree or award
rendered by any such court in Delaware as described herein. Each of the
parties further agrees that notice as provided herein shall constitute
sufficient service of process and the parties further waive any argument that
such service is insufficient. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion or as a
defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action arising out of or relating
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (a) any claim that
it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the courts in Delaware as
described herein for any reason, (b) that it or its property is exempt or
immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process
commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior
to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of
judgment or otherwise) and (c) that (i) the action in any such court is
brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such action is improper
or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in
or by such courts.

  



  

   



 



    



  

Section 7.7. Waiver of Jury Trial. Each of the parties hereto hereby waives
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law any right it may have to a
trial by jury with respect to any litigation directly or indirectly arising
out of, under or in connection with this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto
(i) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any other party
has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in
the event of litigation, seek to enforce that foregoing waiver and (ii)
acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been induced to enter
into this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, as applicable,
by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this
_Section 7.7_.

  



  

Section 7.8. Headings; Interpretation. The descriptive headings contained in
this Agreement are included for convenience of reference only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The parties
have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement.
If any ambiguity or question of intent arises, this Agreement will
be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties and no presumption or
burden of proof will arise favoring or disfavoring any party because of the
authorship of any provision of this Agreement. Unless the context of this
Agreement clearly requires otherwise, use of the masculine gender shall
include the feminine and neutral genders and vice versa, and the definitions
of terms contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well
as the plural forms of such terms. The words "includes" or  "including" shall
mean "including without limitation." The words "hereof," "hereby,"  "herein,"
"hereunder" and similar terms in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement
as a whole and not any particular section or article in which such words
appear, the word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree
to which a subject or other thing extends and such phrase shall not mean
simply "if." Any reference to a law shall include any rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, and shall mean such law as from time to time
amended, modified or supplemented. References herein to any contract
(including this Agreement) mean such contract as amended, supplemented or
modified from time to time in accordance with the terms thereof.

  



  

Section 7.9. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile or portable document format (pdf) transmission) in
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of
which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

  



  

Section 7.10. Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement was not
performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be
entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any
other remedy at law or in equity. Each of the parties hereby further waives
(a) any defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law
would be adequate and (b) any requirement under any Law to post security or a
bond as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

  



  

Section 7.11. Expenses. Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such costs and
expenses, whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated.

  



  

Section 7.12. Amendment. Following the Effective Time, this Agreement may not
be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by (i) the Company, (ii)
the Original Holder (provided the Original Holder or its Permitted
Transferee(s) holds Registrable Securities at the time of such amendment),
(iii) TRP (provided TRP or its Permitted Transferee(s) holds Registrable
Securities at the time of such amendment), and (iv) Michael W. Bor (provided
Michael W. Bor or his Permitted Transferee(s) holds Registrable Securities at
the time of such amendment).

  



  

   



 



    



  

Section 7.13. Waiver. At any time, the Company may (a) extend the time for
the performance of any obligation or other act of any Holder, (b) waive any
inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of any Holder contained
herein or in any document delivered by such Holder pursuant hereto and (c)
waive compliance with any agreement of such Holder (other than with respect
to  _Section 5.1_ ) or any condition to its own obligations contained herein.
At any time, any Holder may, in respect of itself and not other Holders, (a)
extend the time for the performance of any obligation or other act of the
Company, (b) waive any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of
the Company contained herein or in any document delivered by the Company
pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any agreement of the Company or
any condition to their own obligations contained herein. Any such extension
or waiver shall be valid if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by
the party or parties to be bound thereby.

  



  

Section 7.14. No Strict Construction. The language used in this Agreement
shall be deemed to be the language chosen by the parties to express their
mutual intent and no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any
party.

3.   _Certain Transactions._ Each Stockholder Party acknowledges that TRP's business and that of its affiliates, partners, controlling persons, and their respective affiliates is to provide capital and financing to businesses and enterprises. Accordingly, in recognition of the benefits to be derived by the Company of having TRP as a Stockholder Party _,_ each Stockholder Party agrees that TRP and its affiliates may engage in business activities or commercial transactions that may be seen to compete with the Company, that neither the Company nor any of its stockholders shall have any right in or to such other interests or activities or to the income or proceeds derived therefrom, and that TRP shall not be obligated to present any particular investment or business opportunity to the Company or any of its affiliates even if that opportunity were of a type which, if presented to the Company or an affiliate, could be undertaken by it. 

  



  

4.   _Entire agreement_ _._ This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding of the parties hereto in respect of the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior understandings, agreements, or representations by or among the parties hereto, written or oral, to the extent they relate in any way to the subject matter hereof. This Stockholder Agreement may not be changed, amended, modified or waived (other than to correct a typographical error) as to any particular provision, except by a written instrument executed by the parties hereto.

  



  

5.   _Assignment_. No party hereto may, except as set forth herein, assign either this Agreement or any of its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other parties. Any purported assignment in violation of this paragraph shall be void and ineffectual and shall not operate to transfer or assign any interest or title to the purported assignee. This Agreement shall be binding on the parties and their respective successors (including in the case of Acamar, the Company), heirs, personal representatives and assigns and permitted transferees. 

  



  

6.   _Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed in any number of original, electronic or facsimile counterparts and each of such counterparts shall for all purposes be deemed to be an original, and all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument.

7.   _Severability_. This Agreement shall be deemed severable, and the invalidity or unenforceability of any term or provision hereof shall not affect the validity or enforceability of this Agreement or of any other term or provision hereof. Furthermore, in lieu of any such invalid or unenforceable term or provision, the parties hereto intend that there shall be added as a part of this Agreement a provision as similar in terms to such invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible and be valid and enforceable.

  



  

8.   _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial._ This Agreement, the rights and duties of the parties hereto, and any disputes (whether in contract, tort or statute) arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any principles or rules of conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules would require or permit the application of the laws of another jurisdiction. The parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the District of Delaware or, if such court does not have jurisdiction, the Delaware state courts located in Wilmington, Delaware, in any action arising out of or relating to this Agreement. The parties hereto irrevocably agree that all such claims shall be heard and determined in such a Delaware federal or state court, and that such jurisdiction of such courts with respect thereto will be exclusive. Each party hereto hereby waives, and agrees not to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement that it is not subject to such jurisdiction, or that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in such courts or that the venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this Agreement may not be enforced in or by such courts. The parties hereto hereby consent to and grant any such court jurisdiction over the person of such parties and over the subject matter of any such dispute. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to affect the right of any party to serve process in any manner permitted by law or to commence legal proceedings or otherwise proceed against any other party in any other jurisdiction, in each case, to enforce judgments obtained in any action brought pursuant to this paragraph. To the extent not prohibited by applicable law that cannot be waived, each of the parties hereto irrevocably waives any right it may have to trial by jury in respect of any litigation based on, arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement, including but not limited to any course of conduct, course of dealing, verbal or written statement or action of any party hereto.
