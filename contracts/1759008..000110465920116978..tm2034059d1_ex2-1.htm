not appoint an Exchange Agent prior to the Effective Time in such a manner that will result in costs or expenses to the Company
to be paid by the Company prior to the Effective Time or in the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated, in each case in
<U>clause (ii)</U>, absent the written consent of the Company. Promptly after the appointment of the Exchange Agent, Acquiror shall

Consideration pursuant to the preceding <U>clause (A)</U>, no later than three (3) Business Days after receipt of a Certificate
(only to the extent such Company Stock is represented by a Certificate) (together with a Letter of Transmittal duly completed and

require in connection therewith), issue to the holder of such Certificate (or any Company Stock not represented by a Certificate)
the Closing Date Merger Consideration with respect to such Certificate (or any Company Stock not represented by a Certificate)
so surrendered and the Certificate shall forthwith be canceled. The Exchange Agent shall deliver (x) the Stock Merger Consideration

respectively, as reflected in the Stockholder Ownership Allocation, electronically through book entry-delivery or, upon the written
request of any Company Stockholder, in the form of an original stock certificate to the address set forth in such Company Stockholder&rsquo;s
Letter of Transmittal, (y) the Cash Merger Consideration payable to each Company Stockholder in accordance with the Ownership Allocation
in immediately available funds in accordance with the payment instructions set forth in such Company Stockholder&rsquo;s Letter
of Transmittal and (z) the Liquidation Preference Amount to the Company Preferred Stockholder in immediately available funds in
accordance with the payment instructions set forth in such Company Preferred Stockholder&rsquo;s Letter of Transmittal. Unless
otherwise provided herein, no interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any Closing Date Merger Consideration payable upon surrender
of any Certificate (or any Company Stock not represented by a Certificate). Until so surrendered, each outstanding Certificate
(or any Company Stock not represented by a Certificate) that prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Company Stock (other
than for Dissenting Shares and other shares to be canceled pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;3.01(d)</U>) shall be deemed from and after
the Effective Time, for all purposes, to evidence only the right to receive the portion of the Merger Consideration. If after the
Effective Time, any Certificate (or any Company Stock not represented by a Certificate) is presented to the Exchange Agent, it
shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this <U>Section&nbsp;3.07(a)</U>.</P>

modification is contemplated, and as of the date of this Agreement the commitments contained in the Subscription Agreements have

shares in connection with the consummation of Acquiror&rsquo;s business combination (as defined in the Prospectus, the &ldquo;<U>Business
Combination</U>&rdquo;) or in connection with an extension of its deadline to consummate a Business Combination, (ii) to the Public
Stockholders if Acquiror fails to consummate such a Business Combination within twenty-four (24) months from the closing date of
Acquiror&rsquo;s initial public offering, (iii) with respect to any interest earned on the amounts held in the Trust Account, as
necessary to pay any franchise or income taxes, or (iv) to Acquiror after or concurrently with the consummation of a Business Combination.
For and in consideration of Acquiror entering into this Agreement, and for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency
of which is hereby acknowledged, the Company hereby agrees, on behalf of the Company, its Subsidiaries, and their respective officers,
directors, managers, shareholders, members, partners, Affiliates, agents and other representatives (collectively, &ldquo;<U>Representatives</U>&rdquo;),
that the Company and its Representatives do not have (other than their rights upon Closing) any right, title, interest or claim
of any kind in or to any monies in the Trust Account or distributions therefrom, or make any claim against the Trust Account (including
any distributions therefrom), regardless of whether such claim arises based on contract, tort, equity or any other theory of legal
liability (any and all such claims are collectively referred to hereafter as the &ldquo;<U>Released Claims</U>&rdquo;). The Company
on behalf of itself and its affiliates hereby irrevocably waives any Released Claims that the Company or any of its affiliates
may have against the Trust Account (including distributions therefrom) prior to Closing or in the future as a result of, or arising
out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with Acquiror and will not prior to Closing seek recourse against the Trust Account
for any reason whatsoever; provided that (x) nothing herein shall serve to limit or prohibit the Company&rsquo;s and its Representatives&rsquo;
right to pursue a claim against Acquiror for legal relief against monies or other assets held outside the Trust Account or for
specific performance or other equitable relief (including a claim for Acquiror to specifically perform its obligations under this
Agreement and a claim for Acquiror to specifically perform its obligations under the Trust Agreement, including distribution of
funds from the Trust Account upon the Closing in accordance with the terms of this Agreement), and (y) nothing herein shall serve
to limit or prohibit any claims that the Company or its Representatives may have in the future against Acquiror&rsquo;s assets
or funds that are not held in the Trust Account (including any funds that have been released from the Trust Account, other than
to Public Stockholders, and any assets that have been purchased or acquired with any such funds) or for specific performance or
other equitable relief in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions. The Company agrees and acknowledges that such irrevocable
waiver is material to this Agreement and specifically relied upon by Acquiror and its affiliates to induce Acquiror to enter in
this Agreement, and the Company further intends and understands such waiver to be valid, binding and enforceable against the Company
and each of its affiliates under applicable law. This <U>Section&nbsp;6.12(b)</U> shall survive the termination of this Agreement

such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such chairperson, are appropriate for the
proper conduct of the meeting. Such rules, regulations or procedures, whether adopted by the Board or prescribed by the chairperson
of the meeting, may include, among other things, the following: (i) the establishment of an agenda or order of business for the
meeting; (ii) rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present; (iii) limitations on attendance

each stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be entitled to one vote for each share of stock held by
such stockholder which has voting power upon the matter in question. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders
or to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for such
stockholder by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides
for a longer period. A proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled
with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable
by attending the meeting and voting in person or by delivering to the Secretary of the Corporation a revocation of the proxy or
a new proxy bearing a later date. Voting at meetings of stockholders need not be by written ballot. At all meetings of stockholders
for the election of directors at which a quorum is present a plurality of the votes cast shall be sufficient to elect. All other
elections and questions presented to the stockholders at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall, unless otherwise provided
by the Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws, the rules or regulations of any stock exchange applicable to the Corporation,
applicable law or pursuant to any regulation applicable to the Corporation or its securities, be decided by the affirmative vote
of the holders of a majority in voting power of the shares of stock of the Corporation which are present in person or by proxy
and entitled to vote thereon.</P>

FICA, employment tax or other social security contribution obligation) required by law to be withheld with respect to any taxable
event concerning a Holder arising as a result of the Plan or any Award. The Administrator may, in its sole discretion and in satisfaction
of the foregoing requirement, or in satisfaction of such additional withholding obligations as a Holder may have elected, allow
a Holder to satisfy such obligations by any payment means described in Section 10.1 hereof, including without limitation, by allowing
such Holder to elect to have the Company or any Subsidiary withhold Shares otherwise issuable under an Award (or allow the surrender
of Shares). The number of Shares that may be so withheld or surrendered shall be limited to the number of Shares that have a fair
market value on the date of withholding or repurchase no greater than the aggregate amount of such liabilities based on the maximum
statutory withholding rates in such Holder&rsquo;s applicable jurisdiction for federal, state, local and foreign income tax and
payroll tax purposes that are applicable to such taxable income. The Administrator shall determine the fair market value of the
Shares, consistent with applicable provisions of the Code, for tax withholding obligations due in connection with a broker-assisted
cashless Option or Stock Appreciation Right exercise involving the sale of Shares to pay the Option or Stock Appreciation Right

The Company and its Subsidiaries may transfer the Data amongst themselves as necessary for the purpose of implementation, administration
and management of a Holder&rsquo;s participation in the Plan, and the Company and its Subsidiaries may each further transfer the
Data to any third parties assisting the Company and its Subsidiaries in the implementation, administration and management of the
Plan. These recipients may be located in the Holder&rsquo;s country, or elsewhere, and the Holder&rsquo;s country may have different
data privacy laws and protections than the recipients&rsquo; country. Through acceptance of an Award, each Holder authorizes such
recipients to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the purposes of implementing,
administering and managing the Holder&rsquo;s participation in the Plan, including any requisite transfer of such Data as may be
required to a broker or other third party with whom the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Holder may elect to deposit any
Shares. The Data related to a Holder will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer, and manage the Holder&rsquo;s
participation in the Plan. A Holder may, at any time, view the Data held by the Company with respect to such Holder, request additional
information about the storage and processing of the Data with respect to such Holder, recommend any necessary corrections to the
Data with respect to the Holder or refuse or withdraw the consents herein in writing, in any case without cost, by contacting his
or her local human resources representative. The Company may cancel the Holder&rsquo;s ability to participate in the Plan and,
in the Administrator&rsquo;s discretion, the Holder may forfeit any outstanding Awards if the Holder refuses or withdraws his or
her consents as described herein. For more information on the consequences of refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, Holders
may contact their local human resources representative.</P>
