     | (a) Conversion of the Company Common Shares. At the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holders thereof, each Company Common Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) any Company Common
Shares held by the Company, which Company Common Shares, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, shall
be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist with no payment being
made with respect thereto, (ii) Dissenting Shares (as defined in
Section 4.1(c) and (iii) Company Common Shares held by any Subsidiary,
which Company Common Shares shall remain outstanding (subject to
any recapitalization necessary to maintain the same percentage
ownership)), shall be cancelled and retired and shall be converted into the
right to receive the Final Merger Price, payable to the holder thereof,
without interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate formerly
representing such Company Common Share; provided, however, that the amount
payable to any holder of Company Common Shares who is an obligor on an
Affiliate Note shall be reduced by the principal amount of such Affiliate
Note together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon (the

Time, each share of common stock of the Merger Sub issued and

such holders demand for appraisal rights under Chapter 1701.85 of the
ORC (the "Dissenting Shares"), shall not be converted into the right
to receive the Final Merger Price, but the holders of Dissenting
Shares shall be entitled to  ##### 

     

      |   
---|--- 
     | receive from the Surviving Corporation such consideration as
shall be determined pursuant to Chapter 1701.85 of the ORC; provided,
however, that if any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall
effectively withdraw or lose such holders right to appraisal and payment
under the ORC, each of such holders Company Common Shares shall thereupon
be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into the right
to receive the Final Merger Price, without any interest thereon,
upon surrender of the certificate formerly representing such Company
Common Shares and such shares shall not be deemed to be Dissenting Shares.

 4.3 Payment for the Shares.  

      |   
---|--- 
     | (a) From and after the Effective Time, U.S. Bank, N.A. shall
act as paying agent (the "Escrow and Paying Agent") in effecting the payment
of the Final Merger Price in respect of certificates (the
"Certificates") that, prior to the Effective Time, represented Company Common
Shares entitled to payment of the Final Merger Price pursuant to Section
4.1(a).  
     
     | (b) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall
cause the Escrow and Paying Agent to mail to each record holder of
Certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Company
Common Shares a letter of transmittal in the form attached hereto as Exhibit
C (the "Letter of Transmittal") which shall specify (i) that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Company or
the Escrow and Paying Agent, and instructions for use in surrendering
such Certificates and receiving the Final Merger Price in respect thereof
and (ii) include a waiver by such holder of any claims against the
Company, the Surviving Corporation and their Subsidiaries that such holder
has or may have in its capacity as a stockholder of the Company except
for claims to receive the Final Merger Price in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement and claims brought under this Agreement in accordance
with the terms hereof. Following the Effective Time, upon the surrender
of any such Certificate, the Escrow and Paying Agent  ##### 

     

      |   
---|--- 
     | shall pay each holder who has surrendered such Certificate
an aggregate amount equal to (i) (A) the Preliminary Merger Price
multiplied by (B) the number of Company Common Shares formerly represented by
such Certificate, in consideration therefor, and such Certificate
shall forthwith be cancelled, and (ii) any additional payment then due
and payable under Section 4.7(c). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
amount to be paid to any obligor under an Affiliate Note pursuant to
this Section 4.3(b) in respect of the Company Common Shares held by
such obligor shall be reduced by the Reduction Amount with respect to
such Affiliate Note. Until so surrendered, each such Certificate (other
than Certificates representing (i) Company Common Shares held by the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or held in the treasury of the
Company or (ii) Dissenting Shares) shall represent solely the right to
receive (A) the aggregate Preliminary Merger Price relating thereto (net of
the Reduction Amount, if applicable) and (B) any additional payment due
and payable under Section 4.7(c). No interest or dividends shall be paid
or accrued on the Final Merger Price. If the Final Merger Price (or
any portion thereof) is to be delivered to any Person other than the
Person in whose name the Certificate formerly representing Company Common
Shares surrendered thereof is registered, it shall be a condition to such
right to receive payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the
Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Escrow and Paying Agent
the transfer or other similar taxes required by reason of such payment to
a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or
shall establish to the satisfaction of the Escrow and Paying Agent that such
tax has been paid or is not applicable.  
     
     | (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Escrow and Paying Agent shall not pay to the holders of Company
Common Shares that portion of the Final Merger Price to be deposited in (i)
the Indemnity Escrow, (ii) the Adjustment Escrow, and (iii) if
applicable, the Transaction Expenses Escrow until such time as such amounts
are distributable pursuant to the Escrow Agreement.  
     
     | (d) Promptly following the date that the Escrow Agreement
terminates by its terms and the Escrow and Paying Agent distributes any
amount held in the Indemnity Escrow, the Adjustment Escrow, and, if
applicable, the Transaction Expenses Escrow, or such lesser amount as is
required to be distributed to the Fully-Diluted Stockholders thereunder, the
Escrow and Paying Agent shall deliver to the Surviving Corporation all
cash, Certificates and other documents in its possession relating to
the transactions described in this Agreement, and the Escrow and
Paying Agents duties shall terminate. Thereafter, each holder of a
Certificate formerly representing a Company Common Share may surrender
such Certificate to the Surviving Corporation and receive in
consideration therefor the aggregate Final Merger Price relating thereto,
without any interest thereon, as provided in this Article IV (net of the
Reduction Amount, if applicable).  
     
     | (e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on
the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of any Company
Common Shares which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates formerly representing
Company Common Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the
Escrow and Paying Agent, they shall be surrendered and  ##### 

     

      |   
---|--- 
     | cancelled in return for the payment of the aggregate Final
Merger Price relating thereto, as provided in this Article IV.  
     
     | (f) None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Holders Representatives or the Escrow and Paying Agent shall be liable to
any Person in respect of any portion of the Final Merger Price delivered to
a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar law. If any Certificate has not been surrendered prior to
five years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier
date on which the Final Merger Price in respect of such Certificate
would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any public official),
any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of
such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become
the property of the Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of
any Person previously entitled thereto.  
     
     | (g) The aggregate amounts deposited pursuant to Section 4.2(d)
shall be invested by the Escrow and Paying Agent in obligations of,
or guaranteed by, the United States of America, in commercial
paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investor Services
or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, in each case with
maturities not exceeding six months. All earnings thereon, other than
earnings on the Indemnity Escrow, the Adjustment Escrow and the Transaction
Expenses Escrow, shall be allocated for income tax purposes to the benefit
of Parent or the Surviving Corporation. All earnings on the
Indemnity Escrow, the Adjustment Escrow and Transaction Expenses Escrow shall
inure to the Fully-Diluted Stockholders pursuant to the terms set forth in
the Escrow Agreement; provided, all such earnings (other than with respect
to the Transaction Expenses Escrow) shall be distributed to the Fully-
Diluted Stockholders on the one hand, or the Parent, on the other hand, in
proportion to the aggregate amount of the Indemnity Escrow and the Adjustment
Escrow disbursed to the Fully-Diluted Stockholders and the Parent pursuant to
the terms of the Escrow Agreement.  
     
     | (h) In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Escrow
and Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the payments with respect to such Certificate to which
such Person is entitled pursuant to this Article IV.  
     
     | (i) Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold, or cause the Escrow and Paying Agent to deduct and withhold,
from payments payable to a holder of a Certificate any withholding and
stock transfer taxes and such other amounts as are required under the Code
or any applicable provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To
the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld by Parent, Merger Sub
or the Escrow and Paying Agent, such deducted or withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the holder of the Certificate in respect of which such deduction
or withholding was made by Parent, Merger Sub or the Escrow and Paying
Agent and Parent shall provide, or cause the Escrow and Paying Agent
to provide, to the holder of such Certificate written notice of the
amounts so deducted or withheld.  ##### 

     

 4.4 Warrants. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Warrant holder shall assign to the Company, pursuant to the terms of the Warrant Assignment Agreement, all of the Warrants held by such holder, in exchange for the consideration set forth in this Section 4.4. Each Warrant holder shall thereafter be entitled to receive for each Warrant held thereby and so assigned, an amount equal to: (i) a payment in cash by the Company (subject to any applicable withholding taxes), at the Effective Time, equal to the product of (A) the total number of Company Common Shares as to which such Warrant remains unexercised times (B) the excess, if any, of (1) the Preliminary Merger Price over (2) the exercise price per Company Common Share subject to such Warrant, if any (such amounts payable hereunder being referred to as the "Warrant Payments") and (ii) any additional payment when due and payable under Section 4.7(c). Upon surrender of the warrant agreement by the holder of such Warrant to the Escrow and Paying Agent, the Escrow and Paying Agent shall pay to such holder, on behalf of the Company and subject to any applicable withholding taxes, the Warrant Payments due under this Section 4.4 with respect to such Warrant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Escrow and Paying Agent shall not pay to the Warrant holder that portion of the Warrant Payments representing that portion of the Preliminary Merger Price to be deposited in (i) the Indemnity Escrow, (ii) the Adjustment Escrow, and (iii) if applicable, the Transaction Expenses Escrow until such time as such amounts are distributable pursuant to the Escrow Agreement.  

 4.5 Escrow Amounts; Allocation and Assignment of Distributions of Escrowed Amounts. The Parties agree that the terms of the Escrow Agreement shall include (i) the right of the Fully-Diluted Stockholders to receive quarterly tax distributions in amounts sufficient to enable each Fully-Diluted Stockholder to discharge any federal, state and local tax liability (determined by assuming the applicability of the highest combined effective margin of federal, state and local tax rates applicable to an individual residing in New York, New York) with respect to all interest income on the Indemnity Escrow Amount, the Adjustment Escrow and the Transaction Expenses Escrow allocated to such Fully-Diluted Stockholder in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement, and (ii) the fees and expenses of the Escrow and Paying Agent relating to (A) the Indemnity Escrow and the Adjustment Escrow shall be borne equally by the Parent and the Fully-Diluted Stockholders, and (B) if applicable, the Transaction Expenses Escrow shall be borne by the Fully-Diluted Stockholders, and all such fees and expenses payable by the Fully-Diluted Stockholders shall be paid out of the Indemnity Escrow, the Adjustment Escrow and the Transaction Expenses Escrow, respectively. The amount of any distributions or payments to be made to, or on behalf of, a Fully-Diluted Stockholder from (i) the Indemnity Escrow, (ii) the Adjustment Escrow, and (iii) if applicable, the Transaction Expenses Escrow pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement will be determined based on the percentage ownership (calculated on a fully-diluted basis) of Company Common Shares (including Company Common Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants) owned by such Fully-Diluted Stockholder immediately prior to the Effective Time as set forth on Schedule A to the Escrow Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in the Escrow Agreement, each Fully-Diluted Stockholder shall have the right to transfer or assign its right to receive any distributions from (i) the Indemnity Escrow, (ii) the Adjustment Escrow, and (iii) if applicable, the Transaction Expenses Escrow to any Affiliate thereof or any investor, partner or stockholder thereof and any of their respective Affiliates or any other Fully Diluted Stockholder.  

 4.6 Further Assurances. At and after the Effective Time, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of   ##### 

 

the Company or Merger Sub, as applicable, any deeds, bills of
sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf
of the Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and things to vest, perfect
or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all
right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or
assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result
of, or in connection with, the Merger.  

 4.7 Adjustment Escrow.  

      |   
---|--- 
     | (a) At Closing, an aggregate amount equal to $10,000,000
(the "Adjustment Escrow") shall be deducted from the aggregate
amounts otherwise to be paid by the Escrow and Paying Agent to the Fully-
Diluted Stockholders pursuant to Sections 4.3 and 4.4 and retained by the
Escrow and Paying Agent subject to the Escrow Agreement.  
     
     | (b) Within fifteen (15) Business Days following the Closing
Date, Parent shall prepare and deliver to the Holders Representatives
a certificate setting forth Parents calculation of Merger
Consideration (the "Adjusted Merger Consideration"). Such calculation shall
be prepared using the same methods, principles, practices and policies
as was required to be used in the preparation of the Preliminary
Merger Consideration. Within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of the
Parents calculation of the Adjusted Merger Consideration, the
Holders Representatives may provide written notice (the "Objection Notice")
of any objections thereto (the "Objection Notice") setting forth
the specific item of the calculation to which such objection relates and
the specific basis for such objection. If such Objection Notice is
delivered in accordance with the preceding sentence, Parent and the
Holders Representatives shall attempt in good faith to resolve any dispute
set forth in the Objection Notice within twenty (20) Business Days from
the delivery of the Objection Notice to Parent. If the Parent and
Holders Representatives do not resolve such dispute in accordance with
the preceding sentence, then the dispute shall be submitted to Deloitte
and Touche LLP (the "Independent Auditors") who shall make a
final determination of such dispute within thirty (30) Business Days
of submission of the matter to it. The decision of the Independent
Auditors shall be final and binding on the parties hereto and the Fully-
Diluted Stockholders.  
     
     | (c) In the event the Merger Consideration as finally
determined or agreed to hereunder (the "Final Merger Consideration") is less
than the Preliminary Merger Consideration, the Holders Representatives and
Parent shall promptly direct the Escrow and Paying Agent to disburse
an aggregate amount of the Adjustment Escrow equal to such deficit to
Parent in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement; provided, in
the event such deficit is in excess of the Adjustment Escrow, such
excess shall be deducted from the Indemnity Escrow. In the event the
Final Merger Consideration exceeds the Preliminary Merger Consideration,
Parent shall pay within one (1) Business Day of the final determination of
the Adjusted Merger Consideration to the Escrow and Paying Agent an amount
in cash equal to such excess and direct the Escrow and Paying Agent
to disburse such excess amount and the Adjustment Escrow to the Fully-
Diluted Stockholders in accordance with Sections 4.3 and 4.4 hereof pursuant
to the Escrow Agreement.  ##### 

     

      |   
---|--- 
     | (d) The remaining amount of the Adjustment Escrow, if any,
after payment to Parent pursuant to Section 4.7(c) shall be disbursed by
the Escrow and Paying Agent to the Fully-Diluted Stockholders,
without duplication, in accordance with Sections 4.3 and 4.4 hereof pursuant
to the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

and complies in form and in operation with the applicable requirements of
ERISA, the Code, and other applicable laws, rules and regulations, and, to

     | (ii) All required reports and descriptions (including but
not limited to Form 5500 Annual Reports, Summary Annual Reports, PBGC Form
1s, and Summary Plan Descriptions) have been filed or distributed

     | (iii) All contributions (including all employer
contributions and employee salary reduction contributions or other
contributions) that are due have been paid to each Employee Benefit Plan, and

---|--- 
     | that has been approved by the Internal Revenue Service and updated
to comply with applicable laws), and, to the Companys Knowledge, no fact,

be expected to adversely affect the qualified status under Code Section
401(a) of any such Employee Benefit Plan.

Pension Benefit Plan is a defined contribution plan. No Employee

no pending or, to the Companys Knowledge, threatened claim against or under
any Employee Benefit Plan, other than claims for benefits in the Ordinary
Course of Business.

 6.9 Tax Matters. Subject to Section 4.2(b)(ii)(C) and Section 6.9(g):  

      |   
---|--- 
     | (a) The Fully-Diluted Stockholders shall indemnify Parent and
the Company for all Taxes of the Company to the extent such Taxes are
not adequately provided for as current taxes on the Recent
Financial Statements (i) for taxable periods ending on or before the Closing
Date and (ii) for any period not ending on or before the Closing Date, for
the portion of any Taxes attributable to the period ending on the
Closing Date.  
     
     | (b) For any period that includes but does not end on the
Closing Date, (i) liability for any Taxes determined by reference to
income, capital gains, gross income, gross receipts, sales, net profits,
windfall profits or similar items or resulting from a transfer of assets
shall be allocated between the Fully-Diluted Stockholders and the Company
based on the date on which such items accrued; and (ii) liability for all
other Taxes shall be allocated between the Fully-Diluted Stockholders and
the Company, pro rata based on the number of days in the taxable period
for which each party is liable for Taxes hereunder.  
     
     | (c) The Holders Representatives shall cause the Company, at
the Companys expense to prepare and file all tax returns and reports of
the Company due on or prior to the Closing Date, which returns and
reports shall be prepared and filed timely and on a basis consistent
with existing procedures for preparing such returns and reports and in
a manner consistent with prior practice with respect to the treatment
of specific items on the returns or reports; Parent shall cause the
Company to prepare and file all tax returns and reports of the Company due
after the Closing Date, which returns and reports, to the extent they relate
to taxable periods beginning prior to, but including the Closing Date,
and for the purpose of determining the liability for Taxes of the Fully-
Diluted Stockholders, shall be prepared and filed timely and on a basis
consistent with existing procedures for preparing such returns and in a
manner consistent with prior practice with respect to the treatment of
specific items on the returns and reports, unless such treatment does not
have sufficient legal support to avoid the imposition of penalties. In the
event the Fully-Diluted Stockholders are liable under Section 6.9(a) hereof
for Taxes due in connection with the returns described in the preceding
sentence, such liability to the Company shall be satisfied from the Indemnity
Escrow immediately upon request or at least three (3) business days prior to
the filing of such returns, whichever is later.  
     
     | (d) Parent, the Company and the Holders Representatives
shall provide each other with such assistance as may reasonably be requested
by the others in connection with the preparation of any return or report
of Taxes, any audit or other examination by any taxing authority, or
any judicial or administrative proceedings relating to liabilities for
Taxes. Such assistance shall include making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information or explanation
of material provided hereunder and shall include providing copies of
relevant tax returns and supporting material. The party requesting assistance
hereunder shall reimburse the assisting party for reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in providing assistance; provided, however, if the
reimbursing party is the Holders Representatives, such reimbursement amounts
shall be payable from the Indemnity Escrow. Parent, the Company and the
Holders Representatives will retain for the full period of any statute
of limitations and

##### 

  

      |   
---|--- 
     | provide the others with any records or information which may
be relevant to such preparation, audit, examination, proceeding
or determination.  
  

      |   
---|--- 
     | (e) If in connection with any examination, investigation,
audit or other proceeding in respect of any tax return covering the
operations of the Company on or before the Closing Date, any Governmental
Authority issues to the Company a written notice of deficiency, a notice
of reassessment, a proposed adjustment, an assertion of claim or
demand concerning the taxable period covered by such return, Parent or
the Company shall notify the Holders Representatives of its receipt of
such communication from the Governmental Authority within thirty (30)
business days after receiving such notice of deficiency, reassessment,
adjustment or assertion of claim or demand. No failure or delay of Parent or
the Company in the performance of the foregoing shall reduce or
otherwise affect the obligations or liabilities of the Fully-Diluted
Stockholders pursuant to this Agreement, except to the extent that such
failure or delay shall have adversely affected the ability of the
Holders Representatives to defend against any liability or claim for Taxes
that the Fully-Diluted Stockholders are obligated to pay hereunder. Except
as provided below, the Holders Representatives shall, at their expense,
have the nonexclusive right to participate in the contest of any
such assessment, proposal, claim, reassessment, demand or other proceedings
in connection with any tax return covering taxable periods of the
Company ending on or before the Closing Date. Parent and the Company
will control any such contest and shall defend in good faith any
position taken by the Company for which indemnification would be required
pursuant to this Section 6.9. Parent and the Company will not be obligated
to settle or resolve any issue related to Taxes for such a period, which,
if so settled or resolved, could have an effect on the Company or Parent
for periods after the Closing Date, unless the Holders Representatives
agree in writing with Parent and the Company, on terms reasonably
satisfactory to Parent and the Company, that the Fully-Diluted Stockholders
shall indemnify Parent, any affiliate of Parent, and the Company from
the Indemnity Escrow from any cost, damage, loss or expense relating to
such settlement or resolution. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, if any examination, investigation, audit or
other proceeding relates to a tax return for a period that begins before
and ends after the Closing Date, Parent and the Company shall
solely participate in, control and resolve such examination,
investigation, audit or other proceeding, provided that Parent shall
communicate with the Holders Representatives regarding the status of such
examination, investigation, audit or proceeding.  
  

      |   
---|--- 
     | (f) If there is an adjustment to any return or report of Taxes
for the Company which creates a deficiency in any Taxes for which the Fully-
Diluted Stockholders are liable under the provisions of Section 6.9(a)
hereof, the amount of such deficiency in Taxes shall be satisfied from the
Indemnity Escrow. No liability of the Fully-Diluted Stockholders under this
Section 6.9(f) shall be payable until the occurrence of any action by any Tax
authority that is final or resolved in good faith during the course of any
audit or any proceeding relating to Taxes.  
  

      |   
---|--- 
     | (g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
the provisions of this Section 6.9 shall be governed by the
limitations contained in Sections 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.6, 8.7, 8.8 and
8.9; provided, however, that Section 6.9(e) of this Agreement and  ##### 

   

      |   
---|--- 
     | not Section 12(f) of the Escrow Agreement shall control the
claims procedures for claims pursuant to this Section 6.9.  
  

 6.10 Payment of Management Incentive Payments. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree that (i) the Management Incentive Payments to be paid pursuant to the Company Performance Reward Plan will be paid as bonus compensation to the recipients thereof and will be structured (and paid), to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent and the Company, in such a manner as to cause such payments to be treated as a compensation expense for tax purposes and (ii) the Company or the Surviving Corporation will duly perform all of its respective obligations under the Company Performance Reward Plan, including, without limitation, the maintaining the Company Performance Reward Plan Trust and the payment therefrom of (A) approximately 40% of the Management Incentive Payments on or before December 31, 2003, (B) approximately 30% of the Management Incentive Payments on or shortly after October 31, 2004 and (C) the remainder of the Management Incentive Payments on or shortly after October 31, 2005. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall take all such actions necessary to adopt the Company Performance Reward Plan, which shall provide for such payment terms pursuant to terms and conditions reasonably satisfactory to Parent and shall further provide that no amendment or modification shall be made thereto without the express written consent of the Holders Representatives.  

 6.11 Employee Matters. Parent agrees that it will enter into the Employment Agreements as of the date hereof and that such Employment Agreements shall be effective as of the Closing Date. Parent shall take, or cause to be taken, such action as may be necessary so that for the period commencing from and after the Effective Time through December 31, 2004 (or in the case of the Companys Supplement Executive Retirement Plan, through December 31, 2006), the compensation and benefits programs provided to employees of the Surviving Corporation other than those employees who are a party to the Employment Agreements (the "Non-Contract Employees") will remain substantially similar (in the aggregate) to those compensation and benefits programs (excluding equity based programs) provided to such Non-Contract Employees prior to Closing, including, without limitation, maintaining in effect the cash bonus plan currently provided by the Company to such Non-Contract Employees. The foregoing, however, shall not prevent modifications that are made in consultation with, and with the concurrence of, senior management of the Company, including modifications to the salary and bonus structure for Non-Contract Employees that were contemplated by the Company prior to August 1, 2003.  

 6.12 Preservation of Records; Access. From and after the Closing Date, Parent shall (and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries and other Affiliates to), during normal business hours and upon reasonable prior notice and in such a manner as will not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, make available and provide the Holders Representatives and their respective representatives (including, without limitation, counsel and independent auditors) with access to the facilities, properties and personnel of the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries and to all information, files, documents and records (written and computer) relating to the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries or any of their businesses or operations for any and all periods prior to or including the Closing Date which they may require with respect to any claim, dispute, action, cause of action, investigation or proceeding of any kind by or against any Fully-Diluted   ##### 

 

Stockholder (including, without limitation, as may be brought by a
Parent Indemnified Party), and cooperate fully with the Holders
Representatives in connection with the foregoing.  

 6.13 Collection of Receivables. Following the Closing, Parent agrees, or agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation, (i) to use all commercially reasonable efforts, in the Ordinary Course of Business, to manage and collect the Receivables (notwithstanding any indemnification by the Fully-Diluted Stockholders pursuant to Section 8.2(iii) hereof) and (ii) not to compromise, credit, discount, settle, set-off or otherwise reduce any Receivables other than in the Ordinary Course of Business. In the event the Surviving Corporation collects any amount with respect to Receivables for which it has collected an indemnification claim pursuant to Section 8.2(iii) hereof, Parent shall promptly notify the Holders Representatives and cause the Surviving Corporation to promptly remit such amount to the Escrow Agent for distribution to the Fully-Diluted Stockholders.  

 6.14 Weber Change of Control Payment. The Parties hereby agree that in the event that the Weber Change of Control Payment shall become due and payable to Reinhart Weber pursuant to the terms of the Weber Change of Control Agreement during the eighteen (18) month period following the Effective Time, the Fully-Diluted Stockholders shall pay such Weber Change of Control Payment to Rheinhart Weber from the Indemnity Escrow. In the event that the Weber Change of Control payment shall become due and payable at any time following the expiration of the eighteen (18) month period following the Effective Time, the Fully-Diluted Stockholders shall have no obligation in respect of the payment thereof and such payment shall be made or caused to be made by Parent.  

 6.15 Stockholder Agreement. In connection with the grant of the Option (as defined in the Voting Agreement), the Company hereby consents to the amendment of the Stockholders Agreement as set forth in Section 4 of the Voting Agreement.

 8.4 Indemnification Claims.  

      |   
---|--- 
     | (a) Section 8.2 Claims. All claims by Parent Indemnified
Parties under Sections 6.9 and 8.2 shall be made and resolved in accordance
with the procedures provided in the Escrow Agreement. All claims
brought under Sections 8.2 and 8.3 shall be brought in good faith and in a
manner consistent with the terms of this Agreement.  
     
     | (b) Section 8.3 Claims. All claims for indemnification
under Section 8.3 involving third party claims against Stockholder
Indemnified Parties shall be made and  ##### 

   

      |   
---|--- 
     | resolved as hereinafter set forth. If a claim by a third party
is made against a Stockholder Indemnified Party, and if such
Stockholder Indemnified Party intends to seek indemnity with respect thereto
under Section 8.3, such Stockholder Indemnified Party shall promptly notify
the Parent of such claims. The failure to provide such notice shall
not result in a waiver of any right to indemnification hereunder except
to the extent the indemnifying party is actually materially prejudiced
by such failure. With respect to a claim arising from a third party
claim against a Stockholder Indemnified Party, the Holders
Representatives shall undertake, conduct and control, through counsel of its
own choosing (the expense of such counsel to be included in the amount of
the indemnification claim), the settlement or defense thereof;
provided, however, that upon delivery of written notice to the
Holders Representatives no later than 30 days following receipt of notice of
such indemnification claim from the Stockholder Indemnified Party, Parent
may undertake, conduct and control, through counsel of its own
choosing (provided such counsel is reasonably acceptable to the
Holders Representatives) and at its own expense, the settlement or
defense thereof, and the Holders Representatives shall cooperate with it
in connection therewith. The Holders Representatives may
participate, through counsel of their own choosing and at their own expense,
with Parent in the settlement or defense thereof, it being understood
that Parent shall control such defense. Parent shall not, except with
the consent of the Holders Representatives, not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed, enter into any settlement or consent to entry of any
judgment that (i) does not include as an unconditional term thereof the
giving by the Person or Persons asserting such claim to such
Stockholder Indemnified Party of an unconditional release from all liability
with respect to such claim, or (ii) imposes any restriction, condition
or obligation on, or requires any undertaking or admission by
such Stockholder Indemnified Party.  
  

 8.5 Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. All indemnification payments under this Article VIII and under Section 6.9 shall be treated as adjustments to the Merger Consideration.  

 8.6 Damages. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement and except with respect to Losses involving fraud, no Party (or any of its Affiliates) shall, in any event, be liable to the other Party (or any of its Affiliates) for any (i) consequential or exemplary damages (including, without limitation (i) multiple-based damages) and (ii) loss of future revenue or income, or loss of business reputation or opportunity relating to the breach of or alleged breach of this Agreement), or (ii) punitive damages of such other Party (or any of its Affiliates), except to the extent that any third-party action for which a Party seeks indemnification under this Article VIII includes such damages.  

 8.7 Calculation of Losses. The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided to any Party pursuant to this Article VIII shall be net of (each, a "Loss Reduction Amount") (i) any amounts actually recovered by the indemnified party under any insurance policies with respect to such Loss; provided, that no Party shall be obligated to obtain or maintain insurance for such purpose, (ii) with respect to a Parent Indemnified Party, any amounts actually recovered thereby from the landlord relating to the leased real property at Fredericksburg, Virginia, (iii) with respect to claims made pursuant to Section 8.2(iii), the amount of the Specific Reserves allocable to such Loss, (iv) with respect to claims made   ##### 

  

pursuant to Section 8.2(ii), the amount of any specific reserves established

received; provided, that no Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to approve,
review or otherwise participate in the analysis or determination of any such
Tax benefits and no Indemnified Party shall have any obligation to maximize
any such Tax benefit. If the amount of any Losses incurred by an Indemnified

Party pursuant to this Article VIII is reduced by a Loss Reduction Amount,

Taxes) or premiums incurred in connection therewith) shall promptly be repaid
by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party. Except with respect to
indemnification for Losses pursuant to Section 8.2(iii), upon making a full
indemnity payment, the Indemnifying Party shall, to the extent of
such indemnity payment, be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnified Party
against any third party in respect of the Losses to which the indemnity
payment relates.  

 8.8 Duty to Mitigate. Nothing in this Agreement shall in any way restrict, limit or increase the general obligation at law of an Indemnified Party to mitigate any Losses which it may suffer or incur by reason of the breach by an Indemnifying Party of any representation, warranty or covenant of the Indemnifying Party hereunder; provided, however that with respect to any claims for Losses by a Parent Indemnified Party relating to the leased real property located at Fredericksburg, Virginia, the Parent Indemnified Parties shall pursue in good faith any claims, settlement or payment by the landlord of such facility in respect of such Losses.  

 8.9 Sole and Exclusive Remedy. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the Fully-Diluted Stockholders hereby agree that following the Closing, their sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any Losses and any and all other claims relating to the subject matter of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be in accordance with, and limited by, the provisions set forth in this Article VIII and in the Escrow Agreement and all of such Claims for Losses shall be satisfied only out of the Indemnity Escrow; provided, however, nothing herein shall be deemed to limit or modify any obligations of any Fully-Diluted Stockholder or Parent under the applicable Letter of Transmittal or Warrant Assignment Agreement or any rights of Parent or the Company (solely as to the applicable Fully-Diluted Stockholder under the applicable Letter of Transmittal or Warrant Assignment Agreement) or the Fully-Diluted Stockholder thereunder with respect to breaches thereof.

partner, fiduciary, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or
enterprise (collectively, the "Company Indemnified Parties") against all
costs and expenses (including without limitation reasonable attorneys
fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
settlement amounts paid in connection with any claim, action, suit,

Time), whether civil, administrative, criminal or investigative, arising out
of or pertaining to any action or omission in their capacities as
officers or directors, in each case occurring at or before the Effective
Time (including without limitation the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement), in each case, to the fullest extent permitted by the ORC
or any other applicable laws or to the fullest extent permitted under
the Companys articles of incorporation and code of regulations or
any applicable contract or agreement as in effect on the date
hereof). Without limiting the foregoing, in the event of any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, (i) the Company, Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall pay the reasonable
fees and expenses of counsel selected by any Company Indemnified
Party promptly after statements therefor are received (unless the
Surviving Corporation shall elect to defend such action) and (ii) the
Company, Parent and Surviving Corporation shall cooperate in the defense of
any such matter; provided, however, that neither the Company, Parent nor
the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any settlement effected
without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed). Notwithstanding anything else in this Section 8.10 to
the contrary, in no event shall Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
the Company be obligated to indemnify any Company Indemnified Party for
any loss incurred by a Company Indemnified Party arising from any claim by
a Principal Stockholder or any partner, fiduciary, employee, officer
or agent thereof.  
     
     | (b) For a period of three years after the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect the current directors
and officers liability insurance policies maintained by the Company
(or policies that are substantially similar thereto and that provide at
least the same coverage on terms and conditions that, in the aggregate, are
no less advantageous than those contained in the current policies)
with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred at or
prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that in no event shall
Parent be required to expend pursuant to this Section 8.10(b) more than
an amount per year equal to 150% of current annual premiums paid by
the Company and its Subsidiaries for such insurance; provided,
further, however, that if the premium for such coverage exceeds such
amount, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall purchase a policy with
the greatest coverage available for such 150% of the amount per annum
spent by the Company and its Subsidiaries for their fiscal year ending
December 31, 2002.  
     
     | (c) In the event the Company or the Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each case, Parent shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts so that the successors and assigns of the Company or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, honor the indemnification
and other obligations set forth in this Section 8.10.  
  

 8.11 Tax Indemnity Insurance. If the Holders Representatives, on behalf of the Fully Diluted Stockholders, provide to Parent (and prepay the premiums for) an insurance policy (the "Tax Indemnity Insurance Policy") covering the $3,000,000 (together with interest thereon that would have accrued from the effective date of such insurance policy through the Tax Claim   ##### 

 

Termination Date) Tax indemnification provided pursuant to Section 8.2
in relation to indemnification claims by Parent thereunder from and after
the General Claim Termination Date through the Tax Claim Termination Date,
which is (i) reasonably approved and satisfactory in form and substance to
Parent, and (ii) issued by an insurer whose creditworthiness is reasonably
approved and acceptable to Parent, then Parent, upon receiving the Tax
Indemnity Insurance Policy and coverage and so approving the Tax Indemnity
Insurance Policy, will thereupon release the remaining $3,000,000 from the
Indemnity Escrow. The premium for the Tax Indemnity Insurance Policy will be
paid by the Holders Representatives, on behalf of the Fully Diluted
Stockholders, from amounts distributable to the Fully-Diluted Stockholders
pursuant to the Indemnity Escrow or from amounts deposited pursuant to the
Transaction Expense Escrow.
