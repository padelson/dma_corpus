(A) trade, quantity and cash discounts or rebates actually allowed and taken,
provided that such discounts or rebates are not applied disproportionately to
the Product as compared with similar products of the Selling Person, including
those granted for rejected, damaged and recalled goods;

  

  

(B) tax, tariff or customs duties or other duties or government charges (other
than income tax) levied on the sale, transportation or delivery of the Product
to the extent not reimbursed or paid for by third parties; and

  

  

(C) adjustments, allowances, credits, fees, reimbursements, chargeback
payments and rebates (or the equivalent thereof) for the Product granted to
group purchasing organizations or other buying groups, managed health care
organizations, pharmacy benefit management companies, health maintenance
organizations and any other providers of health insurance coverage, health
care organizations or other health care institutions (including hospitals),
third party health care administrators or patient assistance or other similar
programs, or to federal, state/provincial, local and other governments,
including their agencies, or to wholesalers, distributors or other trade
customers.

  

  

Net Revenue shall be calculated in accordance with GAAP, and to the extent in
conformity with GAAP, in accordance with Buyer's usual and customary
accounting practices, methodologies and principles, consistently applied.

  

  

The transfer of any Product by a Selling Person to another Selling Person
shall be excluded from the computation of Net Revenue (except where such other
Selling Person is a commercial end-user of the Product), but the resale of
such Product by any Selling Person to third parties for commercial use shall
be included within the computation of Net Revenue. In the case of any sale for
value, such as barter or counter-trade, of any Product, or part thereof, other
than in an arm's length transaction exclusively for cash, the Net Revenue
amount shall be deemed to be the Net Revenue at which substantially similar
quantities of such Product are sold for cash in an arm's length transaction in
the relevant country or, if there are no such sales, the then fair market
value of the applicable Product in the relevant country assuming it had been
sold in substantially similar quantities.

  

  

For the avoidance of doubt, the following shall not be included within any
computation of Net Revenue: (i) disposal of any Product for, or use of any
Product in, clinical trials, as free samples, or under compassionate use,
patient assistance, named patient or test marketing programs or non-
registrational studies or other similar programs or studies where Product is
supplied or delivered without charge by a Selling Person, (ii) any Product
donated by any Selling Person to non-profit institutions or government
agencies for a non-commercial purpose, (iii) any free Product that is supplied
to a third party in conjunction with the offer for sale or sale of any Product
(such free Product being in an amount customary in the industry), but solely
with respect to such free

Product, and (iv) the use of any Product by any Selling Person for research
and development purposes.

  

  

If any Product is sold as part of a Combination Product, the Net Revenue for
such Product sold as part of a Combination Product, for the purposes of
determining whether a Milestone has been met in any period, shall be
determined by multiplying the Net Revenue of such Combination Product
(replacing "Product" with "Combination Product" in the definition of Net
Revenue above), during the applicable period, by the fraction, A/(A+B), where
A is the average per unit sale price of such Product when sold separately as a
standalone Product in finished form in the country in which the Combination
Product is sold and B is the average per unit sale price of the other products
contained in the Combination Product when sold separately as standalone
products in finished form in the country in which the Combination Product is
sold, in each case during the applicable period or, if sales of such
standalone Product did not occur in such period, then in the most recent
period in which arm's length fair market sales of such Product, as applicable,
occurred. If such average sale price cannot be determined for such Product or
any of the other products for the purposes of determining whether a Milestone
has been met in any period, the Net Revenue amount shall be mutually agreed
upon by the parties based on the relative value contributed by each component,
such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
"Combination Product" means a product containing both a Product and one or
more other products or a product in which both a Product and one or more other
products are packaged.

  

  

Whenever conversion from any foreign currency shall be required for the
purposes of calculating Net Revenue, the amount of such sales in foreign
currencies shall be converted into U.S. dollars using the exchange rate for
the relevant month, which shall be the last price rate of exchange for such
currencies on the last Business Day of the immediately preceding calendar
month as published on Bloomberg page FXC (or such other publication as may be
agreed to between Buyer and Parent from time to time) (the "Monthly Rate").

  

  

"Packaging Materials" collectively means and includes any prescription
information (including labeling and package inserts, indications and safety
instructions), packaging (including any boxes or other containers) and similar
materials relating to the packaging of the Product.

  

  

"Permitted Liens" means (i) Liens for Taxes, assessments or governmental
charges or levies not yet due and payable or that are being contested in good
faith through appropriate proceedings and for which adequate reserves have
been established in accordance with GAAP on the books of a Seller Party, (ii)
carriers', warehousemen's, materialmen's, contractor's, workmen's, repairmen's
and mechanics' Liens and other similar Liens arising or incurred in the
ordinary course of business which secure payment of Liabilities not more than
30 days past due or which are being contested in good faith, (iii) any
restrictions, limitations or conditions contained in the Contracts, (iv) Liens
disclosed on Schedule 1.01(a)(ii) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, (v) Liens
that will be released at or prior to the Closing and (vi) any other Liens
affecting the Transferred

Assets which do not and will not impede the ownership or operation or detract

respect.

limited liability company, a Governmental Authority, a trust or other entity
or organization.

customer does not offset returns of any Product against Seller (or any of its

Section 2.04. Excluded Liabilities. Notwithstanding any provision in this

Party or its Affiliates. The term Excluded Liabilities shall mean all
Liabilities of the Seller Parties or any of their respective Affiliates other
than the Assumed Liabilities. For the avoidance of doubt, the Excluded
Liabilities shall include (but are not limited to):

  

  

(a) all Liabilities arising out of or relating to the return of any Product
shipped by Seller to a third party prior to the Closing (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, shall include any such Product that is reflected in the
accounts receivable transferred to Buyer pursuant to Section 2.01(j))
("Shipped Product") but only if (i) such return is in accordance with Seller's
written return policy as in effect on the date hereof, which policy is set
forth on Schedule 2.04(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, or (ii) Buyer
provides reasonable evidence indicating that the customer returning such
Shipped Product believes it is entitled to such return;

  

  

(b) subject to Section 2.03(a)(i), all Liabilities arising out of any action,
suit, investigation or proceeding before any court or arbitrator or any other
Governmental Authority solely to the extent arising out of actions, omissions
or events occurring prior to the Closing Date relating to the Business or the
Transferred Assets, including with respect to matters set forth on Schedule
2.04(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule;

  

  

(c) any Liability under Seller's employee benefits or compensation
arrangements, plans or agreements, or otherwise with respect to any employee
or former employee of Seller or any of its Affiliates relating to any period
of employment with Seller or any of its Affiliates, or any Liability under
Seller's or its Affiliate's severance plans or policies (including without
limitation the plans listed on Schedule 2.04(c) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule);

  

  

(d) any Environmental Liabilities;

  

  

(e) all accounts payable arising prior to the Closing and due and owing by
Seller to any third party;

ownership, operation or use of the Transferred Assets prior to the Closing,
(ii) all Transfer Taxes

incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and (5) Apportioned Obligations apportioned to the Pre-Closing Tax Period
pursuant to Section 7.02(b); and

  

  

(g) any Liability relating to an Excluded Asset.

  

  

Section 2.05. Assignment of Contracts and Rights. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement shall not constitute an
agreement to assign any Transferred Asset or any claim or right or any benefit
arising thereunder or resulting therefrom if an attempted assignment thereof,
without the consent of a third party, would constitute a breach thereof or in
any way adversely affect the rights of Buyer or the Seller Parties thereunder
or be contrary to Applicable Law. The Seller Parties and Buyer shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts (but without any requirement to pay money or
offer other consideration to any Person) to obtain the consent of any
applicable third party to the assignment of any such Transferred Asset or such
claim, right or benefit. If any such consent or approval is not obtained, the
Seller Parties and Buyer shall cooperate in a mutually agreeable arrangement
under which Buyer would obtain the benefits and assume the Liabilities under
such Transferred Asset in accordance with this Agreement, including sub-
contracting, sub-licensing, or sub-leasing to Buyer, or under which the Seller
Parties would exercise (at the reasonable direction of Buyer) for the benefit
of Buyer, with Buyer assuming such Seller Party's obligations, any and all
rights of the Seller Parties (including, if applicable, the right to elect to
terminate such Transferred Asset in accordance with the terms thereof upon
Buyer's request). Each Seller Party shall promptly pay to Buyer when received
all monies received by such Seller Party under any such Transferred Asset or
any claim, right or benefit arising thereunder, except to the extent the same
represents an Excluded Asset. The Seller Parties shall have no obligation to
obtain such consent or approval or to provide such an alternative arrangement
other than the undertaking to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain or
provide the same as set forth in this Section 2.05, subject only to the other
provisions hereof, and shall have no remedy (including under Article 8) for
failure of the Seller Parties to obtain any such consent or approval or to
provide any such alternative arrangement (subject only to the other provisions
hereof). To the extent that, in connection with obtaining a third party's
consent under any Transferred Asset, one or more of the parties hereto enter
into an agreement with such third party that provides for an allocation of
liability among the parties hereto with respect to such Transferred Asset that
is inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, the parties agree that, as
among themselves, the provisions of this Agreement shall control.

  

  

Section 2.06. Purchase Price. The purchase price for the Transferred Assets is
(i) $1.00, which shall be paid as provided in Section 2.07, plus (ii) the
aggregate of any and all Contingent Payments required to be paid pursuant to
Section 2.10 (the "Purchase Price").

  

  

Section 2.07. Closing. The closing (the "Closing") of the purchase and sale of
the Transferred Assets and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities hereunder
shall take place at 11:59 p.m. New York time at the offices of Davis Polk and

(a) Buyer shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Seller $1.00.

  

  

(b) Seller and Buyer shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the other
party counterparts to each other Transaction Document duly executed by such
party.

  

  

(c) Buyer shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Parent all documents
that Parent may reasonably request relating to the existence of Buyer and the
authority of Buyer to execute and deliver this Agreement and consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

(d) The Seller Parties shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Buyer the
following:

  

  

(i) such deeds, bills of sale, endorsements, consents, assignments and other
good and sufficient instruments of conveyance and assignment as the parties
and their respective counsel shall deem reasonably necessary to vest in Buyer
all right, title and interest in, to and under the Transferred Assets and to
evidence the assumption by Buyer of the Assumed Liabilities in accordance with
the terms hereof, in each case duly executed by the applicable Seller Parties;
and

  

  

(ii) the FIRPTA affidavit specified in Section 7.03.

  

  

Section 2.08. Purchase Price Allocation. The Seller Parties and Buyer agree
that, after Closing, they will negotiate in good faith to agree on a written
allocation of the Purchase Price (increased to include, to the extent properly
taken into account for Tax purposes, the Assumed Liabilities) among the
Transferred Assets in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code (and any
similar provision of state, local or foreign Tax law), which, in the case of
the Contingent Payments, may be in the form of an agreement on the principles
by which any Contingent Payment, if made, shall be incrementally allocated
among the Transferred Assets (any such agreed allocation, the "Agreed
Allocation"). The Seller Parties and Buyer agree to (i) be bound by any Agreed
Allocation, and (ii) act in accordance with any Agreed Allocation in the
preparation, filing and audit of any Tax return (including filing IRS Form
8594), unless otherwise required by Applicable Law. Not later than 30 days
prior to the filing of their respective IRS Forms 8594 relating to this
transaction, each party shall deliver to the other party a copy of the IRS
Form 8594 such party proposes to file.

  

  

Section 2.09. Wrong Pocket Assets. If at any time or from time to time after
the Closing Date, (i) a Seller Party, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other,
shall receive or otherwise possess any asset (including cash) that should
belong to Buyer, on the one hand, or a Seller Party, on the other, pursuant to
this Agreement (other than any Excluded IT Assets), such Person shall promptly
transfer, or cause to be transferred, such asset to the Person so entitled
thereto. If at any time or from time to time after the Closing Date, Buyer
shall obtain access to or otherwise come into possession of any Excluded IT
Assets, Buyer shall promptly return, or cause to be returned, such Excluded IT
Assets in accordance with Section 5.15. Prior to any such transfer in
accordance with this Section 2.09 or Section 5.15, the Person receiving or
possessing such asset shall hold such asset

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

17

in trust for such other Person. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event
any Seller Party receives payment in respect of any accounts receivable of
Seller (including payment to any lock-box account maintained by Seller prior
to the Closing for such purpose), the Seller shall deliver such payments to an
account designated in writing by Buyer by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, such payments (if any) to be made by Seller on a weekly
basis, net of any payment by Seller, at the instruction of Buyer, of any
accounts payable arising at or after the Closing. The Seller Parties shall
maintain all such lock-box accounts for a period of six months following the
date hereof.

  

  

Section 2.10. Contingent Payments.

  

  

(a) Determination of Contingent Payments. With respect to each of the five
consecutive calendar years beginning with the calendar year ending December
31, 2014 (all such calendar years, collectively, the "Earn-Out Period"), in
the event one or more Milestones are achieved in such calendar year (and
provided, subject to the parenthetical in the next sentence, that such
calendar year is an Eligible Calendar Year for such Milestone or Milestones),
Seller shall be eligible to receive in respect of such calendar year only the
highest Contingent Payment applicable to any of the Milestones achieved during
such calendar year that has not previously been paid pursuant to this Section
2.10. In the event more than one Milestone is achieved with respect to any
calendar year, the Milestone or Milestones in respect of which no Contingent
Payment was made for such calendar year in accordance with the immediately
preceding sentence shall become payable in a subsequent calendar year during
the Earn-Out Period (whether or not such calendar year is an Eligible Calendar
Year for such Milestone) if the Net Revenue threshold applicable to such
Milestone is achieved in such subsequent year, subject to the achievement of
any other Milestone in such calendar year and the associated payment of a
greater Contingent Payment in respect of such other Milestone in accordance
with the preceding sentence. For the avoidance of doubt, only one Contingent
Payment shall be payable in respect of any one calendar year and the
Contingent Payment applicable to each Milestone shall become payable only
once, if at all.

  

  

(b) Contingent Consideration Statement. Not later than the 60th day following
the end of each of the first three calendar quarters during the Earn-Out
Period, and not later than the 90th day following the end of the fourth
calendar quarter of each year during the Earn-Out Period, Buyer shall prepare
and deliver to Seller a reasonably detailed statement (each, a "Contingent
Consideration Statement") setting forth (A) the Net Revenue for, and number of
units of Product sold during, the applicable calendar quarter and each prior
calendar quarter, if any, for the applicable calendar year, (B) the "gross to
net" adjustments with respect to the calculation of Net Revenue for such
calendar quarter and each prior calendar quarter, if any, for the applicable
calendar year, including the individual components of the calculation, as
described in the definition of "Net Revenue", and (C) in the case of a
Contingent Consideration Statement for the fourth quarter of any calendar
year, (i) which eligible Milestones were achieved during such calendar year,
if any, (ii) the amount of the Contingent Payment payable in respect of such
calendar year, if any, and (iii) the amounts thereof, if any, that Buyer
elects to offset against the Contingent Payment at such time in accordance
with Section 8.08.

CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT HAS BEEN REQUESTED

 

  

  

(c) Records; Audit Right. Buyer shall, from the Closing Date until the date
that is two years following the end of each calendar year during the Earn-Out
Period, keep accurate books of all accounts and other records in sufficient
detail so that the Contingent Payments payable under this Agreement can be
properly and fully ascertained. Buyer shall, at the request of Seller, permit
a nationally recognized registered independent auditor in the United States
selected by Seller and reasonably acceptable to Buyer (the "Independent
Auditor") to review during ordinary business hours and upon no less than 30
days' prior written notice to Buyer such books and records as may be necessary
to determine the accuracy of any Contingent Consideration Statement for the
fourth quarter of any calendar year or to obtain information as to Contingent
Payments paid or payable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. The
Independent Auditor shall be obligated to execute a confidentiality agreement
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer prior to commencing any
such inspection; provided that the Independent Auditor shall be permitted to
disclose to Seller (i) whether the Independent Auditor believes it has been
provided reasonable access to the relevant books and records to conduct an
audit and inspection in accordance with this Section 2.10(c), and if not, the
nature of any deficiencies in such access, (ii) any differences between the
Independent Auditor's findings regarding Net Revenue and the calculations of
Net Revenue set forth in any applicable Contingent Consideration Statement for
the fourth quarter of the applicable calendar year and (iii) which Milestones,
if any, were met with respect to such calendar year. Such inspections may be
made no more than once each calendar year and during normal business hours.
The books and records for any particular calendar year shall be subject to no
more than one inspection, and in no event shall any inspection be initiated
with respect to any calendar year more than two years following the end of
such calendar year. The Independent Auditor shall send a copy of its written
reports to Buyer at the same time it is sent to Seller. Seller shall be
responsible for the fees and expenses of the Independent Auditor; provided,
however, that Buyer shall reimburse Seller in full for all such costs and
expenses of the Independent Auditor if the Independent Auditor determines that
the Contingent Payment paid hereunder is less than the amount actually owed
for the relevant period of the audit or if any Milestone were achieved in the
applicable calendar year that was not set forth on the applicable Contingent
Consideration Statement. Subject to the foregoing, Buyer shall pay to Seller
any shortfall (together with interest in accordance with Section 2.10(d)(ii))
and, if applicable, the costs and expenses of the Independent Auditor, within
10 Business Days following the conclusion of the audit.

  

  

(d) Delivery of Contingent Payments.

  

  

(i) If any Contingent Payment is payable with respect to any calendar year
pursuant to this Section 2.10, Buyer shall, within 90 days after the end of
such calendar year, pay, or cause to be paid, to Seller or its designee, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by
Seller or its designee an amount equal to (A) the amount of such Contingent
Payment, less (B) the amount which Buyer elects to offset against such
Contingent Payment at such time in accordance with Section 8.08.

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

19  

  

 

 

 

  

 

CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT HAS BEEN REQUESTED

 

  

  

(ii) Any past due amount of any Contingent Payment payable by Buyer hereunder
will bear interest compounded monthly at a per annum rate of the then
prevailing U.S. Prime Rate as published by the Wall Street Journal plus 7%
(calculated at a rate per annum based upon the actual number of days elapsed
over a year of 360 days) from and after the date such Contingent Payment was
due until such amount is paid in full.

  

  

(iii) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, solely for purposes of
the calendar year ended December 31, 2014, the amount of each Contingent
Payment payable in such calendar year and the Net Revenue threshold applicable
to each Milestone for such calendar year shall, in each case, be pro-rated
based on the number of days remaining in 2014 from and after the Closing Date
as compared to 365.

  

  

(e) Buyer Obligations. (i) Buyer shall use Diligent Efforts to achieve each of
the Milestones as promptly as practicable during the Earn-Out Period.
"Diligent Efforts" means, with respect to the Product as of any time, using a
level of efforts and employing a level of resources to develop and
commercialize the Product that is at least comparable in the aggregate to the
level of efforts and resources then being used and employed by Buyer and its
Affiliates and their respective licensees and sublicensees to develop and
commercialize Buyer's Apligraf product, except to the extent (and only to the
extent) that the then applicable regulatory environment applicable to, and
profitability (taking into account the contingent obligations of Buyer to make
the Contingent Payments hereunder) of, the products (including pricing and
reimbursement status achieved), and other relevant factors, including
technical, commercial, legal, scientific and/or medical factors, would
reasonably be expected to justify a materially different level of efforts and
resources between the products due to differences in the products. For the
avoidance of doubt (and without limiting the exception in the preceding
sentence), this Section 2.10(e) does not require Buyer to develop or
commercialize the Product and Buyer's Apligraf product in an identical or even
similar manner or to sell the products at identical or even similar prices, so
long as the resources and efforts used and employed to develop and
commercialize the Product is at least comparable in the aggregate to the
efforts used and employed with respect to Buyer's Apligraf product, taking
into account the aforesaid factors. It is understood that the level of efforts
and resources required to be expended pursuant to this Section 2.10(e) may
change over time. Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer and its Affiliates
shall not take or authorize any action designed to avoid or circumvent the
achievement of any Milestone, including engaging in any program, activity or
other action (which would include, for the avoidance of doubt, the diversion
of sales of the Product to Buyer's Apligraf product) with the specific intent
of reducing the amount of Net Revenue in any calendar year. Subject to the
foregoing, from and after the Closing, Buyer shall, in its sole and
independent discretion (and at its sole cost and expense), manage and control
the Business and the Product and may, in its sole and independent discretion,
discontinue the Business to the extent that such discontinuation is consistent
with Buyer's obligations to use Diligent Efforts hereunder. It is understood
and agreed that a Product Transfer (as defined below) will not relieve Buyer
of its obligation under this Section 2.10(e)(i); provided, that for purposes
of this Section 2.10(e)(i), the activities of Buyer and each

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

20  

  

 

 

 

  

 

CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT HAS BEEN REQUESTED

 

  

  

transferee in a Product Transfer shall be attributed to Buyer for the purposes
of determining Buyer's satisfaction of the foregoing obligations.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Seller Party shall have recourse in respect
of any breach of this Section 2.10(e)(i) unless such Seller Party delivers
written notice of such breach, describing such breach in reasonable detail, to
Buyer and such breach remains uncured for a period of 20 days after the date
such written notice is given to Buyer.

  

  

(ii) Buyer and its Affiliates may not, directly or indirectly, by a sale or
swap of assets, merger, reorganization, joint venture, lease, license or any
other transaction or arrangement, sell, transfer, license, convey or otherwise
dispose of all or a portion of their respective rights in and to any Product
to a third party (other than Buyer or its Affiliates) (collectively, a
"Product Transfer"), unless at all times after any such Product Transfer, Net
Revenue by the applicable transferee will be reflected in Net Revenue in
accordance with the terms hereunder as if such transferee was Buyer, and the
contract for such sale, transfer, license, conveyance or other disposition
(which Buyer shall take all reasonable actions necessary to enforce in all
material respects) shall provide for such treatment and shall require the
transferee to comply with the covenants in Section 2.10(c), Section 2.10(e)(i)
and this Section 2.10(e)(ii), and to provide Buyer with all information
necessary to calculate Net Revenue with respect to such Product. For purposes
of clarification, this Section 2.10(e)(ii) shall not apply to sales of
Products made by Buyer or its Affiliates or ordinary course licensing
arrangements between Buyer and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and third
party licensees, distributors and contract manufacturers, on the other hand,
entered into in the ordinary course of business for purposes of developing,
manufacturing, distributing and selling Products and for which the gross
amounts invoiced for sales of Products by the applicable third party licensee,
distributor or contract manufacturer are recognized for accounting purposes as
revenue of Buyer and its Affiliates.

  

  

(iii) After the Closing, Buyer (or any of its permitted successors or assigns)
shall not engage in any Product Transfer that would result in the sale,
conveyance, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of
Buyer's and its Affiliates' rights covering the Products to an unaffiliated
third party, through one or more transactions or series of transactions,
unless the transferee assumes and succeeds to all of the obligations of Buyer
set forth in this Section 2.10 and prior to or simultaneously with such
Product Transfer delivers to Seller an instrument of assumption for the
benefit of Seller effecting such assumption and succession. Any such Product
Transfer will not release Buyer from its obligations under this Section 2.10.

  

  

(f) Transfer of Right to Receive Contingent Payments. The right to receive the
Contingent Payments or any portion thereof, if payable pursuant to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, may be sold, assigned or otherwise
transferred (including any transfer by operation of law) by Seller to any
Person, subject to the conditions set forth below. Seller will provide written
notice to Buyer within 10 calendar days of any such sale, assignment or other
transfer, and which written notice will include the name,

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

21  

  

 

 

 

  

 

CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT HAS BEEN REQUESTED

 

  

  

contact, address and telephone number of any such purchaser, assignee or
transferee, and written authorization to direct the payment of the Contingent
Payments to such purchaser, assignee or transferee rather than Seller. Seller
acknowledges that the right to receive the Contingent Payments is not a
security, shall not be represented by a certificate or other instrument and
shall not represent a security interest or an ownership interest in Buyer, its
Affiliates or any of their respective assets.

  

  

(g) Definition of Product. For purposes of this Section 2.10 (and any
definitions used in this Section 2.10), "Product" shall mean collectively, the
Product and any alternate forms or formulations thereof developed after the
Closing Date by Buyer or any of its Affiliates or any of their respective
licensees or sublicensees based on or derived in any material respect from the
Transferred Intellectual Property Rights.

  

  

Section 2.11. Withholding. Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold (or
cause to be deducted and withheld) from any amounts payable in respect of the
Transferred Assets or any other payments contemplated by this Agreement such
amount, if any, as Buyer determines in good faith is required to be deducted
and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under Applicable Law,
and to collect any necessary Tax forms for avoiding such withholding,
including IRS Form W-9, or any similar information, from Seller and any other
recipient of any payment hereunder. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
(or caused to be withheld), such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes as having been paid to Seller or such other recipient, as applicable,
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

  

  

ARTICLE 3

Seller Party of each Transaction Document to which it is a party, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, are within

constitutes, and upon the execution thereof, each other Transaction Document
to which a Seller Party is a party, shall constitute, a valid and binding

party and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
require no action by or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental

making, any representation or warranty, express or implied, regarding the fair
market value of the Transferred Assets and the Assumed Liabilities or whether
a filing of a Notification and Report Form is required pursuant to the HSR Act
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, and Buyer further
acknowledges and understands that the Seller Parties are relying on Buyer's
representation and warranty in Section 4.03(b).

  

  

Section 3.04. Noncontravention. The execution, delivery and performance by
each Seller Party of each Transaction Document to which it is a party and the

whole.

  

  

Section 3.05. Sales Statements. Schedule 3.05 of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule sets forth the net sales for the Product for the year ended December
31, 2012 (the "2012 Sales Statement") and the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2013 (the "2013 Interim Sales Statement", and together with the
2012 Sales Statement, the "Sales Statements"). The 2012 Sales Statement has
been derived from the audited financial statements of Shire PLC contained in
Shire PLC's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2012 and the 2013 Interim Sales Statement has been derived from the unaudited
financial statements of Shire PLC contained in Shire PLC's Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2013, each as filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The Sales Statements have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP and fairly present, in all material respects, for the
periods then ended, the net sales of the Product.

contracts, licenses, sublicenses and agreements to which the Seller is a party

Business or the Transferred Assets or that are material to the operation of

(b) None of the Contracts:

limit or restrict the business activity of Seller or any of its Affiliates or
limit the freedom of Seller or any of its Affiliates to use the Transferred
Assets;

  

  

(ii) (A) grants Seller a license, or a covenant not to be sued under, any

(iii) is for the benefit of any Affiliate of a Seller Party.

  

  

(c) Each Contract is a valid and binding agreement of Seller and is in full
force and effect, and neither Seller nor, to the knowledge of the Seller
Parties, any other party thereto is, or may be upon notice or lapse of time or
both, in default or breach in any respect under the terms of any Contract,
except for any such defaults or breaches which would not reasonably be
expected to be material to the operation of the Business as currently
conducted.

  

  

Section 3.07. Litigation. (a) There is no action, suit, investigation or
proceeding pending against, or to the knowledge of the Seller Parties,
threatened against or affecting, the Transferred Assets before any arbitrator
or any Governmental Authority.

  

  

(b) There are no outstanding orders, injunctions or decrees of any
Governmental Authority that apply to the Transferred Assets (or that will
apply to Buyer after Closing) that restrict the ownership, disposition or use
of the Transferred Assets or the conduct of the Business.

  

  

Section 3.08. Compliance with Law. Except as would not reasonably be expected
to be material to the Business, the Transferred Assets and the Product taken
as a whole, (1) Seller is not in violation of any Applicable Law relating to
the Business, the Product, the Transferred Assets or the Assumed Liabilities,
(2) all governmental licenses, permits, approvals and authorizations
principally employed in, or necessary to the ongoing operation of the Business
as currently conducted are in full force and effect and (3) since December 31,
2011, and, to the knowledge of the Seller Parties, from December 31, 2010 to
December 31, 2011, no Governmental Authority has notified the Seller Parties
or any of their Affiliates in writing that Seller (with respect to the
Transferred Assets, Assumed Liabilities, the Product or the operation of the
Business) is in violation of any Applicable Law.

(b) Except as set forth in Schedule 3.09 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,

Product taken as a whole.

  

  

(c) Except as set forth in Schedule 3.09 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,
prior to the transfer of any Transferred Product Registration in accordance
with this Agreement, Seller is the sole and exclusive owner of such

Transferred Assets to Buyer at the Closing in accordance with this Agreement,
Seller has good title to, or in the case of any leased Real Property or
personal property, has valid leasehold interests in, all Transferred Assets,
except where the failure to have such good title would not reasonably be
expected to be material to the operation of the Business as currently
conducted. No Transferred Asset is subject to any Lien, except for Permitted
Liens.

  

  

Section 3.11. Sufficiency of Assets. At the Closing (assuming (i) the receipt
by Buyer of the services, support and knowledge of the Seconded Employees (as
defined in the Secondment Agreement) under and pursuant to the Secondment
Agreement, (ii) the adequate capitalization of Buyer after the Closing in an

constitute a representation or warranty as to non-infringement or
misappropriation of Intellectual Property Rights of any third person (which,
in the latter case, is covered exclusively in Section 3.13).

  

  

Section 3.12. Absence of Changes; Operation of Business. (a) Since September
30, 2013 through the date of this Agreement, (i) there has not been any

CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT HAS BEEN REQUESTED

 

  

  

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, solely as it relates to

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF BUYER

  

  

Buyer represents and warrants to the Seller Parties as of the date hereof
that:

  

  

Section 4.01. Existence and Power. Buyer is a corporation duly incorporated,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation, and has all corporate powers and all governmental licenses,
authorizations, permits, consents and approvals required to carry on its
business as now conducted, except for those licenses, authorizations, permits,
consents and approvals the absence of which would not prevent, materially
delay or materially impair Buyer's ability to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (a "Buyer Material Adverse Effect.")

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

30  

  

 

 

 

  

 

CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT HAS BEEN REQUESTED

 

  

  

Section 4.02. Authorization. The execution, delivery and performance by Buyer
of each Transaction Document to which it is a party and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby are within the corporate
powers of Buyer and have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate
action on the part of Buyer. This Agreement and each other Transaction
Document to which Buyer is a party constitutes a valid and binding agreement
of Buyer, enforceable against Buyer in accordance with the terms hereof and
thereof, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, moratorium and other laws affecting creditors' rights
generally and general principles of equity.

  

  

Section 4.03. Governmental Authorization. viii) The execution, delivery and
performance by Buyer of each Transaction Document to which it is a party and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby require
no material action by or in respect of, or material filing with, any
Governmental Authority other than any such action or filing as to which the
failure to make or obtain would not reasonably be expected to have a Buyer
Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

(b) The Board of Directors of Buyer, or its ultimate parent entity, if
different, has unanimously determined in good faith within 60 calendar days
prior to Buyer's acquisition of the Transferred Assets and the assumption of
the Assumed Liabilities, in accordance with the HSR Act and the rules,
regulations and interpretations promulgated thereunder, that the fair market
value of the Transferred Assets and the Assumed Liabilities falls below the
threshold specified by the HSR Act and, as a result, has concluded that the
acquisition of the Transferred Assets and the Assumed Liabilities do not meet
the statutory size of transaction test under the HSR Act, and therefore no
filing of a Notification and Report Form is required pursuant to the HSR Act
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

Section 4.04. Noncontravention. The execution, delivery and performance by
Buyer of this Agreement and each other Transaction Document to which it is a
party and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
do not and will not (i) violate the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of
Buyer, (ii) assuming compliance with the matters referred to in Section 4.03,
violate any Applicable Law, (iii) require any consent or other action by any
Person under, constitute a default under or give rise to any right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration of any right or obligation or to a
loss of any benefit to which Buyer is entitled under any provision of any
agreement or other instrument binding upon Buyer or (iv) result in the
creation or imposition of any material Lien on any asset of Buyer, with such
exceptions, in the case of clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv), as would not
reasonably be expected to have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

Section 4.05. Adequacy of Funds. To Buyer's knowledge, Buyer will have
adequate financial resources to satisfy its monetary and other Liabilities
under this Agreement, including to make payment of any and all Contingent
Payments as and when such Contingent Payment is required to be paid in
accordance with Section 2.10.

Section 4.06. Litigation. There is no action, suit, investigation or
proceeding pending against, or to the knowledge of Buyer, threatened against
or affecting, Buyer before any arbitrator or any Governmental Authority which
in any manner challenges or seeks to prevent, enjoin, alter or materially
delay the transactions contemplated by each Transaction Document to which it
is a party.

  

  

Section 4.07. Finders' Fees. Except for Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC,
whose fees will be paid by Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer, there is no
investment banker, broker, finder or other intermediary which has been
retained by or is authorized to act on behalf of Buyer who might be entitled
to any fee or commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

  

  

Section 4.08. No Other Representations or Warranties. Except for the
representations and warranties of the Seller Parties set forth in this
Agreement, Buyer (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates) acknowledges and
agrees that no representation or warranty of any kind whatsoever, express or
implied, at law or in equity, is made or shall be deemed to have been made by
or on behalf of any Seller Party or any of its Affiliates, and each Seller
Party hereby disclaims, and Buyer (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates)
hereby disclaims any reliance upon, any such representation or warranty, and
notwithstanding the delivery or disclosure to Buyer or any of its
representatives or Affiliates of any documentation or other information by the
Seller Parties or any of their representatives or Affiliates with respect to
any one or more of the foregoing. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Buyer acknowledges that the Seller Parties make no representation
or warranty with respect to any projections, estimates or budgets delivered to
or made available to Buyer of future revenues, future results of operations
(or any component thereof), future cash flows or future financial condition
(or any component thereof) with respect to the Business, the Transferred
Assets or the Assumed Liabilities. Buyer also acknowledges that no employee or
representative of either Seller Party has been authorized to make any
statements or representations, other than those specifically contained in this
Agreement. Buyer further acknowledges and understands that the Seller Parties

the avoidance of doubt, any Hired Employees). All requests for access to such
books, records, information, employees and auditors shall be made to such
representatives of Seller as Seller shall designate, which representatives
shall be solely responsible for coordinating all such requests and all access
permitted hereunder.

not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of Buyer. All
requests for access to such properties, books, records, information, employees

designate, which representatives shall be solely responsible for coordinating
all such requests and all access permitted hereunder.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, nothing in this
Section 5.02, shall require (i) Seller or any of its Affiliates or Buyer or
any of its Affiliates to violate any Applicable Law or a contract or
obligation of confidentiality owed to a third party, to waive the protection
of an attorney-client privilege, or to take any action that would result in
the disclosure of any trade secrets (provided that, in the case of this clause
(i), the disclosing party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide
the other party, to the extent possible, with access to the relevant
information in a manner that would not reasonably be expected to result in
such violation or the forfeiture or waiver of any such attorney-client or
similar privilege) or (ii) the auditors and independent accountants of Seller
or any of its Affiliates or of Buyer or any of its Affiliates to make any work
papers available to any Person unless and until such Person has signed a
customary confidentiality and hold harmless agreement relating to such access
to work papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such auditors or
independent accountants.

expense to Buyer, the space set forth on Schedule 5.03(a) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule (the "Space"), on substantially the same basis as such
Space is leased to Seller by the applicable landlord.

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

33  

  

 

 

 

  

 

CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT HAS BEEN REQUESTED

 

  

  

This Section 5.03(a) does not, and shall not be deemed to, constitute a lease,
a sublease, a license or a conveyance of the Space or any part thereof by
Seller to Buyer or to confer upon Buyer any right, title, estate, or interest
in the Space. Buyer acknowledges that it is familiar with the physical
condition of the Space and accepts the Space in an "as is," "where is," and
"with all faults" condition. Buyer agrees to (i) maintain property and
liability insurance in amounts and with deductibles that comply with the
requirements of the applicable lease and are otherwise customary for such
location and business, and shall cause Seller to be named as an additional
insured on such policies, (ii) subject to Section 5.03(b), return the Space to
Seller at the expiration of the Real Estate Access Term in as good condition
as on the date hereof, normal wear and tear excepted, (iii) not make any
alterations or additions to the Space, (iv) obtain any permits, licenses, or
approvals that may be required from any local, state, or federal authority or
agency in connection with its use of the Space, (v) comply with all laws

the Real Estate Access Term, with respect to any specific location of the
Space, subject to receipt of any required consents of landlords, Buyer or, at
Buyer's election, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Buyer (but with a guarantee by
Buyer), shall enter into a formal written sublease of the applicable lease
with Seller for such location on substantially similar terms to those set
forth in the applicable lease except as specified on Schedule 5.03(a) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule, provided that Seller shall remain responsible for
Seller's security deposit with the landlord under the applicable lease. If the
applicable landlord refuses to consent to the sublease by the expiration of
the Real Estate Access Term, then Buyer shall be responsible for any
Liabilities arising out of Buyer's inability to use such Space.

  

  

(c) Seller may terminate the provision of Space to Buyer hereunder immediately
upon: (i) the filing by or against Buyer of a petition for liquidation or
reorganization under Title 11 of the United States Code as now or hereinafter
in effect or under any similar statute relating to insolvency, bankruptcy,
liquidation or reorganization, which filing is not stayed; (ii) the
appointment of a trustee, receiver or custodian for Buyer or any of their
properties; (iii) Buyer making an assignment for the benefit of creditors; or
(iv) a material breach or material default by Buyer of any covenant or
obligation of or under this Section 5.03, which breach or default has not been
cured within 10 days after written notice specifying the nature of such breach
or default has been given to Buyer.

  

  

(d) If Buyer does not enter into any sublease described in Section 5.03(b) or
if Seller terminates the provision of Space pursuant to Section 5.03(c), then
Buyer shall promptly vacate the applicable Space after the expiration or
earlier termination of the Real Estate Access Term and, except as otherwise
provided in this Section 5.03, all work, construction, repairs, alterations,
other improvements or installations made to or upon the Space, whether or not
at the expense of Buyer, shall become part of the Space and shall become the
property of Seller and remain upon and be surrendered with the Space as a part
thereof upon the expiration or earlier termination of the Real Estate Access
Term:

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

34  

  

 

 

 

  

 

CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT HAS BEEN REQUESTED

 

  

  

(i) All personal property not permanently affixed to the Space, which are
installed in the Space by or for the account of Buyer at Buyer's expense, and
any Transferred Assets that can be removed without material damage to the
Space, and all other moveable articles of personal property owned by Buyer and
located in the Space (collectively, "Buyer's Property") shall remain the
property of Buyer and may be removed by Buyer or any person claiming under
Buyer at any time or times during the Real Estate Access Term and shall be
removed by Buyer at the expiration or earlier termination of the Real Estate
Access Term. Buyer shall repair any damage to the Space occasioned by the
removal by Buyer or any person claiming under Buyer of any Buyer's Property
from the Space.

  

  

(ii) Any items of Buyer's Property (except money, securities and like
valuables) which remain on the Space after the expiration or earlier
termination of the Real Estate Access Term may, at the option of Seller, be
deemed to have been abandoned and in such case may either be retained by
Seller as its property or may be disposed of without accountability, at
Buyer's expense, in such manner as Seller may see fit.

  

  

(e) The Seller Parties and their respective Affiliates and their employees and
agents shall maintain access to, a right to use and a right to remove any
Excluded Assets within the Space (including, but not limited to, with respect
to any e-mail systems or IT systems of the Seller Parties that remain in use
within the Space) during the Real Estate Access Term in connection with any
reasonable business purpose of the Seller Parties or their respective
Affiliates; provided that any such access and use shall not unreasonably
interfere with the conduct of the business of Buyer.

  

  

(f) During the final three days of the Real Estate Access Term, the Seller
Parties shall be permitted to access the Space to produce copies (including
back-up tapes) of the information set forth in Schedule 5.03(f) of the Seller

Applicable Law and to the extent such information does not constitute

in any event within six months immediately following the Closing, complete the

advertising or promotion of the Product, any Promotional Materials included in
the Transferred Assets on which a Seller Mark appears unless and until (and
without limiting Section 5.05) such Promotional Materials have been revised so
as to not include any references to the Seller Marks. Except as set forth in
this Section 5.04, from and after the Closing, Buyer shall not have any right
to use any of the Seller Marks. On and after the Closing, in no event shall

Promotional Materials, Product literature, stationary, training materials and
similar materials) or (B) in any manner or for any purpose different from the
use of such Seller Marks in connection with the Business during the 90-day
period immediately preceding the Closing. Any and all use of the Seller Marks
by Buyer following the Closing shall inure to the sole and exclusive benefit
of the Seller Parties.

  

  

Section 5.05. Promotional Materials. After the Closing, Buyer shall not use
any of the Promotional Materials included in the Transferred Assets for the
marketing, promotion or sale of the Product, except to the extent that Buyer
has reviewed and approved such Promotional Materials in accordance with

(i) complying with Applicable Law with respect to Buyer's use of the
Promotional Materials after the Closing and (ii) any Liabilities arising from
or relating to Buyer's use of such Promotional Materials after the Closing
(which Liabilities shall constitute Assumed Liabilities for purposes hereof).

  

  

Section 5.06. Public Announcements. Unless otherwise required by Applicable
Law, by any listing agreement with any U.S. or U.K. securities exchange or
share market or by any listing authority including the U.K. Listing Authority,
each Seller Party and Buyer shall not, and Buyer shall cause its Affiliates
not to, make any public announcement or disseminate any written communication
to any supplier, customer, distributor or non-management employee of the
Seller Parties in respect of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, or otherwise communicate with any news media regarding this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby, without the prior written consent of
Buyer and the Seller Parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided that if any such announcement or
communication is so required, Buyer and each Seller Party shall consult with
each other, to the extent reasonably practicable, in advance as to the
contents and timing thereof; provided, further, that after the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement have been announced, each Seller Party and its
Affiliates shall be entitled to respond to questions in the ordinary course or
issue any press release or make any other public statement that, in each case,
is consistent with any public statement previously issued or made by it in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 5.06. On the date hereof, each
Seller Party (and its Affiliates) and Buyer may issue a press release in
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit D.

  

  

Section 5.07. Confidentiality. (a) Effective as of the Closing, the
Confidentiality Agreement between Buyer and Seller dated as of September 13,
2013, as amended on December 11, 2013 and December 12, 2013 (the

36  

  

 

 

 

  

 

CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT HAS BEEN REQUESTED

 

  

  

terminate with respect to information to the extent relating to the
Transferred Assets or Assumed Liabilities; provided, however, that any and all
other information provided to Buyer by a Seller Party or its representatives
concerning Seller or any of its Affiliates, and not otherwise constituting a
Transferred Asset or Assumed Liability, shall remain subject to the terms and
conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement after the Closing.

  

  

(b) After the Closing, the Seller Parties shall hold, and shall cause their
respective representatives to hold, in confidence all confidential documents
and other information concerning the Transferred Assets or Assumed Liabilities
and information concerning Buyer provided pursuant to Section 5.02(b). The
obligation of the Seller Parties to hold any such information in confidence
shall not extend to any information that is (i) required to be disclosed by
Applicable Law or which disclosure is requested by any Governmental Authority,
provided that, other than in connection with any such required or requested
disclosure that relates to the matter described in Item 2 of Schedule 2.04(b)
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, the Seller Parties shall promptly notify
Buyer in advance of any such disclosure and shall use reasonable efforts to
limit the extent of such disclosure, (ii) as necessary to defend or prosecute
any indemnification claim or any action, suit, investigation or proceeding, or
(iii) except as a result of a disclosure in breach of this Agreement by the
Seller Parties after the Closing, generally available to the public or already
known by a third party receiving such information from the Seller Parties. The
obligation of the Seller Parties to hold any such information in confidence
shall be deemed to be satisfied if they exercise the same care with respect to
such information as they would take to preserve the confidentiality of their
own similar information.

  

  

Section 5.08. Non-Solicit of Employees; Exception for Specified Business
Employees. (a) Except as expressly provided in clause (b) below, for a period
of two years following the Closing, Buyer shall not, and shall not permit any
of its Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, hire, employ, engage or solicit
for employment or services (either on a full time or part time basis, or in a
consulting or other non-employee role) any employee of Seller (other than the
Specified Business Employees) without Parent's prior written consent; provided
that Buyer may offer employment to and hire any employee of Seller who (A)
responds to an advertisement for employees in newspapers, trade publications
or other media not targeted specifically at such employee or (B) applies for
employment with Buyer, in each case as long as such employee was not solicited
by Buyer or its Affiliates in violation of this Section 5.08(a).

  

  

(b) Subject to Article 6, Buyer may solicit, offer employment to and/or hire
any employee of Seller supporting the Business, each of whom is listed on
Schedule 5.08 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (collectively, the "Specified
Business Employees").

  

  

(c) The parties acknowledge that the restrictions in this Section 5.08 are
fair and reasonable. If any provision of this Section 5.08 shall be determined
by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable for any reason
whatsoever, then such provision shall not be deemed void, but rather, shall be
modified by the court to the extent required to make such provision
enforceable, it being specifically agreed that it is

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

37  

  

 

 

 

  

 

CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT HAS BEEN REQUESTED

 

  

  

the intent of the parties that this Section 5.08 be enforced to the fullest
extent permitted under Applicable Law.

  

  

(d) Buyer acknowledges that the Seller Parties would be irreparably harmed by
any breach of this Section 5.08 and that there would be no adequate remedy at
law or in damages to compensate the Seller Parties for any such breach. Buyer
agrees that the Seller Parties shall be entitled to injunctive relief
requiring specific performance by Buyer of this Section.

  

  

Section 5.09. Returns Policy. From and after the Closing, Buyer agrees that it
will not take any action intended to encourage, through the offering of
incentives or changes in the returns policy of the Business or otherwise
(other than in the ordinary course of business consistent with the past
practice of the Business prior to Closing), customers to return any Product
shipped by Seller or its Affiliates prior to the Closing Date, except as
required by Applicable Law.

  

  

Section 5.10. Customer Notifications. Promptly after the Closing Date, Buyer
shall notify all customers of the Business (i) of the transfer of the
Transferred Assets to Buyer, (ii) that all purchase orders for the Product
received by Seller or any of its Affiliates prior to the Closing Date but not
filled as of such date will be transferred to Buyer, provided, that, to the
extent that any purchase order cannot be so transferred, Seller and Buyer
shall cooperate with each other to ensure that such purchase order is filled
and that Buyer receives the same economic benefit and assumes the same
liability associated with filling such purchase order as if such purchase
order had been so transferred and (iii) that all subsequent purchase orders
for the Product should be sent to Buyer or Buyer's distributor at the address
to be provided by Buyer.

  

  

Section 5.11. Maintenance and Transfer of Transferred Product Registrations.
(a) subject to Section 5.11(d), Seller shall file, or shall cause to be filed,
applications for the transfer of the Transferred Product Registrations to
Buyer as soon as practicable after, and in any event within 60 days after, the
Closing Date. Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, cooperate with
Seller to deliver Seller any additional documentation and materials that may
be reasonably requested by Seller to effect the transfer of the Transferred
Product Registrations to Buyer.

  

  

(b) Until the completion of the transfer of the Transferred Product
Registrations to Buyer: (i) Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to maintain the Transferred Product Registrations; (ii) if and to the extent
reasonably requested by Buyer, Seller shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to pursue, in such manner as may be reasonably directed by Buyer,
those ongoing variations, amendments and renewals which are pending at the
Closing Date and shall not withdraw them; and (iii) Seller shall not be
required to initiate any new variations or amendments, except to the extent
that they are necessary (in Buyer's reasonable, good faith opinion) for the
continuation of the Business and then only upon Buyer's written request and
direction. No Seller Party shall be liable to or have any obligation to
indemnify Buyer (i) if any or all of the Transferred Product Registrations are
not transferred by any Governmental Authority, or such transfer is delayed,
for any reason, except to the extent directly resulting from a Seller Party's
gross

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

38  

  

 

 

 

  

 

CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT HAS BEEN REQUESTED

 

  

  

negligence or willful misconduct or a breach of Section 5.11(a) by a Seller
Party or (ii) for taking any action requested or directed by Buyer pursuant to
Section 5.11(b)(ii) or (iii) above, except to the extent directly resulting
from a Seller Party's gross negligence or willful misconduct.

  

  

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, the Seller Parties do not warrant, and shall
not be responsible for (except as otherwise set forth in this Section 5.11,
the successful maintenance or renewal of any Transferred Product Registration
after the Closing Date, except to the extent that a Governmental Authority
cancels such Transferred Product Registration or refuses its renewal as a
direct result of a Seller Party's gross negligence or willful misconduct.

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding Section 5.11(a), if an application of a Seller Party for a
registration, approval, license or permit to develop and market the Product is
pending on the date hereof and such pending application is included in the
Transferred Product Registrations, Buyer may elect, at its sole and exclusive
cost, but solely to the extent such pending application is assignable, to have
such Seller Party assign to Buyer any rights that such Seller Party may have
with respect to such pending application; provided that (i) neither Seller
Party shall be responsible for completing or otherwise continuing with such
pending application or obligated to use any efforts to obtain the issuance of
the registration, approval, license or permit that is the subject of such
pending application and (ii) neither Seller Party shall be Liable to or have
any obligation to indemnify Buyer or any of its Affiliates if all or any of
such pending applications are not transferred or such transfer is delayed, or
the registration, approval, license or permit that is the subject of such
pending application is not issued, for any reason.

  

  

(e) Buyer shall bear the cost of (i) all fees levied by the relevant
Governmental Authority in connection with the transfer of the Transferred
Product Registrations pursuant to this Section 5.11, (ii) all costs and
expenses arising from the maintenance of the Transferred Product Registrations
after the Closing and any variations, amendments and renewals undertaken
pursuant to Section 5.11(b)(ii) or Section 5.11(b)(iii) above and (iii) all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses in connection with the transfer of
any pending Transferred Product Registrations pursuant to this Section 5.11.

  

  

(f) Notwithstanding that any Packaging Materials may include Seller Marks or
that Seller may remain the holder of any Transferred Product Registrations
(but without limiting Seller's obligations under the Safety Data Transitional
Agreement), Buyer shall be responsible for (i) complying with Applicable Law
after the Closing with respect to the Business, the Product and the Packaging
Materials and (ii) any Liabilities arising from or relating to the marketing
and sale of any Product after the Closing or the conduct of the Business after
the Closing (all of which Liabilities shall be deemed Assumed Liabilities
under Section 2.03(a)). Until such time as the relevant Transferred Product
Registrations are transferred to Buyer, Buyer shall not make any changes to
the Packaging Materials (other than to the extent required by Applicable Law,
and only to such extent) without the consent of the Seller Parties, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided
that if the Seller Parties consent to any such requested change or such change
is required by Applicable Law, the Seller

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

39  

  

 

 

 

  

 

CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT HAS BEEN REQUESTED

 

  

  

Parties shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer, and shall provide such
reasonable assistance as may be necessary, in implementing any such change.
Any reasonable direct costs and expenses incurred from or as a consequence of
any such change shall be fully borne by Buyer.

  

  

Section 5.12. Buyer Insurance. Promptly following the Closing, Buyer shall
obtain and, for a period of six years from and after the Closing Date, Buyer
shall maintain, product liability insurance coverage with respect to the
Product, from a financially sound and reputable insurance company or
companies, that is customary in scope and amount of coverage. Upon a Seller
Party's written request, Buyer shall promptly provide such Seller Party with a
copy of the insurance policy or policies providing for such coverage.

  

  

Section 5.13. Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representation; Nonassertion of
Attorney-Client Privilege. xiv) Buyer waives and will not assert any conflict
of interest arising out of or relating to the representation, after the
Closing (the "Post-Closing Representation"), of the Seller Parties (any such
Person, a "Designated Person") in any matter involving this Agreement or any
other Transaction Document or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,
by any legal counsel currently representing the Seller Parties in connection
with this Agreement or any other Transaction Document or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby (the "Current Representation").

  

  

(b) Buyer waives and will not assert any attorney-client privilege with
respect to any communication between any legal counsel and any Designated
Person occurring during the Current Representation in connection with any
Post-Closing Representation, including in connection with a dispute with
Buyer, it being the intention of the parties hereto that all such rights to
such attorney-client privilege and to control such attorney-client privilege
shall be retained by Seller; provided that the foregoing waiver and
acknowledgement of retention shall not extend to any communication not
involving this Agreement or any other Transaction Documents or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or to communications with any
Person other than the Designated Persons and their advisers.

  

  

Section 5.14. Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation by the Seller Parties. (a)
In order to protect the goodwill of the Business and so that Buyer may have
and enjoy the full benefit of the Transferred Assets and the Business, and in
consideration of Buyer's agreements to enter into this Agreement and to pay
the Purchase Price, the Seller Parties agree that no Seller Party, nor any of
its respective Affiliates (each such Person, a "Restricted Person"), during
the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the second anniversary
of the Closing Date, without the written prior approval of Buyer, shall:

  

  

(i) directly or indirectly, own, operate, control, lend its name to, invest
in, or otherwise be affiliated in any manner with the management, ownership,
operation or control of, any business, venture or activity that engages in
selling, marketing or distributing any product, product line or service
indicated for the treatment of full-thickness diabetic foot ulcers that in any
way or manner

CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT HAS BEEN REQUESTED

 

  

  

  

competes directly or indirectly with the Product and the Business, as they
respectively existed as of the Closing Date (a "Competing Business"); provided
that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Restricted Persons shall not be
restricted from any of the following:

  

  

(A) any activity of the Restricted Persons undertaken pursuant to this
Agreement or the Secondment Agreement;

  

  

(B) collectively owning less than five percent (5%) of any class of securities
of any publicly-traded company conducting a Competing Business provided that
such securities are held as a passive investment; or

  

  

(C) acquiring one or more Persons or businesses that include within its
business a Competing Business, so long as (1) the revenues of the Competing
Business constitute no more than 15% of the total revenues of the Person or
business being acquired, or would have, on a pro forma basis giving effect to
the acquisition, constituted no more than 1% of the total revenues of the
Seller Parties and their Affiliates on a consolidated basis, in each case
during the twelve calendar months preceding the date of acquisition or (2) if
the revenues of the Competing Business constitute more than 15% of the total
revenues of such Person or business being acquired, or would have, on a pro
forma basis giving effect to the acquisition, constituted no more than 1% of
the total revenues of the Seller Parties and their Affiliates on a
consolidated basis, in each case during the twelve calendar months preceding
the date of acquisition, such Restricted Person completes the sale of the
Competing Business within six months of the acquisition; provided, however
that if such sale is subject to regulatory approval then such 6-month period
shall be extended until five Business Days after all regulatory approvals have
been received, but only to the extent that the parties to such sale are using
reasonable best efforts to obtain any such approvals; or

  

  

(ii) directly or indirectly, (A) solicit, hire or take any other action which
is intended to induce any employee or consultant of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (including any Hired Employee) to terminate or limit his or her
employment with or service to Buyer, whether or not that person would commit a
breach of any employment contract or consultancy agreement by leaving the
employment of or service to Buyer or such Affiliate or (B) take any other
action which is intended to induce (1) any manufacturer, supplier or other
business partner of the Business as of the Closing Date to adversely alter,
modify or discontinue or limit its relationship with the Business or (2) any
customer of the Business at any time during the twelve months prior to the
Closing Date, or any prospective customer who as of the date hereof is in
active negotiations of a potential business relationship in respect of the
Business, to discontinue or limit, or not to commence, purchasing from the
Business, provided, however, that the foregoing subclause (A) shall not
prohibit any Seller Party (or any of its

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

41  

  

 

 

 

  

 

CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT HAS BEEN REQUESTED

 

  

  

Affiliates) from (X) employing any such Person who has not been employed by
Buyer for a period of six months prior to the date such Person was first
solicited for employment or (Y) making general advertisements for employment
that are not specifically directed at Hired Employees and hiring individuals
who respond to such general advertisements.

  

  

(b) The obligations set forth in this Section 5.14 shall not extend to bind
any future acquiror of Seller or any of its Affiliates or any of such
acquiror's other Affiliates (but only in a bona fide acquisition of Seller or
such other Affiliate by a non-Affiliated acquirer) (it being agreed that
Section 5.14 shall continue to apply to Seller and its Affiliates (as such
Affiliates were constituted immediately prior to such acquisition but, for the
avoidance of doubt, excluding such acquiror and its Affiliates)).

  

  

(c) Each Restricted Person agrees with Buyer that the covenants in this
Section 5.14 are reasonable in all respects (including with respect to the
subject matter, time period and geographical area) and are necessary to
protect the interests of Buyer and in the Business and the Transferred Assets,
including the goodwill and the Transferred Intellectual Property Rights.
Further, each Restricted Person acknowledges that, without the restrictions
contained in this Section 5.14, the benefits of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, particularly given the nature of the Transferred Assets and
Business being acquired hereunder, their highly confidential nature and the
ongoing marketing and distribution of the Products, could be circumvented, and
that Buyer would not have entered into this Agreement without the restrictions
contained in this Section 5.14. If a final judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of this Section 5.14 is
invalid or unenforceable, Buyer and the Seller Parties agree that the court
making such determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall be required
to reduce the scope, duration, or geographic area of such term or provision,
to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or
unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and
enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid
or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as
so modified.

  

  

Section 5.15. Excluded IT Assets. After the Closing, Buyer shall promptly take
appropriate steps to provide reasonable assurance that if any employee or
other personnel of Buyer or its Affiliates intentionally or unintentionally
access or otherwise come into possession of any information that is reasonably
likely to constitute information specified under "Excluded IT Assets" in
Schedule 2.02(e) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (the "Excluded IT Assets"),
such employee or other personnel will promptly notify Buyer's legal
department. Upon receipt of such notice, Buyer shall (i) limit access to such
information to only those individuals necessary to determine whether the
information is an Excluded IT Asset (provided that if Buyer reasonably
determines such information is not an Excluded IT Asset, such access
limitations shall no longer be required), (ii) secure and not otherwise make
available or distribute such information to any third party to the extent it
is an Excluded IT Asset, and (iii) within two Business Days of any such access
to an Excluded IT Asset, provide notice of such access to the representatives
of Parent specified in Schedule 5.15 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule.

  

  

Section 5.16. Non-Exclusive License to Buyer. Effective as of the Closing,
Seller hereby grants Buyer a perpetual, non-exclusive, transferable and
royalty-free license to use in connection with the operation of the Business
any know-how and trade secrets owned by Seller as of the date of this
Agreement that are primarily held for use in connection with the Business or
are material to the operation of the Business, in each case, as conducted as
of the date hereof. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) Seller shall retain sole
and exclusive ownership of any and all such know-how and trade secrets; and
(ii) Buyer shall obtain sole and exclusive ownership of know-how and trade
secrets owned by Seller and exclusively related to the Product pursuant to
Section 2.01(a).

applicable Hired Employee shall agree.

  

  

Section 6.01. Hired Employee Benefits. Buyer shall take reasonable steps to
ensure that each such Hired Employee is offered severance benefits, if

situated employees (with tenure counted as of the date such Hired Employee was
first hired by Seller or any of its Affiliates) under Buyer's severance plans
or policies as of the date hereof.

  

  

Section 6.02. No Modification or Amendment of Employee Rights. It is
understood and agreed between the parties that all provisions contained in
this Agreement with respect to employee benefit plans are included for the
sole benefit of the respective parties hereto and do not and shall not create
any right in any other Person, including, but not limited to, any Specified
Business Employee or Hired Employee, any participant in any benefit plan or
any beneficiary thereof. The covenants contained in this Article 6 do not
constitute a modification or amendment of any employee benefit plan of Buyer
or Seller.

  

  

Section 6.03. Personnel Records. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this
Agreement shall prevent a Hired Employee from requesting a copy of his or her
personnel record from Seller Parties, which Seller Parties shall release at
the instruction of such Hired Employee to the extent required by and subject
to any limitations of Applicable Law.

for a period of at least six years following the Closing Date. On or after the
end of such period, each party shall provide the other with at least 10 days
prior written notice before destroying any such books and records, during
which period the party receiving such notice can elect to take possession, at
its own expense, of such books and records. The Seller Parties and Buyer shall
cooperate with each other in the conduct of any audit or other proceeding
relating to Taxes involving the Transferred Assets.

hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, based on the number of days of such
taxable period included in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the number of days

hereto contained in this Agreement (other than those set forth in Section
7.01) shall survive the Closing until May 16, 2015; provided that the
representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.01, 3.02, 3.04(i),
3.04(ii), 3.04(iv), 3.10 and 3.16 (collectively, the "Seller Party Fundamental
Representations") and the representations and warranties set forth in Sections
4.01, 4.02, 4.04(i), 4.04(ii) and 4.07 (collectively, the "Buyer Fundamental
Representations") shall survive the Closing until the date that is 60 days
after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations or any extension
thereof. The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the
parties hereto contained in Article 7 shall survive the Closing until the date
that is 60 days after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
or any extension thereof. The covenants and agreements of the parties hereto
contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing indefinitely or for the
shorter period explicitly specified therein, except that for such covenants
and agreements that survive for such shorter period, breaches thereof shall
survive indefinitely or until the latest date permitted by Applicable Law.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentences, any breach of any covenant,
agreement, representation or warranty in respect of which indemnity may be
sought under this Agreement shall survive the time at which it would otherwise
terminate pursuant to the preceding sentences, if notice of the inaccuracy or
breach thereof giving rise to such right of indemnity shall have been given to
the party against whom such indemnity may be sought prior to such time in
accordance with Sections 8.03 or 8.04, as applicable.

  

  

Section 8.02. Indemnification. (a) Subject to Section 8.01, Section 8.05,
Section 8.07, Section 8.08 and Section 8.09:

officers, employees, shareholders, members, managers, agents, successors and
assigns (collectively, the "Buyer Indemnified Parties") against and agree to
hold each of them harmless from any and all claims, damages, losses, costs,
expenses, liabilities, penalties and fines (including reasonable costs of
collection, reasonable attorneys' fees and reasonable expenses of
investigation) ("Damages") actually suffered by any Buyer Indemnified Party
arising out of:

  

  

(A) any misrepresentation or breach of any representation or warranty (in each
case, disregarding, solely for purposes of calculating Damages and not for
purposes of determining if a breach has occurred, any express qualifications
or limitations set forth in such representation or warranty as to materiality
or "Material Adverse Effect," except as set forth in Section 3.12(a)) (each
such misrepresentation and breach of a representation or warranty a "Warranty
Breach");

  

  

(B) any breach of a covenant or agreement made or to be performed by a Seller
Party pursuant to this Agreement; or

  

  

(C) any Excluded Liability;

  

  

provided that with respect to indemnification by the Seller Parties for
Warranty Breaches pursuant to Section 8.02(a)(i)(A), (1) the Seller Parties
shall not be liable unless the aggregate amount of Damages with respect to
such Warranty Breaches exceeds $500,000 (the "Deductible") and then only to
the extent of such excess; (2) the Seller Parties shall not be liable for any
Damages arising out of any individual claim unless such Damages exceed
$50,000, and any Damages that are disregarded pursuant to this clause (2)
shall not be aggregated for purposes of the preceding clause (1); and (3) the
Seller Parties' maximum Liability for all such Warranty Breaches shall not
exceed $7,500,000 (the "Cap"); provided, further, that if the absence of an
asset has resulted in a breach of a representation or warranty set forth in
Section 3.11, to the extent that such breach may be cured (in whole or in
part) by the delivery of such asset, the Seller Parties' indemnification
obligations hereunder may, at their option, be cured to such extent (and only
such extent) by delivery of such asset, and the remaining indemnification
obligations with respect to such breach (if any) shall be satisfied in
accordance with the other provisions of this Article 8. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Deductible and the Cap shall not apply to any Damages arising
out of a Warranty Breach of any Seller Party Fundamental Representation; and

  

  

(ii) effective at and after the Closing, Buyer hereby indemnifies the Seller
Parties and their Affiliates, and their respective directors, officers,
employees, shareholders, members, managers, agents, successors and assigns
(collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Parties") against and agrees to hold
each of them harmless from any and all Damages actually suffered by any Seller
Indemnified Party arising out of:

  

  

(A) any Warranty Breach;

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

46  

  

 

 

 

  

 

CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT HAS BEEN REQUESTED

 

  

  

(B) any breach of covenant or agreement made or to be performed by Buyer
pursuant to this Agreement;

  

  

(C) (iv) the furnishing of any of the Space provided to Buyer pursuant to
Section 5.03, unless such Damages arise by reason of gross negligence, willful
misconduct or material breach of this Agreement by any of the Seller
Indemnified Parties, or (2) any primary lease agreement for the Space, to the
extent arising out of or relating to any act or failure to act by Buyer any of
its employees, or any of its agents, representatives or invitees, including,
in each case of (1) and (2), any Damages arising under or relating to
Environmental Laws; or

  

  

(D) any Assumed Liability;

  

  

provided that with respect to indemnification by Buyer for Warranty Breaches
pursuant to Section 8.02(a)(ii)(A), (1) Buyer shall not be liable unless the
aggregate amount of Damages with respect to such Warranty Breaches exceeds the
Deductible and then only to the extent of such excess; (2) Buyer shall not be
liable for any Damages arising out of any individual claim unless such Damages
exceed $50,000, and any Damages that are disregarded pursuant to this clause
(2) shall not be aggregated for purposes of the preceding clause (1); and (3)
Buyer's maximum Liability for all such Warranty Breaches shall not exceed the
Cap. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Deductible and the Cap shall not apply
to any Damages arising out of a Warranty Breach of any Buyer Party Fundamental
Representation.

  

  

(b) The waiver of any condition contained in this Agreement based on the
breach of any such representation or warranty, or on the performance of or
compliance with any such covenant or agreement, will not affect the right of
any Indemnified Party to indemnification pursuant to this Article 8 based on
such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement unless so provided in
such waiver.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the right of any
Indemnified Party to indemnification pursuant to this Article 8 will not be
affected by any investigation conducted or knowledge acquired (or capable of
being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the Closing, with respect to the accuracy of any
representation or warranty or the performance of or compliance with any
covenant or agreement.

  

  

Section 8.03. Third Party Claim Procedures. (a) Any Buyer Indemnified Party or
Seller Indemnified Party seeking indemnification under Section 8.02 (each, an
"Indemnified Party") shall give prompt notice in writing to the Person from
whom indemnification is sought (the "Indemnifying Party") of the assertion of
any claim or the commencement of any suit, action or proceeding by any third
party ("Third Party Claim") in respect of which indemnity may be sought under
such Section. Such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail such claim and
the basis for indemnification (taking into account the information then
available to the Indemnified Party). The failure to so

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

47  

  

 

 

 

  

 

CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT HAS BEEN REQUESTED

 

  

  

notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
obligations hereunder, except to the extent such failure shall have adversely
prejudiced the Indemnifying Party. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall
deliver to the Indemnifying Party, as promptly as reasonably practicable
following the Indemnified Party's receipt thereof, copies of all written
notices and documents (including any court papers) received by the Indemnified
Party relating to the Third Party Claim and the Indemnified Party shall
provide the Indemnifying Party with such other information with respect to any
such Third Party Claim reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party. The
Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its sole option and expense, to be
represented by counsel of its choice and, subject to the limitations set forth
in this Section 8.03, to defend against, negotiate, settle (subject to clause
(b)) or otherwise deal with such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party
elects not to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any
Third Party Claim, then the Indemnified Party may defend against, negotiate,
settle (subject to clause (b)) or otherwise deal with such Third Party Claim,
but the Indemnifying Party may nonetheless participate in the defense of such
Third Party Claim with its own counsel at its own expense. If the Indemnifying
Party shall assume the defense of any Third Party Claim, then the Indemnified
Party may participate, at his or its own expense, in the defense of such Third
Party Claim; provided that such Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
participate in any such defense with separate counsel at the expense of
Indemnifying Party if (i) so requested by the Indemnifying Party to
participate or (ii) in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the Indemnifying
Party, a material conflict exists between the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party that would make such separate representation advisable;
provided, further, that the Indemnifying Party shall not be required to pay
for more than one such counsel (plus any appropriate local counsel) for all
Indemnified Parties in connection with any Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding
anything in this Section 8.03 to the contrary, Buyer will control, without
affecting its or any other Indemnified Party's rights to indemnification under
this Agreement, the defense of all Third Party Claims relating to the matters
addressed in Section 7.01 or any Excluded Liability relating to Taxes ("Tax
Claims") to the extent related to Buyer Tax Returns; provided, however, that
Seller and its counsel (at its sole expense) may participate in (but not
control the conduct of) the defense of any such Tax Claim. Buyer shall not
settle any such Tax Claim without the consent of Seller, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 8.03 to the contrary, neither the
Indemnifying Party nor the Indemnified Party shall, without the written
consent of the other party, settle or compromise any Third Party Claim or
permit a default or consent to entry of any judgment. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, consent of the Indemnified Party shall not be required for any such
settlement if (i) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid
in full by the Indemnifying Party (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, the
payment of the Deductible, to the extent applicable), (ii) such settlement
does not permit any order, injunction or other equitable relief to be entered,
directly or indirectly, against the Indemnified Party and (iii) such
settlement includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from
all Liability on claims that are the subject matter of such Third Party Claim
and does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault,
culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Party.

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

48  

  

 

 

 

  

 

CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT HAS BEEN REQUESTED

 

  

  

If the Indemnifying Party makes any payment on any Third Party Claim, then the
Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to all
rights and remedies of the Indemnified Party to any insurance benefits or
other claims of the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim.

  

  

(c) After any decision, judgment or award shall have been rendered by a
Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction, or a settlement shall have
been consummated in accordance with this Article 8, or the Indemnified Party
and the Indemnifying Party shall have arrived at a mutually binding agreement
with respect to a Third Party Claim hereunder, the Indemnified Party shall
forward to the Indemnifying Party notice of any sums due and owing by the
Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such matter.

  

  

(d) Each party shall cooperate, and cause its respective Affiliates to
cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim and shall
furnish or cause to be furnished such records, information and testimony, and
attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals,
as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

  

  

Section 8.04. Direct Claim Procedures. In the event an Indemnified Party has a
claim for indemnity under Section 8.02 against an Indemnifying Party that does
not involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party agrees to give prompt
notice in writing of such claim to the Indemnifying Party. Such notice shall
set forth in reasonable detail such claim and the basis for indemnification
and the amount of such Damages incurred or that such Indemnified Party
reasonably estimates in good faith is likely to be incurred in connection with
such claim (taking into account the information then available to the
Indemnified Party). The failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the
extent such failure shall have actually prejudiced the Indemnifying Party. The
Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate with and assist the Indemnifying
Party in determining the validity of any such claim for indemnity by the
Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party disputes its indemnity obligation
for any Damages with respect to such claim, the parties shall proceed in good
faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute and, if not resolved through
negotiations, such dispute shall be resolved by litigation in an appropriate
court of jurisdiction determined pursuant to Section 9.06.

  

  

Section 8.05. Certain Limitations. (a) The amount of any Damages payable under
Section 8.03 by the Indemnifying Party shall be net of any (i) amounts
recovered or recoverable by the Indemnified Party under applicable insurance
policies, or from any other Person alleged to be responsible therefor and (ii)
Tax Benefit realized by the Indemnified Party arising from the incurrence or
payment of any such Damages. For this purpose, "Tax Benefit" means, with
respect to any Damages subject to an indemnity under Article 8 an amount by
which the net Tax liability of the Indemnified Party (or a group filing a Tax
return that includes such Indemnified Party) is actually reduced in any Tax
period as a result of Damages or the amount of Tax refund that is generated as
a result of such Damages, and any related interest received from the
applicable Taxing Authority (net of any associated Tax cost). If the
Indemnified Party (A) receives any

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

49  

  

 

 

 

  

 

CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT HAS BEEN REQUESTED

 

  

  

amounts under applicable insurance policies, or from any other Person alleged
to be responsible for any Damages, then such Indemnified Party shall promptly
reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any payment made or expense incurred by
such Indemnifying Party in connection with providing such indemnification
payment up to the amount received by the Indemnified Party, net of any
expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in collecting such amount or (B)
receives any net Tax Benefit subsequent to an indemnification payment by the
Indemnifying Party, then such Indemnified Party shall promptly pay to the
Indemnifying Party the amount of such net Tax Benefit up to the amount
received by the Indemnified Party, net of any expenses incurred by such
Indemnified Party in collecting such amount.

  

  

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under Section 8.02 for any (i)
indirect, consequential, punitive or other speculative forms of Damages, (ii)
Damages for lost profits or (iii) Damages that would not exist if not for, or
to the extent aggravated by, any act or wrongful omission by the Indemnified
Party, except, in the cases of clauses (i) or (ii), to the extent any
Indemnified Party is liable for such Damages to any third party based on any
final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.

  

  

(c) The Indemnifying Party shall have no obligation to indemnify the
Indemnified Party for any Damages arising out of a Warranty Breach to the
extent that the recovery of Damages would constitute a duplicative payment of
amounts otherwise recovered for Damages arising out of any Assumed Liability
or Excluded Liability, as the case may be; and the Indemnifying Party shall
have no obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party for any Damages arising
out of any Assumed Liability or Excluded Liability, as the case may be, to the
extent that the recovery of Damages would constitute a duplicative payment of
amounts otherwise recovered for Damages arising out of a Warranty Breach.

  

  

(d) Each Indemnified Party shall mitigate in accordance with Applicable Law
any loss for which such Indemnified Party seeks indemnification under this
Agreement; provided, that (i) no party is required to bring any suit, action
or proceeding action in connection with such mitigation and (ii) any Liability
of any Indemnifying Party under this Agreement for Damages suffered or
incurred by the Indemnified Party shall include Liability in respect of the
reasonable costs and expenses suffered or incurred by the Indemnified Party in
performing its obligations under this Section 8.05(d). If such Indemnified
Party mitigates its loss after the Indemnifying Party has paid the Indemnified
Party under any indemnification provision of this Agreement in respect of that
loss, the Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party and pay to the
Indemnifying Party the extent of the value of the benefit to the Indemnified
Party of that mitigation (less the Indemnified Party's reasonable costs of
mitigation, not exceeding the value of the benefit to the Indemnified Party)
within two Business Days after the benefit is received.

  

  

(e) Each Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
collect any amounts available under insurance coverage, or from any other
Person alleged to be responsible, for any Damages payable under Section 8.02
and any reasonable costs incurred by any Indemnified Party in connection with
such collection shall constitute Damages indemnifiable hereunder.

Section 8.06. Assignment of Claims. If the Indemnified Party receives any
payment from an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Damages pursuant to
Section 8.02 and the Indemnified Party could have recovered all or a part of
such Damages from a third party (a "Potential Contributor") based on the
underlying claim asserted against the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified
Party shall assign such of its rights to proceed against the Potential
Contributor as are necessary to permit the Indemnifying Party to recover from
the Potential Contributor the amount of such payment; provided that no such
assignment shall be required if (8) the Potential Contributor is a supplier or
customer of the Business or Buyer, (9) the Buyer or the Business has a
continuing material commercial relationship with such Potential Contributor
and (10) Buyer determines, in its reasonable discretion, that such
Indemnifying Party so proceeding against such Potential Contributor would be
reasonably likely to result in a material impairment of such commercial
arrangement with such Potential Contributor.

  

  

Section 8.07. Exclusivity. After the Closing, Section 8.02 will provide the
exclusive remedy of the Indemnified Parties against the Indemnifying Parties
for any misrepresentation, breach of representation or warranty, covenant or
other agreement (other than those contained in Sections 5.02, 5.04, 5.07 and
5.14, any claims involving fraud or willful misrepresentation on the part of
any Indemnifying Party, and any equitable remedies pursuant to Section 9.13)
or other claim arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby. Without limiting the foregoing, except as specifically set forth in
this Article 8 and Section 9.13, effective as of the Closing, Buyer waives any
rights and claims Buyer may have against any Seller Party, whether in law or
in equity, relating to the Transferred Assets, the Product or the transactions
contemplated hereby. The rights and claims waived by Buyer include claims for
contribution or other rights of recovery arising out of or relating to any
Environmental Law (whether now or hereinafter in effect), claims for breach of
contract, breach of representation or warranty, negligent misrepresentation
and all other claims for breach of duty.

  

  

Section 8.08. Satisfaction of Indemnification Obligations. Notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement to the contrary: (i) any indemnification for
Damages to which any Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled pursuant to Section
8.02(a)(i) with respect to Warranty Breaches, other than Damages arising from
a Warranty Breach of a Seller Party Fundamental Representation or of Section
3.11, shall be satisfied solely and exclusively by offset against any
Contingent Payment that is owed and has not yet been paid by Buyer to Seller
(each, a "Milestone Set-Off"); and (ii) any other indemnification for Damages
to which any Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled pursuant to Section
8.02(a)(i) may, at Buyer's election, be satisfied by a Milestone Set-Off;
provided in each case that any Milestone Set-Off in respect of an
indemnification claim shall be subject to the applicable limitations on the
rights to indemnification of the Buyer Indemnified Parties set forth in
Section 8.02(a), and provided, further, that no Milestone Set-Off shall be
made against any payment of Contingent Payment that is due and owing to Seller
until the Damages for such indemnification claim have been finally determined.
Buyer shall have the right to withhold such portion of any Contingent Payment
that would otherwise be payable hereunder during the pendency of any
unresolved claim for indemnification hereunder, in such amount as Buyer shall,
in its reasonable discretion, determine is necessary to cover the amount of
Damages subject to such claim (or if such amount is not

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

51  

  

 

 

 

  

 

CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT HAS BEEN REQUESTED

 

  

  

known, Buyer's reasonable good faith estimate thereof) until such claim is
fully and finally resolved in accordance with the terms hereof. For any
Milestone Set-Off in respect of an indemnification claim, once such claim is
finally determined in accordance with Article 8 and the other terms of this
Agreement, if the Damages determined to be payable to the Buyer Indemnified
Party in respect of such claim are less than the amount of the corresponding
Milestone Set-Off (any such difference, an "Excess Milestone Set-Off Amount"),
then Buyer shall promptly pay the Excess Milestone Set-Off Amount to Seller
plus interest accruing on such amount on a daily basis, from and including the
date such amount was withheld from the applicable Contingent Payment but
excluding the date the payment is received by Seller from Buyer, at a rate per
annum equal to the then prevailing U.S. Prime Rate as published by the Wall
Street Journal plus 2%.

  

  

Section 8.09. Purchase Price Adjustment. Any indemnification payment made
under Article 8 will be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

Section 9.10. Bulk Sales Laws. Buyer and the Seller Parties each hereby waive
compliance by the Seller Parties with the provisions of the "bulk sales",
"bulk transfer" or similar laws of any jurisdiction.

  

  

Section 9.11. Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of
this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

  

  

Section 9.12. Seller Disclosure Schedule. The Seller Parties have set forth
information on the Seller Disclosure Schedule in a section thereof that
corresponds to the section of this Agreement to which it relates. A matter set
forth in one section of the Seller Disclosure Schedule need not be set forth
in any other section so long as its relevance to such other section of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule or section of the Agreement is readily apparent on
the face of the information disclosed therein to the Person to which such
disclosure is being made. The parties acknowledge and agree that (1) the
Seller Disclosure Schedule to this Agreement may include certain items and
information solely for informational purposes for the convenience of Buyer and
(2) the disclosure by the Seller Parties of any matter in the Seller
Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to constitute an acknowledgment by the
Seller Parties that the matter is required to be disclosed by the terms of
this Agreement or that the matter is material.

  

  

Section 9.13. Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof in the courts
specified in Section 9.06, in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity.

  

  

Section 9.14. Non-Recourse. No past, present or future director, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent,
attorney or representative of any Seller Party, Buyer or any of their
respective Affiliates shall have any Liability for any Liabilities of the
Seller Parties or Buyer (as applicable) under this Agreement or the Assignment
and Assumption Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by
reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, except to the
extent such Liabilities are expressly assumed by any such Person or are
binding upon any such Person pursuant to Section 9.04 or by operation of
Applicable Law.
