                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

         THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") is made and
entered into as of the 13th day of June, 2001, by and between F.N.B.
CORPORATION, a Florida corporation having its principal office located in
Naples, Florida ("FNB"), and PROMISTAR FINANCIAL CORPORATION, a Pennsylvania
corporation having its principal office located in Johnstown, Pennsylvania
("Promistar").

                                    PREAMBLE

         The Boards of Directors of Promistar and FNB believe that the
acquisition described herein is in the best interests of the parties and their
respective shareholders. This Agreement provides for the acquisition of
Promistar by FNB pursuant to the merger of Promistar with and into FNB (the
"Merger"). At the effective time of such Merger, the outstanding shares of the
capital stock of Promistar shall be converted into the right to receive shares
of the common stock of FNB (except as provided herein). As a result,
shareholders of Promistar shall become shareholders of FNB. Immediately upon
consummation of the Merger, Alpha Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary of Promistar,
shall be merged into First National Bank of Pennsylvania, a wholly owned
subsidiary of FNB. The transactions described in this Agreement are subject to
the approvals of the shareholders of Promistar and FNB, the Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and
the Pennsylvania Department of Banking, and the satisfaction of certain other
conditions described in this Agreement. It is the intention of the parties to
this Agreement that the Merger for federal income tax purposes shall qualify as
a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code, and for accounting purposes shall qualify for treatment as a pooling of
interests.

         Contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as
a condition and inducement to FNB's willingness to enter into this Agreement,
Promistar and FNB are entering into a stock option agreement (the "Stock Option
Agreement"), in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit 1, pursuant to
which Promistar is granting to FNB an option to purchase shares of Promistar
Common Stock.

         Certain terms used in this Agreement are defined in Section 11.1 of
this Agreement.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the above and the mutual
warranties, representations, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the
parties agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE 1
                        TRANSACTIONS AND TERMS OF MERGER

         1.1      Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
at the Effective Time, Promistar shall be merged with and into FNB in accordance
with the provisions of the FBCA and the PBCL. At the Effective Time, the
separate existence of Promistar shall cease, and FNB shall be the Surviving
Corporation resulting from the Merger and shall continue to be governed by the
Laws of the State of Florida. From and after the Effective Time, the Merger
shall have the effects specified in the FBCA and the PBCL. The Merger shall be
consummated pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, which has been approved and
adopted by the respective Boards of Directors of Promistar and FNB.

         1.2      Time and Place of Closing. The closing of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the "Closing"), including the Merger, shall take
place at 10:00 A.M., local time, on a date specified by the Parties as they,
acting through their chief executive officers or chief financial officers, may
mutually agree. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, unless mutually
agreed upon in writing


                                       1
<PAGE>   7

by each Party, the Parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the
Closing to occur on, but not prior to, the fifth business day following the
Approval Date.

         1.3      Effective Time. The Merger and other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement shall become effective upon (i) the later to occur of (A) the
date and time at which the Florida Articles of Merger containing the provisions
required by, and executed in accordance with, the FBCA shall have been accepted
for filing by the Florida Department of State, and (B) the date and time at
which the Pennsylvania Articles of Merger containing the provisions required by,
and executed in accordance with, the PBCL shall have been accepted for filing by
the Pennsylvania Department of State, or (ii) such later date and time as is
agreed in writing by FNB and Promistar and specified in the Florida Articles of
Merger and the Pennsylvania Articles of Merger (the time at which the Merger
becomes effective referred to herein as the "Effective Time"). Unless FNB and
Promistar otherwise mutually agree in writing, the Parties to this Agreement
shall use their best efforts to cause the Effective Time to occur on the date of
Closing.

         1.4      Execution of Stock Option Agreement. Concurrently with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as a condition of FNB's
willingness to enter into this Agreement, Promistar is executing and delivering
to FNB the Stock Option Agreement.

                                    ARTICLE 2
                                 TERMS OF MERGER

         2.1      Articles of Incorporation. The Articles of Incorporation of
FNB in effect at the Effective Time shall be the Articles of Incorporation of
the Surviving Corporation until otherwise amended or repealed in accordance with
applicable Law.

         2.2      Bylaws. The Bylaws of FNB in effect at the Effective Time
shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until otherwise amended or
repealed in accordance with applicable Law.

         2.3      FNB Board of Directors. Following the Effective Time, the
number of members of the FNB Board of Directors shall be increased by three
(which shall be accomplished by creating one vacancy in each of the three
classes of FNB directors) and three of the present members of the Board of
Directors of Promistar shall be elected by the FNB Board of Directors to fill
the vacancies so created. At the first annual meeting of the shareholders of FNB
following the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of FNB shall nominate for
reelection each of the directors elected pursuant to this Section 2.3. At the
third annual meeting following the Effective Time, the FNB Board of Directors
shall nominate for reelection the director elected pursuant to this Section 2.3
whose term expires at such meeting. At the fourth annual meeting following the
Effective Time, the FNB Board of Directors shall nominate for reelection the
director elected pursuant to this Section 2.3 whose term expires at such
meeting.

         2.4      First National Bank of Pennsylvania Board of Directors.
Following the Effective Time, FNB shall cause five of the directors of Promistar
or its Subsidiaries to be elected as members of the Board of Directors of First
National Bank of Pennsylvania.

                                    ARTICLE 3
                           MANNER OF CONVERTING SHARES

         3.1      Conversion of Shares. Subject to the provisions of this
Article 3, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of FNB, or Promistar, or the shareholders of either, the shares of
the constituent corporations shall be converted as follows:

         (a)      Each share of FNB Capital Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding from
and after the Effective Time.

         (b)      Subject to Section 3.4 relating to fractional shares, each
share of Promistar Common Stock (excluding shares to be cancelled pursuant to
Section 3.3 of this Agreement) issued and outstanding at the Effective Time
shall cease to be outstanding and shall be converted into and exchanged for
0.926 shares of FNB Common Stock (subject to possible adjustment pursuant to
Section 10.1 hereof (the "Exchange Ratio").

         3.2      Anti-Dilution Provisions. In the event FNB changes the number
of shares of FNB Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time
as a result of a stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reclassification
or similar transaction with respect to such stock and the record date therefor
(in the case of a stock dividend) or the effective date thereof (in the case of
a stock split or similar recapitalization for which a record date is not
established) shall be prior to the Effective Time, the Exchange Ratio shall be
proportionately adjusted so as to prevent the dilutive effect of such
transaction on a percentage of ownership basis.

         3.3      Shares Held by Promistar or FNB. Each share of Promistar
Common Stock, if any, held by any Promistar Company or by any FNB Company, in
each case other than in a fiduciary capacity or as a result of debts previously
contracted, shall be canceled and retired at the Effective Time and no
consideration shall be issued in exchange therefor.

         3.4      Fractional Shares. Each shareholder of Promistar will have the
option of enrolling the shares of FNB Common Stock issued to such shareholder
pursuant to the Merger in FNB's Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan
(the "DRSP Plan"). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each
holder of Promistar Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who elects not
to enroll in the DRSP Plan and who would otherwise have been entitled to receive
a fraction of a share of FNB Common Stock (after taking into account all
certificates delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash
(without interest) in an amount equal to such fractional part of a share of FNB
Common Stock multiplied by the "market price" of one share of FNB Common Stock
at the Closing. The market price of one share of FNB Common Stock at the Closing
shall be the closing price of such common stock, as reported by Nasdaq (or, if
not reported thereby, any other authoritative source selected by FNB) on the
last trading day preceding the Closing. No such holder will be entitled to
dividends, voting rights, or any other rights as a shareholder in respect of any
fractional shares. Each shareholder of Promistar electing to enroll in the DRSP
Plan will receive his or her share of FNB Common Stock issued pursuant to the
Merger in book-entry form, with any fractional share rounded to the third
decimal place, and such shareholder will be entitled to dividends and voting
rights with respect to such fractional share.

         3.5      Treatment of Options and Warrants.

         (a)      At the Effective Time, each option, warrant or other right to
purchase or acquire Promistar Common Stock (collectively, the "Promistar
Options") pursuant to stock awards, stock options, stock appreciation rights, or
other benefits granted by Promistar pursuant to any employee stock option plan
or other arrangement of Promistar ("Promistar Stock Plan"), which Promistar
Options are outstanding at the


                                       3
<PAGE>   9

Effective Time of the Merger, whether or not such Promistar Options are then
vested or exercisable, shall be converted into and become rights with respect to
FNB Common Stock, and FNB shall assume each Promistar Option, in accordance with
the terms of the Promistar Stock Plan, Stock Option agreement, or warrant
agreement by which it is evidenced, except that from and after the Effective
Time (i) FNB and its Compensation Committee shall be substituted for Promistar
and the compensation committee of Promistar's Board of Directors, including, if
applicable, the entire Board of Directors of Promistar, administering such
Promistar Stock Plan, (ii) each Promistar Option assumed by FNB may be exercised
solely for shares of FNB Common Stock, (iii) the number of shares of FNB Common
Stock subject to each such Promistar Option shall be equal to the number of
shares of Promistar Common Stock subject to each such Promistar Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, and
(iv) the per share exercise price under each such Promistar Option will be
adjusted by dividing the per share exercise price under each such Promistar
Option by the Exchange Ratio and rounding up to the nearest cent.
Notwithstanding the provisions of clause (iii) of the preceding sentence, FNB
shall not be obligated to issue any fraction of a share of FNB Common Stock upon
exercise of Promistar Options and any fraction of a share of FNB Common Stock
that otherwise would be subject to a converted Promistar Option shall represent
the right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of such fraction and
the difference between the market value of one share of FNB Common Stock on the
date of exercise and the per share exercise price of such Option. Promistar and
FNB agree to take all necessary steps to effectuate the foregoing provisions of
this Section 3.5.

         (b)      As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, FNB shall
deliver to the participants in each Promistar Stock Plan an appropriate notice
setting forth such participant's rights pursuant thereto and the grants pursuant
to such Promistar Stock Plan shall continue in effect on the same terms and
conditions (subject to the adjustments required by Section 3.5(a) of this
Agreement after giving effect to the Merger), and FNB shall comply with the
terms of each Promistar Stock Plan to ensure, to the extent required by, and
subject to the provisions of, such Promistar Stock Plan, that Promistar Options
which qualified as incentive stock options prior to the Effective Time continue
to qualify as incentive stock options after the Effective Time. At or prior to
the Effective Time, FNB shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for
issuance sufficient shares of FNB Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of
Promistar Options assumed by it in accordance with this Section 3.5. As soon as
practicable after the Effective Time, FNB shall file a registration statement on
Form S-3 or Form S-8, as the case may be (or any successor or other appropriate
forms), with respect to the shares of FNB Common Stock subject to such Promistar
Options and shall use its reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of
such registration statement (and maintain the current status of the prospectus
or the prospectuses contained therein), for so long as such options remain
outstanding. With respect to individuals who subsequent to the Merger will be
subject to the reporting requirements under Section 16(a) of the 1934 Act, where
applicable, FNB shall administer the Promistar Stock Plan assumed pursuant to
this Section 3.5 in a manner which complies with Rule 16b-3 promulgated under
the 1934 Act to the extent the Promistar Stock Plan complied with such Rule
prior to the Merger.

         (c)      All restrictions or limitations on transfer with respect to
the Promistar Common Stock awarded under the Promistar Stock Plan or any other
plan, program, or arrangement of Promistar, to the extent that such restrictions
or limitations shall not have already lapsed, and except as otherwise expressly
provided in such plan, program, or arrangement, shall remain in full force and
effect.

                               EXCHANGE OF SHARES

         4.1      Exchange Procedures. At the Effective Time, FNB shall deposit,
or shall cause to be deposited, with First National Bank of Florida, a wholly
owned subsidiary of FNB (the "Exchange Agent") certificates evidencing shares of
FNB Common Stock and cash in such amounts necessary to


                                       4
<PAGE>   10

provide all consideration required to be exchanged by FNB for shares of
Promistar Common Stock pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Promptly after
the Effective Time, FNB shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to the former
shareholders of Promistar appropriate transmittal materials (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates
theretofore representing shares of Promistar Common Stock shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of such certificates to the Exchange Agent). After the Effective
Time, each holder of shares of Promistar Common Stock (other than shares to be
canceled pursuant to Section 3.3 of this Agreement) issued and outstanding at
the Effective Time shall surrender the certificate or certificates representing
such shares to the Exchange Agent and shall upon surrender thereof promptly
receive in exchange therefor the consideration provided in Section 3.1 of this
Agreement, together with all declared but undelivered dividends or distributions
in respect of such shares (without interest thereon) pursuant to Section 4.2 of
this Agreement. To the extent required by Section 3.4 of this Agreement, each
holder of Promistar Common Stock issued and outstanding at the Effective Time
also shall receive, upon surrender of the certificate or certificates
representing such shares, cash in lieu of any fractional share of FNB Common
Stock to which such holder may be otherwise entitled (without interest). FNB
shall not be obligated to deliver the consideration to which any former holder
of Promistar Common Stock is entitled as a result of the Merger until such
holder surrenders such holder's certificate or certificates representing the
shares of Promistar Common Stock for exchange as provided in this Section 4.1.
The certificate or certificates of shares of Promistar Common Stock so
surrendered shall be duly endorsed as the Exchange Agent may require. Any other
provision of this Agreement notwithstanding, neither FNB nor the Exchange Agent
shall be liable to a holder of Promistar Common Stock for any amounts paid or
property delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property Law. In the event any certificate representing shares of
Promistar Common Stock shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed, and, if required by FNB, the posting by such
person of a bond in such reasonable amount as FNB may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such certificate,
FNB shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate the
shares of FNB Common Stock deliverable in respect thereof determined in
accordance with this Agreement.

         4.2      Rights of Former Promistar Shareholders. The stock transfer
books of Promistar shall be closed as to holders of Promistar Common Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time and no transfers of Promistar Common
Stock by any such holder shall thereafter be made or recognized. Until
surrendered for exchange in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.1 of
this Agreement, each certificate theretofore representing Promistar Common Stock
(other than shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 3.3 of this Agreement)
shall from and after the Effective Time represent for all purposes only the
right to receive the consideration provided in Sections 3.1 and 3.4 of this
Agreement in exchange therefor, subject, however, to FNB's obligation to pay any
dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the
Effective Time which have been declared or made by Promistar in respect of such
Promistar Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and which
remain unpaid at the Effective Time. Until 90 days after the Effective Time,
former shareholders of record of Promistar shall be entitled to vote at any
meeting of FNB stockholders the number of shares of FNB Common Stock into which
their respective shares of Promistar Common Stock are converted, regardless of
whether such holders have exchanged their certificates representing Promistar
Common Stock for certificates representing FNB Common Stock in accordance with
the provisions of this Agreement. Whenever a dividend or other distribution is
declared by FNB on the FNB Common Stock, the record date for which is at or
after the Effective Time, the declaration shall include dividends or other
distributions on all shares issuable pursuant to this Agreement, but beginning
30 days after the Effective Time no dividend or other distribution payable to
the holders of record of FNB Common Stock as of any time subsequent to the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the holder of any certificate representing
shares of Promistar Common Stock issued and outstanding at the Effective Time
until such holder surrenders such certificate for exchange as provided in
Section 4.1 of this Agreement. However, upon surrender of such Promistar


                                       5
<PAGE>   11

Common Stock certificate, both the FNB Common Stock certificate (together with
all such undelivered dividends or other distributions without interest) and any
undelivered dividends and cash payments to be paid for fractional share
interests (without interest) shall be delivered and paid with respect to each
share represented by such certificate. Any portion of the consideration
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) which had been made
available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 4.1 of this Agreement that
remains unclaimed by the shareholders of Promistar for 12 months after the
Effective Time shall be paid to FNB. Any shareholders of Promistar who have not
theretofore complied with this Article 4 shall thereafter look only to FNB
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar laws) and only as general
creditors thereof for payment of their shares of FNB Common Stock, cash in lieu
of fractional shares, and unpaid dividends and distributions on the FNB Common
Stock deliverable in respect of each Promistar Common Share such shareholder
holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any
interest thereon.

                                    ARTICLE 5
                   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PROMISTAR

         Promistar hereby represents and warrants to FNB as follows:

         5.1      Organization, Standing, and Power. Promistar is a corporation
duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the laws of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and has the corporate power and authority to carry
on its business as now conducted and to own, lease and operate its material
Assets. Promistar is duly qualified or licensed to transact business as a
foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the
character of its Assets or the nature or conduct of its business requires it to
be so qualified or licensed, except for such jurisdictions in which the failure
to be so qualified or licensed is not reasonably likely to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Promistar.

         5.2      Authority; No Breach by Agreement.

         (a)      Promistar has the corporate power and authority necessary to
execute and deliver this Agreement and, subject to the approval and adoption of
this Agreement by the shareholders of Promistar, to perform its obligations
under this Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Promistar and the
consummation by Promistar of the transactions contemplated herein, including the
Merger, have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action
in respect thereof on the part of Promistar, subject to the approval of this
Agreement by its shareholders as contemplated by Section 8.1 of this Agreement.
Subject to such requisite shareholder approval (and assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery by FNB) and to such Consents of Regulatory Authorities as
required by applicable law, this Agreement represents a legal, valid and binding
obligation of Promistar, enforceable against Promistar in accordance with its
terms (except in all cases as such enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally and except that the availability of
the equitable remedy of specific performance or injunctive relief is subject to
the discretion of the court before which any proceeding may be brought).

         (b)      Except as set forth in Section 5.2(b) of the Promistar
Disclosure Memorandum, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Promistar, nor the consummation by Promistar of the transactions contemplated
hereby, nor compliance by Promistar with any of the provisions hereof, will (i)
conflict with or result in a breach of any provision of Promistar's Articles of
Incorporation or Bylaws, or, (ii) constitute or result in a Default under, or
require any Consent pursuant to, or result in the creation of any Lien on any
Asset of any Promistar Company under, any Contract or Permit of any Promistar
Company, where such Default or Lien, or any failure to obtain such Consent, is
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on Promistar, or (iii)


                                       6
<PAGE>   12

subject to receipt of the requisite Consents referred to in Section 9.1(a), (b)
and (c) of this Agreement, violate any Order, or, to its Knowledge, any Law
applicable to any Promistar Company or any of their respective material Assets
which will have a Material Adverse Effect on Promistar.

         (c)      Other than in connection or compliance with the provisions of
the Securities Laws, applicable state corporate and securities Laws, and rules
of Nasdaq, and other than Consents required from Regulatory Authorities, and
other than notices to or filings with the Internal Revenue Service or the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation with respect to any employee benefit plans,
or under the HSR Act, and other than Consents, filings, or notifications which,
if not obtained or made, are not reasonably likely to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Promistar, no notice to, filing
with, or Consent of, any public body or authority is necessary for the
consummation by Promistar of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
in this Agreement.

         5.3      Capital Stock.

         (a)      The authorized capital stock of Promistar consists of (i)
25,000,000 shares of Promistar Common Stock, of which 14,953,921 shares are
issued and outstanding as of the date of this Agreement, and (ii) 2,000,000
shares of preferred stock, no par value per share, none of which are outstanding
as of the date of this Agreement. All of the issued and outstanding shares of
capital stock of Promistar are duly and validly issued and outstanding and are
fully paid and nonassessable under the PBCL. None of the outstanding shares of
capital stock of Promistar has been issued in violation of any preemptive
rights. Promistar has reserved 1,260,000 shares of Promistar Common Stock for
issuance under the Promistar Stock Plans, pursuant to which, as of the date of
this Agreement, options and warrants to purchase not more than 748,500 shares of
Promistar Common Stock are outstanding.

         (b)      Except as set forth in Section 5.3(a) of this Agreement, as
provided pursuant to the Stock Option Agreement, or as set forth in Section
5.3(b) to the Promistar Disclosure Memorandum, there are no shares of capital
stock or other equity securities of Promistar outstanding and no outstanding
Rights relating to the capital stock of Promistar.

         5.4      Promistar Subsidiaries. Except as disclosed in Section 5.4 of
the Promistar Disclosure Memorandum, the list of Subsidiaries of Promistar filed
by Promistar as Exhibit 21.1 to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2000, is a true and complete list of all of the
Promistar Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement. Except as disclosed in
Section 5.4 of the Promistar Disclosure Memorandum, Promistar or one of its
Subsidiaries owns all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of
each Promistar Subsidiary. No equity securities of any Promistar Subsidiary are
or may become required to be issued (other than to another Promistar Company) by
reason of any Rights, and there are no Contracts by which any Promistar
Subsidiary is bound to issue (other than to another Promistar Company)
additional shares of its capital stock or Rights or by which any Promistar
Company is or may be bound to transfer any shares of the capital stock of any
Promistar Subsidiary (other than to another Promistar Company). There are no
Contracts relating to the rights of any Promistar Company to vote or to dispose
of any shares of the capital stock of any Promistar Subsidiary. All of the
shares of capital stock of each Promistar Subsidiary held by a Promistar Company
are fully paid and nonassessable under the applicable corporation Law of the
jurisdiction in which such Subsidiary is incorporated or organized (except, in
the case of Subsidiaries that are national banks, for the assessment
contemplated by 12 U.S.C. ss. 55), and are owned by such Promistar Company free
and clear of any Lien. Each Promistar Subsidiary is either a bank or a
corporation, and is duly organized, validly existing and (as to corporations) in
good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction in which it is incorporated or
organized, and has the corporate power and authority necessary for it to own,
lease and operate its Assets and to carry on its business as now conducted. Each
Promistar Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed to transact business as a
foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the
character


                                       7
<PAGE>   13

of its Assets or the nature or conduct of its business requires it to be so
qualified or licensed, except for such jurisdictions in which the failure to be
so qualified or licensed is not reasonably likely to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Promistar. Each Promistar Subsidiary
that is a depository institution is an "insured institution" as defined in the
Federal Deposit Insurance Act and applicable regulations thereunder.

         5.5      SEC Filings; Financial Statements.

         (a)      Promistar has filed and made available to FNB accurate and
complete copies of all forms, reports and documents required to be filed by
Promistar with the SEC since January 1, 1996 (collectively, the "Promistar SEC
Reports"). The Promistar SEC Reports (i) at the time filed, complied in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the 1933 Act and the 1934
Act, as the case may be, and (ii) did not at the time they were filed (or if
amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then on
the date of such filing) contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact required to be stated in such Promistar SEC Reports or
necessary in order to make the statements in such Promistar SEC Reports, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Except
for Promistar Subsidiaries that are registered as brokers, dealers, investment
advisers or associated persons thereof, none of the Promistar Subsidiaries is
required to file any forms, reports or other documents with the SEC.

         (b)      Each of the Promistar Financial Statements (including, in each
case, any related notes) contained in the Promistar SEC Reports, including any
Promistar SEC Reports filed after the date of this Agreement until the Effective
Time, complied, and each Promistar SEC Report filed after the date of this
Agreement until the Effective Time will comply, as to form in all material
respects with the applicable published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto, was or will be prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as may be indicated in
the notes to such financial statements or, in the case of unaudited statements,
as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC), and fairly presented the consolidated
financial position of Promistar and its Subsidiaries at the respective dates and
the consolidated results of its operations and cash flows for the periods
indicated, except that the unaudited interim financial statements were or are
subject to normal and recurring adjustments which were not or are not expected
to be material in amount.

         5.6      Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Since March 31, 2001,
(i) there have been no events, changes or occurrences which have had, or are
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on Promistar, and (ii) the Promistar Companies have not taken any action,
or failed to take any action, prior to the date of this Agreement, which action
or failure, if taken after the date of this Agreement, would represent or result
in a material breach or violation of any of the covenants and agreements of
Promistar provided in Articles 7 or 8 of this Agreement.

         5.7      Tax Matters.

         (a)      All Tax Returns required to be filed by or on behalf of any of
the Promistar Companies have been timely filed or requests for extensions have
been timely filed, granted, and have not expired for periods ended on or before
December 31, 2000, and on or before the date of the most recent fiscal year end
immediately preceding the Effective Time, except to the extent that all such
failures to file, taken together, are not reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Promistar, and all Tax Returns filed are complete and accurate
in all material respects. All Taxes shown on filed Tax Returns have been paid.
There is no audit examination, deficiency, or refund Litigation with respect to
any Taxes that is reasonably likely to result in a determination that would
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Promistar,
except as reserved against in the Promistar Financial Statements delivered


                                       8
<PAGE>   14

prior to the date of this Agreement. All Taxes and other liabilities due with
respect to completed and settled examinations or concluded Litigation have been
paid.

         (b)      Adequate provision for any Taxes due or, to the Knowledge of
Promistar, to become due for any of the Promistar Companies for the period or
periods through and including the date of the respective Promistar Financial
Statements has been made and is reflected on such Promistar Financial
Statements.

         (c)      Deferred Taxes of the Promistar Companies have been adequately
provided for in the Promistar Financial Statements.

         (d)      To the Knowledge of Promistar, each of the Promistar Companies
is in compliance with, and its records contain all information and documents
(including properly completed Internal Revenue Service Forms W-9) necessary to
comply with, all applicable information reporting and Tax withholding
requirements under federal, state and local Tax Laws, and such records identify
with specificity all accounts subject to backup withholding under Section 3406
of the Internal Revenue Code, except for such instances of noncompliance and
such omissions as are not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Promistar.

         5.8      Compliance With Laws. Promistar is duly registered as a bank
holding company under the BHC Act. Each Promistar Company has in effect all
Permits necessary for it to own, lease, or operate its material Assets and to
carry on its business as now conducted, except for those Permits the absence of
which are not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Promistar. None of the Promistar Companies is
presently in Default under or in violation of any such Permit, other than
Defaults which are not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Promistar. Except as set forth in
Section 5.8 of the Promistar Disclosure Memorandum, no Promistar Company:

         (i)      is in violation of any Laws, Orders, or Permits applicable to
its business or employees conducting its business, except for violations which
are not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Promistar; or

         (ii)     has received any notification or communication from any agency
or department of federal, state, or local government or any Regulatory Authority
or the staff thereof (i) asserting that any Promistar Company is not in
compliance with any of the Laws or Orders which such governmental authority or
Regulatory Authority enforces, where such noncompliance is reasonably likely to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Promistar,
(ii) threatening to revoke any Permits, the revocation of which is reasonably
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
Promistar, or (iii) requiring any Promistar Company to enter into or consent to
the issuance of a cease and desist order, formal agreement, directive,
commitment, or memorandum of understanding, or to adopt any board resolution or
similar undertaking, which restricts materially the conduct of its business, or
in any manner relates to its capital adequacy, its credit or reserve policies,
its management or the payment of dividends.

         5.9      Assets. Except as disclosed in Section 5.9 of the Promistar
Disclosure Memorandum, the Promistar Companies have good and marketable title,
free and clear of all Liens (except for those Liens which are not likely to have
a Material Adverse Effect on Promistar or its Subsidiaries taken as a whole), to
all of their respective Assets. All material tangible properties used in the
businesses of the Promistar Companies are in good condition, reasonable wear and
tear excepted, and are usable in the ordinary course of business consistent with
Promistar's past practices. All Assets which are material to Promistar's
business on a consolidated basis, held under leases or subleases by any of the
Promistar


                                       9
<PAGE>   15

Companies, are held under valid Contracts enforceable in accordance with their
respective terms (except as enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or other Laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally and except that the availability of
the equitable remedy of specific performance or injunctive relief is subject to
the discretion of the court before which any proceedings may be brought), and
each such Contract is in full force and effect. The Promistar Companies
currently maintain insurance in amounts, scope, and coverage as disclosed in
Section 5.9 of the Promistar Disclosure Memorandum. None of the Promistar
Companies has received written notice from any insurance carrier that (i) such
insurance will be canceled or that coverage thereunder will be reduced or
eliminated, or (ii) premium costs with respect to such policies of insurance
will be substantially increased. Except as disclosed in Section 5.9 of the
Promistar Disclosure Memorandum, to the Knowledge of Promistar there are
presently no occurrences giving rise to a claim under such policies of insurance
and no notices have been given by any Promistar Company under such policies.

         5.10     Legal Proceedings. There is no Litigation instituted or
pending, or, to the Knowledge of Promistar, threatened against any Promistar
Company, or against any Asset, employee benefit plan, interest, or right of any
of them, that is reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Promistar, nor are there any Orders of any Regulatory
Authorities, other governmental authorities, or arbitrators outstanding against
any Promistar Company, that are reasonably likely to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Promistar.

         5.11     Reports. Since January 1, 1996, or the date of organization if
later, each Promistar Company has filed all reports and statements, together
with any amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that it was
required to file with Regulatory Authorities (except, in the case of state
securities authorities, failures to file which are not reasonably likely to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Promistar).
As of its respective date, each such report and document, including the
financial statements, exhibits, and schedules thereto, (i) complied in all
material respects with all applicable Laws, and (ii) did not, in all material
respects, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, which untrue statement of material fact or omission to state a
material fact is likely to have, individually, or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Promistar.

         5.12     Statements True and Correct. None of the information supplied
or to be supplied by any Promistar Company or any Affiliate thereof for
inclusion in the Registration Statement will, when the Registration Statement
becomes effective, be false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or
omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by any Promistar
Company or any Affiliate thereof for inclusion in the Joint Proxy Statement or
any other documents to be filed by Promistar or FNB with the SEC or any other
Regulatory Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
will, at the respective time such documents are filed, and with respect to the
Joint Proxy Statement, when first mailed to the shareholders of FNB or
Promistar, be false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or, in the case of
the Joint Proxy Statement or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, at the
time of the FNB Shareholders' Meeting or the Promistar Shareholders' Meeting, be
false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or omit to state any
material fact necessary to correct any statement in any earlier communication
with respect to the solicitation of any proxy for the FNB Shareholders' Meeting
or the Promistar Shareholders' Meeting. All documents that any Promistar Company
or any Affiliate thereof is responsible for filing with any Regulatory Authority
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby will comply as to form
in all material respects with the provisions of applicable Law.

<PAGE>   16

         5.13     Accounting, Tax and Regulatory Matters. No Promistar Company
or any Affiliate thereof has taken or agreed to take any action or has any
Knowledge of any fact or circumstance that is reasonably likely to (i) prevent
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, from qualifying for
pooling-of-interests accounting treatment or as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a)(2)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code, or (ii) materially
impede or delay receipt of any Consents of Regulatory Authorities referred to in
Section 9.1(b) of this Agreement or result in the imposition of a condition or
restriction of the type referred to in the last sentence of such Section.

         5.14     Environmental Matters.

         (a)      To the Knowledge of Promistar, except as disclosed in Section
5.14 of the Promistar Disclosure Memorandum, each Promistar Company, its
Participation Facilities, and its Loan Properties are, and have been, in
compliance with all Environmental Laws, except for violations which are not
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on Promistar.

         (b)      Except as disclosed in Section 5.14 of the Promistar
Disclosure Memorandum, there is no Litigation pending, or, to the Knowledge of
Promistar, threatened before any court, governmental agency, or authority or
other forum in which any Promistar Company or any of its Loan Properties or
Participation Facilities (or any Promistar Company in respect of any such Loan
Property or Participation Facility) has been or, with respect to threatened
Litigation, may be named as a defendant or potentially responsible party (i) for
alleged noncompliance (including by any predecessor) with any Environmental Law
or (ii) relating to the release into the environment of any Hazardous Material,
whether or not occurring at, on, under, or involving any of its Loan Properties
or Participation Facilities, except for such Litigation pending or threatened
that is not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Promistar.

         (c)      To the Knowledge of Promistar, except as disclosed in Section
5.14 of the Promistar Disclosure Memorandum, there is no reasonable basis for
any Litigation of a type described above in Section 5.14(b), except such as is
not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Promistar.

         (d)      To the Knowledge of Promistar, except as disclosed in Section
5.14 of the Promistar Disclosure Memorandum, during the period of (i)
Promistar's or any of its Subsidiaries' ownership or operation of any of their
respective properties, (ii) Promistar's or any of its Subsidiaries'
participation in the management of any Participation Facility, or (iii)
Promistar's or any of its Subsidiaries' holding a security interest in a Loan
Property, there has been no release of Hazardous Material in, on, under, or
affecting any Participation Facility or Loan Property of a Promistar Company,
except such as are not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Promistar.

         5.15     Outstanding FNB Common Stock. As of the date of this
Agreement, Promistar Companies do not beneficially own any shares of FNB Common
Stock for their own accounts (not including those held in a fiduciary or trust
capacity for, or on behalf of, unaffiliated third parties). During the term of
this Agreement, no Promistar Company shall purchase or otherwise acquire
beneficial ownership of any FNB Common Stock except pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement.

         5.16     Material Contracts. Except as set forth in the Promistar SEC
Reports or in Section 5.16 of the Promistar Disclosure Memorandum, no Promistar
Company is a party to or bound by any "material contract" as such term is
defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC (each such contract a
"Promistar Contract"). With respect to each Promistar Contract and except as
disclosed in Section 5.16 of the Promistar Disclosure Memorandum: (i) such
Promistar Contract is in full force and effect; (ii) no Promistar Company is in
Default thereunder; (iii) no


                                       11
<PAGE>   17

Promistar Company has repudiated or waived any material provision of any such
Promistar Contract; and (iv) no other party to any such Contract is, to the
Knowledge of Promistar, in Default in any respect or has repudiated or waived
any material provision thereunder.

         5.17     Employee Benefit Plans.

         (a)      Promistar has disclosed in Section 5.17 of the Promistar
Disclosure Memorandum, and has delivered or made available to FNB prior to the
execution of this Agreement copies in each case of: (i) all pension, retirement,
profit-sharing, deferred compensation, stock option, employee stock ownership,
severance pay, vacation, bonus, or other incentive plan, all other written
employee programs, arrangements, or agreements, all medical, vision, dental, or
other health plans, all life insurance plans, and all other employee benefit
plans or fringe benefit plans, including, without limitation, "employee benefit
plans" (as that term is defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA), currently adopted,
maintained by, sponsored in whole or in part by, or contributed to by any
Promistar Company or ERISA Affiliate (as defined below) thereof for the benefit
of employees, retirees, dependents, spouses, directors, independent contractors,
or other beneficiaries and under which employees, retirees, dependents, spouses,
directors, independent contractors, or other beneficiaries are eligible to
participate (collectively, the "Promistar Benefit Plans"); (ii) all insurance
contracts, annuity contracts and other funding vehicles relating to the
Promistar Benefit Plans; (iii) all material agreements entered into with service
providers in connection with the Promistar Benefit Plans; and (iv) summary plan
descriptions, favorable Internal Revenue Service determination letters for each
Promistar ERISA Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code and the most recently available Form 5500 annual reports,
certified financial statement and actuarial reports for the Promistar Benefit
Plans. Any of the Promistar Benefit Plans which is an "employee pension benefit
plan" (as that term is defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA), is referred to herein
as a "Promistar ERISA Plan." Each Promistar ERISA Plan which is also a "defined
benefit plan" (as defined in Section 4140 of the Internal Revenue Code) is
referred to herein as a "Promistar Pension Plan." No Promistar Pension Plan is
or has been a multiemployer plan within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA.
No Promistar Benefit Plan is a multiple employer plan within the meaning of
Section 413(c) of the Internal Revenue Code or is a multiple employer welfare
arrangement within the meaning of Section 3(40) of ERISA. Since the date the
foregoing documents were delivered or made available to FNB, no amendments to
any Promistar Benefit Plan have been made or will be made prior to the Closing
Date. Except as disclosed in Section 5.17 of the Promistar Disclosure
Memorandum, Promistar does not maintain any unwritten Promistar Benefit Plans.
No Promistar Company nor any ERISA Affiliate is a party to a collective
bargaining agreement. Promistar has disclosed in Section 5.17 of the Promistar
Disclosure Memorandum a complete and accurate list of (A) each ERISA Affiliate,
and (B) each Promistar ERISA Plan that has not been adopted by each ERISA
Affiliate that maintains a separate payroll.

         (b)      Except as disclosed in Section 5.17 of the Promistar
Disclosure Memorandum, all Promistar Benefit Plans are in compliance with the
applicable terms of ERISA, the Internal Revenue Code, COBRA (as defined below)
and any other applicable Laws the breach or violation of which are reasonably
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
Promistar, and each Promistar ERISA Plan which is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code has received a favorable
determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service, and Promistar is not
aware of any circumstances likely to result in revocation of any such favorable
determination letter. Except as disclosed in Section 5.17 of the Promistar
Disclosure Memorandum, to the Knowledge of Promistar, no Promistar Company nor
any ERISA Affiliate has any liability to the Internal Revenue Service with
respect to any Promistar Benefit Plan, including any liability imposed by
Chapter 43 of the Internal Revenue Code, and no Promistar Company has engaged in
a transaction with respect to any Promistar Benefit Plan that, assuming the
taxable period of such transaction expired as of the date hereof, would subject
any Promistar Company to a Tax imposed by either Section 4975 of the Internal


                                       12
<PAGE>   18

Revenue Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA in amounts which are reasonably likely
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
Promistar.

         (c)      Except as disclosed in Section 5.17 of the Promistar
Disclosure Memorandum, no Promistar Pension Plan has any "unfunded current
liability" (as that term is defined in Section 302(d)(8)(A) of ERISA) and the
fair market value of the assets of any such plan exceeds the plan's "benefit
liabilities," as that term is defined in Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA, when
determined under actuarial factors that would apply if the plan terminated in
accordance with all applicable legal requirements. Except as disclosed in
Section 5.17 of the Promistar Disclosure Memorandum, since the date of the most
recent actuarial valuation, there has been (i) no material change in the
financial position of any Promistar Pension Plan, (ii) no change in the
actuarial assumptions with respect to any Promistar Pension Plan, and (iii) no
increase in benefits under any Promistar Pension Plan as a result of plan
amendments or changes in applicable Law which is reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Promistar or
materially adversely affect the funding status of any such plan. Neither any
Promistar Pension Plan nor any "single-employer plan," within the meaning of
Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or formerly maintained by any Promistar
Company, or the single-employer plan of any entity which is considered one
employer with Promistar under Section 4001 of ERISA or Section 414 of the
Internal Revenue Code or Section 302 of ERISA (whether or not waived) (an "ERISA
Affiliate") has an "accumulated funding deficiency" within the meaning of
Section 412 of the Internal Revenue Code or Section 302 of ERISA, which is
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Promistar. No Promistar
Company has provided, or is required to provide, security to a Promistar Pension
Plan or to any single-employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate pursuant to Section
401(a)(29) of the Internal Revenue Code.

         (d)      Within the six-year period preceding the Effective Time, no
liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of ERISA has been or is expected to
be incurred by any Promistar Company with respect to any ongoing, frozen, or
terminated single-employer plan or the single-employer plan of any ERISA
Affiliate, which liability is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Promistar. No Promistar Company has incurred any withdrawal liability
with respect to a multiemployer plan under Subtitle B of Title IV of ERISA
(regardless of whether based on contributions of an ERISA Affiliate), which
liability is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Promistar.
No notice of a "reportable event," within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA
for which the 30-day reporting requirement has not been waived, has been
required to be filed for any Promistar Pension Plan or by any ERISA Affiliate
within the 12-month period ending on the date hereof. No Promistar Company nor
ERISA Affiliate has filed a notice of intent to terminate any ERISA Pension Plan
or has adopted any amendment to treat such Plan as terminated. The Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation has not instituted proceedings to treat any ERISA
Pension Plan as terminated. No event has occurred or circumstance exists that
may constitute grounds under Section 4042 of ERISA for the termination of, or
appointment of a trustee to administer, any Promistar Pension Plan.

         (e)      Except as disclosed in Section 5.17 of the Promistar
Disclosure Memorandum, no Promistar Company has any liability for retiree health
and life benefits under any of the Promistar Benefit Plans other than health
continuation coverage required by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act of 1985 as amended and Sections 601 through 608 of ERISA ("COBRA") or by any
similar state law, and there are no restrictions on the rights of such Promistar
Company to amend or terminate any such plan without incurring any liability
thereunder, which liability is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Promistar. There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of Promistar,
threatened complaint, claim (other than a routine claim for benefits submitted
by participants or beneficiaries), proceeding, audit or investigation of any
kind in or before any court, tribunal, or governmental agency with respect to
any Promistar Benefit Plan.


                                       13
<PAGE>   19

         (f)      Except as disclosed in Section 5.17 of the Promistar
Disclosure Memorandum, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (i) result in any
payment (including severance, unemployment compensation, golden parachute, or
otherwise) becoming due to any director or any employee of any Promistar Company
from any Promistar Company under any Promistar Benefit Plan or otherwise, (ii)
increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Promistar Benefit Plan, or
(iii) result in any acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such
benefit, where such payment, increase, or acceleration is reasonably likely to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Promistar.

         (g)      The actuarial present values of all accrued deferred
compensation entitlements (including entitlements under any executive
compensation, supplemental retirement, or employment agreement) of employees and
former employees of any Promistar Company and their respective beneficiaries,
other than entitlements accrued pursuant to funded retirement plans subject to
the provisions of Section 412 of the Internal Revenue Code or Section 302 of
ERISA, have been fully reflected on the Promistar Financial Statements to the
extent required by and in accordance with GAAP.

         (h)      Except as disclosed in Section 5.17(h) of the Promistar
Disclosure Memorandum, all contributions and payments made or accrued with
respect to all Promistar Benefit Plans are deductible under Sections 404 or 162
of the Internal Revenue Code and, if not made, are properly reflected on the
financial statements of the Promistar Companies and ERISA Affiliates. No event
has occurred or circumstance exists that could result in an increase in premium
costs of insured or self-insured Promistar Benefit Plans that would have a
Material Adverse Effect on Promistar. Levels of insurance reserves, trust
funding and accrued liabilities with respect to all ERISA Benefit Plans (to
which such reserves or liabilities do or should apply) are reasonable and
sufficient to provide for all incurred but unreported claims and any retroactive
or prospective premium adjustments.

         5.18     State Takeover Laws. Promistar has taken all action required
to be taken by it in order to exempt this Agreement and the Stock Option
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby from, and the
Agreement and the Stock Option Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby are exempt from the requirements of any "moratorium,"
"control share," "fair price" or other anti-takeover Laws of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania.

         5.19     Opinion of Financial Advisor. Promistar has received the
written opinion of Keefe, Bruyette and Woods, Inc., its financial advisor, to
the effect that, as of the date hereof, the consideration to be received by the
Promistar shareholders, based upon and subject to the limitations set forth in
such opinion, is fair to the Promistar shareholders from a financial point of
view.

                                    ARTICLE 6
                      REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF FNB

         FNB hereby represents and warrants to Promistar as follows:

         6.1      Organization, Standing, and Power. FNB is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing, and in active status under the laws of the State of
Florida, and has the corporate power and authority to carry on its business as
now conducted and to own, lease and operate its material Assets. FNB is duly
qualified or licensed to transact business as a foreign corporation and is in
good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of its Assets or the
nature or conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified or licensed,

licensed is not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on FNB.


                                       14
<PAGE>   20

         6.2      Authority; No Breach By Agreement.

         (a)      FNB has the corporate power and authority necessary to execute
and deliver this Agreement and, subject to the approval and adoption of this
Agreement by the shareholders of FNB and to such Consents of Regulatory
Authorities as required under applicable law, to perform its obligations under
this Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The
execution, delivery, and performance of this Agreement by FNB and the
consummation by FNB of the transactions contemplated herein, including the
Merger, have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action
in respect thereof on the part of FNB, subject to the approval of this Agreement
by its shareholders as contemplated by Section 8.1 of this Agreement. Subject to
such requisite shareholder approval (and assuming due authorization, execution
and delivery by Promistar) and to such Consents of Regulatory Authorities as
required by applicable law, this Agreement represents a legal, valid, and
binding obligation of FNB, enforceable against FNB in accordance with its terms
(except in all cases as such enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally and except that the availability of
the equitable remedy of specific performance or injunctive relief is subject to
the discretion of the court before which any proceeding may be brought).

         (b)      Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by FNB,
nor the consummation by FNB of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor
compliance by FNB with any of the provisions hereof, will (i) conflict with or
result in a breach of any provision of FNB's Articles of Incorporation or
Bylaws, or, (ii) constitute or result in a Default under, or require any Consent
pursuant to, or result in the creation of any Lien on any Asset of any FNB
Company under, any Contract or Permit of any FNB Company, where such Default or
Lien, or any failure to obtain such Consent, is reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on FNB, or, (iii)
subject to receipt of the requisite Consents referred to in Section 9.1(a), (b)
and (c) of this Agreement, violate any Order, or to its Knowledge, any Law
applicable to any FNB Company or any of their respective material Assets which
will have a Material Adverse Effect on FNB.

         (c)      Other than in connection or compliance with the provisions of
the Securities Laws, applicable state corporate and securities Laws, and rules
of Nasdaq, and other than Consents required from Regulatory Authorities, and
other than notices to or filings with the Internal Revenue Service or the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation with respect to any employee benefit plans,
or under the HSR Act, and other than Consents, filings, or notifications which,
if not obtained or made, are not reasonably likely to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on FNB, no notice to, filing with, or
Consent of, any public body or authority is necessary for the consummation by
FNB of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated in this Agreement.

         6.3      Capital Stock. The authorized capital stock of FNB consists of
(i) 100,000,000 shares of FNB Common Stock, of which 25,556,384 shares were
issued and outstanding as of the date of this Agreement and (ii) 20,000,000
shares of FNB Preferred Stock, of which 163,667 shares were issued and
outstanding as of the date of this Agreement ("FNB Capital Stock"). All of the
issued and outstanding shares of FNB Capital Stock are, and all of the FNB
Common Stock to be issued in exchange for Promistar Common Stock upon
consummation of the Merger will be authorized and reserved for issuance prior to
the Effective Time and, when issued in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, will be, duly and validly issued and outstanding and fully paid and
nonassessable under the FBCA. None of the outstanding shares of FNB Capital
Stock has been, and none of the shares of FNB Common Stock to be issued in
exchange for shares of Promistar Common Stock upon consummation of the Merger
will be, issued in violation of any preemptive rights of the current or past
shareholders of FNB.

         6.4      FNB Subsidiaries. Except as disclosed in Section 6.4 of the
FNB Disclosure Memorandum, the list of Subsidiaries of FNB filed by FNB with its
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000, is a
true and complete list of all of the FNB Subsidiaries as of the date of this
Agreement. Except as disclosed in Section 6.4 of the FNB Disclosure Memorandum,
FNB or one of its Subsidiaries owns all of the issued and outstanding shares of
capital stock of each FNB Subsidiary. No equity securities of any FNB Subsidiary
are or may become required to be issued (other than to another FNB Company) by
reason of any Rights, and there are no Contracts by which any FNB Subsidiary is
bound to issue (other than to another FNB Company) additional shares of its
capital stock or Rights or by which any FNB Company is or may be bound to
transfer any shares of the capital stock of any FNB Subsidiary (other than to
another FNB Company). There are no Contracts relating to the rights of any FNB
Company to vote or to dispose of any shares of the capital stock of any FNB
Subsidiary. All of the shares of capital stock of each FNB Subsidiary held by a
FNB Company are fully paid and nonassessable under the applicable corporation
Law of the jurisdiction in which such Subsidiary is incorporated or organized
(except, in the case of Subsidiaries that are national banks, for the assessment
contemplated by 12 U.S.C. ss. 55), and are owned by the FNB Company free and
clear of any Lien. Each FNB Subsidiary is either a bank, a corporation or a
limited liability company, and is duly organized, validly existing, and (as to
corporations) in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction in which it is
incorporated or organized, and has the corporate power and authority necessary
for it to own, lease, and operate its Assets and to carry on its business as now
conducted. Each FNB Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed to transact
business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction
where the character of its Assets or the nature or conduct of its business
requires it to be so qualified or licensed, except for such jurisdictions in
which the failure to be so qualified or licensed is not reasonably likely to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on FNB. Each
FNB Subsidiary that is a depository institution is an "insured institution" as
defined in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and applicable regulations
thereunder.

         6.5      SEC Filings; Financial Statements.

         (a)      FNB has filed and made available to Promistar accurate and
complete copies of all forms, reports, and documents required to be filed by FNB
with the SEC since January 1, 1996 (collectively, the "FNB SEC Reports"). The
FNB SEC Reports (i) at the time filed, complied in all material respects with
the applicable requirements of the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act, as the case may
be, and (ii) did not at the time they were filed (or if amended or superseded by
a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then on the date of such filing)
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated in such FNB SEC Reports or necessary in order to make the
statements in such FNB SEC Reports, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading. Except for FNB Subsidiaries that are registered
as brokers, dealers, investment advisers, or associated persons thereof, none of
the FNB Subsidiaries is required to file any forms, reports or other documents
with the SEC.

         (b)      Each of the FNB Financial Statements (including, in each case,
any related notes) contained in the FNB SEC Reports, including any FNB SEC
Reports filed after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time,
complied, and each FNB SEC Report filed after the date of this Agreement until
the Effective Time will comply, as to form in all material respects with the
applicable published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, was
or will be prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis
throughout the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes to such
financial statements or, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by
Form 10-Q of the SEC), and fairly presented the consolidated financial position
of FNB and its Subsidiaries at the respective dates and the consolidated results
of its operations and cash flows for the periods indicated, except that the
unaudited interim financial statements were or are subject to normal and
recurring adjustments which were not or are not expected to be material in
amount.


                                       16
<PAGE>   22

         6.6      Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Since March 31, 2001,
(i) there have been no events, changes, or occurrences which have had, or are
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on FNB, and (ii) the FNB Companies have not taken any action, or failed
to take any action, prior to the date of this Agreement, which action or
failure, if taken after the date of this Agreement, would represent or result in
a material breach or violation of any of the covenants and agreements of FNB
provided in Articles 7 or 8 of this Agreement.

         6.7      Tax Matters.

         (a)      All Tax Returns required to be filed by or on behalf of any of
the FNB Companies have been timely filed or requests for extensions have been
timely filed, granted, and have not expired for periods ended on or before
December 31, 2000, and on or before the date of the most recent fiscal year end
immediately preceding the Effective Time, except to the extent that all such
failures to file, taken together, are not reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on FNB, and all Tax Returns filed are complete and accurate in
all material respects. All Taxes shown on filed Tax Returns have been paid.
There is no audit examination, deficiency, or refund Litigation with respect to
any Taxes that is reasonably likely to result in a determination that would
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on FNB, except
as reserved against in the FNB Financial Statements delivered prior to the date
of this Agreement. All Taxes and other liabilities due with respect to completed
and settled examinations or concluded Litigation have been paid.

         (b)      Adequate provision for any Taxes due or, to the knowledge of
FNB, to become due for any of the FNB Companies for the period or periods
through and including the date of the respective FNB Financial Statements has
been made and is reflected on such FNB Financial Statements.

         (c)      Deferred Taxes of the FNB Companies have been adequately
provided for in the FNB Financial Statements.

         (d)      To the Knowledge of FNB, each of the FNB Companies is in
compliance with, and its records contain all information and documents
(including properly completed Internal Revenue Service Forms W-9) necessary to
comply with, all applicable information reporting and Tax withholding
requirements under federal, state and local Tax Laws, and such records identify
with specificity all accounts subject to backup withholding under Section 3406
of the Internal Revenue Code, except for such instances of noncompliance and
such omissions as are not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on FNB.

         6.8      Compliance With Laws. FNB is duly registered as a financial
holding company under the BHC Act. Each FNB Company has in effect all Permits
necessary for it to own, lease, or operate its material Assets and to carry on
its business as now conducted, except for those Permits the absence of which are
not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on FNB. None of the FNB Companies is presently in Default under
or in violation of any such Permit, other than Defaults which are not reasonably
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
FNB. No FNB Company:

         (i)      is in violation of any Laws, Orders, or Permits applicable to
its business or employees conducting its business, except for violations which
are not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on FNB; or

         (ii)     has received any notification or communication from any agency
or department of federal, state, or local government or any Regulatory Authority
or the staff thereof (i) asserting that any FNB Company is not in compliance
with any of the Laws or Orders which such governmental authority or


                                       17
<PAGE>   23

Regulatory Authority enforces, where such noncompliance is reasonably likely to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on FNB, (ii)
threatening to revoke any Permits, the revocation of which is reasonably likely
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on FNB, or
(iii) requiring any FNB Company to enter into or consent to the issuance of a
cease and desist order, formal agreement, directive, commitment, or memorandum
of understanding, or to adopt any board resolution or similar undertaking, which
restricts materially the conduct of its business, or in any manner relates to
its capital adequacy, its credit or reserve policies, its management or the
payment of dividends.

         6.9      Assets. Except as disclosed in Section 6.9 of the FNB
Disclosure Memorandum, the FNB Companies have good and marketable title, free
and clear of all Liens (except for those Liens which are not likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect on FNB or its Subsidiaries taken as a whole), to all of
their respective Assets. All material tangible properties used in the businesses
of the FNB Companies are in good condition, reasonable wear and tear excepted,
and are usable in the ordinary course of business consistent with FNB's past
practices. All Assets which are material to FNB's business on a consolidated
basis, held under leases or subleases by any of the FNB Companies, are held
under valid Contracts enforceable in accordance with their respective terms
(except as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, or other Laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors' rights generally and except that the availability of the equitable
remedy of specific performance or injunctive relief is subject to the discretion
of the court before which any proceedings may be brought), and each such
Contract is in full force and effect. The FNB Companies currently maintain
insurance in amounts, scope, and coverage as disclosed in Section 6.9 of the FNB
Disclosure Memorandum. None of the FNB Companies has received written notice
from any insurance carrier that (i) such insurance will be canceled or that
coverage thereunder will be reduced or eliminated, or (ii) premium costs with
respect to such policies of insurance will be substantially increased. Except as
disclosed in Section 6.9 of the FNB Disclosure Memorandum, to the Knowledge of
FNB there are presently no occurrences giving rise to a claim under such
policies of insurance and no notices have been given by any FNB Company under
such policies.

         6.10     Legal Proceedings. Except as disclosed in Section 6.10 of the
FNB Disclosure Memorandum, there is no Litigation instituted or pending, or, to
the Knowledge of FNB, threatened (or unasserted but considered probable of
assertion and which if asserted would have at least a reasonable probability of
an unfavorable outcome) against any FNB Company, or against any Asset, employee
benefit plan, interest, or right of any of them, that is reasonably likely to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on FNB, nor
are there any Orders of any Regulatory Authorities, other governmental
authorities, or arbitrators outstanding against any FNB Company, that are
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on FNB.

         6.11     Reports. Since January 1, 1996, or the date of organization if
later, each FNB Company has filed all reports and statements, together with any
amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that it was required to
file with Regulatory Authorities (except, in the case of state securities
authorities, failures to file which are not reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on FNB). As of its
respective date, each such report and document, including the financial
statements, exhibits, and schedules thereto, (i) complied in all material
respects with all applicable Laws, and (ii) did not, in all material respects,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, which
untrue statement of material fact or omission to state a material fact is likely
to have, individually, or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on FNB.

         6.12     Statements True and Correct. None of the information supplied
or to be supplied by any FNB Company or any Affiliate thereof for inclusion in
the Registration Statement will, when the


                                       18
<PAGE>   24

Registration Statement becomes effective, be false or misleading with respect to
any material fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by any FNB Company or any Affiliate thereof for inclusion in the Joint
Proxy Statement or any other documents to be filed by FNB or Promistar with the
SEC or any other Regulatory Authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby will, at the respective time such documents are filed, and
with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement, when first mailed to the shareholders
of FNB or Promistar, be false or misleading with respect to any material fact,
or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or, in
the case of the Joint Proxy Statement or any amendment thereof or supplement
thereto, at the time of the FNB Shareholders' Meeting or the Promistar
Shareholders' Meeting, be false or misleading with respect to any material fact,
or omit to state any material fact necessary to correct any statement in any
earlier communication with respect to the solicitation of any proxy for the FNB
Shareholders' Meeting or the Promistar Shareholders' Meeting. All documents that
any FNB Company or any Affiliate thereof is responsible for filing with any
Regulatory Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
will comply as to form in all material respects with the provisions of
applicable Law.

         6.13     Accounting, Tax and Regulatory Matters. No FNB Company or any
Affiliate thereof has taken or agreed to take any action or has any Knowledge of
any fact or circumstance that is reasonably likely to (i) prevent the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, from qualifying for
pooling-of-interests accounting treatment or as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a)(2)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code, or (ii) materially
impede or delay receipt of any Consents of Regulatory Authorities referred to in
Section 9.1(b) of this Agreement or result in the imposition of a condition or
restriction of the type referred to in the last sentence of such Section.

         6.14     Environmental Matters.

         (a)      To the Knowledge of FNB, except as disclosed in Section 6.14
of the FNB Disclosure Memorandum, each FNB Company, its Participation
Facilities, and its Loan Properties are, and have been, in compliance with all
Environmental Laws, except for violations which are not reasonably likely to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on FNB.

         (b)      Except as disclosed in Section 6.14 of the FNB Disclosure
Memorandum, there is no Litigation pending, or, to the Knowledge of FNB,
threatened before any court, governmental agency, or authority or other forum in
which any FNB Company or any of its Loan Properties or Participation Facilities
(or any FNB Company in respect of any such Loan Property or Participation
Facility) has been or, with respect to threatened Litigation, may be named as a
defendant or potentially responsible party (i) for alleged noncompliance
(including by any predecessor) with any Environmental Law or (ii) relating to
the release into the environment of any Hazardous Material, whether or not
occurring at, on, under, or involving any of its Loan Properties or
Participation Facilities, except for such Litigation pending or threatened that
is not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on FNB.

         (c)      To the Knowledge of FNB, except as disclosed in Section 6.14
of the FNB Disclosure Memorandum, there is no reasonable basis for any
Litigation of a type described above in Section 6.14(b), except such as is not
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on FNB.

         (d)      To the Knowledge of FNB, except as disclosed in Section 6.14
of the FNB Disclosure Memorandum, during the period of (i) FNB's or any of its
Subsidiaries' ownership or operation of any of their respective properties, (ii)
FNB's or any of its Subsidiaries' participation in the management of any


                                       19
<PAGE>   25

Participation Facility, or (iii) FNB's or any of its Subsidiaries' holding a
security interest in a Loan Property, there have been no releases of Hazardous
Material in, on, under, or affecting any Participation Facility or Loan Property
of a FNB Company, except such as are not reasonably likely to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on FNB.

         6.15     Outstanding Promistar Common Stock. Except as disclosed in
Section 6.15 of the FNB Disclosure Memorandum, as of the date of this Agreement,
FNB Companies do not beneficially own any shares of Promistar Common Stock for
their own accounts (not including those held in a fiduciary or trust capacity
for, or on behalf of, unaffiliated third parties). During the term of this
Agreement, no FNB Company shall purchase or otherwise acquire beneficial
ownership of any additional Promistar Common Stock except pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement.

         6.16     Material Contracts. Except as set forth in the FNB SEC
Reports, no FNB Company is a party to or bound by any "material contract" as
such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC (each such
contract a "FNB Contract"). With respect to each FNB Contract and except as
disclosed in Section 6.16 of the FNB Disclosure Memorandum: (i) such FNB
Contract is in full force and effect; (ii) no FNB Company is in Default
thereunder; (iii) no FNB Company has repudiated or waived any material provision
of any such FNB Contract; and (iv) no other party to any such FNB Contract is,
to the Knowledge of FNB, in Default in any respect or has repudiated or waived
any material provision thereunder.

         6.17     Employee Benefit Plans.

         (a)      FNB has disclosed in Section 6.17 of the FNB Disclosure
Memorandum, and has delivered or made available to Promistar prior to the
execution of this Agreement copies in each case of: (i) all pension, retirement,
profit-sharing, deferred compensation, stock option, employee stock ownership,
severance pay, vacation, bonus, or other incentive plan, all other written
employee programs, arrangements, or agreements, all medical, vision, dental, or
other health plans, all life insurance plans, and all other employee benefit
plans or fringe benefit plans, including, without limitation, "employee benefit
plans" (as that term is defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA), currently adopted,
maintained by, sponsored in whole or in part by, or contributed to by any FNB
Company or ERISA Affiliate (as defined below) thereof for the benefit of
employees, retirees, dependents, spouses, directors, independent contractors, or
other beneficiaries and under which employees, retirees, dependents, spouses,
directors, independent contractors, or other beneficiaries are eligible to
participate (collectively, the "FNB Benefit Plans"); (ii) all insurance
contracts, annuity contracts and other funding vehicles relating to the FNB
Benefit Plans; (iii) all material agreements entered into with service providers
in connection with the FNB Benefit Plans; and (iv) summary plan descriptions,
favorable Internal Revenue Service determination letters for each FNB ERISA Plan
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code and
the most recently available Form 5500 annual reports, certified financial
statement and actuarial reports for the FNB Benefit Plans. Any of the FNB
Benefit Plans which is an "employee pension benefit plan" (as that term is
defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA), is referred to herein as a "FNB ERISA Plan."
Each FNB ERISA Plan which is also a "defined benefit plan" (as defined in
Section 4140) of the Internal Revenue Code) is referred to herein as a "FNB
Pension Plan." No FNB Pension Plan is or has been a multiemployer plan within
the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA. No FNB Benefit Plan is a multiple
employer plan within the meaning of Section 413(c) of the Internal Revenue Code
or is a multiple employer welfare arrangement within the meaning of Section
3(40) of ERISA. Since the date the foregoing documents were delivered or made
available to Promistar, no amendments to any FNB Benefit Plan have been made or
will be made prior to the Closing Date. Except as disclosed in Section 6.17 of
the FNB Disclosure Memorandum, FNB does not maintain any unwritten FNB Benefit
Plans. No FNB Company nor any ERISA Affiliate is a party to a collective
bargaining agreement. FNB has disclosed in Section 6.17 of the FNB Disclosure
Memorandum a complete and accurate list of (A) each ERISA


                                       20
<PAGE>   26

Affiliate, and (B) each FNB ERISA Plan that has not been adopted by each ERISA
Affiliate that maintains a separate payroll.

         (b)      Except as disclosed in Section 6.17 of the FNB Disclosure
Memorandum, all FNB Benefit Plans are in compliance with the applicable terms of
ERISA, the Internal Revenue Code, COBRA (as defined below) and any other
applicable Laws the breach or violation of which are reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on FNB, and each FNB
ERISA Plan which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code has received a favorable determination letter from the
Internal Revenue Service, and FNB is not aware of any circumstances likely to
result in revocation of any such favorable determination letter. Except as
disclosed in Section 6.17 of the FNB Disclosure Memorandum, to the Knowledge of
FNB, no FNB Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has any liability to the Internal
Revenue Service with respect to any FNB Benefit Plan, including any liability
imposed by Chapter 43 of the Internal Revenue Code, and no FNB Company has
engaged in a transaction with respect to any FNB Benefit Plan that, assuming the
taxable period of such transaction expired as of the date hereof, would subject
any FNB Company to a Tax imposed by either Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue
Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA in amounts which are reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on FNB.

         (c)      Except as disclosed in Section 6.17 of the FNB Disclosure
Memorandum, no FNB Pension Plan has any "unfunded current liability" (as that
term is defined in Section 302(d)(8)(A) of ERISA) and the fair market value of
the assets of any such plan exceeds the plan's "benefit liabilities," as that
term is defined in Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA, when determined under actuarial
factors that would apply if the plan terminated in accordance with all
applicable legal requirements. Except as disclosed in Section 6.17 of the FNB
Disclosure Memorandum, since the date of the most recent actuarial valuation,
there has been (i) no material change in the financial position of any FNB
Pension Plan, (ii) no change in the actuarial assumptions with respect to any
FNB Pension Plan, and (iii) no increase in benefits under any FNB Pension Plan
as a result of plan amendments or changes in applicable Law which is reasonably
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
FNB or materially adversely affect the funding status of any such plan. Neither
any FNB Pension Plan nor any "single-employer plan," within the meaning of
Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or formerly maintained by any FNB
Company, or the single-employer plan of any entity which is considered one
employer with FNB under Section 4001 of ERISA or Section 414 of the Internal
Revenue Code or Section 302 of ERISA (whether or not waived) (an "ERISA
Affiliate") has an "accumulated funding deficiency" within the meaning of
Section 412 of the Internal Revenue Code or Section 302 of ERISA, which is
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on FNB. No FNB Company has
provided, or is required to provide, security to a FNB Pension Plan or to any
single-employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the
Internal Revenue Code.

         (d)      Within the six-year period preceding the Effective Time, no
liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of ERISA has been or is expected to
be incurred by any FNB Company with respect to any ongoing, frozen, or
terminated single-employer plan or the single-employer plan of any ERISA
Affiliate, which liability is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect on FNB. No FNB Company has incurred any withdrawal liability with respect
to a multiemployer plan under Subtitle B of Title IV of ERISA (regardless of
whether based on contributions of an ERISA Affiliate), which liability is
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on FNB. No notice of a
"reportable event," within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA for which the
30-day reporting requirement has not been waived, has been required to be filed
for any FNB Pension Plan or by any ERISA Affiliate within the 12-month period
ending on the date hereof. No FNB Company nor ERISA Affiliate has filed a notice
of intent to terminate any ERISA Pension Plan or has adopted any amendment to
treat such Plan as terminated. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation has not
instituted proceedings to treat any ERISA Pension Plan as


                                       21
<PAGE>   27

terminated. No event has occurred or circumstance exists that may constitute
grounds under Section 4042 of ERISA for the termination of, or appointment of a
trustee to administer, any FNB Pension Plan.

         (e)      Except as disclosed in Section 6.17 of the FNB Disclosure
Memorandum, no FNB Company has any liability for retiree health and life
benefits under any of the FNB Benefit Plans other than health continuation
coverage required by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985
as amended and Sections 601 through 608 of ERISA ("COBRA") or by any similar
state law, and there are no restrictions on the rights of such FNB Company to
amend or terminate any such plan without incurring any liability thereunder,
which liability is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on FNB.
There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of FNB, threatened complaint, claim
(other than a routine claim for benefits submitted by participants or
beneficiaries), proceeding, audit or investigation of any kind in or before any
court, tribunal, or governmental agency with respect to any FNB Benefit Plan.

         (f)      Except as disclosed in Section 6.17 of the FNB Disclosure
Memorandum, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (i) result in any
payment (including severance, unemployment compensation, golden parachute, or
otherwise) becoming due to any director or any employee of any FNB Company from
any FNB Company under any FNB Benefit Plan or otherwise, (ii) increase any
benefits otherwise payable under any FNB Benefit Plan, or (iii) result in any
acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such benefit, where such
payment, increase, or acceleration is reasonably likely to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on FNB.

         (g)      The actuarial present values of all accrued deferred
compensation entitlements (including entitlements under any executive
compensation, supplemental retirement, or employment agreement) of employees and
former employees of any FNB Company and their respective beneficiaries, other
than entitlements accrued pursuant to funded retirement plans subject to the
provisions of Section 412 of the Internal Revenue Code or Section 302 of ERISA,
have been fully reflected on the FNB Financial Statements to the extent required
by and in accordance with GAAP.

         (h)      All contributions and payments made or accrued with respect to
all FNB Benefit Plans are deductible under Sections 404 or 162 of the Internal
Revenue Code and, if not made, are properly reflected on the financial
statements of the FNB Companies and ERISA Affiliates. No event has occurred or
circumstance exists that could result in an increase in premium costs of insured
or self-insured FNB Benefit Plans that would have a Material Adverse Effect on
FNB. Levels of insurance reserves, trust funding and accrued liabilities with
respect to all ERISA Benefit Plans (to which such reserves or liabilities do or
should apply) are reasonable and sufficient to provide for all incurred but
unreported claims and any retroactive or prospective premium adjustments.

         6.18     Opinion of Financial Advisor. FNB has received the written
opinion of The Robinson-Humphrey Company, LLC, its financial advisor, to the
effect that, as of the date hereof, the consideration to be paid to the
Promistar shareholders, based upon and subject to the limitations set forth in
such opinion, is fair to the FNB shareholders from a financial point of view.

                                    ARTICLE 7

any Party to obtain any necessary approvals of any Regulatory Authorities
required for the transactions contemplated hereby or (ii) adversely affect its

consistent with past practice or (B) other changes as are provided for herein or
as may be required by law or to satisfy contractual obligations existing as of
the date hereof or additional grants of awards to newly hired employees
consistent with past practice; provided, however, that each officer and employee
of Promistar entitled, pursuant to either Promistar's Key Employee Incentive
Compensation Plan of 1996 or Promistar's Annual Management Incentive Plan, to
receive a bonus at the end of the fiscal year in which the Closing occurs, shall
be paid a pro rata portion of such bonus at the Effective Time; or

Disclosure Memorandum, enter into or amend (except as may be required by
applicable law, to satisfy contractual obligations existing as of the date
hereof or amendments which, either individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to result in a material liability to FNB, Promistar or
their respective Subsidiaries) any pension, retirement, stock option, stock
purchase, savings, profit sharing, deferred compensation, consulting, bonus,
group insurance or other employee benefit, incentive or welfare contract, plan
or arrangement, or any trust agreement related thereto, in respect of any of its
directors, officers or other employees, including, without limitation, taking
any action that accelerates the vesting or exercise of any benefits payable
thereunder; or

         (d)      amend its Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; or

         (e)      implement or adopt any change in its accounting principles,
practices or methods, other than as may be required by GAAP; or

         (f)      (i) knowingly take any action that would, or would be
reasonably likely to, prevent or impede the Merger from qualifying as a

any action that is intended or is reasonably likely to result in (A) any of its
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement being or becoming
untrue in any material respect at any time prior to the Effective Time, (B) any
of the conditions to the Merger set forth in Article 9 not being satisfied or
(C) a material violation of any provision of this Agreement except, in each
case, as may be required by applicable law; or

         (g)      agree or commit to do anything prohibited by this Section 7.1.

         7.2      Covenants of Promistar. From the date of this Agreement until
the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement, except
as expressly contemplated by this Agreement, Promistar covenants and agrees that
it will not, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries not to, do any of the
following without the prior consent (except as specifically provided otherwise
in this Agreement) of FNB:


                                       23

Person (except for loans secured by a first mortgage on single family
owner-occupied real estate and except for any loan to any Person who has
received from Promistar a commitment for a loan or extension of credit prior to
the date of this Agreement) if, immediately after making such loan, such Person
would be indebted to the Promistar Companies, collectively, in an aggregate
amount in excess of $5,000,000 (in either case FNB shall object thereto within
two business days, and the failure to provide a written objection within two
business days shall be deemed as the approval of FNB to make such loan or extend
such credit); or

         (e)      incur any additional debt obligation or other obligation for
borrowed money (other than indebtedness of a Promistar Company to another
Promistar Company) in excess of an aggregate of $1,000,000 (for the Promistar

of Promistar Subsidiaries consistent with past practices (it being understood
and agreed that the incurrence of indebtedness in the ordinary course of
business shall include, without limitation, creation of deposit liabilities,
purchases of federal funds, advances from the Federal Reserve Bank, and entry
into repurchase agreements fully secured by U.S. government or agency
securities, but shall not include advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank), or

sell, pledge, encumber, authorize the issuance of, enter into any Contract to
issue, sell, pledge, encumber, or authorize the issuance of, or otherwise permit
to become outstanding, any additional Promistar Common Shares or any other

         (i)      except for purchases of United States Treasury securities or
United States Government agency securities, which in either case have maturities
of five years or less, and except as disclosed in Section 7.2(i) of the
Promistar Disclosure Memorandum, purchase any securities or make any material
investment, either by purchase of stock or securities, contributions to capital,
Asset transfers, or purchase of any Assets, in any Person other than a wholly
owned Promistar Subsidiary, or otherwise acquire direct or indirect control over
any Person, other than in connection with (i) foreclosures in the ordinary
course of business, (ii) acquisitions of control by a depository institution
Subsidiary in its fiduciary capacity, or (iii) the creation of new wholly owned
Subsidiaries organized to conduct or continue activities otherwise permitted by
this Agreement in which case FNB shall object thereto within two business days,
and the failure to provide written objection within two business days shall be
deemed to be approval of FNB to make such purchase or investment; or

         (j)      except as disclosed in Section 7.2(j) of the Promistar
Disclosure Memorandum, commence any Litigation other than in accordance with
past practice or settle any Litigation involving any liability of any Promistar
Company for material money damages or restrictions upon the operations of any
Promistar Company; or

         (k)      except in the ordinary course of business, modify, amend, or
terminate any material Contract other than renewals without material adverse
change of terms, or waive, release, compromise, or assign any material rights or
claims; or

         (l)      except as disclosed in Section 7.2(l) of the Promistar
Disclosure Memorandum, except for transactions in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice, make any investment in excess of
$250,000 either by purchase of stock or securities, contributions to capital,
property transfers, or purchase of any property or assets of any other
individual, corporation or other entity other than a wholly owned Subsidiary
thereof; or

         (m)      sell, transfer, mortgage, encumber or otherwise dispose of any
of its material properties or assets to any individual, corporation or other
entity other than a direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary, or cancel,
release or assign any indebtedness to any such Person or any claims held by any
such Person, except in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice or pursuant to contracts or agreements in force at the date of this
Agreement; or

         (n)      agree or commit to do anything prohibited by this Section 7.2.

         7.3      Covenants of FNB. From the date of this Agreement until the
earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement, FNB
covenants and agrees that it shall continue to conduct its business and the
business of FNB Subsidiaries in a manner designed in its reasonable judgment, to
enhance the long-term value of the FNB Common Stock and the business prospects
of the FNB Companies; provided, that nothing in this Agreement shall prevent any
FNB Company from (i) discontinuing or disposing of any of its Assets or business
or (ii) acquiring all or any portion of the business of any other entity, if
such action is, in the judgment of FNB, desirable in the conduct of the business
of FNB and its Subsidiaries.

         7.4      Dividends.

         (a)      Promistar covenants and agrees that it shall not make,
declare, or pay any dividend or make any other distribution in respect of
Promistar's capital stock, except for (i) the acquisition of Promistar Common
Shares by Promistar in a fiduciary or trust capacity in the ordinary course of
business, (ii) regular and ordinary cash dividends on Promistar Common Shares in
an amount per share not to


                                       25
<PAGE>   31

exceed the per share amount of Promistar's most recent cash dividend as of the
date of this Agreement, and (iii) dividends from wholly owned Subsidiaries of
Promistar to Promistar or to another wholly owned Subsidiary of Promistar.

         (b)      FNB covenants and agrees that it shall not make, declare, or
pay any dividend or make any other distribution in respect of FNB's capital
stock, except for (i) quarterly cash dividends on FNB Common Stock in an amount
not to exceed the greater of (A) the rate payable on such FNB Common Stock as of
the date of this Agreement or (B) an amount equal to 40% of the after-tax net
income of FNB for FNB's fiscal quarter immediately preceding the record date for
such dividend, (ii) dividends payable on FNB Preferred Stock at a rate not
exceeding the rate provided for in the terms thereof, and (iii) dividends from
wholly owned Subsidiaries of FNB to FNB or to another wholly owned Subsidiary of
FNB, as applicable.

         (c)      After the date of this Agreement, each Party covenants and
agrees to coordinate with the other Party the declaration of any dividends in
respect of Promistar Common Stock and FNB Common Stock and the record dates and
payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the Parties that
holders of Promistar Common Stock or FNB Common Stock shall not receive two
dividends, or fail to receive one dividend, for any single calendar quarter with
respect to their shares of Promistar Common Stock and/or FNB Common Stock and
any shares of Promistar Common Stock any such holder receives in exchange
therefor in the Merger.

         7.5      Adverse Changes In Condition. Each Party agrees to give
written notice promptly to the other Party upon becoming aware of the occurrence
or impending occurrence of any event or circumstance relating to it or any of
its Subsidiaries which (i) is reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on it or (ii) would cause or constitute a
material breach of any of its representations, warranties, or covenants
contained herein, and to use its reasonable best efforts to prevent or promptly
to remedy the same.

         7.6      Reports. Each Party and its respective Subsidiaries shall file
all reports required to be filed by each of them with Regulatory Authorities
between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time and shall deliver to
the other Party copies of all such reports promptly after the same are filed. If
financial statements are contained in any such reports filed with the SEC, such
financial statements will fairly present the consolidated financial position of
the entity filing such statements as of the dates indicated and the consolidated
results of operations, changes in shareholders' equity, and cash flows for the
periods then ended in accordance with GAAP (subject in the case of interim
financial statements to normal recurring year-end adjustments that are not
material and except for the absence of certain footnote information in the
unaudited financial statements). As of their respective dates, such reports
filed with the SEC will comply in all material respects with the Securities Laws
and will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. Any financial statements contained in any other reports to
another Regulatory Authority shall be prepared in accordance with the Laws
applicable to such reports.

         (a)      As soon as practicable after execution of this Agreement (in
no event later than August 15, 2001), FNB shall file the Registration Statement
with the SEC, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Registration Statement to become effective under the 1933 Act and take any
action required to be taken under the applicable state blue sky or securities
Laws in connection with the issuance of the shares of FNB Common Stock upon
consummation of the Merger. Promistar shall furnish all information concerning
it and the holders of its capital stock as FNB may reasonably request in
connection with such action.

         (b)      Each of the Parties shall take, in accordance with applicable
Law and its respective articles of incorporation and bylaws, all action
necessary to convene, respectively, an appropriate meeting of the shareholders
of such Party, each such meeting to be held as promptly as practical after the
date hereof, for the purpose of voting upon approval of this Agreement and such
other related matters as each deems appropriate. Except as disclosed in Section
8.1(b) of the Promistar Disclosure Memorandum, in connection with such
shareholders' meetings, (i) each of the Parties shall mail the Joint Proxy
Statement to its respective shareholders, (ii) the Parties shall furnish to each
other all information concerning them that they may reasonably request in

Party's shareholders the approval of this Agreement, (iv) each member of the
Board of Directors of each Party shall vote all of the shares of each of the
Parties beneficially owned by such director in favor of the approval of this
Agreement, and (v) the Board of Directors and officers of each Party shall
(subject to compliance with their fiduciary duties under applicable law as
advised by counsel) use their reasonable best efforts to obtain such
shareholders' approval.

         8.2      Applications. FNB shall use its reasonable best efforts to
prepare and file, not later than August 15, 2001, applications with all
Regulatory Authorities having jurisdiction over the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement seeking the requisite Consents necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and thereafter use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Merger to be consummated as expeditiously as possible,
and Promistar shall cooperate in the preparation and, where appropriate, filing
of such applications. Further, FNB shall, prior to the Closing, prepare and file
with the National Association of Securities Dealers the required documents and
make payment of the required fees for the shares of FNB Common Stock to be
issued to holders of Promistar Common Stock in connection with the Merger.

         8.3      Filings With State Offices. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, FNB and Promistar shall, in connection with the

Articles of Merger to be filed with the Florida Secretary of State and the
Pennsylvania Secretary of State, respectively.

         8.4      Agreement as to Efforts to Consummate. Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, each Party agrees to use, and to cause its
Subsidiaries to use, its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper, or
advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective, as soon as
practicable after the date of this Agreement, the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including the use of their respective reasonable best efforts to
lift or rescind any Order adversely affecting its ability to consummate the


                                       27
<PAGE>   33

transactions contemplated herein and to cause to be satisfied the conditions
referred to in Article 9 of this Agreement; provided, that nothing herein shall
preclude either Party from exercising its rights under this Agreement. Each
Party shall use, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to use, its reasonable
best efforts to obtain all Permits and Consents of all third parties and
Regulatory Authorities necessary or desirable for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

         8.5      Access to Information; Confidentiality.

         (a)      From the date hereof to the earlier to occur of the Effective
Time or the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article 10 hereof, upon
reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws, FNB and Promistar shall afford
each other, and each other's accountants, counsel, and other representatives,
during normal working hours for the period of time prior to the Effective Time
or termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article 10 hereof, reasonable
access to all of its and its Subsidiaries' properties, books, contracts,
commitments, and records and, during such period, each shall furnish promptly to
the other Party (i) a copy of each report, schedule, and other document filed or
received by it or any of its Subsidiaries during such period pursuant to the
requirements of the Securities Laws, (ii) a copy of all filings made with any
Regulatory Authorities or other governmental entities in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and all written communications
received from such Regulatory Authorities and governmental entities related
thereto, and (iii) all other information concerning either Party or its
respective Subsidiaries' business, properties and personnel as the other Party
may reasonably request, including reports of condition filed with Regulatory
Authorities. In this regard, without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
FNB and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates shall notify Promistar promptly upon the
receipt by it of any comments from the SEC, or its staff, and of any requests by
the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or for
additional information and will supply Promistar with copies of all
correspondence between it and its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC
or the members of its staff or any other government official, on the other hand,
with respect to the Registration Statement. Each Party hereto shall, and shall
cause its advisors and representatives to (x) conduct its investigation in such
a manner which will not unreasonably interfere with the normal operations,
customers or employee relations of the other and shall be in accordance with
procedures established by the Parties having the due regard for the foregoing,
and (y) refrain from using for any purposes other than as set forth in this
Agreement, and shall treat as confidential, all information obtained by each
hereunder or in connection herewith and not otherwise known to them prior to the
Effective Time.

         (b)      FNB, the FNB Companies and their Affiliates will hold, and
will use their best efforts to cause their officers, directors, employees,
consultants, advisors, representatives, and agents to hold, in confidence,
unless compelled by judicial or other legal process, all confidential documents
and information furnished by Promistar to FNB, any FNB Company, or their
Affiliates in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including information provided in accordance with this Section 8.5, except to
the extent that such information can clearly be demonstrated by FNB to have been
(i) previously known on a nonconfidential basis by FNB, (ii) in the public
domain other than as a result of disclosure by FNB, any FNB Company, or any of
their Affiliates, or (iii) later lawfully acquired by FNB from sources other
than Promistar; provided, however, that FNB may disclose such information to its
officers, directors, employees, consultants, advisors, representatives, and
agents in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement only
to the extent that such Persons who, in FNB's reasonable judgment, need to know
such information for the purpose of evaluating Promistar (provided that such
Persons shall be informed of the confidential nature of such information and
shall agree to be bound by the terms of this provision) and, in any event, such
disclosures shall be made only to the extent necessary for such purposes. If
this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Article 10 hereof, FNB, the FNB
Companies and their Affiliates shall maintain the confidence of such information
and will use their best efforts to cause its officers, directors, employees,
consultants, advisors, representatives, and

                                       28
<PAGE>   34
agents to, return to Promistar all documents and other materials, and all
copies made thereof, obtained by FNB, any FNB Company, or any of their
Affiliates in connection with this Agreement that are subject to this Section
8.5.

         (c)      Promistar and its Affiliates will hold, and will use their
best efforts to cause their officers, directors, employees, consultants,
advisors, representatives, and agents to hold, in confidence, unless compelled
by judicial or other legal process, all confidential documents and information
concerning FNB furnished to Promistar or its Affiliates in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including information provided in
accordance with this Section 8.5, except to the extent that such information can
clearly be demonstrated by Promistar to have been (i) previously known on a
nonconfidential basis by Promistar, (ii) in the public domain other than as a
result of disclosure by Promistar or any of its Affiliates, or (iii) later
lawfully acquired by Promistar from sources other than FNB; provided, however,
that Promistar may disclose such information to its officers, directors,
employees, consultants, advisors, representatives, and agents in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement only to the extent that such
Persons who, in Promistar's reasonable judgment, need to know such information
for the purpose of evaluating FNB (provided that such Persons shall be informed
of the confidential nature of such information and shall agree to be bound by
the terms of this provision) and, in any event, such disclosures shall be made
only to the extent necessary for such purposes. If this Agreement is terminated
in accordance with Article 10 hereof, Promistar and its Affiliates shall
maintain the confidence of such information and will, and will use their best
efforts to cause its officers, directors, employees, consultants, advisors,
representatives, and agents to, return to FNB all documents and other materials,
and all copies made thereof, obtained by Promistar or any of its Affiliates in
connection with this Agreement that are subject to this Section 8.5.

         8.6      Press Releases. Prior to the Effective Time, Promistar and FNB
shall, prior to any release or disclosure, consult with each other as to the
form and substance of any press release or other public disclosure materially
related to this Agreement or any other transaction contemplated hereby;
provided, that nothing in this Section 8.6 shall be deemed to prohibit any Party
from making any disclosure which its counsel deems necessary or advisable in
order to satisfy such Party's disclosure obligations imposed by Law.

         8.7      Current Information. During the period from the date of this
Agreement until the earlier to occur of the Effective Time or termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Article 10 hereof, each of Promistar and FNB shall,
and shall cause its representatives to, confer on a regular and frequent basis
with representatives of the other. Each of Promistar and FNB shall promptly
notify the other of (i) any material change in its business or operations, (ii)
any material complaints, investigations, or hearings (or communications
indicating that the same may be contemplated) of any Regulatory Authority, (iii)
the institution or threat of material Litigation involving such Party, or (iv)
the occurrence, or nonoccurrence, of an event or condition, the occurrence, or
nonoccurrence, of which would be reasonably expected to cause any of such
party's representations or warranties set forth herein to be untrue in any
respect as of the Effective Time; and in each case shall keep the other fully
informed with respect thereto.

         8.8      Other Actions. No Party shall, or shall permit any of its
Subsidiaries, if any, to take any action, except in every case as may be
required by applicable Law, that would or is intended to result in (i) any of
its representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement that are
qualified as to materiality being or becoming untrue, (ii) any of such
representations and warranties that are not so qualified becoming untrue in any
material manner having a Material Adverse Effect, (iii) any of the conditions
set forth in this Agreement not being satisfied or in a violation of any
material provision of this Agreement, or (iv) adversely affecting the ability of
any of them to obtain any of the Consents or Permits from Regulatory Authorities
(unless such action is required by sound banking practice).

         8.9      No Solicitation.

         (a)      From and after the date of this Agreement and until the
earlier of the termination of this Agreement or the Effective Time, except in
compliance with this Section 8.9, Promistar will not, and will not permit its
directors, officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or
other representatives, agents or Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, (i)
solicit, initiate, or encourage any Acquisition Proposals; (ii) engage in
discussions with third parties, or negotiations concerning, or provide any
non-public information to any person or entity in connection with, any
Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) agree to, approve, recommend or otherwise endorse
or support any Acquisition Proposal. As used herein, the term "Acquisition
Proposal" shall mean any proposal relating to a possible (i) merger,
consolidation or similar transaction involving Promistar or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than a transaction with respect to which an acquisition
agreement has been executed and publicly announced as of the date hereof); (ii)
sale, lease or other disposition, directly or indirectly, involving Promistar or
any of its Subsidiaries representing, in the aggregate, 10% or more of the
Assets of Promistar on a consolidated basis; (iii) issuance, sale or other
disposition of (including by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange or any
similar transaction) securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase or
securities convertible into, such securities) representing 10% or more of the
votes attached to the outstanding securities of Promistar; (iv) transaction with
Promistar in which any person shall acquire beneficial ownership (as such term
is defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), or the right to acquire
beneficial ownership, or any "group" (as such term is defined under the Exchange
Act) shall have been formed which beneficially owns or has the right to acquire
beneficial ownership of, 10% or more of the outstanding shares of Promistar
Common Stock; or (v) liquidation, dissolution, recapitalization or other similar
type of transaction with respect to Promistar; or (vi) transaction which is
similar in form, substance or purpose to any of the foregoing transactions;
provided, however, that the term "Acquisition Proposal" shall not include the
Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby. Promistar will, and will direct
all its directors, officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants and other representatives, agents and Affiliates to, immediately
cease any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any
parties conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing.

         (b)      Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 8.9(a) above, if a
corporation, limited liability company, limited liability partnership,
partnership, person or other entity or group (a "Third Party") after the date of
this Agreement submits to Promistar's Board of Directors an unsolicited, bona
fide, written Acquisition Proposal, and Promistar's Board of Directors
reasonably determines in good faith, after receipt of advice from outside legal
counsel that the failure to engage in discussions with the Third Party
concerning such Acquisition Proposal would likely cause Promistar's Board of
directors to breach its fiduciary duties to Promistar and its shareholders, and
after consultation with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc., or any other nationally
recognized investment bank, then, in such case, (i) Promistar may (A) furnish
information about its business to the Third Party under protection of an
appropriate confidentiality agreement containing customary limitations on the
use and disclosure of all non-public written or oral information furnished to
such Third Party, provided that Promistar must contemporaneously furnish to FNB
all such non-public information furnished to the Third Party and (B) negotiate
and participate in discussions and negotiations with such Third Party; and (ii)
if Promistar's Board of Directors determines that such an Acquisition Proposal
is a Superior Proposal (defined below), Promistar's Board of Directors may
(subject to the provisions of this Section 8.9) (A) withdraw or adversely modify
its approval or recommendation of the Merger and recommend such Superior
Proposal or (B) terminate this Agreement, in each case, at any time after the
second business day following delivery of written notice to FNB (a "Notice of
Superior Proposal") advising FNB that Promistar's Board of Directors has
received a Superior Proposal, identifying the Third Party and specifying the
material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal. Promistar may take any
of the foregoing actions pursuant to the preceding sentence if, and only if, an
Acquisition Proposal that was a Superior Proposal continues to be a Superior
Proposal in light of any improved proposal submitted by FNB, considered in good
faith by Promistar and with the advice of a


                                       30
<PAGE>   36

financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, including, without
limitation, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc., prior to the expiration of the two
business day period specified in the preceding sentence. Promistar shall provide
FNB with a final written notice, at least twenty-four (24) hours before
accepting any Superior Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior
Proposal" means any unsolicited, bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal for
consideration consisting of cash (not subject to a financing contingency) and/or
securities, and otherwise on terms which Promistar's Board of Directors
determines (based on the written advice of a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation, including, without limitation, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods,
Inc.) are more favorable to Promistar's shareholders from financial point of
view than the Merger (or other revised proposal submitted by FNB as contemplated
above), after consultation with its outside legal counsel and that the Third
Party is reasonably likely to consummate the Superior Proposal on the terms
proposed. Nothing contained herein shall prohibit Promistar from taking, and
disclosing to its shareholders, a position required by Rule 14d-9(e) under the
Exchange Act prior to the second business day following FNB's receipt of a
Notice of Superior Proposal, provided that Promistar does not withdraw or modify
its position with respect to the Merger or approve or recommend an Acquisition
Proposal.

         (c)      Promistar will notify FNB immediately, and in any event within
24 hours, if (i) a bona fide Acquisition Proposal is made or is modified in any
respect (including any written material provided by the offeror, the principal
terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal or modification thereto
and the identity of the offeror) or (ii) Promistar furnishes non-public
information to, or enters into discussions or negotiations with respect to an
acquisition Proposal with, any Third Party.

         (d)      In addition to the obligations of Promistar set forth in
paragraph (a), (b) and (c) of this Section 8.9, Promistar, as promptly as
practicable, will advise FNB orally and in writing of any request for
information which Promistar reasonably believes could lead to an Acquisition
Proposal or of any Acquisition Proposal, and the material terms and conditions
of such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, Promistar will keep FNB
informed in all material respects of the status of any such request, Acquisition
Proposal or inquiry. In addition to the foregoing, Promistar will (i) provide
FNB with prior written notice of any meeting of Promistar's Board of Directors
(or any committee thereof) at which Promistar's Board of Directors is expected
to consider a Superior Proposal and (ii) provide FNB with prior written notice
of a meeting of Promistar's Board of Directors (or any committee thereof) at
which Promistar's Board of Directors is expected to recommend a Superior
Proposal to its shareholders and together with such notice a copy of the
definitive documentation relating to such Superior Proposal to the extent such
documentation is then available (and otherwise provide such definitive
documentation as soon as available).

         (e)      It is understood and agreed that, without limitation of
Promistar's obligations hereunder, any violation of this Section 8.9 by any
director, officer, Affiliate, investment bank, financial advisor, accountant,
attorney or other advisor or representative of Promistar, whether or not such
person or entity is purporting to act on behalf of Promistar, shall be deemed to
be a breach of this Section 8.9 by Promistar. Promistar agrees that, as of the
date hereof, it, its Affiliates and their respective directors, officers,
employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other representatives
and agents, shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
activities, discussions and negotiations with any Third Party (other than FNB
and its representatives) conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal.

         8.10     Accounting and Tax Treatment. Each of the Parties undertakes
and agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify,
and to take no action which would cause the Merger to not qualify, for treatment
as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code for federal income tax purposes. FNB and Promistar undertake and
agree to use


                                       31
<PAGE>   37

their respective reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify, and to
take no action that would cause the Merger to not qualify, for
pooling-of-interests accounting treatment.

         8.11     Articles of Incorporation Provisions. Each Promistar Company
shall take all necessary action to ensure that the entering into of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby do not and will not result in the grant of any rights to any
Person under the Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws, or other governing
instruments of any Promistar Company or restrict or impair the ability of FNB or
any of its Subsidiaries to vote, or otherwise to exercise the rights of a
shareholder with respect to, shares of any Promistar Company that may be
directly or indirectly acquired or controlled by it.

         8.12     Agreement of Affiliates. Promistar has disclosed in Section
8.12 of the Promistar Disclosure Memorandum all Persons whom it reasonably
believes are "affiliates" of Promistar as that term is defined in SEC Accounting
Series Releases 130 and 135 and in Rule 145 under the 1933 Act. Promistar shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause each Person who may be deemed an
affiliate of Promistar to execute and deliver to FNB not later than the date of
mailing of the Joint Proxy Statement, a written agreement, substantially in the
form of Exhibit 2 hereto, providing that such Person will not sell, pledge,
transfer, or otherwise dispose of the shares of Promistar Common Stock held by
such Person except as contemplated by such agreement or by this Agreement and
will not sell, pledge, transfer, or otherwise dispose of the shares of FNB
Common Stock to be received by such Person upon consummation of the Merger
except in compliance with applicable provisions of the 1933 Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder and until such time as financial results covering at
least 30 days of combined operations of FNB and Promistar have been published
within the meaning of Section 201.01 of the SEC's Codification of Financial
Reporting Policies. Shares of FNB Common Stock issued to such affiliates of
Promistar in exchange for shares of Promistar Common Stock shall not be
transferable until such time as financial results covering at least 30 days of
combined operations of FNB and Promistar have been published within the meaning
of Section 201.01 of the SEC's Codification of Financial Reporting Policies,
regardless of whether each such affiliate has provided the written agreement
referred to in this Section 8.12 (and FNB shall be entitled to place restrictive
legends upon certificates for shares of FNB Common Stock issued to affiliates of
Promistar pursuant to this Agreement to enforce the provisions of this Section
8.12). FNB shall not be required to maintain the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement under the 1933 Act for the purposes of resale of FNB
Common Stock by such affiliates.

         8.13     Employment Contracts. At the Effective Time, FNB shall enter
into an employment agreement with each of Steven C. Ackmann and Kim Craig
containing such terms and conditions as mutually agreeable. In consideration of
the entering into such employment agreements, Steven C. Ackmann and Kim Craig
shall, at the Effective Time, cancel and terminate any employment agreements
entered into with Promistar.

         8.14     Indemnification.

         (a)      FNB shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the present and
former directors, officers, employees, and agents of Promistar (each, an
"Indemnified Party") after the Effective Time against all costs, fees, or
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, penalties,
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any Litigation as incurred, in connection with any claim, action
or proceeding arising out of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) to
the same extent such Persons are indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by
Promistar under Promistar's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws as in effect on
the date hereof, including provisions relating to advances of


                                       32
<PAGE>   38

expenses incurred in the defense of any Litigation. Without limiting the
foregoing, in any case in which approval of FNB is required to effectuate any
indemnification, FNB shall direct or cause such FNB Company to direct, at the
election of the Indemnified Party, that the determination of any such approval
shall be made by independent counsel mutually agreed upon between FNB and the
Indemnified Party. FNB shall, and shall cause all other relevant FNB Companies,
to apply such rights of indemnification in good faith and to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law.

         (b)      Prior to Closing, Promistar shall purchase for, and on behalf
of, its current and former officers and directors, extended coverage under the
current directors' and officers' liability insurance policy maintained by
Promistar to provide for continued coverage of such insurance for a period of
six years following the date of Closing with respect to matters occurring prior
to the Effective Time.

         (c)      If FNB or any of its successors or assigns shall consolidate
with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
Person of such consolidation or merger or shall transfer all or substantially
all of its assets to any Person, then and in each case, proper provision shall
be made so that the successors and assigns of FNB shall assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 8.14.

         (d)      The provisions of this Section 8.14 are intended to be for the
benefit of and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs
and representatives.

         8.15     Additional Reports. In accordance with Section 8.5, Promistar
and FNB shall each furnish to the other copies of any Promistar SEC Documents or
FNB SEC Documents, as the case may be, which it files with the SEC on or after
the date hereof, and Promistar and FNB, as the case may be, represents and
warrants that as of the respective dates thereof, such reports will not contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statement therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Any
unaudited consolidated interim financial statements included in such reports
(including any related notes and schedules) will fairly present, in all material
respects, the financial position of Promistar or FNB, as the case may be, as of
the dates thereof and the results of operations and changes in financial
position or other information included therein for the periods or as of the
dates then ended, in each case in accordance with past practice and GAAP
consistently applied during the periods involved (except that such unaudited
financial statement exclude footnote disclosures necessary for a fair
presentation which would make them in compliance with GAAP, and such financial
statements are subject, where appropriate, to normal year-end adjustments).

         8.16     Exemption from Liability under Section 16(b).

         (a)      Provided that Promistar delivers to FNB the Section 16
Information (as defined below) with respect to Promistar prior to the Effective
Time, the Board of Directors of FNB, or a committee of Non-Employee Directors
thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the
Exchange Act), will adopt a resolution in advance of the Effective Time
providing that the receipt by Promistar Insiders (as defined below) of FNB
Common Stock in exchange for shares of Promistar Common Stock, pursuant to the
transactions contemplated hereby and to the extent such securities are listed in
the Section 16 Information, are intended to be exempt from liability pursuant to
Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.

         (b)      "Section 16 Information" shall mean information accurate in
all respects regarding Promistar Insiders, the number of shares of Promistar
Common Stock or other Promistar equity securities deemed to be beneficially

         9.1      Conditions to Obligations of Each Party. The respective
obligations of each Party to perform this Agreement and consummate the Merger

registrations with, and notifications to, all Regulatory Authorities required
for consummation of the Merger shall have been obtained or made and shall be in
full force and effect and all waiting periods required by Law shall have
expired. No Consent obtained from any Regulatory Authority which is necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby shall be conditioned or
restricted in a manner (including requirements relating to the raising of
additional capital or the disposition of Assets) which in the reasonable
judgment of the Board of Directors of either Party would so materially adversely
impact the economic or business benefits of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement that, had such condition or requirement been known, such Party
would not, in its reasonable judgment, have entered into this Agreement.

         (c)      Consents and Approvals. Other than filing the Florida Articles
of Merger and the Pennsylvania Articles of Merger, each Party shall have
obtained any and all Consents required for consummation of the Merger (other
than those referred to in Section 9.1(b) of this Agreement or listed in Section
9.1(c) of the Promistar Disclosure Memorandum) or for the preventing of any
default under any Contract or Permit of such Party which, if not obtained or
made, is reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on such Party.

         (d)      Legal Proceedings. No court or governmental or regulatory
authority of competent jurisdiction shall have enacted, issued, promulgated,
enforced, or entered any Law or Order (whether temporary, preliminary, or
permanent) or taken any other action which prohibits, restricts, or makes
illegal consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

the Internal Revenue Code and (ii) the exchange in the Merger of Promistar
Common Stock for FNB Common Stock will not give rise to gain or loss to the
shareholders of Promistar with respect to such exchange (except to the extent of
any cash received). In rendering such Tax Opinion, such counsel shall be
entitled to rely upon representations of officers of Promistar and FNB
reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to such counsel.

warranties speak as of an earlier date) as of the Effective Time, except where
the failure of such representations and warranties to be so true and correct
(without giving effect to any limitation as to "materiality" or "Material
Adverse Effect" set forth therein) would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Promistar.

         (b)      Performance of Agreements and Covenants. Each and all of the
agreements and covenants of Promistar to be performed and complied with pursuant
to this Agreement and the other agreements contemplated hereby prior to the

request.

         (d)      Affiliates Agreements. FNB shall have received from each
affiliate of Promistar the affiliates letter referred to in Section 8.12 of this
Agreement, to the extent necessary to assure in the reasonable judgment of FNB

speak as of an earlier date) as of the Closing Date, except where the failure of
such representations and warranties to be so true and correct (without giving

         10.1     Termination. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, this Agreement may be terminated and the Merger abandoned at any time
prior to the Effective Time:

         (a)      By mutual written consent of the Board of Directors of FNB and
the Board of Directors of Promistar; or

         (b)      By the Board of Directors of either Party (provided that the

refuse to consummate the Merger pursuant to Section 9.2(a) or Section 9.3(a) of
this Agreement and (ii) is not in material breach of any covenant or other
agreement contained in this Agreement) in the event of an inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty of the other Party contained in this Agreement which
cannot be or has not been cured within 40 days after the giving of written
notice to the breaching Party of such inaccuracy and which inaccuracy would
provide the terminating Party the ability to refuse to consummate the Merger
pursuant to Section 9.2(a) or Section 9.3(a) of this Agreement; or


                                       36
<PAGE>   42

         (c)      By the Board of Directors of either Party in the event of a
material breach by the other Party of any covenant, agreement, or obligation
contained in this Agreement which breach cannot be or has not been cured within
40 days after the giving of written notice to the breaching Party of such
breach; or

         (d)      By the Board of Directors of either Party in the event (i) any
Consent of any Regulatory Authority required for consummation of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby shall have been denied by final
nonappealable action of such authority or if any action taken by such authority
is not appealed within the time limit for appeal, or (ii) the shareholders of
Promistar or FNB fail to vote their approval of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby as required by applicable Law; or

         (e)      By the Board of Directors of either Party in the event that
the Merger shall not have been consummated by March 31, 2002, if the failure to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby on or before such date is not
caused by any breach of this Agreement by the Party electing to terminate
pursuant to this Section 10.1(e); or

         (f)      By the Board of Directors of either Party (provided that the
terminating Party is not then in breach of any representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement under the applicable standard set forth in Section
9.2(a) of this Agreement in the case of Promistar and Section 9.3(a) in the case
of FNB or in material breach of any covenant or other agreement contained in
this Agreement) in the event that any of the conditions precedent to the
obligations of such Party to consummate the Merger cannot be satisfied or
fulfilled by the date specified in Section 10.1(e) of this Agreement; or

         (g)      By Promistar on any date during the four business day period
commencing on the first day following the Approval Date, if both of the
following conditions are satisfied on such date:

                  (1)      the FNB Ratio on such date shall be less than 0.80;
         and

                  (2)      the FNB Ratio on such date shall be less than the
         difference obtained by subtracting 0.15 from the Index Ratio on such
         date;

         subject, however, to the following three sentences. If Promistar
determines not to consummate the Merger pursuant to this Section 10.1(g), it
shall give prompt written notice of its election to terminate to FNB, which
notice may be withdrawn at any time prior to the lapse of the four business day
period commencing on the Approval Date. During the five business day period
commencing on the date of its receipt of such notice (the "Adjustment Date"),
FNB shall have the option to elect to increase the Exchange Ratio to a number
equal to the Adjusted Exchange Ratio. The election contemplated by the preceding
sentence shall be made by giving notice to Promistar of such election and of the
Adjusted Exchange Ratio, whereupon no termination shall have occurred pursuant
to this Section 10.1(g), and this Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance
with its terms (except as the Exchange Ratio shall have been so modified), and
any references in this Agreement to "Exchange Ratio" shall thereafter be deemed
to refer to Adjusted Exchange Ratio.

                  (2)      a number (rounded to the nearest one one-thousandth)
         equal to the product of (A) the Exchange Ratio (as then in effect)
         multiplied by (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Index Radio
         on the Approval Date less 0.15, and the denominator of which is the FNB
         Ratio on the Approval Date.

         "FNB Price," with respect to any particular date, shall mean the

the weights (which have been determined based upon market capitalizations on May
18, 2001) shall be redistributed proportionately (based on market
capitalizations on May 18, 2001) for purposes of determining the Index Price.
The weight attributed to each of the entities composing the Index Group is set
forth on Exhibit 6 hereto. If any entity belonging to the Index Group or FNB
declares or effects a stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization,
split-up, combination, exchange of shares, or similar transaction between the
date hereof and the Adjustment Date, the prices for the common stock of such
entity or FNB shall be appropriately adjusted for the purposes of applying this
Section 10.1(g).

         "Index Price," with respect to any particular date, shall mean the
weighted average (weighted in accordance with the "Percentage Weighting" set
forth on Exhibit 6 hereto) of the closing sales prices of the companies

10.2 and Sections 8.5 and 11.1 of this Agreement shall survive any such

event of any termination of this Agreement following the occurrence of an
Initial Triggering Event (as defined in the Stock Option Agreement), FNB shall
