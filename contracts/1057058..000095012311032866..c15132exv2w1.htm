(a) The Purchase Price is: Two Hundred Ninety-Nine Million Dollars
($299,000,000), (i) minus any Closing Date Debt, (ii) _plus_ or _minus_ , as
applicable, that amount by which (A) the Closing Date Current Assets, _minus_

(the " _Working Capital Deficit_ ") the Closing Date Current Liabilities,

(the " _Cap Ex Expenditures_ ") of less than Five Million Three
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($5,300,000) (any such lesser dollar amount being
referred to as, the " _Cap Ex Deficit_ "), as such Cap Ex Expenditures are
described in County Wastes 2011 capital budget, a copy of which is attached
hereto as Exhibit B (the " _Budget_ "), (iv) _plus_ that dollar amount, if
any, by which the Hudson Valley Group Companies shall have incurred, between

purchase price actually paid by any Hudson Valley Group Company to any third
party(ies) (the " _New Business Aggregate Net Purchase Price_ ")
in connection with the purchase and sale, between March 1, 2011 and the
Closing Date, of all or substantially all of the assets of any solid waste
business owned by a non-Affiliated third party (each, a " _Pre-Closing
Acquisition_ "), provided that WCI shall have given its prior
written approval to any such purchase and sale as required pursuant to
Section 5.2(h). The Shareholders shall provide to WCI, within three business
days prior to the Signing Date and the Closing Date, a good faith estimate of
the amounts for each of the items described in clauses (i) through (v)
of this Section 1.2(a), it being acknowledged and agreed that the estimates
of Closing Date Current Assets and Closing Date Current Liabilities shall be
calculated in accordance with GAAP and Sections 3.22(b) and 3.22(c) and the
principles set forth on Schedule 3.22(b) and Exhibit C. 

  

(b) At Closing, the following portion of the Purchase Price shall be paid to
the Shareholders in immediately available funds by wire transfer in the
respective amounts set forth on the Closing Statement: Two Hundred Ninety-
Nine Million Dollars ($299,000,000), (i) _minus_ the estimated Closing Date
Debt, (ii) _plus_ or _minus_ , as applicable, the estimated Working
Capital Deficit or Working Capital Surplus, (iii) _minus_ any Cap Ex Deficit,
(iv) _plus_ any Cap Ex Surplus, (v) plus the New Business Aggregate Net

(c) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date (the " _True Up Date_ "),
WCI and Dan Lombardi, the Chief Financial Officer of County Waste as of the
Signing Date (the " _CFO_ "), shall jointly determine the actual amounts
for each of the items referred to in clauses (i) through (v) in Section
1.2(a) and agree on the final Purchase Price Adjustments as set forth in
Section 1.2(d), it being acknowledged and agreed that the calculations of
Closing Date Current Assets and Closing Date Current Liabilities shall
be finally determined in accordance with GAAP, Sections 1.2(d)(iii),
1.2(d)(iv), 3.22(b) and 3.22(c) and the principles set forth on Schedule
3.22(b) and Exhibit C; provided, however, that the ten percent (10%)
retainage amount that is payable under the Material Contract with Global
Foundry shall be deemed to have been received even if not actually received
by the True Up Date (unless the reason for such 

  

Stock Purchase Agreement 
 Hudson Valley Waste Holding, Inc.  

 

    ##### 

  

  

amount not having been actually received is due to a breach by a Hudson
Valley Group Company of such Material Contract on or prior to the Closing
Date) (the " _True Up Calculations_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, there
will be no Purchase Price Adjustments for any accounts receivable that are
collected or uncollected after the True Up Calculations are finally
determined as set forth hereunder. No credit notes, rebates or discounts may
be applied to such accounts receivable. Also, collections shall be applied
first to the oldest receivable unless specifically identified. The
Shareholders may retain, at the Shareholders sole expense, the CFO as an
independent contractor to assist with the True Up Calculations and WCI shall
provide the CFO with access to the books and accounts of the Hudson Valley
Group Companies for that purpose. WCI will provide the Shareholders
Representatives with the True Up Calculations within ten (10) days after they
are completed. If the Shareholders Representatives accepts the True Up
Calculations, or if the Shareholders Representatives fail to give notice to
WCI of any objection within ten (10) days after receipt of the True Up
Calculations, the True Up Calculations shall be the final and binding
calculation of the Purchase Price adjustments set forth in Section 1.2(d)
(the " _Adjustments_ "). If WCI and the CFO cannot agree on the True Up
Calculations within the True Up Period or the Shareholders Representatives
give notice to WCI of an objection to the True Up Calculations within ten
(10) days after receipt of the True Up Calculations, WCI and
the Shareholders Representatives shall attempt in good faith to resolve any
such matters in dispute. The Shareholders Representatives shall have the
right to audit (or have the Hudson Valley Group Companies former accountants
audit), at the Shareholders sole expense, the books and records of the
Hudson Valley Group Companies related to the True Up Calculations. If WCI and
the Shareholders Representatives are able to resolve the matters in dispute,
the True Up Calculations, as modified to reflect the resolution of any
matters in dispute, shall be the final and binding calculation of the
Purchase Price Adjustments. If, however, WCI and the
Shareholders Representatives are unable to resolve the matters in dispute,
WCI and the Shareholders Representatives shall submit any disputed items to
an independent certified public accountant reasonably satisfactory to WCI and
the Shareholders Representatives for a resolution of the dispute, the cost
of which shall be shared equally by WCI and the Shareholders. The
determination of the independent certified public accountant shall be final
and binding on WCI and the Shareholders Representatives, and the True Up
Calculations, as modified to reflect (A) those differences, if any, that WCI
and the Shareholders Representatives were able to resolve, and (B) the
independent certified public accountants determination with regard to the
remaining disputed items, shall be the final and binding resolution of the
Purchase Price Adjustments, absent manifest error. 

  

(d) The following Purchase Price Adjustments, as applicable, shall be made
within two (2) business days after the True Up Calculations are finally
determined pursuant to Section 1.2(c): 

  

(i) If the actual Closing Date Debt as determined by the True Up Calculations
is less than the estimated Closing Date Debt as set forth on Schedule
3.22(a), WCI shall within two (2) business days pay an amount equal to the
difference to the Shareholders _pro rata_ in accordance with Schedule 3.2 or
as otherwise instructed in writing by the Shareholders Representatives. 

  

(ii) If the actual Closing Date Debt as determined by the True Up Calculations
exceeds the estimated Closing Date Debt as set forth on Schedule 3.22(a), the

Shareholders based on their _pro rata_ share in accordance with Schedule 3.2)
shall within two (2) business days pay an amount equal to the excess to WCI.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, each of the parties
hereto shall use reasonable efforts in good faith to take, or cause to be
taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective

materially adverse financial burden or operating condition on WCI. 

  

(b) In the event any litigation is commenced between the Signing Date and the
Closing Date against any Hudson Valley Group Company by any person or entity
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, WCI shall have
the right, at its own expense, to participate therein, and no Hudson Valley
Group Company will settle any such litigation without the consent of WCI,
which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. 

  

9.2 Confidentiality. Neither the Hudson Valley Group Companies nor the
Shareholders shall disclose or make any public announcement of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written consent
of WCI, unless required to make such disclosure or announcement by Law or in
connection with any HSR Act filing, in which event the party making the
disclosure or announcement shall provide written notice to WCI at least
twenty-four (24) hours before such disclosure or announcement is expected to
be made. 

  

9.3 Brokers and Finders Fees. Each of the Shareholders shall pay or cause to

9.5 Tax Returns. 

  

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing, the Shareholders
shall prepare, at their sole cost and expense, all short year federal, state,
county, local and foreign tax returns for each Hudson Valley Group Company
for the period beginning with the first day of each such companys fiscal
year in which the Closing occurs and ending on the Closing Date. Such
return shall (a) be prepared consistent with past practice by Williams and
Lombardi CPA (or, if unavailable, another tax or accounting firm reasonably
acceptable to WCI); (b) not, without WCIs prior written consent, contain any
elections that would have an adverse effect on the financial condition or
tax position of any Hudson Valley Group Company after the Closing Date; (c)
compute any penalties and interest due with the return; and (d) be delivered
to WCI together with all necessary supporting schedules within ninety (90)
days following the Closing Date (or at least sixty (60) days prior to the
date on which such return is required to be filed, if earlier) for WCIs
approval prior to its filing (but such approval shall not relieve the
Shareholders of their responsibility for the Taxes assessed under these
returns). The Shareholders shall be responsible for the execution of
the returns and payment of all Taxes, _pro rata_ in accordance with Schedule
3.2,shown to be due or that may come to be due on such returns or otherwise
relating to the period prior to the Closing Date, except to the extent

Shareholders shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes of each Hudson Valley
Group Company that are allocable to the pre-Closing portion of Straddle
Periods,  _pro rata_ in accordance with Schedule 3.2, except to the extent
included in the calculation of Closing Date Current Liabilities. With respect
to a Straddle Period, the parties hereto will, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, elect with the relevant taxing authorities to treat for
all purposes the Closing Date as the last day of a taxable period of each
Hudson Valley Group Company. In any case where applicable law does not permit
any Hudson Valley Group Company to treat the Closing Date as the last day of
a taxable period, then for purposes of this Agreement, the portion of such
Taxes that is attributable to the pre-Closing portion of a Straddle Period
shall be (i) in the case of Taxes that are not based on income or gross
receipts, the total amount of such Taxes for the period in question
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the
period up to the Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the total
number of days in the entire period in question, and (ii) in the case of
Taxes that are based on income or gross receipts, the Taxes that would be due
with respect to the period up to the Closing Date, as if such period were a
taxable period.

9.6 General Release by Shareholders. Each Shareholder (and, if applicable,
such Shareholder in his, her or its capacity as an officer, director and/or
manager of any Hudson Valley Group Company) hereby fully releases and
discharges each Hudson Valley Group Company and its directors, officers,
agents and employees from all rights, claims and actions, known or unknown, of
any kind whatsoever (including any right any Shareholder has to
indemnification by any Hudson Valley Group Company), which such Shareholder
(and, if applicable, such Shareholder in his, her or its capacity as an
officer, director and/or manager of any Hudson Valley Group Company) now has
against any Hudson Valley Group Company and its directors, officers, agents
and employees, arising out of or relating to events arising prior to or on
the Closing Date, except to the extent such indemnification rights, claims
and actions are covered by a "tail" insurance policy in favor of
the Shareholders and directors which is in effect on the Closing Date and
which remains in effect thereafter. Specifically, but not by way of
limitation, each Shareholder (and, if applicable, such Shareholder in his,
her or its capacity as an officer, director and/or manager of any Hudson
Valley Group Company) waives any right of indemnification, contribution or
other recourse against any Hudson Valley Group Company which he now has or
may hereafter have against any Hudson Valley Group Company with respect to
representations, warranties or covenants made in this Agreement by any Hudson
Valley Group Company, except to the extent such indemnification rights, claims
and actions are covered by a "tail" insurance policy in favor of the
Shareholders and directors which is in effect on the Closing Date and which

and exercise any and all rights which such Shareholder or Shareholders are
permitted or required to do or exercise under this Agreement and the other
agreements, documents and certificates executed in connection herewith. Each
of the Shareholders agrees that such agency and proxy are coupled with an
interest, are therefore irrevocable without the consent of the Shareholders
Representatives and shall survive the death, bankruptcy or other incapacity
of any Shareholder. 

  

(c) Each of the Shareholders hereby agrees that any amendment or waiver under
this Agreement, and any action taken on behalf of the Shareholders to enforce
the rights of the Shareholders under this Agreement, and any action taken
with respect to any Claim (including any action taken to object to, defend,
compromise or agree to the payment of such Claim), shall be effective
if approved in writing by the Shareholders Representatives, and that each
and every action so taken shall be binding and conclusive on every
Shareholder, whether or not such Shareholder had notice of, or approved, such
amendment or waiver.

of a majority of the Holding Companys Stock immediately prior to the
Closing, a successor representative to fill such vacancy, shall provide
prompt written notice to WCI of such change and such substituted
representative, together with any existing representative, shall then be
deemed to be a Shareholders Representative for all purposes of this
Agreement. 

   

10\. INDEMNIFICATION 

  

10.1 Indemnity by the Principal Shareholder. The Principal Shareholder,
subject to the limitations set forth in Section 10.4, covenants and agrees
that he will indemnify and hold harmless WCI and its Affiliates, each Hudson
Valley Group Company, and their respective directors, officers, agents,
successors and assigns (individually a " _WCI Indemnitee_ " and
collectively the " _WCI Indemnitees_ "), from and after the Signing Date,
against any and all losses, damages (including exemplary damages),
assessments, fines, penalties, adjustments, liabilities, claims,
deficiencies, costs and expenses (including specifically, reasonable
attorneys fees, court costs, witness fees and expenses of investigation)
(collectively, " _Damages_ "), suffered or incurred by any WCI Indemnitee
arising from, in connection with or related to any of the events, matters
or contingencies set forth below or in Section 10.2 (each, a " _WCI Indemnity
Event_ ", and collectively, the " _WCI Indemnity Events_ "): 

  

(a) Any misrepresentation, breach of warranty, or nonfulfillment of any
agreement or covenant on the part of any Shareholder or any Hudson Valley
Group Company pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any Exhibit or
Schedule attached hereto. 

  

(b) Any Environmental Site Losses at any Environmental Site (as hereinafter
defined). " _Environmental Site Losses_ " shall mean any and all Damages and
expenditures (including expenses in connection with site evaluations, risk
assessments and feasibility studies), arising out of or required by an
interim or final judicial or administrative decree, judgment,
injunction, mandate, interim or final permit condition or restriction, cease
and desist order, abatement order, compliance order, consent order, clean-up
order, exhumation order, reclamation order or any other remedial action that
is required to be undertaken under federal, state or local law in respect
of operating activities on or affecting any Environmental Site, including (i)
any actual or alleged violation of any law or regulation respecting the
protection of the environment, including RCRA and CERCLA and (ii) any
remedies or violations, whether by a private or public action, alleged
or sought to be assessed as a consequence, directly or indirectly, of any
Hazardous Material existing, on or prior to the Closing, at any Environmental
Site, whether or not any Release resulting from any such Hazardous Material
Release is into the air, water (including groundwater) or land. "
_Environmental Site_ " shall mean any Facility, UST and other waste storage,
processing, treatment or disposal facility, and any other business site or
other real property owned, leased, controlled, operated or used by any Hudson
Valley Group Company or by any predecessor thereof prior to the Closing. The
term " _Release_ " shall mean any spilling, leaking, pumping,
pouring, emitting, emptying, discharging, injecting, escaping, leaching,
dumping or disposing into the ambient environment. Notwithstanding anything
in this Section to the contrary, a Release composed solely of Hazardous
Material contained in household waste lawfully disposed of in a landfill
during the time any Hudson Valley Group Company owned and/or operated such
landfill does not constitute an Environmental Site Loss.

(a) Any misrepresentation or breach of any representation or warranty set

nonperformance of any covenant in Section 9.3, 9.5 or 11.1; provided, however,

deemed an Absolute Obligation. 

  

(b) Any Taxes incurred by any Hudson Valley Group Company for periods prior to
or ending on the Closing Date to the extent such Taxes exceed the reserve

paid by WCI pursuant to Section 1.2(d)(ix). 

  

(c) Any Closing Date Debt or any claim by any person for brokerage or finders

Shareholder Indemnitee arising from, in connection with or related to any
misrepresentation, breach of warranty, or nonfulfillment of any agreement or

10.4 Limitations on the Parties Indemnification Obligations. 

  

(a) The obligation of the Principal Shareholder to indemnify the WCI
Indemnitees for Damages as provided in Section 10.1 shall only apply after
the aggregate amount of such obligations exceeds One Million Four Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($1,400,000) (the " _General Deductible Amount_ "), and then
only for the amount by which such Damages exceed the General Deductible
Amount. The Principal Shareholder shall have no obligation to make any
payment for Damages as provided in Section 10.1 for any single claim unless
the amount of the Damages with respect to such claim is at least Fifty
Thousand Dollars ($50,000) (the " _Minimum Claim Amount_ "). Notwithstanding
any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, neither the General
Deductible Amount nor the Minimum Claim Amount shall apply to any
indemnification obligations on account of Misconduct or any breach or
nonperformance of any Absolute Obligations. 

  

(b) Notwithstanding any disclosure contained in the Disclosure Schedule to
qualify any representation or warranty related to any Absolute Obligation,
BUT SUBJECT TO SECTION 10.11 (NO DOUBLE RECOVERY), any Damages related to,
arising from or in connection with the subject matter so disclosed shall be
subject to indemnification pursuant to this Article 10 as if the disclosure
had not been made. By way of illustration but not limitation, if a disclosure
is made that a Hudson Valley Group Company is delinquent in the payment of
any Taxes arising with respect to a pre-Closing period, the Shareholders
shall be liable (ON TERMS, AND SUBJECT TO THE CONDITIONS, SET FORTH IN THIS
AGREEMENT) for such Taxes notwithstanding the disclosure that was made. In the
event that a representation contained in this Agreement is breached and such
representation is qualified by words or phrases such as "material," "material
adverse effect," "materially," "immaterial," "immaterially," "nonmaterial,"
"substantially," or words of similar import, such qualifiers shall be
disregarded for purposes of calculating the amount of any obligation of
indemnity arising pursuant to this Article 10\. Absent Misconduct and except
with respect to Damages arising from, in connection with or related to the
breach of any of the Absolute Obligations, the maximum amount that the WCI
Indemnitees can recover as a result of one or more WCI Indemnity Events
pursuant to the provisions hereof for Damages or Claims shall not in the
aggregate exceed Twenty Million Dollars ($20,000,000) (the " _General
Indemnity Cap_ "). Absent Misconduct, with respect to Damages based on,
arising from or related to the breach or nonperformance of any of the
Absolute Obligations or the breach or nonperformance by WCI of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements hereunder, the
maximum amount that any of the Indemnitees can recover shall not in the
aggregate exceed Thirty-Five Million Dollars ($35,000,000) (the " _Absolute
Indemnity Cap_ "), it being acknowledged and agreed that, in the case of the
liability of the Outside Shareholders, such recovery for Damages shall be
allocated among all of the Shareholders _pro rata_ in accordance with Schedule
3.2 or as otherwise instructed in writing by the Shareholders
Representatives and (i) the Outside Shareholders shall only be liable to WCI
or any Indemnitee for their respective _pro rata_ shares of Damages as
aforesaid, and (ii) the maximum aggregate liability of the Outside
Shareholders to make payment for Damages shall not exceed their respective
_pro rata_ shares of the Absolute Indemnity Cap. For the avoidance of doubt
and notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Principal Shareholder shall be liable for, and each WCI Indemnitee may
recover against the Principal Shareholder for, the entire amount of Damages
subject to indemnification hereunder, subject to the General Liability Cap or
the Absolute Indemnity Cap, if and as applicable. For the purposes of this
Section 10, " _Misconduct_ " shall mean fraud, fraudulent inducement,
misappropriation or intentional misrepresentation or concealment.

10.5 Notice of Indemnity Claim. 

  

(a) In the event that any claim (" _Claim_ ") is hereafter asserted against or
arises with respect to, as applicable, any WCI Indemnitee or Shareholder
Indemnitee (each, an " _Indemnitee_ ") as to which an Indemnitee may be
entitled to indemnification hereunder, the Indemnitee shall notify (i) the
Shareholders Representatives, if the Indemnitee is a WCI Indemnitee, or (ii)
WCI, if the Indemnitee is a Shareholder Indemnitee (each, an "
_Indemnifying Party_ "), in writing thereof (the " _Claims Notice_ ") within
sixty (60) days after (i) receipt of written notice of commencement of any
third party litigation against the Indemnitee (a " _Third Party Claim_ ");
(ii) receipt by the Indemnitee of written notice of any Third Party Claim
pursuant to an invoice, notice of claim or assessment against the Indemnitee;
or (iii) the Indemnitee becomes aware of the existence of any other event in
respect of which indemnification may be sought from the Indemnifying Party
(including any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty or breach of any
covenant). The Claims Notice shall describe the Claim and the specific facts
and circumstances in reasonable detail, and shall indicate the amount, if
known, or an estimate, if possible, of the losses that have been or may be
incurred or suffered by the Indemnitee. The failure to timely deliver a
Claims Notice pursuant to this Section 10.5(a) or otherwise notify the
Indemnifying Party of the commencement of such actions in accordance with
the terms hereof shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from the obligation
to indemnify hereunder, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 10.4,
except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party establishes by competent
evidence that it has been prejudiced thereby. 

  

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the defense of any
Third Party Claim with the Indemnifying Partys own counsel (which counsel
shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee) if the Indemnifying Party
provides written notice of its election to assume such defense within thirty
(30) days after the Indemnifying Party has received a Claims Notice
with respect to such Third Party Claim and such Third Party Claim is solely
for money damages and the cumulative total of all Claims (including such
Claim) does not exceed the Indemnity Cap at the time the Claim is made;
provided, however, the Indemnifying Party must conduct the defense of the
Third Party Claim actively and diligently in order to preserve
the Indemnifying Partys rights and rights of the Indemnitee. The Indemnitee
may participate, at the Indemnitees own expense, in the defense of any Claim
assumed by the Indemnifying Party. 

  

(c) If, within thirty (30) days of the Indemnifying Partys receipt of a
Claims Notice, the Indemnifying Party shall not have elected to defend the
Third Party Claim or if the Indemnifying Party fails to diligently defend the
Third Party Claim, the Indemnitee shall have the right to assume control of
the defense and/or compromise of such Third Party Claim subject to
Section 10.5(f), and the costs and expenses of such defense, including
reasonable attorneys fees, shall be added to the Claim. The Indemnifying
Party shall promptly, and in any event within thirty (30) days after demand
therefor, reimburse the Indemnitee for the costs of defending the Third
Party Claim, including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses.

(d) The party assuming the defense of any Claim shall keep the other party
reasonably informed at all times of the progress and development of its or
their defense of and compromise efforts with respect to such Claim and shall
furnish the other party with copies of all relevant pleadings, correspondence
and other papers. In addition, the parties to this Agreement shall cooperate
with each other and make available to each other and their representatives
all available relevant records or other materials required by them for their
use in defending, compromising or contesting any Claim. The failure to timely
deliver a Claims Notice or otherwise notify the Indemnifying Party of the
commencement of such actions in accordance with this Section 10.5 shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party from the obligation to indemnify hereunder
except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party establishes by competent
evidence that it has been prejudiced thereby. 

  

(e) If the Indemnified Person undertakes the investigation and defense of a
Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will not be bound by any
determination of the Third Party Claim or any compromise or settlement of the
Third Party Claim effected without the consent of the Indemnifying Party
(which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). 

  

(f) The Indemnifying Party will not consent to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any settlement with respect to the Third-Party Claim without the
prior consent of the Indemnitee (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) unless the judgment or proposed settlement (i) includes
an unconditional release of all liability of each Indemnitee with respect to
such Third Party Claim, and (ii) involves only the payment of money damages
by the Indemnifying Party and does not impose an injunction or other
equitable relief upon the Indemnitee or impose any restrictions on the
operation of the business of the Indemnitee or Affiliates of the
Indemnitee. So long as the Indemnifying Party has assumed and is conducting
the defense of the Third-Party Claim in accordance with Section 10.5(b)
above, the Indemnitee will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement with respect to the Third-Party Claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed by the Indemnifying Party). 

  

(g) In the event both the Indemnitee and the Indemnifying Party are named as
defendants in a Third Party Claim, they shall both be represented by the same
counsel (on whom they shall agree), unless such counsel, the Indemnitee or
the Indemnifying Party shall determine that such counsel has a conflict of
interest in representing both the Indemnitee and the Indemnifying Party in
the same action or proceeding and the Indemnitee and the Indemnifying Party
do not waive such conflict to the satisfaction of such counsel. 

  

(h) A Claims Notice delivered to the Shareholders Representative shall be
deemed delivered to each Shareholder, and actions required to be taken by any
Shareholder in its, his or her capacity as an Indemnifying Party shall be
taken by the Shareholders Representatives on behalf of the Indemnifying
Party.

10.6 Survival of Representations and Warranties and Indemnification
Obligations. The representations and warranties set forth in Articles 3 and 4
shall survive the Closing; provided, however, that the indemnity and other
obligations of the Principal Shareholder arising under Section 10.1 shall
survive the Closing for a period of twelve (12) months and thereupon
shall terminate, unless a Claims Notice shall have been delivered with
respect thereto within such period; and provided, further, that (a) the
indemnity and other obligations of all the Shareholders arising in connection
with any Misconduct or breach or nonperformance of any Absolute
Obligations under Section 10.2 or any of their respective post-termination or
post-Closing covenants, and (b) the indemnity and other obligations of WCI
arising in connection with any Misconduct or breach or nonperformance of any
of its representations or warranties or post-termination or post-
Closing covenants shall survive the Closing for the period of the applicable
statute of limitations, unless in each such case a Claims Notice shall have
been delivered with respect thereto within such period. For the avoidance of
doubt, no obligation of an Indemnifying Party to indemnify and hold harmless
an Indemnitee hereunder shall terminate with respect to any matter as to which
the Indemnitee shall have, before the expiration of the applicable period,
previously made a claim by delivering a notice (stating in reasonable detail
the basis of such claim) to the Indemnitee. 

  

10.7 No Exhaustion of Remedies or Subrogation. Subject to the terms of Section
10.4, each Shareholder waives any right to require any Indemnitee to (a)
proceed against any Hudson Valley Group Company or any Shareholder; (b)
proceed against any other person; or (c) pursue any other remedy whatsoever
in the power of any Indemnitee. 

  

10.8 Exclusion of Other Remedies. Except in the case of Misconduct or as
otherwise set forth in Section 12.15, the rights to indemnification set forth
in this Article 10 constitute the only remedy of the Indemnitees for any
breach or nonperformance by any Indemnifying Party of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements under this Agreement. The parties
may exercise their rights of termination in Section 2. 

  

10.9 No Waiver. Nothing in this Agreement in any was restricts or limits the
right of any Indemnifying Party to claim Damages for the failure of any
Indemnitee to comply with any general obligation at Law of any Person to
mitigate any loss which it may suffer or incur by reason of the breach by any
Party of any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of such Party
under this Agreement. 

  

10.10 Adjustment to Purchase Price. Any indemnification payment made by an
Indemnifying Party under this Article 10 is a dollar-for-dollar decrease in
the Purchase Price. 

  

10.11 No Double Recovery. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, no Indemnitee shall be entitled to double recovery for any
claims even though they may have resulted from the breach of more than one of
the representations, warranties, covenants and obligations of the
Indemnifying Party in this Agreement. No Shareholder shall have any liability
or obligation with respect to any claim for indemnification to the extent
that such matter was reflected as an adjustment to the Purchase Price in
Section 1.2.

10.12 Liability of Shareholders. Notwithstanding any provision in this
Agreement to the contrary, for the purposes of this Agreement, (i) in any
provision which purports to make the Outside Shareholders jointly liable to
make any payment, whether on account of taxes, brokers fees, expenses or
otherwise (including Section 5.7, Section 9.3, Section 9.5 and Section 12.7),
the liability of the Outside Shareholders shall be _pro rata_ among all of
the Shareholders in accordance with Schedule 3.2, (ii) no Outside Shareholder
shall be liable to WCI or any Indemnitee for a breach of covenant by any
Shareholder other than itself, (iii) no Outside Shareholder shall be liable
to WCI or any Indemnitee for any breach of representation or warranty other
than an Absolute Representation as provided in Section 10.2, and (iv) the
Principal Shareholder shall be jointly and severally liable to the WCI
Indemnitees for any Damages subject to indemnification pursuant to
this Article 10, and any WCI Indemnitee may recover from the Principal
Shareholder, and the Principal Shareholder shall pay to the WCI Indemnitees,
the entire amount of Damages arising from, in connection with or related to
any WCI Indemnitee Event subject to indemnification pursuant to this Article
10 (even if such Damages exceed the Principal Shareholders _pro rata_ portion
of such Damages), and, with respect to any WCI Indemnity Event set forth in
Section 10.2, the Principal Shareholder may seek reimbursement from the Other
Shareholders _pro rata_ in accordance with Schedule 3.2.

respective Affiliates shall keep secret and retain in strictest confidence,

11.2 Rights and Remedies On Breach. If any Shareholder or Affiliate of the
Shareholder breaches, or threatens to commit a breach of, any of the
provisions of Section 11.1 (the " _Restrictive Covenants_ "), WCI shall have
the following rights and remedies, each of which rights and remedies shall be
independent of the others and severally enforceable, and each of which is in
addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights and remedies available to
WCI at law or in equity: 

  

(a) _Specific Performance_. Each Shareholder (other than Clairvest and its
Affiliates, except in the case of a breach of Section 11.1(b)) agrees that
any breach or threatened breach of the Restrictive Covenants would cause
irreparable injury to WCI and that money damages would not provide an
adequate remedy to WCI. Accordingly, in addition to any other rights or
remedies, WCI shall be entitled to exercise the remedies set forth in Section
12.15 and 12.16. 

  

(b) _Accounting_. The right and remedy to require each Shareholder to account
for and pay over to WCI all compensation, profits, monies, accruals,
increments or other benefits derived or received by a Shareholder as the
result of any transactions constituting a breach of the Restrictive
Covenants. 

  

(c) _Severability of Covenants_. Each Shareholder (other than Clairvest and
its Affiliates) acknowledges and agrees that the Restrictive Covenants are
reasonable and valid in prohibited business activity and geographical and
temporal scope and in all other respects. If the business activities, period
of time or geographical area covered by the Restrictive Covenants should be
deemed too extensive, then the parties intend that the Restrictive Covenants
be construed to cover the maximum scope of business activities, period of
time and geographical area (not exceeding those specifically set forth
herein), if any, as may be permissible under applicable law. 

  

(d) _Blue-Penciling_. If any court determines that any of the Restrictive
Covenants, or any part thereof, is unenforceable because of the scope of the
business activities covered, the duration or the geographic area, such court
shall reduce the scope duration or area of such provision, as the case may
be, to the minimum extent necessary to render it enforceable and, in
its reduced form, such provision shall then be enforced. 

  

(e) _Enforceability in Jurisdiction_. WCI and the Shareholders (other than
Clairvest) intend to and hereby confer jurisdiction to enforce the
Restrictive Covenants on the courts of any jurisdiction within the geographic
scope of the Restrictive Covenants. If the courts of any one or more of such
jurisdictions hold the Restrictive Covenants unenforceable by reason of the
breadth of such scope or otherwise, such determination shall not bar or in any
way affect WCIs right to the relief provided above in the courts of any
other jurisdiction within the geographic scope of the Restrictive Covenants
as to breaches of such covenants in such other respective jurisdictions, such
covenants as they relate to each jurisdiction being, for this purpose,
severable into diverse and independent covenants.
