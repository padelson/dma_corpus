Representative and otherwise in accordance with this Agreement and the
Representative shall provide Parent with wire instructions therefor at least

Preference_ ") to an account designated by the Representative (for
distribution to the holders of Company Preferred Shares) at least two (2)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date;

  

(vi) an amount equal to the aggregate Per Share Common Payment with respect to
each Company Common Share issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to

Company Common Shares) at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date; and

  

(vii) an amount equal to the aggregate Option Payments with respect to each

other means customary for such jurisdiction (but in any event in accordance
with Applicable Law) and subject to the delivery of any tax forms (including
the delivery of an applicable Tax form to the extent required by Applicable
Law and to the extent that such non‑U.S. holder has not already provided an
applicable Tax form to the Company).

  

No later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing, the Representative
shall deliver to Parent a statement setting forth that the aggregate amount
required to be paid by Parent (or its Affiliate) pursuant to each of clauses
_(v)_ , _(vi)_ and _(vii)_ of this _Section 2.9(a)_ (the " _Seller Proceeds_
") _and the Option Payment payable to each holder of Vested Company Options_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (I) Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to rely on such statement and the information
provided therein by the Representative in all respects without any further
inquiry by Parent, (II) upon the payment of the Seller Proceeds by Parent (or
its Affiliate) pursuant to clauses _(v)_ , _(vi)_ and _(vii)_ of this _Section

Option Payments pursuant to _Section 2.9(a)(vii)_ or any payments pursuant to

(b) _Determination of Final Purchase Price_.

  

(i) As soon as practicable, but no later than 60 days after the Closing Date,
Parent shall prepare and deliver to the Representative, Parent's good faith
proposed calculations (which calculations shall collectively be referred to
herein as the " _Proposed Closing Date Calculations_ ") of each of (A) the Net
Working Capital, (B) the amount of Cash and Cash Equivalents, (C) the amount
of Closing Date Funded Indebtedness, (D) the amount of Unpaid Transaction
Expenses and (E) the Purchase Price, in each case, including reasonably
detailed calculations of the components thereof and in a manner consistent
with the definitions thereof. Parent agrees to prepare the Proposed Closing
Date Calculations in a manner consistent with the Accounting Principles. If
Parent fails to deliver the Proposed Closing Date Calculations within such 60
day period, then, at the election of the Representative in its sole
discretion, the Actual Adjustment shall be deemed to equal zero; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Representative reserves any and all other rights granted
to it in this Agreement.

  

(ii) If the Representative does not give written notice of any dispute (a "
_Purchase Price Dispute Notice_ ") to Parent within 30 days of receiving the
Proposed Closing Date Calculations, the parties hereto agree that the Proposed
Closing Date Calculations shall be deemed to set forth the final Net Working
Capital, Cash and Cash Equivalents, Closing

  

  

    

Date Funded Indebtedness, Unpaid Transaction Expenses and the Purchase Price,
in each case, for purposes of determining the Actual Adjustment. Prior to the
end of such 30‑day period, the Representative may accept the Proposed Closing
Date Calculations by delivering written notice to that effect to Parent, in
which case the Purchase Price will be finally determined when such notice is
given. If the Representative gives a Purchase Price Dispute Notice to Parent
within such 30‑day period, Parent and the Representative shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to resolve the disputes during the 30‑day
period commencing on the date Parent receives the Purchase Price Dispute
Notice from the Representative. If the Representative and Parent do not agree
upon a final resolution with respect to any disputed items within such 30‑day
period, then the remaining items in dispute shall be submitted promptly to
Deloitte, or, if such firm declines to be retained to resolve the dispute,
another nationally‑recognized, independent accounting firm reasonably
acceptable to Parent and the Representative (in either case, the " _Accounting
Firm_ "), Any item not specifically submitted to the Accounting Firm for
evaluation shall be deemed final and binding on Parent and Representative (as
set forth in the Proposed Closing Date Calculations, the Purchase Price
Dispute Notice or as otherwise resolved in writing by Parent and the
Representative). The Accounting Firm shall be requested to render a
determination of each disputed item within 30 days after referral of the
matter to such Accounting Firm, which determination, must be in writing and
must set forth, in reasonable detail, the basis therefor and must be based
solely on (i) the definitions and other applicable provisions of this
Agreement, (ii) a single presentation (which presentations shall be limited to
the remaining items in dispute set forth in the Proposed Closing Date
Calculations and Purchase Price Dispute Notice) submitted by each of Parent
and the Representative to the Accounting Firm within 15 days after the
engagement thereof (which the Accounting Firm shall forward to Parent or the
Representative, as applicable) and (iii) one written response submitted to the
Accounting Firm within 10 Business Days after receipt of each such
presentation (which the Accounting Firm shall forward to Parent or the
Representative, as applicable), and not on independent review, which such
determination shall be conclusive and binding on each party to this Agreement
absent manifest error. The terms of appointment and engagement of the
Accounting Firm shall be as reasonably agreed upon between the Representative
and Parent, and any associated engagement fees shall be initially borne 50% by
the Representative and 50% by Parent; _provided_ that such fees shall
ultimately be borne by Parent and the Representative in the same proportion as
the aggregate amount of the disputed items that is unsuccessfully disputed by
each such party (as determined by the Accounting Firm) bears to the total
amount of the disputed items submitted to the Accounting Firm. Except as
provided in the preceding sentence, all other costs and expenses incurred by
the parties hereto in connection with resolving any dispute hereunder before
the Accounting Firm shall be borne by the party incurring such cost and
expense. The Accounting Firm will act as an expert and not as an arbitrator
and will address only such items that are in dispute. The scope of the
disputes to be resolved by the Accounting Firm shall be limited to whether
such calculation was done in accordance with the terms hereof, the accounting
methods, standards, policies, practices, classifications, estimation
methodologies, assumptions or procedures used to prepare the Proposed Closing
Date Calculations, and whether there were mathematical errors in the
calculation of the Proposed Closing Date Calculations, and the Accounting Firm
shall not make any other determination. The Accounting Firm shall resolve each
disputed item by choosing a value not in excess of, nor less than, the
greatest or lowest value, respectively, set forth in the presentations (and,
if applicable, the responses) delivered to the Accounting Firm pursuant to
this _Section 2.9(b)(ii)_. The Proposed Closing Date Calculations

  

  

  

    

shall be revised as appropriate to reflect the resolution of any objections
thereto pursuant to this _Section 2.9(b)(ii)_ and, as so revised, such
Proposed Closing Date Calculations shall be deemed to set forth the final
Aggregate Option Exercise Price, Net Working Capital, Cash and Cash
Equivalents, Closing Date Funded Indebtedness, Unpaid Transaction Expenses and
Purchase Price, in each case, for all purposes hereunder (including the
determination of the Actual Adjustment).

  

(iii) The Surviving Corporation shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, promptly make its financial records and personnel available
to the Representative and its accountants and other representatives at
reasonable times upon reasonable advance notice during the review by the
Representative of, and the resolution of any objections with respect to, the
Proposed Closing Date Calculations.

  

(iv) The parties hereto agree that the procedures set forth in this _Section
2.9(b)_ for resolving disputes with respect to the Proposed Closing Date
Calculations shall be the sole and exclusive method for resolving any such
disputes; _provided_ , that this provision shall not prohibit Parent or the
Representative from instituting litigation to enforce any final determination
of the Purchase Price by the Accounting Firm pursuant to _Section 2.9(b)(ii)_
, or to compel any party to this Agreement to submit any dispute arising in
connection with this _Section 2.9_ to the Accounting Firm pursuant to and in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this _Section 2.9_ , in any court
or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction in accordance with _Section 9.17_.
The substance of the Accounting Firm's determination shall not be subject to
review or appeal, absent a showing of fraud or manifest error. It is the
intent of the parties to this Agreement to have any final determination of the
Purchase Price by the Accounting Firm proceed in an expeditious manner;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any deadline or time period contained herein may
be extended or modified by the written agreement of Parent and the
Representative and the parties hereto agree that the failure of the Accounting
Firm to strictly conform to any deadline or time period contained herein shall
not be a basis for seeking to overturn any determination rendered by the
Accounting Firm which otherwise conforms to the terms of this _Section
2.9(b)_.

  

(c) _Adjustment to Estimated Purchase Price_.

  

(i) If the Actual Adjustment is a positive amount, (x) Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall pay to the Representative the portion of the Actual
Adjustment due to the holders of Company Common Shares (based on their
aggregate Percentage Interests) (for distribution to such holders based on
their relative Percentage Interests) and the remainder of the Actual
Adjustment to the Surviving Corporation and/or any other Group Company
designated by the Surviving Corporation (for distribution to the holders of
Vested Company Options based on their relative Percentage Interests), in each
case, in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds and within three
Business Days after the date on which the Purchase Price is finally determined
pursuant to this _Section 2.9_ and (y) simultaneously therewith, Parent and
the Representative shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow
Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to release (A) to the Representative the
portion of the funds then remaining in the Escrow Account due to the holders
of Company Common Shares (based on their relative Percentage Interests) for
distribution to such holders based on their relative Percentage Interests and
(B) the remainder of the funds then remaining in the Escrow Account to the
Surviving

  

  

    

Corporation and/or any other Group Company designated by the Surviving
Corporation (for distribution to the holders of Vested Company Options based
on their relative Percentage Interests); _provided_ , that in no event shall
the aggregate amount paid by Parent and the Surviving Corporation pursuant to
_Section 2.9(c)(i)(x)_ exceed $10,000,000.

  

(ii) If the Actual Adjustment is a negative amount, then within three Business
Days after the date on which the Purchase Price is finally determined pursuant
to this _Section 2.9_ , Parent and the Representative shall deliver joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to
deliver to Parent an amount equal to the absolute value of such negative
amount out of the Escrow Account; _provided_ that if the absolute value of the
Actual Adjustment is less than the Escrow Amount, then simultaneously with the
delivery of such joint written instructions, Parent and the Representative
shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the
Escrow Agent to release (A) to the Representative the portion of the excess
funds in the Escrow Account due to the holders of Company Common Shares (based
on their aggregate Percentage Interests) for distribution to such holders of
Company Common Shares based on their relative Percentage Interests and (B) the
remainder of the excess funds in the Escrow Account to the Surviving
Corporation and/or any other Group Company designated by the Surviving
Corporation (for distribution to the holders of Vested Company Options based
on their relative Percentage Interests), in each case, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds and within three Business Days after the date on
which the Purchase Price is finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.9_.

  

(iii) With respect to each amount payable in respect of Company Common Shares
and Vested Company Options, no later than three (3) Business Days prior to
such payment from the Escrow Account to the Representative and the Surviving
Corporation (or other Group Company designated by the Surviving Corporation),
the Representative shall deliver to Parent a statement setting forth the
portions of such payment required to be paid hereunder to the Representative
(for distribution to holders of Company Common Stock based on their relative
Percentage Interests) and to the Surviving Corporation or any other Group
Company designated by the Surviving Corporation (for distribution to the
holders of Vested Company Options based on their relative Percentage
Interests). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (I) Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and each Group Company making payments in respect of
Company Vested Options shall be entitled to rely on such statement and the
information provided therein by the Representative in all respects without any
further inquiry and (II) following the payment by Parent (or out of the Escrow
Account) of the applicable amounts to the Representative or the Surviving
Corporation or any other Group Company designated by the Surviving Corporation
so indicated in such statement, making such payment to the Representative or
the Surviving Corporation or any other Group Company designated by the
Surviving Corporation in accordance with such statement, none of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any such Group Company shall have any obligation with
respect to the distribution of such amounts by the Representative.

  

(iv) In the event that, upon the submission of any items in dispute to the
Accounting Firm pursuant to Section 2.9(b), the undisputed items would result
in a payment out of the Escrow Account to one party, the other, or both, such
payment shall be made promptly following such submission, applying the
provisions of this Section 2.9(c) mutatis mutandis (including by executing and
delivering joint written instructions in respect of such

  

  

    

payment to the Escrow Agent), and any such payment will be credited against
any payment required to be paid pursuant to this Section 2.9(c).

  

(v) For the avoidance of doubt, except for Claims for Actual Fraud against the
Person committing such Actual Fraud, the Escrow Amount shall serve as the sole
and exclusive source of recovery for any amounts owed to Parent in connection
with the final determination of the Purchase Price and Actual Adjustment
pursuant to this _Section 2.9_.

  

(vi) Promptly after receipt of the amounts to be paid to the Surviving
Corporation pursuant to this _Section 2.9(c)_ , if any, the Surviving
Corporation shall pay or cause to be paid to each holder of Vested Company
Options the applicable portion of such amount (based on their relative
Percentage Interests) through the Surviving Corporation's payroll or, in the
case of any non-U.S. holder of Vested Company Options, either through the
applicable Group Company's payroll or through such other means customary for
such jurisdiction (but in any event in accordance with Applicable Law) and
subject to the delivery of any tax forms (including the delivery of an
applicable Tax form, to the extent required by Applicable Law and to the
extent that such non‑U.S. holder has not already provided an applicable Tax
form to the Company).

  

(vii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no holder of Company
Common Shares or Company Preferred Shares shall be entitled to receive
payments pursuant to this _Section 2.9(c)_ until such holder has complied with
_Section 2.13_ (including, for the avoidance of doubt, by delivering a

and/or Company Preferred Shares represented thereby; _provided_ , that

provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (any such shares being referred to as "
_Dissenting Shares_ " until such time as such holder fails to perfect or
otherwise loses such holder's appraisal rights under the DGCL with respect to
such shares) shall not have such shares converted into, or have the right to
receive, the applicable Per Share Common Payment and a portion (if any) of the
Escrow Funds and the Representative Expense Amount as provided herein, but
instead such holder shall be entitled to such rights (and only such rights) as
are granted under Section 262 of the DGCL, unless and until such holder
withdraws (in accordance with Section 262(k) of the DGCL) or effectively loses
the right to dissent. If any holder of Dissenting Shares shall have
effectively withdrawn (in accordance with Section 262(k) of the DGCL), lost
the right to dissent or a court of competent jurisdiction shall have
determined that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section
262 of the DGCL, then as of the later of the Effective Time or the occurrence
of such event, the Dissenting Shares held by such holder shall be
automatically cancelled and converted into and represent only the right to
receive the applicable Per Share Common Payment and a portion (if any) of the
Escrow Funds and the Representative Expense Amount as provided herein pursuant
to _Section 2.8_ (without, in each case, any interest thereon) and Parent
shall promptly deposit any amounts then owed to such holder with the

contributing employer) to any Multiemployer Plan, in connection with any
complete or partial withdrawal as a result of the transactions contemplated
under this Agreement or otherwise.

  

(c) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.13(c)_: (i) each Employee Benefit Plan
and each Foreign Benefit Plan has been administered in all material respects
in accordance with its terms and complies in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of ERISA, the Code, COBRA and any other Applicable
Laws and (ii) each Employee Benefit Plan intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from
the Internal Revenue Service or is the subject of a favorable opinion letter
from the Internal Revenue Service on the form of such Employee Benefit Plan
and, to the Company's Knowledge, there are no facts or circumstances that
would be reasonably likely to materially adversely affect the qualified status
of any such Employee Benefit Plan. All required reports and descriptions of
the Employee Benefit Plans have been timely filed and distributed in all
material respects.

  

(d) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.13(d)_, no Group Company has any
material Liability under Title IV of ERISA nor, is any material Liability
under Title IV of ERISA reasonably expected to be incurred by any Group
Company, including on account of any ERISA Affiliate. All material
contributions required to be made by any Group Company under

  

  

    

Applicable Law or the terms of any Employee Benefit Plan, Multiemployer Plan,
Foreign Benefit Plan or the plan of a Governmental Entity, or collective
bargaining agreement as of the Closing Date, have been made in full or
properly accrued as of such date.

  

(e) No Group Company has engaged in any transaction with respect to any
Employee Benefit Plan, Multiemployer Plan or Foreign Benefit Plan, that would
reasonably be expected to subject any Group Company to any material Tax or
penalty (civil or otherwise) imposed by ERISA, the Code or other Applicable
Law. To the Company's Knowledge, no "fiduciary" within the meaning of Section
3(21) of ERISA has committed any breach of fiduciary responsibility imposed by
ERISA or other similar Applicable Law with respect to any Employee Benefit
Plan, Multiemployer Plan, Foreign Benefit Plan or otherwise that would result
in material Liability to a Group Company. Other than claims and appeals for
benefits in the ordinary course, there is no pending, or to the Company's
Knowledge, threatened or anticipated action, suit, grievance, investigation,
arbitration, litigation or claim with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan,
Multiemployer Plan, Foreign Benefit Plan, or any assets of any thereof, and
there is no pending audit or investigation of any Employee Benefit Plan,
Multiemployer Plan or Foreign Benefit Plan, by any Governmental Entity, in
each case, that would result in material Liability to a Group Company.

  

(f) The consummation of the Transactions will not give rise to any Liability
under any Employee Benefit Plan, Multiemployer Plan, Foreign Benefit Plan or
otherwise, including Liability for severance pay, unemployment compensation,
termination pay or withdrawal Liability, or accelerate the time of payment or
vesting or increase the amount of compensation or benefits due to any
employee, officer, director, stockholder or other service provider of any
Group Company (whether current, former or retired) or their beneficiaries.
Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.13(f)_ , no amount received (whether in
cash or property or the vesting of property), as a result of the consummation
of the Transactions, by any employee, officer, director, stockholder or other
service provider of any Group Company under any Employee Benefit Plan or
otherwise would not be deductible by reason of Section 280G of the Code. No
Group Company has an obligation to gross-up, indemnify or otherwise reimburse
any current or former employee, officer, director or other service provider of
the Group Company on or after the Effective Time for any Tax incurred by such
individual or entity under Section 409A or 4999 of the Code. The parties
acknowledge that this _Section 3.13(f)_ shall not apply to any arrangements
entered into at the direction of Parent or between Parent and its Affiliates,
on the one hand, and a disqualified individual on the other hand (" _Buyer
Arrangements_ ") so that, for the avoidance of doubt, compliance with this
_Section 3.13(f)_ shall be determined as if such Buyer Arrangements had not
been entered into.

  

(g) Each Employee Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation
plan" (as defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) satisfies in form and
operation the requirements of Sections 409A(a)(2), 409A(a)(3) and 409A(a)(4)
of the Code and the guidance thereunder in all material respects.

any of their respective properties or assets may be bound, or (iii) violate
any order, writ, injunction, decree, law, statute, rule or regulation of any
Governmental Entity applicable to Parent or Merger Sub or any of Parent's
Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets, except in the
case of clauses _(b)_ and _(c)_ above, for violations which would not prevent
or materially delay the Merger.

  

Section 4.4 _Brokers_. No broker, finder, financial advisor or investment
banker is entitled to any brokerage, finder's, financial advisor's or
investment banker's fee or commission or similar payment in connection with
the Transactions based upon arrangements made by and on behalf of Parent or
Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates for which Sellers or any
Group Company may become liable.

  

  

    

Section 4.5 _Debt Financing_. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has
delivered to the Company and the Representative true, complete and correct
copies of the executed debt commitment letter (the " _Debt Financing
Commitment Letter_ ") and corresponding customarily redacted fee letter (none
of which redacted terms would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
amount or availability of the Debt Financing or affect the conditions thereto)
from the financial institutions identified therein (the " _Debt Financing
Commitments_ ," as each may be amended or replaced from time to time to the
extent permitted by _Section 5.8(a))_ to provide, subject to the terms and
conditions therein, debt financing in the amounts set forth therein for the
purpose of funding the Transactions (being collectively referred to as the "
_Debt Financing_ "). The Debt Financing Commitment Letter is a legal, valid
and binding obligations of Spectrum Brands, Inc. (a wholly‑owned Subsidiary of
Parent), and to the knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, and is
enforceable in accordance with its terms, except (a) to the extent that
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other Applicable Laws affecting the enforcement
of creditors' rights generally and (b) that the availability of equitable
remedies, including specific performance, is subject to the discretion of the
court before which any proceeding thereof may be brought. As of the date
hereof, the Debt Financing Commitment Letter is in full force and effect, and
the Debt Financing Commitment Letter has not been withdrawn, rescinded or
terminated or otherwise amended or modified in any respect, and no such
amendment or modification is contemplated. Neither Parent nor Spectrum Brands,
Inc. is in breach of any of the terms or conditions set forth in the Debt
Financing Commitment Letter, and as of the date hereof, no event has occurred
which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be
expected to constitute a breach, default or failure to satisfy any condition
precedent set forth therein. As of the date hereof, Parent has no reason to
believe that any of the conditions in the Debt Financing Commitment Letter
will not be satisfied, or that the Debt Financing will not be made available
on a timely basis in order to consummate the Transactions. As of the date
hereof, no counterparty to any Debt Financing Commitment Letter has notified
Parent or Spectrum Brands, Inc. of its intention to terminate the Debt
Financing Commitment Letter or not to provide the Debt Financing. The net
proceeds from the Debt Financing, together with other sources of liquidity as
shall be available to Parent, will be sufficient to consummate the
Transactions, including the payment of all fees and expenses of or payable by
Parent, Spectrum Brands, Inc., Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, and
any related repayment or refinancing of any Closing Date Funded Indebtedness,
and any other amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation
of the Transactions. Parent and Spectrum Brands, Inc. have paid in full any
and all commitment or other fees required by the Debt Financing Commitment
Letter that are due as of the date hereof, and will pay, after the date
hereof, all such fees as they become due. There are no conditions precedent or
contingencies to the obligations of the parties under the Debt Financing
Commitment Letter (including, to the extent applicable, pursuant to any "flex"
provisions in the related fee letter or otherwise) to make the full amount of
the Debt Financing available to Parent or Spectrum Brands, Inc. on the terms
therein except as expressly set forth in the Debt Financing Commitment Letter.
There are no side letters or other Contracts to which Parent or any of its
Affiliates (including Spectrum Brands, Inc.) is a party related to the funding
of the full amount of the Debt Financing that could adversely affect the
availability of the Debt Financing other than as expressly set forth in the
Debt Financing Commitment Letter. No Person has any right to impose, and none
of the providers under the Debt Financing Commitment Letter or Parent or
Spectrum Brands, Inc. has any obligation to accept, any condition precedent to
such funding other than any of the

  

  

    

conditions expressly set forth in the Debt Financing Commitment Letter nor any
reduction to the aggregate amount available under the Debt Financing
Commitment Letter on the Closing Date (nor any term or condition which would
have the effect of reducing the aggregate amount available under the Debt
Financing Commitment Letter on the Closing Date, except as expressly provided
therein). Subject to the Company's compliance with this Agreement and the
satisfaction (or waiver) of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ and
_Section 6.2_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions), Parent has no reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy
on a timely basis any conditions to the funding of the full amount of the Debt
Financing, or that the Debt Financing will not be available on the Closing
Date. For the avoidance of doubt, it is not a condition to Closing under this
Agreement for Parent or Spectrum Brands, Inc. to obtain the Debt Financing,
any Alternative Debt Financing or any other financing.

  

Section 4.6 _Merger Sub Activities_. Merger Sub was organized solely for the
purpose of entering into this Agreement and consummating the Transactions and
has not engaged in any activities or business, and has incurred no Liabilities
or obligations whatsoever, in each case, other than those incident to its
organization and the execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Transactions.

  

Section 4.7 _Surviving Corporation after the Merger_. Assuming (a)
satisfaction of the conditions in _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.3_ , (b) the
representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement are
true and correct, and (c) no material adverse change with respect to the
business, operations, assets, properties and financial condition of the Parent
and its Subsidiaries has occurred prior to the Closing, at and immediately
after the Effective Time, and after giving effect to the Merger and the other
Transactions the Group Companies, Parent and its other Subsidiaries (i) will
be solvent (in that both the fair value of their consolidated assets will not
be less than the sum of their consolidated debts and that the present fair
saleable value of their consolidated assets will not be less than the amount
required to pay their probable consolidated Liabilities on their consolidated
debts as they become absolute and matured), (ii) will have adequate capital
with which to engage in their business, and (iii) will not have incurred debts
beyond their ability to pay as they become absolute and matured.

  

Section 4.8 _Acknowledgment and Representations by Parent and Merger Sub_.

  

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub is an informed and sophisticated Person, and
has engaged expert advisors experienced in the evaluation and acquisition of
companies such as the Group Companies as contemplated hereunder. Parent,
Merger Sub and their respective representatives have undertaken such
investigation and have been provided with and has evaluated such documents and
information as each of them have deemed necessary to enable them to make an
informed and intelligent decision with respect to the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents and the consummation
of the Merger. In making their determination to proceed with the Merger,
Parent and Merger Sub have relied solely on the results of their and their
respective representatives' own independent investigation and the
representations and warranties of the Company expressly and specifically set
forth in _ARTICLE III_ (as qualified by the Schedules), in the certificates or
other instruments delivered pursuant hereto, or in any Ancillary Document
(including any Letter of Transmittal or affidavit of lost certificate).

  

  

    

(b) In connection with the investigation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Group
Companies, Parent, Merger Sub and their respective representatives have
received and, after the date hereof but prior to the Closing, may receive from
the Group Companies or any of their representatives certain projections,
budgets, forward looking statements and other forecasts. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub acknowledges that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to
make such projections, budgets, forward looking statements and other
forecasts, that Parent, Merger Sub and their respective representative are
familiar with such uncertainties, that Parent, Merger Sub and their respective
representatives are taking full responsibility for making their own evaluation
of the adequacy and accuracy of all projections, budgets, forward looking
statements and other forecasts so furnished to them (including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such projections, budgets,
forward looking statements and other forecasts), and that Parent and Merger
Sub have not relied upon, are not relying upon and will not rely upon any such
projections, budgets, forward looking statements or other forecasts or any
other materials, documents or information (including those provided in certain
"data rooms," confidential information memoranda or similar materials, or
management presentations in connection with the Merger) made available to
Parent, Merger Sub and their respective representatives and Affiliates by the
Group Companies or any of their representatives, and Parent and Merger Sub
shall have no claim against any Person with respect thereto.

  

(c) Parent and Merger Sub (on behalf of themselves and their Affiliates)
acknowledge that, other than as expressly set forth in _ARTICLE III_ , in the
certificates or other instruments delivered pursuant hereto, or in any
Ancillary Document (including any Letter of Transmittal or affidavit of lost
certificate), none of the Group Companies or any of their respective
directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, stockholders, equityholders,
agents or representatives or any other Person makes or has made any
representation or warranty, contractual or legal, either express or implied,
as to the accuracy or completeness of any of the information provided or made
available to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective agents,
representatives, lenders or Affiliates or any other Person acting on their
behalf prior to the execution of this Agreement.

hours reasonable access to all books and records of the Group Companies (in a

permit, and Parent, Merger Sub and their representatives shall not be
permitted to, perform any environmental sampling at any Leased Real Property
or Owned Real Property, including sampling of soil, groundwater, surface
water, building materials, or air or wastewater emissions. All of such
information shall be treated as confidential information pursuant to the terms
of the Confidentiality Agreement, the provisions of which are by this
reference hereby incorporated herein. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this Agreement, no Group Company or any of its respective
Affiliates shall be required to disclose to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective representatives any information (i) if doing so would reasonably be
expected to violate any Contract, fiduciary duty or Applicable Law to which
any Seller, Group Company or any Affiliate is a party or is subject), (ii)
which would reasonably be expected to result in the loss of the ability to
successfully assert attorney-client and work product privileges, (iii) if any
Group Company or any of their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates, on the other hand,
are adverse parties in a litigation and such information is reasonably
pertinent thereto or (iv) if any Group Company reasonably determines that such
information should not be disclosed due to its competitively sensitive nature;
_provided_ , in each case, the Company shall, and shall cause each other Group
Company to use commercially reasonable efforts to, allow otherwise required
disclosure to Parent to occur without so jeopardizing any such privilege,
litigation or the competitively sensitive nature of such information or
contravening any such Contract, fiduciary duty or Applicable Law (except that
the Company shall not be required to incur any costs or pay any fees with
respect thereto).

  

Section 5.3 _Requisite Stockholder Approval_. Promptly following its delivery

the holders of Company Common Shares and Company Preferred Shares that did not
execute the Requisite Stockholder Approval (i) a copy of such Requisite
Stockholder Approval, and (ii) the notices required pursuant to Section 228 of
the DGCL. Any such notice will comply with the requirements of the DGCL.

  

Section 5.4 _Efforts to Consummate_.

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under Applicable Laws and
regulations to consummate and make effective as promptly as practicable the
Transactions (including the satisfaction, but not waiver, of the closing
conditions set forth in _ARTICLE VI_ ). Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use their reasonable best efforts to
obtain consents of all Governmental Entities necessary to consummate the
Transactions. All HSR Act filing fees shall be borne by Parent. Each party
hereto shall make an appropriate filing, if necessary, pursuant to the HSR Act
with respect to the Transactions promptly (and in any event, within ten (10)
Business Days) after the date of this Agreement (which such filings shall
request early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act) and shall
supply as promptly as practicable to the appropriate Governmental Entities any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant
to the HSR Act. Without limiting the foregoing, (i) Parent, Merger Sub, and
their respective Affiliates shall not extend (or take any action with the
effect of extending) any waiting period or comparable period under the HSR Act
or enter into any agreement with any Governmental Entity not to consummate the
Transactions, except with the

  

  

    

prior written consent of the Company, and (ii) Parent and Merger Sub agree to
take (and Parent's and Merger Sub's "reasonable best efforts" shall expressly
include the taking of), and cause their Affiliates to take, all actions that
may be required by any Governmental Entity to expeditiously consummate the
Transactions, including (A) selling, licensing or otherwise disposing of, or
holding separate and agreeing to sell, license or otherwise dispose of, or
proposing or negotiating to do the same for (i) any entities, assets or
facilities of any Group Company after the Closing or (ii) any entity, facility
or assets of Parent or its Affiliates before or after the Closing, (B)
terminating, modifying, amending or assigning existing relationships and
contractual rights and obligations (other than terminations that would result
in a breach of a contractual obligation to a third party), (C) amending,
assigning or terminating existing licenses or other agreements (other than
terminations that would result in a breach of a license or such other
agreement with a third party) and entering into such new licenses or other
agreements, (D) modifying any course of conduct regarding future operations of
Parent or Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates or with respect to any of the
businesses, assets, rights or interested to be acquired pursuant to this
Agreement and (E) otherwise taking or committing to take any other action that
limits or would limit Parent or Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates' freedom
of action with respect to the businesses, assets, rights or interested to be
acquired pursuant to this Agreement; _provided_ , that nothing set forth in
this _Section 5.4(a)_ shall require Parent, Merger Sub or their Affiliates to
take or consent to any action that is not conditioned on the consummation of
the Closing.

  

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub shall not, and shall
cause their Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly acquire or agree to
acquire (by merging or consolidating with, or by purchasing a substantial
portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any other manner), any Person or
portion thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets, if the
entering into a definitive agreement relating to, or the consummation of, such
acquisition, merger or consolidation would reasonably be expected to (i)
impose any delay in the obtaining of, or increase the risk of not obtaining,
any permits, orders or other approvals of any Governmental Entity necessary to
consummate the Merger or the expiration or termination of any applicable
waiting period, (ii) increase the risk of any Governmental Entity entering an
order prohibiting the consummation of the Merger, (iii) increase the risk of
not being able to remove any such order on appeal or otherwise, or (iv) delay
or prevent the consummation of the Merger.

  

(c) In the event any claim, action, suit, investigation or other proceeding by
any Governmental Entity or other Person is commenced which questions the
validity or legality of the transactions contemplated hereby or seeks damages
in connection therewith, the parties hereto agree to cooperate and, to the
extent necessary to satisfy the conditions set forth in _ARTICLE VI_ , use
reasonable best efforts to defend against such claim, action, suit,
investigation or other proceeding and, if an injunction or other order is
issued in any such action, suit or other proceeding, to use reasonable best
efforts to have such injunction or other order lifted, and to cooperate
reasonably regarding any other impediment to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  

Section 5.5 _Indemnification; Directors ' and Officers' Insurance_.

  

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that, for a period of six years following the
Effective Time, all rights to indemnification or exculpation now existing in
favor of the directors, officers, employees and agents of each Group Company,
as provided in such

  

  

    

Group Company's Governing Documents or otherwise in effect as of the date
hereof with respect to any matters occurring prior to the Closing Date, shall
survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect and the Group
Companies on their own behalf will perform and discharge the Group Companies'
obligations to provide such indemnity and exculpation after the Merger. To the
maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law, such indemnification shall be
mandatory rather than permissive, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to advance expenses in connection with such indemnification as
provided in such Group Company's Governing Documents or other applicable
agreements. The indemnification and Liability limitation or exculpation
provisions of the Group Companies' Governing Documents shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified after the Closing Date in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who, as of the Closing
Date or at any time prior to the Closing Date, were directors, officers,
employees or agents of any Group Company, unless such modification is required
by Applicable Law.

  

(b) The Company shall, prior to the Closing Date, purchase at Parent's expense
for the period beginning on the Closing and ending six years thereafter
without any lapses in coverage, a "tail" policy providing directors' and
officers' liability insurance coverage for the benefit of those Persons who
are covered by any Group Company's directors' and officers' liability
insurance policies as of the date hereof or at the Closing with respect to
matters occurring prior to the Closing. Such policy shall provide coverage
that is at least equal to the coverage provided under the Group Companies'
current directors' and officers' liability insurance policies.

  

(c) Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby acknowledge (on behalf of
themselves and their respective Subsidiaries) that the indemnified Persons
under this _Section 5.5_ may have certain rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and/or insurance provided by current shareholders,
members, or other Affiliates of the stockholders or their respective
shareholders (" _Indemnitee Affiliates_ ") separate from the indemnification
obligations of the Group Companies hereunder. The parties hereto hereby agree
(i) that the Group Companies are the indemnitors of first resort solely with
respect to matters involving or relating to the Group Companies (i.e., its
obligations to the indemnified Persons under this _Section 5.5_ are primary
and any obligation of any Indemnitee Affiliate to advance expenses or to
provide indemnification for the same expenses or Liabilities incurred by the
indemnified Persons under this _Section 5.5_ with respect to matters involving
or relating to the Group Companies are secondary), (ii) that rights to
indemnification and advancement of expenses by the Group Companies shall be
determined without regard to any rights the indeminified Persons under this
_Section 5.5_ may have against any Indemnitee Affiliate, and (iii) that the
parties hereto (on behalf of themselves and their respective Subsidiaries)
irrevocably waive, relinquish and release the Indemnitee Affiliates from any
and all claims against the Indemnitee Affiliates for contribution, subrogation
or any other recovery of any kind arising from any rights that any Person
indemnified under this _Section 5.5_ may have against any Indemnitee
Affiliate. The obligations of Parent and the Group Companies under this
_Section 5.5_ shall be binding upon the successors and permitted assigns of
Parent.

  

(d) The directors, officers, employees and agents of each Group Company
entitled to the indemnification, Liability limitation, exculpation and
insurance set forth in this _Section 5.5_ are intended to be third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 5.5_. This _Section_

  

  

    

 _5.5_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and shall be binding on
all successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation.

  

(e) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
its Subsidiaries shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.5_.

  

Section 5.6 _Exclusive Dealing_. During the period from the date of this
Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Company will not, and will cause
its directors, officers, representatives and Affiliates not to, execute or
enter into, or legally commit to execute or enter into, any written agreement
with respect to any Competing Transaction, enter into or participate in any
negotiations or discussions with any potential third party acquirer or its
representatives regarding a Competing Transaction (other than Parent and its
Affiliates), knowingly encourage, knowingly facilitate, initiate or solicit
any Competing Transaction or provide confidential non-public information to
any potential third party acquirer or its representatives to facilitate a
Competing Transaction. Without limiting the foregoing, following the date
hereof, no Group Company will file any registration statement or any amendment
to any registration statement (for the avoidance of doubt, periodic and
current reports required by the rules and regulations of the SEC or the
Indentures are not subject to this sentence), with the SEC or cause or permit
any previously filed registration statement or any amendment thereto to become
effective.

  

Section 5.7 _Retention of Documents and Information_. After the Closing Date,
and subject to Parent's document retention policies, Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, until the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Closing Date, retain all books, records and other documents
pertaining to the business of the Group Companies in existence on the Closing
Date and, subject to any confidentiality restrictions that the Group Companies
are subject and the preservation of any applicable legal privilege, make the
same available for inspection and copying by the Representative (at
Representative's expense), during normal business hours of the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, upon reasonable request
and upon reasonable notice in a manner so as to not interfere with the normal

Section 5.8 _Financing_ _; Financing Cooperation_.

  

(a) Parent shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates (including Spectrum
Brands, Inc.) to, use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Debt Financing
or any other financing that is in an aggregate amount sufficient for purposes
of funding in full the Transactions (the " _Financing_ ") on a timely basis,
but in no event later than two (2) Business Days prior to the Termination
Date, including, if necessary using its reasonable best efforts to (i) comply
with its obligations under the applicable Debt Financing Commitment Letter and
any definitive agreements related thereto, (ii) negotiate and enter into
definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing on a timely basis on
terms and conditions (including the "market

  

  

    

flex" provisions) contained therein or otherwise not materially less favorable
to Parent in the aggregate than those contained in the Debt Financing
Commitment Letter (and the redacted fee letter), (iii) satisfy on a timely
basis all conditions applicable to Parent and Spectrum Brands, Inc. contained
in the Debt Financing Commitment Letter within its control, including the
payment of any commitment, engagement or placement fees required as a
condition to the Debt Financing, (iv) enforce its rights against the financial
institutions that are a party to the Debt Financing Commitment Letter, and (v)
consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to the Closing Date (it being
understood that it is not a condition to Closing under this Agreement for
Parent or Spectrum Brands, Inc. to obtain the Debt Financing, any Alternative
Debt Financing or other Financing). For the avoidance of doubt, in the event
all or any portion of the Debt Financing structured as "high-yield" financing
has not been consummated on or prior to the Closing, Parent and Merger Sub
shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the proceeds of the bridge
facilities contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment Letter to be
available. Parent shall keep the Representative and the Company informed on a
reasonable basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to
arrange the Debt Financing. Parent shall give the Representative and the
Company prompt notice upon having knowledge of any breach by any party of the
Debt Financing Commitment Letter or any termination of the Debt Financing
Commitment Letter. Other than as expressly set forth in _Section 5.8(b)_ ,
Parent shall not, and shall not permit its Affiliates (including Spectrum
Brands, Inc.) to, without the prior written consent of the Representative,
amend, modify, supplement or waive any of the conditions or contingencies to
funding contained in the Debt Financing Commitment Letter or any other
provision of, or remedies under, the Debt Financing Commitment Letter, in each
case, to the extent such amendment, modification, supplement or waiver would
reasonably be expected to have the effect of (A) adversely affecting in any
material respect the ability of Parent to timely consummate the Transactions,
(B) amending, modifying, supplementing or waiving the conditions or
contingencies to the Debt Financing Commitment Letter or the Debt Financing in
a manner materially adverse to the Company or the Sellers or (C) materially
delaying the Closing.

  

(b) If all or any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable, Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) arrange to promptly obtain the
Debt Financing or such portion of the Debt Financing from alternative sources,
which may include one or more of a senior secured debt financing, an offering
and sale of notes or equity securities, or any other financing or offer and
sale of other debt or equity securities, or any combination thereof, in an
amount sufficient, when added to any portion of the Debt Financing or other
sources of liquidity that is available, to pay in cash all amounts required to
be paid by Parent in connection with the Transactions (" _Alternative Debt
Financing_ ") and (ii) obtain a new financing commitment letter (the "
_Alternative Debt Commitment Letter_ ") and a new definitive agreement with
respect thereto that provides for financing (A) on terms not materially less
favorable, in the aggregate, to Parent, (B) containing conditions to draw and
other terms that would reasonably be expected to affect the availability
thereof that (1) are not more onerous, taken as a whole, than those conditions
and terms contained in the Debt Financing Commitment Letter as of the date
hereof and (2) would not reasonably be expected to delay the Closing and (C)
in an amount that is sufficient, when added to any portion of the Debt
Financing or other sources of liquidity that is available, to pay in cash all
amounts required to be paid by Parent in connection with the Transactions. In
such event, the term " _Debt Financing_ " as used in this Agreement shall be
deemed to include any Alternative Debt Financing and the term " _Debt
Financing Commitment Letter_ " as used in this Agreement shall be deemed to
include any Alternative Debt Commitment Letter.

  

  

    

(c) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, provide the following reasonable cooperation with the arrangement of the
Financing: (i) on or prior to May 15, 2015, the Company shall provide to
Parent unaudited interim financial statements of (A) Armored AutoGroup Inc.
and its consolidated Subsidiaries for the quarter ended March 31, 2015 and (B)
IDQ Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated Subsidiaries for the quarter ended
March 31, 2015 (such financial statements, the " _Financing Information_ "),
and the Company shall not be required to provide any other financial
statements of the Group Companies; (ii) the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts, to the extent such information is available, to provide
financial and other information reasonably necessary to prepare a description
of the Group Companies' business and financial information reasonably
necessary to prepare a management discussion and analysis, in each case, that
is customary for the Debt Financing and, in the case of the management
discussion and analysis, corresponds to the applicable Audited Financial
Statements and the Financing Information; (iii) the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts, to the extent such information is available,
to provide such other financial data as may be reasonably necessary to allow
Parent its Affiliates to prepare pro forma financial statements of the type
and form customarily included in the Debt Financing (which, for the avoidance
of doubt, shall not include the obligation to provide financial statements of
the Group Companies other than the Financing Information); (iv) the Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to participate in meetings, drafting
sessions and rating agency presentations to the extent reasonably necessary to
allow Parent or any of its Affiliates to consummate the Financing; and (v) the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts, to the extent reasonably
necessary to allow Parent or any of its Affiliates to consummate the
Financing, to cause its auditors to (A) provide representation letters,
certifications and consents in connection with the preparation and use of
financial information in offering documents, prospectuses, rating agency
presentations, investor presentations, registration statements filed pursuant
to the Securities Act, Exchange Act reports, other filings required to be made
by Parent or such Affiliate under the Exchange Act and other documents to be
filed with the SEC, and accounting comfort letters addressed to the
underwriters or initial purchasers solely in respect of any Financing
Information or Financial Statements to the extent included in offering
documents or prospectuses and (B) participate in drafting sessions and due
diligence sessions (including accounting due diligence sessions) with respect
to any such offering and provide assistance in responding to comments or
questions from the SEC with respect to the financial information, in each
case, as reasonably requested by Parent and to the extent such items relate to
information that the Company is otherwise required to provide under this
_Section 5.8(c)_. The Financing Information shall have been prepared in all
material respects in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis
throughout the periods covered thereby, except as may be indicated in the
notes thereto and subject to the absence of footnotes and normal year-end
adjustments and, in certain cases, normal quarterly adjustments, and shall
fairly present, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position
of the applicable entities as of the dates thereof and their consolidated
results of operations for the periods then ended (subject to the absence of
footnotes and normal year-end adjustments). Notwithstanding the immediately
preceding sentence, (i) none of the Sellers, the Company or any of the Group
Companies shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or
incur any other liability in connection with the Financing, Debt Financing or
any Alternative Debt Financing, (ii) the effectiveness of any documentation
executed by any Group Company with respect thereto (other than, for the
avoidance of doubt, customary representation letters executed in favor of its
auditors) shall be

  

  

  

    

subject to the consummation of the Closing and (iii) the Group Companies shall
not be required to (x) obtain payoff letters with respect to any Funded
Indebtedness (other than Closing Date Funded Indebtedness under the Credit
Facilities) or (y) except as provided in _Section 5.11_ , give any notices
under the indentures governing any outstanding bonds or notes of any Group
Company. Any information provided pursuant to this Section 5.8(c) shall be
subject to confidentiality obligations customary for the Financing as
contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment Letter. Parent acknowledges and
agrees that none of the Sellers nor any Group Company nor any of their
respective Affiliates or any of their respective directors, officers,
employees, representatives and advisors (including legal, financial and
accounting advisors) shall have any responsibility for, or incur any Liability
to any Person under or in connection with, the arrangement of the Financing,
Debt Financing or Alternative Debt Financing that Parent may raise in
connection with the Transactions, and that Parent shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Representative, the Sellers, the Group Companies and their
respective Affiliates and directors, officers, employees, representatives and
advisors (including legal, financial and accounting advisors) from and against
any and all Losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with the
arrangement of the Financing, Debt Financing or Alternative Debt Financing and
any information utilized in connection therewith (other than information
provided by the Group Companies expressly for use in connection therewith),
and each of such Persons is intended to be a third party beneficiary of this
_Section 5.8(c)_. Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, promptly
reimburse the Company for all out-of-pocket costs or expenses incurred by the
Group Companies in connection with cooperation provided for in this _Section
5.8(c)_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
condition set forth in _Section 6.2(b)_ , as it applies to the Group
Companies' obligations under this _Section 5.8(c)_ , shall be deemed satisfied
unless a Group Company has knowingly, willfully and materially breached its
obligations under this _Section 5.8(c)_ and such breach is the proximate cause
of Parent's failure to obtain the Financing, Debt Financing or Alternative
Debt Financing.

  

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, all Closing Date Funded Indebtedness (other
than Closing Date Funded Indebtedness under the Credit Facilities) shall
remain outstanding immediately following the Effective Time and shall be
liabilities of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries.

  

Section 5.9 _Employee Benefits_ _Plans and Retention_. Parent shall grant, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to grant, employees of each Group
Company who continue to be employed by a Group Company credit for any service
with such Group Company earned prior to the Closing Date (a) for eligibility
and vesting purposes and (b) for purposes of vacation accrual and severance
benefit determinations under any benefit or compensation plan, program,
agreement or arrangement that may be established or maintained by Parent or
the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries on or after the Closing
Date (but not for purposes of any plans subject to Title IV of ERISA) (the "
_New Plans_ "). In addition, Parent shall (i) cause to be waived all
pre‑existing condition exclusions and actively‑at‑work requirements and
similar limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability
requirements under any New Plans to the extent waived or satisfied by an
employee under any Employee Benefit Plan as of the Closing Date and (ii) cause
any deductible, co-insurance and covered out-of-pocket expenses paid on or
before the Closing Date by any employee (or covered dependent thereof) of any
Group Company to be taken into account for purposes of satisfying the
corresponding deductible, coinsurance and maximum out‑of‑pocket provisions
after the Closing Date under any

  

  

    

applicable New Plan in the year of initial participation. Nothing contained
herein, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any employee of any
Group Company any right to continued employment for any period or continued
receipt of any specific employee benefit, or shall constitute an amendment to
or any other modification of any New Plan or Employee Benefit Plan or Foreign
Benefit Plan. Parent agrees that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be
solely responsible for satisfying the continuation coverage requirements of
Section 4980B of the Code for all individuals who are "MandA qualified
beneficiaries" as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section
54.4980B‑9.

  

Section 5.10 _Tax Matters_. During the period from the date of this Agreement
to the Closing Date, the Group Companies shall:

  

(a) prepare and duly file all federal income Tax Returns and all other
material Tax Returns required to be filed by the Group Companies between the
date of this Agreement and the day prior to the Closing Date (" _Post-Signing
Returns_ ") in a manner consistent with past practice, except as otherwise
required by a change in, or interpretation of, Applicable Law;

  

(b) deliver drafts of all Post-Signing Returns that are income Tax Returns to
Parent no later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the date on which such
Post-Signing Returns are required to be filed;

  

(c) fully and timely pay all Taxes due and payable, if any, in respect of such
Post-Signing Returns that are so filed;

  

(d) promptly notify Parent of any material federal, state, local or foreign
income or franchise Claim or audit pending or threatened in writing against or
with respect to any Group Company in respect of any Tax matter, including Tax
Liabilities and refund claims, and not settle or compromise any such, Claim or
audit without Parent's prior written consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); and

  

(e) terminate all Tax Sharing Agreements to which any Group Company is a party
such that there are no further Liabilities thereunder, other than any Tax
Sharing Agreements solely among the Group Companies.

  

The Company shall be deemed to have performed and complied in all material
respects with the covenants, obligations and agreements required to be
performed or complied with under this _Section 5.10_ , except to the extent
noncompliance would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

  


 

  

Section 5.11 _Redemption Notices_. The Company shall cause Armored AutoGroup
Inc. to give a notice of redemption under the AAG Indentures as Parent may
reasonably request in writing; _provided_ , that any such notice under the AAG
Indentures given prior to the Closing Date shall be conditional upon the
Closing and the terms and conditions specified by Parent for the redemption
shall be in compliance with Applicable Law and the AAG Indentures. For the
avoidance of doubt, no Group Company shall be required to provide any notice
of redemption under any IDQ Indenture prior to the Closing Date.

  

  

    

Section 5.12 _280G Payments_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
(i) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from each "disqualified
individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code) a waiver by such
individual of any and all rights to payments (or other benefits) contingent on
the consummation of the Transactions (within the meaning of Section
280G(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Code) to the extent necessary so that such payments
and benefits would not be "excess parachute payments" under Section 280G of
the Code and (ii) submit to its stockholders for a vote all such waived
payments in a manner such that, if such vote is adopted by the stockholders in
a manner that satisfies the stockholder approval requirements under Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and regulations promulgated thereunder, no payment
received by such "disqualified individual" would be a "parachute payment"
under Section 280G(b) of the Code. The Company agrees to provide to Parent
written drafts of the shareholder disclosure statement, waivers, and
stockholder approval forms that will be provided to disqualified individuals
and stockholders in advance of delivering such documents to the disqualified
individuals and stockholders, as applicable, and allow Parent a reasonable
opportunity to provide comments on such documents. The parties acknowledge
that this _Section 5.12_ shall not apply to any Buyer Arrangements unless
Parent provided sufficient information regarding such Buyer Arrangements to
the Company no later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Effective Time,
so that, for the avoidance of doubt, compliance with this _Section 5.12_ shall
be determined as if such Buyer Arrangements had not been entered into.

  

Section 5.13 _Termination of Affiliate Transactions_. On or prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall, or shall cause, all transactions and
Contracts entered into by any Group Company with any Affiliated Person to be
terminated without further obligation on the part of any Group Company (other
than this Agreement, the Ancillary Documents, employment or similar Contract
of a Group Company employee (other than the Contract set forth on _Schedule
5.13_ ) or any other Contract between a portfolio company of the Avista
Sellers, KI‑IDQ 2012 Holdings, LLC or any of their respective affiliated
investment funds, on the one hand, and any Group Company, on the other hand,
entered into in the ordinary course of business on arm's length terms). From
the date hereof through the Closing, the Company shall not, and shall not
permit any Group Company to, enter into any transaction or Contract (other
than the Ancillary Documents) with any Affiliated Person unless such
transaction or Contract shall be terminated on or prior to the Closing Date in
accordance with this _Section 5.13_.

ARTICLE VII 
 TERMINATION

  

Section 7.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger may
be abandoned at any time prior to the Closing (except as limited as to time in
the case of clause (e) below) by written notice setting forth the applicable
clause below, only:

  

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

  

(b) by Parent, if any of the representations or warranties of the Company set
forth in _ARTICLE III_ shall not be true and correct, which failure to be true
and correct, either individually or in the aggregate, would result in the
condition to Closing set forth in _Section 6.2(a)_ not being satisfied or if
any of the covenants, obligations or agreements of the Company set forth in
this Agreement shall have been breached, which breach, either individually or
in the aggregate, would result in the condition to Closing set forth in

true and correct or breach (or failures to be true and correct or breaches) is
not cured within the earlier of (i) the Termination Date and (ii) 30 days

and correct or breaches) is not cured within the earlier of (i) the
Termination Date and (ii) 30 days after written notice thereof is delivered to
Parent; _provided_ , that the Company will not have the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(c)_ if the Company is then in

agreements contained in this Agreement such that the conditions set forth in

(d) by Parent, if the Requisite Stockholder Approval is not obtained within
one (1) Business Day of the date of this Agreement;

  

(e) by Parent, if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or prior to

representations, warranties, agreement, obligations or covenants under this
Agreement;

  

(f) by the Company, if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or prior

enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger and such order,
decree or ruling or other action shall have become final and nonappealable;

injunction.

  

Section 7.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1_ , this entire Agreement shall forthwith

Affiliates) with the exception of (i) the provisions of this _Section 7.2_ ,
_ARTICLE VIII_ , _ARTICLE IX_ and the penultimate sentence of _Section 5.2_ ,
each of which provisions shall survive such termination and remain valid and
binding obligations of the parties, and (ii) any Liability of any party hereto
for any willful or intentional breach of this Agreement (and, for the
avoidance of doubt, any failure by Parent to consummate the Transactions when
such Transactions are required to be consummated pursuant to _Section 2.2_
within the time period set forth in _Section 7.1(g)_ shall be deemed to be a
willful or intentional breach of this Agreement) prior to such termination, in
which case and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Sellers and the Company shall be entitled to all remedies available at law or
in equity, including equitable relief (including specific performance in
accordance with _Section 9.17)_ and damages (including damages for the benefit
of the bargain lost by the Sellers and the Company, diminution in value of the

Companies' costs and expenses (including pursuant to _Section 5.8_ )). The
parties hereto agree that the Company shall be entitled to receive any damages
that Sellers would have been entitled to claim had they been a direct party to
this Agreement. Nothing herein shall limit or prevent any party hereto from
exercising any rights or remedies it may have under _Section 9.17_.

discretion, may deem necessary or desirable;

  

(iii) to use the Representative Expense Amount to satisfy costs, expenses
and/or Liabilities of the Representative in connection with matters related to
this Agreement and/or the Ancillary Documents, with any balance of the
Representative Expense Amount not used for such purposes to be disbursed by
the Representative so that the applicable portions are paid to each holder of
Company Common Shares based on its Percentage Interests and the remainder is
paid to the Surviving Corporation and/or any other Group Company designated by

Options based on its Percentage Interest, less applicable withholding taxes)
at such time as the Representative determines in its sole discretion that no

(iv) to pay the Aggregate Liquidation Preference to the holders of Company
Preferred Shares in accordance with _Section 2.9(a)_ ;

  

(v) to collect and receive all moneys and other proceeds and property payable
to the Sellers as described herein, and, subject to any applicable withholding
retention laws, and net of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
Representative (including any Transaction Expenses paid by the Representative
in excess of the Representative Expense Amount), the Representative shall
disburse and pay the applicable portions thereof (A) to each holder of Company
Common Shares based on its Percentage Interests and (B) to the Surviving

Corporation (for distribution to each holder of Vested Company Options based
on its Percentage Interests), at such time as the Representative determines in
its reasonable discretion;

  

(vi) as the Representative, to enforce and protect the rights and interests of
Sellers (including the Representative, in its capacity as a Seller) and to
enforce and protect the rights and interests of the Representative arising out
of or under or in any manner relating to this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement, and each other Ancillary Document or the Transactions, and to take
any and all actions which the Representative believes are necessary or

  

  

    

appropriate under this Agreement and any Ancillary Document for and on behalf
of the Sellers, including asserting or pursuing any Claim against Parent,
Merger Sub and/or the Surviving Corporation, defending any third party Claims
or Claims by Parent, Merger Sub or their Affiliates, consenting to,

(B) investigate, defend, contest or litigate any Claim initiated by Parent,

determine to be appropriate, and give receipts, releases and discharges with
respect to, any such Claim; (C) file any proofs of debt, claims and petitions
as the Representative may deem advisable or necessary; (D) settle, negotiate

Claim, it being understood that the Representative shall not have any
obligation to take any such actions, and shall not have any Liability for any
failure to take any such actions;

  

(vii) to refrain from enforcing any right of any Seller and/or the
Representative arising out of or under or in any manner relating to this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any other Ancillary Document in connection
with the foregoing; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such failure to act on
the part of the Representative, except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or such other Ancillary Document, shall be
deemed a waiver of any such right or interest by the Representative or by such
Seller unless such waiver is in writing signed by the waiving party or by the
Representative;

  

(viii) engage attorneys, accountants, financial and other advisors and other
Persons (including the Escrow Agent) necessary or appropriate (at the expense
of the holders of Company Common Shares and Vested Company Options pro rata
based on their respective Percentage Interests), in the sole discretion of the
Representative in the performance of its duties hereunder; and

  

(ix) to make, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such other agreements,
guarantees, orders, receipts, endorsements, notices, requests, instructions,
certificates, stock powers, letters and other writings, and, in general, to do
any and all things and to take any and all action that the Representative, in
its sole and absolute discretion, may consider necessary or proper or
convenient in connection with or to carry out the Transactions.

  

(b) The Representative shall not be entitled to any fee, commission or other
compensation for the performance of its services hereunder, but shall be
entitled to the payment of all its expenses incurred as the Representative
from the holders of Company Common Shares and Vested Company Options (on a pro
rata basis based on their respective Percentage Interest). In connection with
this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and any other Ancillary Document, and in
exercising or failing to exercise all or any of the powers conferred upon the
Representative hereunder (i) the Representative shall incur no responsibility
whatsoever to any Seller by reason of any error in judgment or other act or
omission performed or omitted hereunder or in connection with the Escrow
Agreement or any other Ancillary Document, excepting only responsibility for
any act or failure to act which represents gross negligence or

  

  

    

willful misconduct, and (ii) the Representative shall be entitled to rely on
the advice of counsel, public accountants or other independent experts
experienced in the matter at issue, and any error in judgment or other act or
omission of the Representative pursuant to such advice shall in no event
subject the Representative to Liability to any Seller. Each holder of Company
Common Shares and Vested Company Options shall indemnify, pro rata based upon
such holder's Percentage Interest, the Representative against all losses,
damages, Liabilities, claims, obligations, costs and expenses, including
reasonable attorneys', accountants' and other experts' fees and the amount of
any judgment against them, of any nature whatsoever (including, but not
limited to, any and all expense whatsoever reasonably incurred in
investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, commenced or
threatened or any claims whatsoever), arising out of or in connection with any
Claim or in connection with any appeal thereof, relating to the acts or
omissions of the Representative hereunder, or under the Escrow Agreement or
any other Ancillary Document or otherwise in its capacity as the
Representative. The foregoing indemnification shall not apply in the event of
any Claim which finally adjudicates the Liability of the Representative
hereunder for its gross negligence or willful misconduct. In the event of any
indemnification hereunder, upon written notice from the Representative to the
Sellers as to the existence of a deficiency toward the payment of any such
indemnification amount, each holder of Company Common Shares and Vested
Company Options shall promptly deliver to the Representative full payment of
his or her ratable share of the amount of such deficiency, in accordance with
such holder's Percentage Interest. The Representative may resign or be
replaced by the Sellers together holding at least 50% of the Percentage
Interest and the newly appointed Representative shall deliver written notice
thereof to Parent and the Escrow Agent (together with reasonable evidence
thereof). Such substituted Representative shall be deemed to be the
Representative for all purposes of this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents.
Such removal and appointment shall be effective upon the later of the date
indicated in the written notice or the date such written notice is received by
Parent and the Escrow Agent. All decisions and actions by the Representative
shall be binding upon all Sellers and no Sellers shall have the right to
object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same.

  

(c) All of the indemnities, immunities and powers granted to the
Representative under this Agreement shall survive the Closing Date and/or any
termination of this Agreement and/or any Ancillary Document.

  

(d) Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to
rely conclusively upon all actions taken or omitted to be taken by the
Representative pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and any other
Ancillary Document, all of which actions or omissions shall be legally binding
upon the Sellers. Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation are
entitled to deal exclusively with the Representative on all matters relating
to this Agreement, any Ancillary Document or the Transactions. Any action
taken or not taken or decisions, communications or writings made, given or
executed by the Representative, for or on behalf of any Seller, shall be
deemed an action taken or not taken or decisions, communications or writings
made, given or executed by such Seller. Any notice or communication delivered
by Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation to the Representative shall
be deemed to have been delivered to all of the Sellers. Parent, Merger Sub and
the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to disregard any decisions,
communications or writings made, given or executed by any Seller in connection
with this Agreement, any Ancillary Document and the Transactions, unless the
same is made, given or executed by the Representative.

  

  

  

    

(e) The grant of authority provided for herein (i) is coupled with an interest
and shall be irrevocable and survive the death, incompetency, bankruptcy or
liquidation of any Seller and shall be binding upon the executors, heirs,
legal representatives, personal representatives, successor trustees and
successors of each stockholder of the Company, (ii) shall survive the
consummation of the Merger and (iii) shall be enforceable notwithstanding any
rights or remedies any of the Company's stockholders may have in connection
with the Transactions.

  

Section 8.2 _The Representative_. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree
that Avista Capital Partners II GP, LLC (in its capacity as the
Representative) is a party to this Agreement solely to perform certain
administrative functions in connection with the consummation of the
Transactions. Accordingly, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the
Representative, acting in such capacity, shall not be responsible for the
obligations of any Seller or other Person under this Agreement or any
Ancillary Document, (ii) shall have only such obligations hereunder as are
expressly set forth herein or in any Ancillary Document and (iii) shall be
entitled to the limitations of liability and rights to indemnification as
provided by the Sellers hereunder.

Section 9.3 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to
any choice of law or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State
of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the
law of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware, except to the extent
the DGCL shall be held to govern the Merger. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
each of the parties hereto agrees that the Debt Commitment Letter, the rights
and duties of the parties thereunder and any Claims arising under or related
thereto shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the
jurisdiction provided under the governing law provisions thereof.

Agreement, whether or not the Merger is consummated (including, for avoidance
of doubt, the fees and expenses to be borne by Parent in accordance with
_Section 5.4_ , _Section 5.8_ and _Section 7.2_ ), all fees and expenses
incurred in connection with the Merger, this Agreement and the Transactions,
including the fees and disbursements of counsel, financial advisors and
accountants, shall be paid by the party hereto incurring such fees or

Disclosure Schedules and Exhibits hereto, as the same may from time to time be
amended, modified, supplemented or restated in accordance with the terms
hereof. The headings contained in this Agreement are inserted for convenience
only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. The parties hereto agree that they have been represented by counsel
during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and, therefore, waive
the application of any Applicable Law or rule of construction providing that
ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be construed against the
party drafting such agreement or document. Further, no party hereto, nor its
respective counsel, shall be deemed the drafter of this Agreement for purposes
of construing or enforcing the provisions hereof, and all provisions of this
Agreement shall be construed according to their fair meaning and not strictly
for or against any party, and no presumption or burden of proof will arise
favoring or disfavoring any Person by virtue of its authorship of any
provision of this Agreement. Unless otherwise expressly provided herein, any
statute defined or referred to herein means such statute as from time to time
amended, modified or supplemented, including by succession of comparable
successor statutes. Any reference to any Applicable Law shall be deemed also
to refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the
context requires otherwise. Unless otherwise indicated to the contrary herein
by the context or use thereof: (i) the words, "herein," "hereto," "hereof" and
words of similar import refer to this Agreement as a whole, including the
Schedules, Parent Disclosure Schedules and Exhibits, and not to any particular
section, subsection paragraph, subparagraph or clause contained in this
Agreement; (ii) masculine gender shall also include the feminine and neutral
genders, and vice versa; (iii) words importing the singular shall also include
the plural, and vice versa; (iv) the words "include," "includes" or

Disclosure Schedules are to Articles, Sections, Exhibits, Schedules and Parent

herein but are defined in GAAP have the meanings ascribed to them therein;
(ix) the words "writing", "written" and comparable terms refer to printing,
typing and other means of reproducing words (including electronic media) in a
visible form; (x) other than as used with respect to any Schedule or Parent
Disclosure Schedule, references to any Applicable Law, agreement or Contract
are to that Applicable Law, agreement or Contract as amended, modified or
supplemented from time to time in accordance with the terms hereof and
thereof; (xi) references to any Person include the successors and permitted
assigns of that Person; (xii) references from or through any date mean, unless
otherwise specified, from and including or through and including,
respectively; (xiii) the words "dollar" or "$" shall mean U.S. dollars; (xiv)
the word "day" means calendar day unless Business Day is expressly specified

taken on a day that is not a Business Day, then such action shall be required
to be done or taken not on such day but on the first succeeding Business Day
thereafter); and (xv) with respect to the

  

  

    

determination of any period of time, the word "from" means "from and
including" and the words "to" and "until" each means "to but including".

  

Section 9.7 _Exhibits and Schedules_. All Exhibits, Schedules, Parent
Disclosure Schedules, or documents expressly incorporated into this Agreement,
are hereby incorporated into this Agreement and are hereby made a part hereof
as if set out in full in this Agreement. Any item disclosed in any Schedule or
Parent Disclosure Schedule referenced by a particular Section in this
Agreement shall be deemed to have been disclosed with respect to every other
Section in this Agreement if the relevance of such disclosure to such other
sections is reasonably apparent. The specification of any dollar amount in the
representations or warranties contained in this Agreement or the inclusion of
any specific item in any Schedule or Parent Disclosure Schedule is not
intended to imply that such amounts, or higher or lower amounts or the items
so included or other items, are or are not material, and no party shall use
the fact of the setting of such amounts or the inclusion of any such item in
any dispute or controversy as to whether any obligation, items or matter not
described herein or included in a Schedule or Parent Disclosure Schedule is or
is not material for purposes of this Agreement. Any capitalized term used in
any Exhibit, Schedule or Parent Disclosure Schedule but not otherwise defined
therein shall have the meaning given to such term in this Agreement.

  

Section 9.8 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each party and its successors and permitted
assigns and, except as provided in _Section 5.5_ , _Section 5.8(c)_ , _Section
7.2_ , this _Section 9.8_ and _Section 9.18_ , nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any
rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) from and after the Closing,
the equityholders and optionholders of the Company as of immediately prior to
the Closing shall be third party beneficiaries of _Section 2.8_ , _Section
2.9_ , _Section 8.1(a)(iv)_ and _Section 9.18_ , (b) the Sellers, the
Representative and its Affiliates are third party beneficiaries of _Section

_Section 9.15_ , _Section 9.16_ and _Section 9.18_.

  

Section 9.9 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this
Agreement will be interpreted in such a manner as to be effective and valid
under Applicable Law, but if any term or other provision of this Agreement is
held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable under Applicable Law, all other
provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect so long as
the economic or legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party hereto. Upon such determination that
any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or
unenforceable under Applicable Law, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the
Transactions are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent
possible.

  

Section 9.10 _Amendment_. Prior to the Effective Time, subject to Applicable
Law (including the DGCL) and _Section 9.11_ , this Agreement may be amended or
modified only by a written agreement executed and delivered by duly authorized
officers of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company. After the Effective Time,
subject to Applicable Law (including the DGCL), this Agreement may be amended
or modified only by written agreement executed and delivered

  

  

    

by duly authorized officers of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Representative. This Agreement may not be modified or amended except as
provided in the immediately preceding two sentences and any purported
amendment by any party or parties hereto effected in a manner which does not
comply with this _Section 9.10_ shall be void. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, _Section 9.3_ , _Section 9.8_ , this _Section 9.10_ ,
_Section 9.15_ , _Section 9.16_ and _Section 9.18_ may not be amended or
modified without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources.

Company may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations

herein, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of
the Company contained herein or in any document, certificate or writing
delivered by the Company or Sellers pursuant hereto or (iii) waive compliance
by the Company with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of any party hereto to any such extension or waiver
shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of
such party. Any waiver of any term or condition shall not be construed as a
waiver of any subsequent breach or a subsequent waiver of the same term or
condition, or a waiver of any other term or condition of this Agreement. The
failure of any party hereto to assert any of its rights hereunder shall not
constitute a waiver of such rights.

  

Section 9.12 _Survival of Representations and Covenants_. The representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements of the parties contained in this
Agreement shall terminate as of and shall not survive beyond the Closing for
all purposes, including any right to damages under any theory or cause of
action, and there shall be no Liability in respect thereof, including but not
limited to Liability for any inaccuracy, misrepresentation, breach of, default
in, or failure to perform any such representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements whether such Liability has accrued prior to or after the Closing,

partners, members, officers, directors, employees, agents or representatives,
except for (i) those covenants and agreements to the extent that by their
terms apply or are to be performed in whole or in part at or after the

and exclusive remedies of each party with respect to this Agreement from and
after the Closing, and (iii) any claims for Actual Fraud committed by such
Person.

RELATED HERETO, INCLUDING ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE DEBT

Section 9.16 _Jurisdiction and Venue_. Each of the parties hereto (i) submits
to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware
(or, if the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court sitting in
Delaware) in any Claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, (ii)
agrees that all claims in respect of such Claim may be heard and determined in
any such court and (iii) agrees not to bring any Claim arising out of or
relating to this Agreement in any other court. Each of the parties hereto
waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any Claim so
brought and waives any bond, surety or other security that might be required
of any other party with respect thereto. Each party hereto agrees that service
of summons and complaint or any other process that might be served in any
Claim may be made on such party by sending or delivering a copy of the process
to the party to be served at the address of the party and in the manner
provided for the giving of notices in _Section 9.2_. Nothing in this _Section
9.16_ , however, shall affect the right of any party to serve legal process in
any other manner permitted by the Applicable Law. Each party hereto agrees
that a final, non-appealable judgment in any Claim so brought shall be
conclusive and may be enforced by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by Applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
each party hereto hereby irrevocably agrees (i) that any Claim of any kind or
description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, involving the Financing Sources arising out of or relating to the
Transactions, the Debt Financing and the transactions contemplated by the Debt
Financing Commitment Letter, any related fee letters or the performance of
services thereunder shall be brought to the exclusive jurisdiction of any
state or federal court sitting in the City of New York, Borough of Manhattan,
(ii) not to bring or permit any of its Affiliates to bring or support any
other Person in bringing any such Claim and (iii) to waive any right to trial
by jury in respect of any such Claim.

  

Section 9.17 _Remedies_.

  

(a) Any and all remedies provided herein will be deemed cumulative with and
not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon
such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude
the exercise of any other

  

  

    

remedy. Parent and the Company agree that irreparable harm, for which monetary
damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in
the event that the parties hereto do not perform their respective obligations
under the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to comply with their
obligations under _Section 5.8_ or take such actions as are required of them
hereunder to consummate the Transactions) in accordance with their specific
terms or otherwise breach such provisions. It is accordingly agreed that,
prior to the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1_ ,
the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific
performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement
(including _Section 5.8_ and Parent's obligations to consummate the
Transactions if it is required to do so hereunder), in each case, without
posting a bond or undertaking and without needing to prove damages, this being
in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity. The foregoing right shall include the right of the Company and the
Representative to cause Parent to cause the Transactions to be consummated, in
each case, if, the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.2_
have been satisfied or waived (other than conditions which by their nature
cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but subject to such conditions being
capable of being satisfied at such time). Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief when expressly available pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement on the basis that the other parties have an
adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity.

  

(b) To the extent any party hereto brings a Claim or other similar process to
enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this
Agreement (other than an action to enforce specifically any provision that
expressly survives termination of this Agreement) when expressly available to
such party pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Termination Date shall
automatically be extended to (i) the twentieth (20th) Business Day following
the resolution of such Claim or other similar process or (ii) such other time
period established by the court presiding over such Claim or other similar
process (and Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to extend the
term of any Financing beyond the revised Termination Date as extended by this
_Section 9.17_ ).

  

Section 9.18 _Non-Recourse_ _._ Except for any Claims for Actual Fraud
committed by such Person, all Claims (whether in contract or in tort, in law
or in equity) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement
or the other Ancillary Documents, or the negotiation, execution or performance
of this Agreement or the other Ancillary Documents (including any
representation or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement or the
other Ancillary Documents or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement or
the other Ancillary Documents), may be made only against the entities that are
expressly identified as parties hereto and thereto. Except for any Claims for
Actual Fraud committed by such Person, no Person who is not a named party to
this Agreement or the other Ancillary Documents, including any past, present
or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner,
stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or representative of any named party
to this Agreement or the other Ancillary Documents (" _Non-Party Affiliates_
"), shall have any Liability (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in
equity, or based upon any theory that seeks to impose Liability of an entity
party against its owners or affiliates) for any obligations or Liabilities
arising under, in connection with or related to this Agreement or such other
Ancillary Agreement (as the case may be) or for any claim based on, in respect
of, or by reason of this Agreement or such other

  

  

    

Ancillary Agreement (as the case may be) or the negotiation or execution
hereof or thereof; and each party hereto waives and releases all such
Liabilities, claims and obligations against any such Non-Party Affiliates.
Non-Party Affiliates are expressly intended as third party beneficiaries of
this provision of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, none of the
Financing Sources will have any liability to the Seller or its Affiliates
relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Debt Financing or otherwise,
whether at law, or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and neither the
Seller nor any of its Affiliates will have any rights or claims against any of
the Financing Sources hereunder or thereunder; provided that this sentence
shall in no way limit the Company's ability to seek specific performance
pursuant to _Section 9.17_.

  

Section 9.19 _Waiver of Conflicts_ _and Privileged Information_.

  

(a) Each party to this Agreement acknowledges that (i) one or more of the
Group Companies, the Representative, Sellers and/or their respective
Affiliates have retained Kirkland and Ellis LLP (the " _Law Firm_ ") to act as
their counsel in connection with the Transactions (including the negotiation,
preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and related agreements,
and the consummation of the Transactions) as well as other past and ongoing
matters, (ii) Law Firm has not acted as counsel for any other Person in
connection with the Transactions and (iii) no Person other than the Group
Companies, one or more of the Sellers, the Representative or their respective
Affiliates has the status of a Law Firm client for conflict of interest or any
other purpose as a result thereof. Parent hereby (A) waives and will not
assert, and will cause each of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing,
the Group Companies) to waive and not assert, any conflict of interest
relating to Law Firm's representation after the Closing of any Seller, the
Representative or their respective Affiliates in any matter involving the
Transactions (including the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery
of this Agreement and related agreements, and the consummation of the
Transactions), including in any litigation, arbitration, mediation or other
proceeding, and (B) consents to, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries
(including, after the Closing, the Group Companies) to consent to, any such
representation, even though in each case (x) the interests of such Seller, the
Representative or such Affiliates may be directly adverse to Parent, the Group
Companies or their respective Affiliates, (y) Law Firm may have represented
the Sellers, the Group Companies, the Representative or their respective
Affiliates in a substantially related matter, or (z) Law Firm may be handling
other ongoing matters for Parent, the Group Companies, or any of their
respective Affiliates.

  

(b) Parent agrees that, after the Closing, none of Parent, the Group Companies
or any of their Affiliates will have any right to access or control any of Law
Firm's records or communications relating to or affecting the Transactions
(including the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this
Agreement and related agreements, and the consummation of the Transactions or
thereby), which will be the property of (and be controlled by) the
Representative. In addition, Parent agrees that it would be impractical to
remove all Attorney-Client Communications from the records (including e-mails
and other electronic files) of the Group Companies. Accordingly, Parent will
not, and will cause each of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the
Group Companies) not to, use any Attorney-Client Communication remaining in
the records of the Group Companies after the Closing in a manner that may be
adverse to the Representative, any Seller or any of their respective
Affiliates.

  

  

    

(c) Parent agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Group Companies), that from and after the
Closing (i) the attorney-client privilege, all other evidentiary privileges,
and the expectation of client confidence as to all Attorney-Client
Communications belong to the Sellers and will not pass to or be claimed by
Parent, the Group Companies, or any of their Affiliates, and (ii) the
Representative will have the exclusive right to control, assert or waive the
attorney-client privilege, any other evidentiary privilege, and the
expectation of client confidence with respect to such Attorney-Client
Communications. Accordingly, Parent will not, and will cause each of its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Group Companies) not to, (x)
assert any attorney-client privilege, other evidentiary privilege, or
expectation of client confidence with respect to any Attorney-Client
Communication, except in the event of a post-Closing dispute with a Person
that is not a Seller, the Representative or any of their respective
Affiliates; or (y) waive any privilege relating to such Attorney-Client
Communication to the extent the Sellers are asserting such privilege in any
proceeding and have notified Parent in respect thereof. Furthermore, Parent
agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of each of its Affiliates (including,
after the Closing, the Group Companies), that in the event of a dispute
between any Seller, the Representative or any of their respective Affiliates,
on the one hand, and the Group Companies, on the other hand, arising out of or
relating to any matter in which Law Firm jointly represented both parties,
neither the attorney-client privilege, the expectation of client confidence,
nor any right to any other evidentiary privilege will protect from disclosure
to such Seller, the Representative or their respective Affiliates any
information or documents developed or shared during the course of Law Firm's
joint representation.

LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the " _Representative_ "), Spectrum
Brands Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ ") and Citibank,
N.A., as escrow agent (the " _Escrow Agent_ "). Each of the Representative,
Parent and the Escrow Agent are from time to time referred to herein each
individually as a " _Party_ ", and collectively as the " _Parties_ ". Each
capitalized term which is used but not otherwise defined in this Agreement has
the meaning assigned to such term in the Merger Agreement (as defined below).

  

WHEREAS, on April 28, 2015, Armored AutoGroup Parent Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the " _Company_ "), Parent, Ignite Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware
corporation and an indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_
"), and the Representative entered into that certain Agreement and Plan of
Merger (as such agreement may be amended, restated or otherwise modified from
time to time in accordance with its terms, the " _Merger Agreement_ ");

  

WHEREAS, on the Effective Date, the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement were consummated, pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Sub
merged with and into the Company;

  

WHEREAS, the Representative and Parent agreed in the Merger Agreement to enter
into this Agreement with the Escrow Agent;

  

WHEREAS, on the Effective Date, Parent will deliver to the account designated
by the Escrow Agent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds for
deposit in the Escrow Account (as defined below), an amount equal to
$10,000,000 (the " _Escrow Amount_ "), pursuant to the terms and conditions
set forth in the Merger Agreement (including, without limitation, Section
2.9(a)(i) thereof);

  

WHEREAS, the Escrow Agent agrees to hold and distribute the Escrow Amount in
accordance with the terms of this Escrow Agreement;

  

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each of the Sellers appointed,
authorized and empowered the Representative as exclusive agent and attorney-
in-fact to act on behalf of such Seller, in connection with and to facilitate
the consummation of the Transactions, including pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement, and all actions taken by the Representative under this Escrow
Agreement will be binding upon such Seller and such Seller's successors and
assigns as if expressly ratified and confirmed in writing by each of the them.

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants
contained herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:

  

1. _Appointment of and Acceptance by Escrow Agent_. The Representative and Parent hereby appoint and designate the Escrow Agent to hold and maintain possession of the Escrow Account (as defined below) and the Escrow Amount deposited therein and to act as 

  

  

    

escrow agent for the purposes set forth herein, and the Escrow Agent hereby
accepts such appointment and designation under the terms and conditions set
forth herein.

  

2. _Receipt of Deposit; Establishment of Escrow_.

  

(a) On the Effective Date, Parent will deliver, or cause to be delivered, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds for deposit, an amount equal to
the Escrow Amount to the Escrow Agent, and the Escrow Agent will acknowledge
to the Representative and Parent its receipt of the Escrow Amount.

  

(b) The Escrow Agent shall hold, invest and disburse the funds remaining in
the Escrow Account from time to time (the " _Escrow Funds_ ") solely in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

  

(c) The Escrow Agent shall place the Escrow Funds into a separate, non-
commingled non-interest bearing account (the " _Escrow Account_ ").

  

3. _Maintenance of the Escrow Funds_. Receipt and disbursement of the Escrow Funds shall be confirmed by the Escrow Agent to Parent and the Representative as soon as practicable by account statement, and any discrepancies in any such account statement shall be noted by the Representative or Parent to the Escrow Agent within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt thereof. The Escrow Agent shall provide a report to Parent and the Representative upon any disbursement of the Escrow Funds made pursuant to this Agreement, which report shall include (i) the address to which each payment was sent or the wiring instructions, as applicable, (ii) the amount disbursed and (iii) the check or reference number, as applicable.

  

4. _FIRPTA_. Parent represents to Escrow Agent that it is not a "foreign person" for purposes of Section 1445 of the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations thereunder. In the event the Escrow Funds held in the Escrow Account ever earn interest at the election of the Parties, the Parties shall provide written instruction to the Escrow Agent as to whom the interest paid to the Escrow Account is attributed to for tax reporting purposes.

  

5. _Escrow Agent 's Disbursement of the Escrow Funds_.

  

(a) Except as otherwise set forth in this _Section 5_ , the Escrow Agent shall
disburse the Escrow Funds, or any portion thereof, only (i) in accordance with
the joint written instructions of the Representative and Parent (the " _Joint
Instructions_ "), (ii) upon receipt of a copy of a final determination of the
Actual Adjustment issued by the Accounting Firm in accordance with Section 2.9
of the Merger Agreement, certified in writing by the Party providing such
determination (a " _Final Determination_ "), or (iii) upon receipt of a copy
of a final judgment, decree or order of a court not subject to appeal,
certified in writing by the Party providing such judgment, decree or order,
along with such certificate (a " _Final Judgment_ ") (such Party to
concurrently provide a copy of such Final Judgment to the other Party). The
Joint Instructions shall set forth, or the Final Judgment or Final
Determination shall be accompanied by, sufficient payment instructions for
each portion of the Escrow Funds to be distributed and except as otherwise set
forth in this _Section 5_ , the Escrow Agent shall act solely upon such Joint
Instructions, Final Judgment or Final Determination.

  

  

    

(b) Any amount payable pursuant to this _Section 5_ shall be paid within three
(3) Business Days following the receipt of the Joint Instructions, Final
Judgment or Final Determination via wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the account designated in writing by the recipient thereof.

  

(c) The Escrow Agent shall act solely upon the instructions and notices it
receives from the Parties under this _Section 5_ and shall not be responsible
for determining whether such instructions are in accordance with the Merger
Agreement.

  

6. _Liability and Duties of the Escrow Agent_. The Escrow Agent's duties and obligations under this Agreement shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this Agreement and as set forth in the Final Determination, the Final Judgment or any additional written escrow instructions in accordance with this Agreement and signed jointly by the Representative and Parent which the Escrow Agent may receive after the date of this Agreement (including the Joint Instructions). The Escrow Agent shall be under no obligation to refer to any documents other than this Agreement and the written instructions and requests, the Final Determination and any Final Judgment delivered to the Escrow Agent hereunder. The Escrow Agent shall not be obligated to recognize, and shall not have any liability or responsibility arising under, any agreement to which the Escrow Agent is not a party, even though reference thereto may be made herein. With respect to the Escrow Agent's responsibility, the Representative and Parent further agree that:

  

(a) The Escrow Agent, including its officers, directors, employees and agents,
shall not be liable to anyone whomsoever by reason of any error of judgment or
for any act done or step taken or omitted in good faith by the Escrow Agent,
or for any mistake of fact or law or anything which the Escrow Agent may do or
refrain from doing in good faith in connection herewith, unless caused by or
arising out of the fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Escrow
Agent (including its affiliates and its and its affiliates' respective
officers, directors and employees). The Escrow Agent may execute any of its
powers and perform any of its duties hereunder directly or through attorneys,
affiliates or agents and, with respect to such attorneys or agents (but not
affiliates), shall be liable only for its fraud, gross negligence or willful
misconduct (as finally adjudicated in a court of competent jurisdiction) in
the selection of any such attorney or agent. The Escrow Agent may consult with
counsel, accountants and other skilled persons to be selected and retained by
it. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any action taken, suffered or
omitted to be taken by it in accordance with, or in reliance upon, the advice
or opinion of any such counsel, accountants or other skilled persons. The
Representative and Parent shall jointly and severally, indemnify and hold the
Escrow Agent and its directors, officers and employees (the " _indemnitees_ ")
harmless from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, liabilities,
penalties, judgments, settlements, actions, suits, proceedings, litigation,
investigations, costs or expenses (including, without limitation, the
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses of outside counsel
and all reasonable and documented expenses of document location, duplication
and shipment) (collectively " _Losses_ ") arising out of or in connection with
(i) the Escrow Agent's execution and performance of this Agreement, the
enforcement of any rights or remedies under or in connection with this
Agreement, or as may arise by reason of any act, omission or error of the
indemnitee, except in the case of any indemnitee to the extent that such
Losses are finally adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction to have
been caused by the fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct

  

  

    

of the Escrow Agent or its affiliates or its or its affiliates' respective
officers, directors or employees or, (ii) to the extent expressly permitted by
the terms of this Agreement, its following any instructions or other
directions, whether joint or singular, from Parent and the Representative,
except to the extent that its following any such instruction or direction is
expressly forbidden by the terms hereof. The Representative and Parent hereby
grant the Escrow Agent a lien on, right of set-off against and security
interest in the Escrow Funds for the payment of any claim for indemnification,
expenses and amounts due hereunder. In furtherance of the foregoing, the
Escrow Agent is expressly authorized and directed, but shall not be obligated,
to charge against and withdraw from the Escrow Funds for its own account or
for the account of an indemnitee any amounts due to the Escrow Agent or to an
indemnitee under this _Section 6_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, the Representative and Parent agree, solely as between themselves,
that any obligation for indemnification under this _Section 6_ (or for
reasonable and documented fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent described in
_Section 7_ ) shall be borne between the Representative and Parent based on
the relative fault of such Parties (and their representatives), as determined
by a court of competent jurisdiction, in causing the loss, damage, liability,
cost or expense against which the Escrow Agent is entitled to indemnification
or, if no such determination is made, then one-half by the Representative and
one-half by Parent, and each such Party shall promptly satisfy its obligations
to the other (including, if any amounts have been withdrawn from the Escrow
Account by the Escrow Agent to satisfy the Parties' joint obligations to the
Escrow Agent, the Parent shall promptly reimburse the Representative for
amounts withdrawn from the Escrow Account for which it was responsible under
this sentence). Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in
no event shall any Party be liable under this Agreement for special,
incidental, punitive, indirect or consequential loss or damage of any kind
whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits), even if such Party has
been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the
form of action. The obligations contained in this _Section 6_ shall survive
the termination of this Agreement and the resignation, replacement or removal
of the Escrow Agent.

  

(b) Promptly after the end of each month, or at any other time upon request by
Parent or the Representative, the Escrow Agent shall provide the
Representative and Parent with monthly statements showing disbursements, if
any, of the Escrow Funds.

  

(c) This Agreement is a personal one, the Escrow Agent's duties hereunder
being only to the Representative and Parent, their successors, permitted
assigns, heirs and legal representatives, and to no other Person whomsoever.

  

(d) No succession to, or assignment of, the interest of the Representative or
Parent under this Agreement shall be binding upon the Escrow Agent unless and
until written notice of such succession or assignment has been provided to the
Escrow Agent.

  

(e) The Escrow Agent may rely or act upon any written instructions furnished
to it pursuant to the terms and provisions of this Agreement bearing a
signature or signatures believed by the Escrow Agent in good faith to be
genuine of the Representative and Parent without inquiry and without requiring
substantiating evidence of any kind.

  

(f) In case the Escrow Agent obeys or complies with any writ, order, judgment
or decree entered by any court affecting the property deposited under this
Agreement,

  

  

    

the Escrow Agent shall not be liable to the Representative or Parent or to any
other Person by reason of such compliance in connection with such litigation
(other than as a result of the fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct
of the Escrow Agent (including its affiliates and its and its affiliates'
respective officers, directors and employees)). The Escrow Agent will provide
written notice to the Representative and Parent as soon as practicable of any
judicial or administrative order, judgment, decree, writ or other form of
judicial or administrative process served upon the Escrow Agent which in any
way affects the Escrow Funds (including but not limited to orders of
attachment or garnishment or other forms of levies or injunctions or stays
relating to the transfer of Escrow Funds) (any of the foregoing, an "Order"),
and to the extent practicable, at least five (5) Business Days prior to
disbursing any funds from the Escrow Account in respect thereof); _provided_ ,
that the Escrow Agent shall have no obligation to provide notice to the
Representative or Parent with respect to any Order until notice of such Order
has been received by the Escrow Agent (from any source) at the address set
forth in _Section 9_ , so long as the Escrow Agent provides reasonable written
notice to the Representative and Parent prior to taking any action to obey or
comply with any Order, whether or not notice of such Order has been provided
to the Escrow Agent at the address set forth in _Section 9_.

  

(g) The Escrow Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties or
obligations hereunder by giving thirty (30) calendar days advance notice in
writing of such resignation to the other Parties specifying a date when such
resignation shall take effect. In addition, Parent, on the one hand, and the
Representative, on the other hand, acting jointly, shall have the right to
terminate the appointment of the Escrow Agent by giving it thirty (30) days'
notice in writing of such termination, specifying the date upon which such
termination shall take effect. Within thirty (30) days after receiving such
notice in the case of resignation, or providing such notice in the case of
termination, the Representative and Parent jointly shall (i) each pay one-half
of the Escrow Agent's outstanding fees, costs and expenses that are due and
payable under this Agreement and (ii) appoint a successor escrow agent to
which the Escrow Agent shall distribute the property then held under this
Agreement and shall deliver all information and documentation related thereto,
whereupon the Escrow Agent shall upon such distribution and delivery to a
successor escrow agent, be discharged of and from any and all further
obligations arising in connection with this Agreement, except for such
liability and expenses which results from the Escrow Agent's fraud, gross
negligence or willful misconduct. If the Representative and Parent have failed
to appoint a successor escrow agent prior to the expiration of thirty (30)
days following either receipt of the notice of resignation or provision of the
notice of termination, the Escrow Agent may petition any court of competent
jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor escrow agent or for other
appropriate relief, and any such resulting appointment shall be binding upon
all of the Parties hereto. Until a successor escrow agent has accepted such
appointment and the Escrow Agent has transferred the Escrow Funds to such
successor escrow agent, the Escrow Agent shall continue to retain and
safeguard the Escrow Funds until receipt of (A) a joint written instruction by
Parent and the Representative, or (B) an order of a court of competent
jurisdiction. In accordance with _Section 6(a)_ and _Section 7_ , the Escrow
Agent shall have the right to withhold an amount equal to any amount due and
owing to the Escrow Agent.

  

(h) In the event that the Escrow Agent is in doubt as to what action it should
take hereunder, the Escrow Agent shall be permitted but not obligated to refer
the matter to a court of competent jurisdiction and shall retain the Escrow
Funds until the Escrow Agent shall

  

  

    

have received (i) an order of a court of competent jurisdiction directing
delivery of the Escrow Funds or (ii) a joint written instruction executed by
Parent and the Representative directing delivery of the Escrow Funds, at which
time the Escrow Agent shall disburse the Escrow Funds in accordance with such
court order or joint written instruction. The Parties hereto other than the
Escrow Agent further agree to pursue any redress or recourse in connection
with such a dispute, without making the Escrow Agent a party to same (unless
in connection with any such dispute a party claims fraud, gross negligence or
willful misconduct by the Escrow Agent (including its affiliates and its and
its affiliates' respective officers, directors and employees).

  

(i) Subject to _Sections 6(a)_ and _7_ , the Escrow Agent does not have any
interest in the Escrow Funds, but is serving as escrow holder only and has
only possession thereof as escrow agent hereunder. _Sections 6(a)_, _7_ and
this _Section 6(i)_ shall survive notwithstanding any termination of this
Agreement or the Escrow Agent's resignation.

  

7. _Compensation of Escrow Agent_. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to fees and reimbursement for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses including, but not by way of limitation, the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and costs of attorneys or agents which it may find necessary to engage in performance of its duties hereunder, in accordance with the fee schedule attached hereto as _Schedule 1_. Such fees and expenses shall be paid on the Effective Date 50% by Parent and 50% by the Representative. Subject to _Section 6(a)_ , any such fees and expenses that are payable following the Effective Date shall be payable 50% by the Representative and 50% by Parent; _provided_ that fees payable by Parent or the Representative hereunder may be paid out of the Escrow Funds to the extent and at such time as the portion of the Escrow Funds is released to Parent or the Representative, respectively.

  

8. _Security Procedures_.

  

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary as set forth in _Section 9_ , any
instructions setting forth, claiming, containing, objecting to, or in any way
related to the transfer or distribution of funds, including but not limited to
any such funds transfer instructions that may otherwise be set forth in a
written instruction permitted pursuant to _Section 5_ of this Agreement, may
be given to the Escrow Agent only by mail, confirmed facsimile or email and no
instruction for or related to the transfer or distribution of the Escrow
Funds, or any portion thereof, shall be deemed delivered and effective unless
the Escrow Agent actually shall have received such instruction in writing by
mail, facsimile or email at the address, number or email, respectively,
provided to the Parties by the Escrow Agent in accordance with _Section 9_.

  

(b) In the event funds transfer instructions are given (other than in writing
at the time of the execution of this Agreement), whether in writing, by
facsimile or otherwise, the Escrow Agent is authorized to seek confirmation of
such instructions by telephone call-back to the individual(s) designated on
the Incumbency Certificates which have been provided by each of the
Representative and Parent to the Escrow Agent (the " _Incumbency Certificates_
"), and the Escrow Agent may rely upon the confirmations of anyone purporting
to be the individual(s) so designated. Each funds transfer instruction shall
be executed by an authorized signatory, a list of such signatories is set
forth on Incumbency Certificates. The individuals and telephone numbers for
call-backs may be changed only in writing actually received and acknowledged
by the Escrow Agent. Each of the Representative and Parent agree to promptly
provide the Escrow

  

  

    

Agent with a replacement Incumbency Certificate and any necessary due
diligence documentation requested by the Escrow Agent naming a replacement
authorized signatory or replacement authorized individual for call-backs, as
applicable, if at any time any authorized signatory or authorized individual
for call-backs contained in its Incumbency Certificate is no longer authorized
on behalf of such Party. The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that such
security procedure is commercially reasonable. It is understood that the
Escrow Agent and the beneficiary's bank in any funds transfer may rely solely
upon any account numbers or similar identifying numbers provided by any party
hereto to identify (i) the beneficiary, (ii) the beneficiary's bank or (iii)
an intermediary bank. The Escrow Agent may apply any of the Escrow Funds for
any payment order it executes using any such identifying number, even when its
use may result in a person other than the beneficiary being paid, or the
transfer of funds to a bank other than the beneficiary's bank or an
intermediary bank designated.

applicable Party in the event such other due diligence documentation is needed
in accordance with _Section 24_ herein.

  

11. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, all other provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party.

  

12. _No Strict Construction_. The language used in this Agreement will be deemed to be the language chosen by Parent, the Representative and the Escrow Agent to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction will be applied against any Person.

16. _Amendment; Waiver_. This Agreement may not be amended or modified, except by a written instrument executed by Parent, the Representative and the Escrow Agent. No provision of this Agreement may be waived except in a writing signed by the party against whom such enforcement is sought. Neither the failure nor any delay on the part of any Party to exercise any right, remedy, power, or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege preclude any other or further exercise of the same or of any other right, remedy, power, or privilege with respect to any 

  

  

    

occurrence be construed as a waiver of any right, remedy, power, or privilege
with respect to any other occurrence.

  

17. _Termination_. This Agreement shall remain in effect unless and until the Escrow Funds are distributed in full. Termination of this Agreement shall not impair the obligations of Parent and the Representative set forth in _Sections 6(a)_ and _7_ , which such obligations shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

  

18. _Merger or Consolidation_. Any banking association or corporation into which the Escrow Agent (or substantially all of its escrow business) may be merged, converted or with which the Escrow Agent may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Escrow Agent shall be a party, or any banking association or corporation to which all or substantially all of the escrow business of the Escrow Agent shall be sold or otherwise transferred, shall succeed to all the Escrow Agent's rights, obligations and immunities hereunder without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding.

  

19. _Entire Agreement_. As between all of the Parties, this Agreement and the Merger Agreement and the other Ancillary Documents (including, in each case, any schedule, exhibit or annex attached hereto or thereto) contain the entire agreement and understanding among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, whether written or oral, relating to such subject matter in any way; _provided_ , that in regard to the Escrow Agent only, this Agreement (including any schedule attached hereto) contains the entire agreement and understanding among the Parties hereto and the Escrow Agent with respect to the subject matter hereof. Solely with respect to Parent and the Representative, in the event of any conflict between the terms and provisions of this Agreement and either the Merger Agreement or any other Ancillary Document (including, in each case, any schedule, exhibit or annex attached hereto or thereto), the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement or such Ancillary Document, as applicable, shall control as between the Representative and Parent.

  

20. _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and their permitted successors and assigns and nothing herein expressed or implied shall give or be construed to give any Person, other than the parties hereto and such permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable rights hereunder.

  

21. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION (I) ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR (II) IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES IN RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED HERETO, IN EACH CASE, WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY, OR OTHERWISE. EACH PARTY HEREBY FURTHER AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY AND THAT THE PARTIES MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS 

  

  

    

WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY.

  

22. _Jurisdiction_. Each of the Parties hereto (a) irrevocably consents to the service of the summons and complaint and any other process in any action or proceeding relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, for and on behalf of itself or any of its properties or assets, in accordance with this _Section 22_ or in such other manner as may be permitted by applicable law, that such process may be served in the manner of giving notices in _Section 9_ and that nothing in this _Section 22_ shall affect the right of any Party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by applicable law; (b) irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits itself and its properties and assets in any action or proceeding to the exclusive general jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the " _Chancery Court_ ") and any state appellate court therefrom located within the State of Delaware (or, only if the Chancery Court declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware) in the event any dispute or controversy arises out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect thereof; (c) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court; (d) agrees that any actions or proceedings arising in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought, tried and determined only in the Chancery Court and any state appellate court therefrom located within the State of Delaware (or, only if the Chancery Court declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware); (e) waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such action or proceeding in any such court or that such action or proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim the same; and (f) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in any court other than the aforesaid courts. Each Party agrees that a final judgment in any action or proceeding in such courts as provided above shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable law.

  

23. _Force Majeure_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no Party shall be liable to any other Party for losses due to, or if it is unable to perform any obligation hereunder because of acts of God, war, terrorism, fire, floods, strikes, electrical outages, equipment or transmission failures or other causes reasonably beyond its control.

  

24. _Identification_. The Representative and Parent acknowledge that the Escrow Agent, pursuant to the requirements of Section 326 of the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (" _USA PATRIOT Act_ "), requires the Escrow Agent to implement reasonable procedures to verify the identity of any Person that opens a new account with it. Accordingly, the Representative and Parent acknowledge that Section 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act and the Escrow Agent's identity verification procedures require the Escrow Agent to obtain information which may be used to confirm the Representative's and Parent's identity including without limitation name, address and organizational documents (" _Identifying Information_ "). The Representative and Parent agree to provide the Escrow Agent with and consent to the Escrow Agent obtaining from third parties any such Identifying Information required (in the Escrow Agent's reasonable judgment) by the 

  

  

    

USA PATRIOT ACT as a condition of opening an account with or using any service
provided by the Escrow Agent.

  

25. _Citibank Name_. Other than the Merger Agreement or any Ancillary Documents and except as required by law, no printed or other material in any language, including prospectuses, notices, reports, and promotional material which mentions "Citibank" by name or the rights, powers, or duties of the Escrow Agent under this Agreement shall be issued by any other parties hereto, or on such party's behalf, without the prior written consent of the Escrow Agent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  


 

  

You are receiving this Letter of Transmittal in connection with the merger
(the "Merger") of Ignite Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Merger
Sub"), with and into Armored AutoGroup Parent Inc., a Delaware corporation
(the "Company"), pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger (the
"Merger Agreement"), dated as of April 28, 2015, by and among Spectrum Brands
Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), Merger Sub, the Company and
Avista Capital Partners II GP, LLC, as Representative (the "Representative").
Capitalized terms used in this Letter of Transmittal and not defined herein
shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Merger Agreement.

  


 

  

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, each issued and
outstanding Company Preferred Share, Company Common Share and Company Option
will be cancelled and extinguished and (other than any Cancelled Shares, any
Dissenting Shares and unvested Company Options) will be converted
automatically into the right to receive the applicable portion of the Merger
consideration payable in respect of such Company Preferred Share, Company
Common Share and Company Option, as applicable, as set forth in the Merger
Agreement, payable in each case without interest to the Sellers.

  


 

  

To the extent the undersigned holds Company Preferred Shares, the undersigned
hereby acknowledges that, in order to receive the consideration payable in
respect of the undersigned's Company Preferred Shares pursuant to the Merger
Agreement, the undersigned must execute and deliver to the Representative a
separate Letter of Transmittal with respect to such Company Preferred Shares
in accordance with the provisions of such other Letter of Transmittal.

  


 

  

Upon fully completing, signing and returning this Letter of Transmittal, you
will be surrendering your Company Common Shares and any certificates
evidencing your Company Common Shares, in exchange for the right to receive in
cash:

  


 

  

   (a) | in respect of each Company Common Share so surrendered (if any),
the Per Share Common Payment; _plus_   
---|--- 
  

  

   (b) | a portion of the funds remaining in the Escrow Account (if any,
after giving effect to the payment of any Actual Adjustment calculated
pursuant to Section 2.9(b) of the Merger Agreement in favor of Parent); _plus_
  
---|--- 
  

  

   (c) | a portion of any Actual Adjustment calculated pursuant to Section
2.9(b) of the Merger Agreement in favor of the Sellers (if any); _plus_   
---|--- 
  

     

  

   (d) | a portion of amounts (if any) distributed to the Sellers from the
balance of the Representative Expense Amount in accordance with Section
8.1(a)(iii) of the Merger Agreement.  
---|--- 
  

  

You hereby acknowledge and agree that you have (i) to the extent you and your
advisors deemed appropriate, reviewed the Merger Agreement and the terms of
the Merger described therein and approve the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger; and, the Escrow
Agreement and the terms of the Escrow Account described therein, (ii) reviewed
the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (stating that appraisal rights may
be available subject to the waiver below), a copy of which is enclosed
herewith as _Exhibit 1_ and (iii) had an opportunity to consult with and have
relied solely upon the advice, if any, of your legal, financial, accounting
and/or tax advisors with respect to the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions described therein and the Escrow Agreement, in each case to
the extent you have deemed necessary. You hereby acknowledge and agree that
you have not been advised or directed by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation, any Seller, the Representative, any of their
Affiliates, or their or their Affiliates' respective legal counsel or other
advisors or representatives in respect of any such matters and that you have
not relied on any such parties in connection with this Letter of Transmittal,
the Merger Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby.

  


 

  

You hereby acknowledge that the Avista Entities (as defined in the
Stockholders Agreement) have duly exercised their rights under Section 5.02 of
the Stockholders Agreement in connection with the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, you hereby waive, and
agree not to assert or perfect, any appraisal or dissenters' rights with
respect to all of the Company Common Shares owned by you under Section 262 of
the DGCL or any other Applicable Law, whether or not you have previously made
a written demand upon the Company and otherwise complied with the appraisal
rights provisions of the DGCL or other such Applicable Law. You hereby agree
that the Stockholders Agreement shall be terminated effective as of the
Effective Time and shall thereafter be of no further force or effect;
_provided_ , that your obligations pursuant to Sections 5.02 and 5.03 of the
Stockholders Agreement shall survive such termination.

  


 

  

By signing and returning this Letter of Transmittal, you acknowledge and agree
(i) $3,000,000 in the aggregate will be held by the Escrow Agent on behalf of
you and the other equityholders of the Company to be used as the sole source
for payment of certain purchase price adjustments in favor of Parent pursuant
to Section 2.9(c)(ii) of the Merger Agreement, and (ii) that pursuant to
Article 8 of the Merger Agreement, you have appointed (and you hereby agree
and consent to such appointment of) the Representative as your attorney-in-
fact and agent for and on your behalf, and consent to the taking by the
Representative of any and all actions and the making of any decisions required
or permitted to be taken by the Representative under or contemplated by the
Merger Agreement and the other documents contemplated thereby, including with
respect to the Representative Expense Amount established under Section
2.9(a)(iv) of the Merger Agreement, and acknowledge and agree that you may be
required to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Representative upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in Section 8.1 of the Merger
Agreement.

  


 

  

By signing and returning this Letter of Transmittal, you represent and warrant
to Parent and Merger Sub that (a) you have good and valid title to the Company
Common Shares

  

  

  

    

that you are surrendering for payment hereunder and are the record and
beneficial owner of such Company Common Shares, (b) such Company Common Shares
are free and clear of all Liens (except, if applicable, pursuant to the
Stockholders Agreement or as may be imposed by Applicable Law), (c) there are
no options, warrants, convertible securities or other rights, agreements,
arrangements or commitments relating to such Company Common Shares, (d) you
are not party to any voting or similar agreements (except, if applicable, the
Option Plan and, prior to the Effective Time, the Stockholders Agreement) with
respect to such Company Common Shares and you have full and exclusive
authority to surrender without restriction such Company Common Shares.

  


 

  

You hereby accept the amount of the Per Share Common Payment in respect of
your Company Common Shares being surrendered by you hereunder (as applicable),
and the rights to potentially receive certain payments, if any, under Sections
2.9(c) and 8.1(a)(iii) of the Merger Agreement, and you acknowledge and agree
that (i) such amount satisfies all obligations to you under Applicable Law,
the Certificate of Incorporation, the other organizational documents of the
Company, any agreement, arrangement or understanding between you and the
Company and/or any representative of the Company, and any other agreement
pertaining to such Company Common Shares, (ii) such amount accurately reflects
the portion of the aggregate merger consideration which you are entitled to
receive pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement,
Applicable Law, the Certificate of Incorporation, the other organizational
documents of the Company, any agreement, arrangement or understanding between
you and the Company and/or any representative of the Company, and any other
agreement pertaining to such Company Common Shares, and (iii) in accepting
such amount the Surviving Corporation, the Company, Parent, any Seller and
Merger Sub and their respective representatives shall be deemed to have
satisfied all obligations to make any and all payments with respect to the
Merger for such Company Common Shares and shall have no further obligations to
you with respect to payment of any portion of the aggregate merger
consideration, except as expressly set forth in the Merger Agreement (and the
undersigned expressly waives any and all claims to the contrary). However,
such acknowledgement shall not be deemed to waive or release (i) Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries from any
obligations to you as an employee, officer or director of the Company or such
Subsidiary for accrued and unpaid salary, accrued bonus, expense
reimbursements and employee benefits in the ordinary course of business or
(ii) your right to receive the consideration contemplated by the Merger
Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof, or any other of your rights
expressly set forth in the Merger Agreement or in any other written agreement
between you and the Company relating to your employment with or provision of
services to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. By accepting the Per Share
Common Payment, you hereby waive any and all rights related to your ownership
of any Company Common Shares being surrendered hereunder, at any time prior to
the Effective Time, including, without limitation, any voting rights,
liquidation rights, rollover, purchase or redemption rights or payment rights
in respect of any rollover, purchase or redemption, registration rights,
dissenters' rights, preemptive rights, option or put rights, rights of first
refusal, consent rights regarding a change of control of the Company or
similar preferences, whether arising pursuant to any organizational documents
of the Company, by agreement or by operation of law. You further waive any and
all rights that you may have to acquire additional Company Common Shares,
pursuant to any stock option agreement, warrant or otherwise.

  


 

  

  

    

Effective as of the Effective Time, you hereby unconditionally and irrevocably
and forever release and discharge Parent and its Affiliates (which include the
Surviving Corporation and the Group Companies), each other Seller and its
Affiliates and the Representative, and their respective successors and
assigns, and any present or former directors, managers, officers, employees,
agents, lenders, investors, partners, principals, members, managers,
shareholders or equityholders of any of the foregoing Persons (each, a
"Releasee"), of and from, and hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waive,
any and all claims, debts, losses, expenses, proceedings, covenants,
liabilities, suits, judgments, damages, actions and causes of action,
obligations, accounts, and liabilities of any kind or character whatsoever,
known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, in contract, direct or indirect,
at Law or in equity (collectively the respective "Released Claims") that you
ever had, now have or ever may have or claim to have against any Releasee, for
or by reason of any matter, circumstance, event, action, inaction, omission,
cause or thing whatsoever arising prior to the Effective Time, in each case,
to the extent arising out of, resulting from, or related to, your ownership of
Company Common Shares (or any instrument convertible into, or exercisable or
exchangeable for, Company Common Shares); _provided_ , that the foregoing
shall not apply to Released Claims (a) pursuant to the terms of the Merger
Agreement (including Section 5.5), the Escrow Agreement, this Letter of
Transmittal or any other Ancillary Documents or (b) that cannot be waived by
Applicable Law. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall also not
apply: (a) if you are an employee, officer or director of a Group Company, (i)
in respect of base salary or benefits that remain unpaid or in respect of
reimbursement of out‑of‑pocket expenses in compliance with the Group
Companies' employee expense reimbursement policy, or pursuant to any
employment, severance or similar agreement between you and any of the Group
Companies, or (ii) that are rights under any written employment, severance or
similar agreement or (b) in respect of any obligation of any Group Company
under its bylaws, charter, or similar organizational documents to indemnify
you in accordance with the terms thereof or any insurance policy of the Group
Companies providing for coverage with respect thereto. The undersigned, on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates, expressly waives all rights afforded by
any statute which limits the effect of a release with respect to unknown
claims. The undersigned, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, understands
the significance of this release of unknown claims and waiver of statutory
protection against a release, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, of
unknown claims, and acknowledges and agrees that this waiver is an essential
and material term of this letter of transmittal and the Merger Agreement and
that this paragraph is intended for the benefit of, and to grant third party
beneficiary rights to each Releasee to enforce this paragraph.

  


 

  

Effective as of the Effective Time, Parent, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates (which includes the Surviving Corporation and the Group Companies),
hereby unconditionally and irrevocably and forever releases and discharges you
and each of your Affiliates, successors and assigns, and any present or former
directors, managers, officers, employees, agents, lenders, investors,
partners, principals, members, managers, shareholders or equityholders of any
of the foregoing Persons (each, a "Seller Releasee"), of and from, and hereby
unconditionally and irrevocably waives, any and all Released Claims that such
party ever had, now has or ever may have or claim to have against any Seller
Releasee, for or by reason of any matter, circumstance, event, action,
inaction, omission, cause or thing whatsoever arising prior to the Effective
Time, in each case, to the extent arising out of, resulting from, or related
to, your ownership of

  

  

  

    

Company Common Shares (or any instrument convertible into, or exercisable or
exchangeable for, Company Common Shares); _provided_ , that the foregoing
shall not apply to Released Claims (a) pursuant to the terms of the Merger
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the other Ancillary Documents or (b) that
cannot be waived by Applicable Law. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing
shall also not apply to any defenses available to any Group Company in respect
of any obligation of any Group Company under its bylaws, charter or similar
organizational documents to indemnify the undersigned in accordance with the
terms thereof or any insurance policy of the Group Companies providing for
coverage with respect thereto. Parent, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates
(which includes the Surviving Corporation and Group Companies), expressly
waive all rights afforded by any statute which limits the effect of a release
with respect to unknown claims. Parent, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates
(which includes the Surviving Corporation and Group Companies), understand the
significance of this release of unknown claims and waiver of statutory
protection against a release, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, of
unknown claims, and acknowledge and agree that this waiver is an essential and
material term of this letter of transmittal and the Merger Agreement and that
this paragraph is intended for the benefit of, and to grant third party
beneficiary rights to each Seller Releasee to enforce this paragraph.

  


 

  

You hereby agree to, upon request, execute any additional documents necessary
or desirable to complete the sale, transfer and cancellation of the Company
Common Shares hereby delivered, provided that such documents do not result in
your receiving less value than provided by the terms of the Merger Agreement
or impose any additional potential liabilities on you.

  


 

  

All issues and questions concerning the construction, validity, interpretation
and enforceability of this Letter of Transmittal hereto shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without
giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law rules or provisions
(whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
Delaware.

  


 

  

You hereby (i) submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chancery Court of
the State of Delaware (or, if the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware
declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal
court sitting in Delaware) in any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Letter of Transmittal, (ii) agree that all claims in respect
of such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in any such court and
(iii) agree not to bring any action or proceeding arising out of or relating
to this Letter of Transmittal in any other court. You hereby waive any defense
of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding so
brought and waive any bond, surety or other security that might be required of
any other party with respect thereto. You agree that service of summons and
complaint or any other process that might be served in any action or
proceeding may be made on such party by sending or delivering a copy of the
process to the party to be served at the address of the party. Nothing in this
paragraph, however, shall affect the right of any party to serve legal process
in any other manner permitted by Applicable Law. You agree that a final, non-
appealable judgment in any action or proceeding so brought shall be conclusive
and may be enforced by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
Applicable Law.

  


 

  

  

    

From and after the Closing Date you shall not, and shall use your commercially
reasonable efforts to cause your Affiliates (together with you, each a "
_Restricted Person_ ") not to, disclose any Confidential Information in
respect of the Company to anyone other than to representatives of Parent and
the Surviving Corporation (except for (a) any such Confidential Information
which is requested or required by Applicable Law or legal process to be
disclosed by such Restricted Person, and then only after you have given notice
(except to the extent such notice is prohibited by Applicable Law or if such
disclosure is required pursuant to the request of any regulatory authority
having jurisdiction over a Restricted Person in the ordinary course of
examination of such Restricted Person's books and records by such regulatory
authority or in response to any request by such regulatory authority) to
Parent of its obligation to disclose such Confidential Information so that
Parent may waive compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, or be given
a reasonable opportunity to obtain, at Parent's expense, an appropriate
protective order with respect to such disclosure, and you shall reasonably
cooperate with Parent (to the extent not prohibited by Applicable Law), at
Parent's expense, in connection with obtaining such protective order;
_provided_ , that if in the absence of a protective order or the receipt of a
waiver by Parent, you are nonetheless, upon the advice of counsel, required or
requested to disclose Confidential Information, you may disclose such
Confidential Information but only to the extent so required to be disclosed
upon the advice of counsel, (b) Confidential Information that is or becomes
generally available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by a
Restricted Person in violation of this paragraph or that is or becomes
available to a Restricted Person on a non-confidential basis from a source
that is not known by such Restricted Person to be bound by a confidentiality
obligation to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, (c) with the prior written
consent of Parent, or (d) in connection with any required Tax disclosures or
to enforce your rights under the Merger Agreement or this Letter of
Transmittal). For purposes hereof "Confidential Information" shall mean any
information concerning (a) the businesses or affairs of the Group Companies
and/or (b) the negotiation, terms and conditions of the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the
extent applicable, if you are an investment fund or other similar vehicle, you
and your Affiliates may provide general information about the subject matter
of the Merger Agreement in connection with your fund raising, marketing,
informational or reporting activities of the kind customarily provided with
respect to investments of this nature.

  


 

  

You hereby agree that the Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and,
with respect to the release granted in respect of the Released Claims, the
Releasees, shall be third party beneficiaries of your representations,
warranties, undertakings and agreements, with full rights as such.

 _IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION_

  

Under United States federal income tax laws, a holder that receives payments
may be subject to backup withholding on such payments. To prevent backup
withholding, a holder that is a U.S. Person who receives payments is required
to provide the Surviving Corporation and Parent (as payer) with such holder's
correct taxpayer identification number ("TIN") on the enclosed Form W-9 (or
otherwise establish a basis for exemption from backup withholding) and certify
under penalty of perjury that such TIN is correct and that such holder is not
subject to backup withholding. If such holder is an individual, the TIN is his
or her social security number. If the Surviving Corporation or Parent is not
provided with the correct TIN, a penalty may be imposed by the IRS, and any
payment may be subject to backup withholding.

  

Certain holders (including, among others, all corporations and foreign
individuals and entities) are not subject to these backup withholding and
reporting requirements. Exempt holders should indicate their exempt status on
Form W-9 or applicable Form W-8. In order for a foreign individual or entity
to qualify as an exempt recipient, such individual or entity should submit a
Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable, signed under penalties of perjury,
attesting to such individual's or entity's exempt status. The applicable Form
W-8 can be obtained from the Exchange Agent or at the link below. Please note
that there are additional Form W-8s if the W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E does not apply
to your particular situation. The W-8 forms can be accessed at the IRS
website: http://www.irs.gov.

  


 

  

If backup withholding applies, the Surviving Corporation or Parent is required
to backup withhold, currently at a rate of 28%, on any payments made to the
holder or other payee. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Rather,
the United States federal income tax liability of persons subject to backup
withholding will be reduced by the amount of tax withheld provided that the
required information is timely given to the IRS. If withholding results in an
overpayment of taxes, a refund may be obtained from the IRS.

  

Purpose of Form W-9

  

Form W-9 and instructions to the form are enclosed with this Letter of
Transmittal. Please also read through the instructions to Form W-9.

EXHIBIT 1

  


 

  

Appraisal Rights

  


 

  

(See attached)

  

  

  

  

  

  


 

     

 

 

§ 262 Appraisal rights

  

(a) Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock
on the date of the making of a demand pursuant to subsection (d) of this
section with respect to such shares, who continuously holds such shares
through the effective date of the merger or consolidation, who has otherwise
complied with subsection (d) of this section and who has neither voted in
favor of the merger or consolidation nor consented thereto in writing pursuant
to § 228 of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of
Chancery of the fair value of the stockholder's shares of stock under the
circumstances described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As used in
this section, the word "stockholder" means a holder of record of stock in a
corporation; the words "stock" and "share" mean and include what is ordinarily
meant by those words; and the words "depository receipt" mean a receipt or
other instrument issued by a depository representing an interest in 1 or more
shares, or fractions thereof, solely of stock of a corporation, which stock is
deposited with the depository.

  

(b) Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series
of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger or consolidation to be
effected pursuant to § 251 (other than a merger effected pursuant to § 251(g)
of this title and, subject to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, § 251(h) of
this title), § 252, § 254, § 255, § 256, § 257, § 258, § 263 or § 264 of this
title:

  

(1) Provided, however, that, except as expressly provided in § 363(b) of this
title, no appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the
shares of any class or series of stock, which stock, or depository receipts in
respect thereof, at the record date fixed to determine the stockholders
entitled to receive notice of the meeting of stockholders to act upon the
agreement of merger or consolidation, were either: (i) listed on a national
securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more than 2,000 holders; and
further provided that no appraisal rights shall be available for any shares of
stock of the constituent corporation surviving a merger if the merger did not
require for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the surviving
corporation as provided in § 251(f) of this title.

  

(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(l) of this section, appraisal rights under
this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock
of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof are required by the terms
of an agreement of merger or consolidation pursuant to §§ 251, 252, 254, 255,
256, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for such stock anything
except:

  

a. Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger
or consolidation, or depository receipts in respect thereof;

  

b. Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect
thereof, which shares of stock (or depository receipts in respect thereof) or
depository receipts at the effective date of the merger or consolidation will
be either listed on a national securities exchange or held of record by more
than 2,000 holders;

  

c. Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts
described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a. and b. of this section; or

  

d. Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and cash in
lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the
foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a., b. and c. of this section.

     

(3) In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation party
to a merger effected under § 251(h), § 253 or § 267 of this title is not owned
by the parent immediately prior to the merger, appraisal rights shall be
available for the shares of the subsidiary Delaware corporation.

  

(4) In the event of an amendment to a corporation's certificate of
incorporation contemplated by § 363(a) of this title, appraisal rights shall
be available as contemplated by § 363(b) of this title, and the procedures of
this section, including those set forth in subsections (d) and (e) of this
section, shall apply as nearly as practicable, with the word "amendment"
substituted for the words "merger or consolidation," and the word
"corporation" substituted for the words "constituent corporation" and/or
"surviving or resulting corporation."

  

(c) Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that
appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any
class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate of
incorporation, any merger or consolidation in which the corporation is a
constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets
of the corporation. If the certificate of incorporation contains such a
provision, the procedures of this section, including those set forth in
subsections (d) and (e) of this section, shall apply as nearly as is
practicable.

  

(d) Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:

  

(1) If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are
provided under this section is to be submitted for approval at a meeting of
stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting,
shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the record date for
notice of such meeting (or such members who received notice in accordance with
§ 255(c) of this title) with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are
available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section that appraisal
rights are available for any or all of the shares of the constituent
corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if
1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114
of this title. Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such
stockholder's shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking of
the vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of
such stockholder's shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably
informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the
stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholder's
shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not
constitute such a demand. A stockholder electing to take such action must do
so by a separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the
effective date of such merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting
corporation shall notify each stockholder of each constituent corporation who
has complied with this subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented
to the merger or consolidation of the date that the merger or consolidation
has become effective; or

  

(2) If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to§ 228, § 251(h), §
253, or § 267 of this title, then either a constituent corporation before the
effective date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or resulting
corporation within 10 days thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any
class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to
appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or consolidation and that
appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such class or series
of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a
copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock
corporation, a copy of§ 114 of this title. Such notice may, and, if given on
or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify
such stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation. Any
stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20

     

days after the date of mailing of such notice or, in the case of a merger
agreement approved pursuant to § 25l(h) of this title, within the later of the
consummation of the tender or exchange offer contemplated by § 25l(h) of this
title and 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice, demand in writing
from the surviving or resulting corporation the appraisal of such holder's
shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the
corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder
intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such holder's shares. If such
notice did not notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, either (i) each such constituent corporation shall send a
second notice before the effective date of the merger or consolidation
notifying each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such
constituent corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights of the effective
date of the merger or consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting
corporation shall send such a second notice to all such holders on or within
10 days after such effective date; provided, however, that if such second
notice is sent more than 20 days following the sending of the first notice or,
in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 25l(h) of this title, later
than the later of the consummation of the tender or exchange offer
contemplated by § 25l(h) of this title and 20 days following the sending of
the first notice, such second notice need only be sent to each stockholder who
is entitled to appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such
holder's shares in accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the
secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation
that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall,
in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.
For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive either
notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that
shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given,
provided, that if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the
merger or consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If no
record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective date, the
record date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day
on which the notice is given.

  

(e) Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation,
the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder who has complied
with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise
entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a
petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of
the stock of all such stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time
within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any
stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that
proceeding as a named party shall have the right to withdraw such
stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the
merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of the
merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the
requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof, upon written
request, shall be entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the
merger or resulting from the consolidation a statement setting forth the
aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation
and with respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the
aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such written statement shall be
mailed to the stockholder within 10 days after such stockholder's written
request for such a statement is received by the surviving or resulting
corporation or within l0 days after expiration of the period for delivery of
demands for appraisal under subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever
is later. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the
beneficial owner of shares of such stock held either in a voting trust or by a
nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person's own name, file a
petition or request from the corporation the statement described in this
subsection.

  

(f) Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy
thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting corporation, which shall
within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register in
Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the
names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their
shares and with whom agreements as

     

to the value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving or
resulting corporation. If the petition shall be filed by the surviving or
resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by such a duly
verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall
give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by
registered or certified mail to the surviving or resulting corporation and to
the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein stated. Such
notice shall also be given by 1 or more publications at least 1 week before
the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in the
City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the Court deems advisable.
The forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the
Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting
corporation.

  

(g) At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the
stockholders who have complied with this section and who have become entitled
to appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded
an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates
to submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation
thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder
fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the proceedings as
to such stockholder.

  

(h) After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the
appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the
Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal
proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall determine the fair value
of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the merger or consolidation, together with
interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value.
In determining such fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant
factors. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good
cause shown, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date
of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at
5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as
established from time to time during the period between the effective date of
the merger and the date of payment of the judgment. Upon application by the
surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to
participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion,
proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the
stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on
the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to
subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted such stockholder's
certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may
participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such
stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this section.

  

(i) The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares,
together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting corporation to
the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such
stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the
case of holders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to
the corporation of the certificates representing such stock. The Court's
decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be
enforced, whether such surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of
this State or of any state.

  

(j) The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon
the parties as the Court deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon
application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the
expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal
proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and the
fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all
the shares entitled to an appraisal.

  

(k) From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no
stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided in subsection (d) of
this section shall be entitled to vote such stock

     

for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on
the stock (except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of
record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger or
consolidation); provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall
be filed within the time provided in subsection (e) of this section, or if
such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a
written withdrawal of such stockholder's demand for an appraisal and an
acceptance of the merger or consolidation, either within 60 days after the
effective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of
this section or thereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then
the right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed
as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such approval may
be conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just; provided, however that
this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not
commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party
to withdraw such stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms
offered upon the merger or consolidation within 60 days after the effective
date of the merger or consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of this
section.

  

(l) The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares
of such objecting stockholders would have been converted had they assented to
the merger or consolidation shall have the status of authorized and unissued
shares of the surviving or resulting corporation.

With respect to the Preferred Stock of

  

ARMORED AUTOGROUP PARENT INC.

  


 

  

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  


 

  

You are receiving this Letter of Transmittal in connection with the merger
(the "Merger") of Ignite Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Merger
Sub"), with and into Armored AutoGroup Parent Inc., a Delaware corporation
(the "Company"), pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger (the
"Merger Agreement"), dated as of April 28, 2015, by and among Spectrum Brands
Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), Merger Sub, the Company and
Avista Capital Partners II GP, LLC, as Representative (the "Representative").
Capitalized terms used in this Letter of Transmittal and not defined herein
shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Merger Agreement.

  


 

  

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, each issued and
outstanding Company Preferred Share, Company Common Share and Company Option
will be cancelled and extinguished and (other than any Cancelled Shares, any
Dissenting Shares and unvested Company Options) will be converted
automatically into the right to receive the applicable portion of the Merger
consideration payable in respect of such Company Preferred Share, Company
Common Share and Company Option, as applicable, as set forth in the Merger
Agreement, payable in each case without interest to the Sellers.

  


 

  

To the extent the undersigned holds Company Common Shares, the undersigned
hereby acknowledges that, in order to receive the consideration payable in
respect of the undersigned's Company Common Shares pursuant to the Merger
Agreement, the undersigned must execute and deliver to the Representative a
separate Letter of Transmittal with respect to such Company Common Shares in
accordance with the provisions of such other Letter of Transmittal.

  


 

  

Upon fully completing, signing and returning this Letter of Transmittal, you
will be surrendering Company Preferred Shares and any certificates evidencing
your Company Preferred Shares, in exchange for the right to receive, in
respect of each Company Preferred Share so surrendered (if any), an amount in
cash equal to the sum of (i) the Liquidation Value (as defined in the Company
Certificate of Incorporation) _plus_ (ii) all accumulated, accrued and unpaid
dividends thereon with respect to such Company Preferred Share as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time as provided in Section 2.9(a)(v) of
the Merger Agreement (the "Preferred Stock Consideration").

  


 

  

You hereby acknowledge and agree that you have (i) to the extent you and your
advisors deemed appropriate, reviewed the Merger Agreement and the terms of
the Merger described therein and approve the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger and (ii) had an
opportunity to consult with and have relied solely upon the advice, if any, of
your legal, financial, accounting and/or tax advisors with respect to the
Merger

  

  

     

Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions described therein, in each
case to the extent you have deemed necessary. You hereby acknowledge and agree
that you have not been advised or directed by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company,
the Surviving Corporation, any Seller, the Representative, any of their
respective Affiliates or any of their or their Affiliates' respective legal
counsel or other advisors or representatives in respect of any such matters
and that you have not relied on any such parties in connection with this
Letter of Transmittal, the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby.

  


 

  

You hereby acknowledge that the Avista Entities (as defined in the
Stockholders Agreement) have duly exercised their rights under Section 5.02 of
the Stockholders Agreement in connection with the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, you hereby waive, and
agree not to assert or perfect, any appraisal or dissenters' rights with
respect to all of the Company Preferred Shares owned by you under Section 262
of the DGCL (a copy of which is enclosed herewith as _Exhibit 1_ ) or any
other Applicable Law, whether or not you have previously made a written demand
upon the Company and otherwise complied with the appraisal rights provisions
of the DGCL or other such Applicable Law. You hereby agree that the
Stockholders Agreement shall be terminated effective as of the Effective Time
and shall thereafter be of no further force or effect; _provided_ , that your
obligations pursuant to Sections 5.02 and 5.03 of the Stockholders Agreement
shall survive such termination.

  


 

  

By signing and returning this Letter of Transmittal, you acknowledge and agree
that pursuant to Article 8 of the Merger Agreement, you have appointed (and
you hereby agree and consent to such appointment of) the Representative as
your attorney-in-fact and agent for and on your behalf, and consent to the
taking by the Representative of any and all actions and the making of any
decisions required or permitted to be taken by the Representative under or
contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the other documents contemplated
thereby, including with respect to the Representative Expense Amount
established under Section 2.9(a)(iv) of the Merger Agreement, and acknowledge
and agree that you may be required to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Representative upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
Section 8.1 of the Merger Agreement. You acknowledge and agree that Parent,
Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation shall have the rights set forth in
Section 8.1(d) and 2.9 of the Merger Agreement, including without limitation
the right to rely conclusively upon all actions taken or omitted to be taken
by the Representative and to deal exclusively with the Representative.

  


 

  

By signing and returning this Letter of Transmittal, you represent and warrant
to Parent and Merger Sub that (a) you have good and valid title to the Company
Preferred Shares that you are surrendering for payment hereunder and are the
record and beneficial owner of such Company Preferred Shares, (b) such Company
Preferred Shares are free and clear of all Liens (except, if applicable,
pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement or as may be imposed by Applicable
Law), (c) there are no options, warrants, convertible securities or other
rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments relating to such Company
Preferred Shares, (d) you are not party to any voting or similar agreements
(except, if applicable, the Option Plan and, prior to the Effective Time, the
Stockholders Agreement) with respect to such Company Preferred Shares and you
have full and exclusive authority to surrender without restriction such
Company Preferred Shares.

  

  

    

You hereby accept the amount of the Preferred Stock Consideration in respect
of your Company Preferred Shares being surrendered by you hereunder (as
applicable), and you acknowledge and agree that (i) such amount satisfies all
obligations to you under Applicable Law, the Certificate of Incorporation, the
other organizational documents of the Company, any agreement, arrangement or
understanding between you and the Company and/or any representative of the
Company, and any other agreement pertaining to such Company Preferred Shares,
(ii) such amount accurately reflects the portion of the aggregate merger
consideration which you are entitled to receive pursuant to and in accordance
with the terms of the Merger Agreement, Applicable Law, the Certificate of
Incorporation, the other organizational documents of the Company, any
agreement, arrangement or understanding between you and the Company and/or any
representative of the Company, and any other agreement pertaining to such
Company Preferred Shares, and (iii) in accepting such amount the Surviving
Corporation, the Company, Parent, any Seller and Merger Sub and their
respective representatives shall be deemed to have satisfied all obligations
to make any and all payments with respect to the Merger for such Company
Preferred Shares and shall have no further obligations to you with respect to
payment of any portion of the aggregate merger consideration, except as
expressly set forth in the Merger Agreement (and the undersigned expressly
waives any and all claims to the contrary). However, such acknowledgement
shall not be deemed to waive or release (i) Parent, the Surviving Corporation,
the Company or any of their Subsidiaries from any obligations to you as an
employee, officer or director of the Company or such Subsidiary for accrued
and unpaid salary, accrued bonus, expense reimbursements and employee benefits
in the ordinary course of business or (ii) your right to receive the
consideration contemplated by the Merger Agreement in accordance with the
terms thereof, or any other of your rights expressly set forth in the Merger
Agreement or in any other written agreement between you and the Company
relating to your employment with or provision of services to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries. By accepting the Preferred Stock Consideration (as
applicable), you hereby waive any and all rights related to your ownership of
any Company Preferred Shares being surrendered hereunder, at any time prior to
the Effective Time, including, without limitation, any voting rights,
liquidation rights, rollover, purchase or redemption rights or payment rights
in respect of any rollover, purchase or redemption, registration rights,
dissenters' rights, preemptive rights, option or put rights, rights of first
refusal, consent rights regarding a change of control of the Company or
similar preferences, whether arising pursuant to any organizational documents
of the Company, by agreement or by operation of law. You further waive any and
all rights that you may have to acquire additional Company Common Shares
and/or Company Preferred Shares, pursuant to any stock option agreement,
warrant or otherwise.

  


 

  

Effective as of the Effective Time, you hereby unconditionally and irrevocably
and forever release and discharge Parent and its Affiliates (which include the
Surviving Corporation and the Group Companies), each other Seller and its
Affiliates and the Representative, and their respective successors and
assigns, and any present or former directors, managers, officers, employees,
agents, lenders, investors, partners, principals, members, managers,
shareholders or equityholders of any of the foregoing Persons (each, a
"Releasee"), of and from, and hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waive,
any and all claims, debts, losses, expenses, proceedings, covenants,
liabilities, suits, judgments, damages, actions and causes of action,
obligations, accounts, and liabilities of any kind or character whatsoever,
known or

  

  

    

  

unknown, suspected or unsuspected, in contract, direct or indirect, at Law or
in equity (collectively, the respective "Released Claims") that you ever had,
now have or ever may have or claim to have against any Releasee, for or by
reason of any matter, circumstance, event, action, inaction, omission, cause
or thing whatsoever arising prior to the Effective Time, in each case, to the
extent arising out of, resulting from, or related to, your ownership of
Company Preferred Shares (or any instrument convertible into, or exercisable
or exchangeable for, Company Preferred Shares); _provided_ , that the
foregoing shall not apply to Released Claims (a) pursuant to the terms of the
Merger Agreement (including Section 5.5), the Escrow Agreement, this Letter of
Transmittal or any other Ancillary Documents or (b) that cannot be waived by
Applicable Law. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall also not
apply: (a) if you are an employee, officer or director of a Group Company, (i)
in respect of base salary or benefits that remain unpaid or in respect of
reimbursement of out‑of‑pocket expenses in compliance with the Group
Companies' employee expense reimbursement policy, or pursuant to any
employment, severance or similar agreement between you and any of the Group
Companies, or (ii) that are rights under any written employment, severance or
similar agreement or (b) in respect of any obligation of any Group Company
under its bylaws, charter, or similar organizational documents to indemnify
you in accordance with the terms thereof or any insurance policy of the Group
Companies providing for coverage with respect thereto. The undersigned, on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates, expressly waives all rights afforded by
any statute which limits the effect of a release with respect to unknown
claims. The undersigned, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, understands
the significance of this release of unknown claims and waiver of statutory
protection against a release, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, of
unknown claims, and acknowledges and agrees that this waiver is an essential
and material term of this letter of transmittal and the Merger Agreement and
that this paragraph is intended for the benefit of, and to grant third party
beneficiary rights to each Releasee to enforce this paragraph.

  


 

  

Effective as of the Effective Time, Parent, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates (which includes the Surviving Corporation and the Group Companies),
hereby unconditionally and irrevocably and forever releases and discharges you
and each of your Affiliates, successors and assigns, and any present or former
directors, managers, officers, employees, agents, lenders, investors,
partners, principals, members, managers, shareholders or equityholders of any
of the foregoing Persons (each, a "Seller Releasee"), of and from, and hereby
unconditionally and irrevocably waives, any and all Released Claims that such
party ever had, now has or ever may have or claim to have against any Seller
Releasee, for or by reason of any matter, circumstance, event, action,
inaction, omission, cause or thing whatsoever arising prior to the Effective
Time, in each case, to the extent arising out of, resulting from, or related
to, your ownership of Company Preferred Shares; _provided_ , that the
foregoing shall not apply to Released Claims (a) pursuant to the terms of the
Merger Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the other Ancillary Documents or (b)
that cannot be waived by Applicable Law. For the avoidance of doubt, the
foregoing shall also not apply to any defenses available to any Group Company
in respect of any obligation of any Group Company under its bylaws, charter or
similar organizational documents to indemnify the undersigned in accordance
with the terms thereof or any insurance policy of the Group Companies
providing for coverage with respect thereto. Parent, on behalf of itself and
its Affiliates (which includes the Surviving Corporation and Group Companies),
expressly waive all rights afforded by any statute which limits the effect of
a release with respect to unknown claims. Parent, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates (which includes the Surviving Corporation and Group

  

  

    

  

Companies), understand the significance of this release of unknown claims and
waiver of statutory protection against a release, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates, of unknown claims, and acknowledge and agree that this waiver is
an essential and material term of this letter of transmittal and the Merger
Agreement and that this paragraph is intended for the benefit of, and to grant
third party beneficiary rights to each Seller Releasee to enforce this
paragraph.

  


 

  

You hereby agree to, upon request, execute any additional documents necessary
or desirable to complete the sale, transfer and cancellation of the Company
Preferred Shares hereby delivered, provided that such documents do not result
in your receiving less value than provided by the terms of the Merger
Agreement or impose any additional potential liabilities on you.

  


 

  

All issues and questions concerning the construction, validity, interpretation
and enforceability of this Letter of Transmittal hereto shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without
giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law rules or provisions
(whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
Delaware.

  


 

  

You hereby (i) submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chancery Court of
the State of Delaware (or, if the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware
declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal
court sitting in Delaware) in any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Letter of Transmittal, (ii) agree that all claims in respect
of such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in any such court and
(iii) agree not to bring any action or proceeding arising out of or relating
to this Letter of Transmittal in any other court. You hereby waive any defense
of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding so
brought and waive any bond, surety or other security that might be required of
any other party with respect thereto. You agree that service of summons and
complaint or any other process that might be served in any action or
proceeding may be made on such party by sending or delivering a copy of the
process to the party to be served at the address of the party. Nothing in this
paragraph, however, shall affect the right of any party to serve legal process
in any other manner permitted by Applicable Law. You agree that a final, non-
appealable judgment in any action or proceeding so brought shall be conclusive
and may be enforced by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
Applicable Law.

  


 

  

From and after the Closing Date you shall not, and shall use your commercially
reasonable efforts to cause your Affiliates (together with you, each a "
_Restricted Person_ ") not to, disclose any Confidential Information in
respect of the Company to anyone other than to representatives of Parent and
the Surviving Corporation (except for (a) any such Confidential Information
which is requested or required by Applicable Law or legal process to be
disclosed by such Restricted Person, and then only after you have given notice
(except to the extent such notice is prohibited by Applicable Law or if such
disclosure is required pursuant to the request of any regulatory authority
having jurisdiction over a Restricted Person in the ordinary course of
examination of such Restricted Person's books and records by such regulatory
authority or in response to any request by such regulatory authority) to
Parent of its obligation to disclose such Confidential Information so that
Parent may waive compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, or be given
a reasonable opportunity to obtain, at Parent's expense, an appropriate

  

  

    

  

protective order with respect to such disclosure, and you shall reasonably
cooperate with Parent (to the extent not prohibited by Applicable Law), at
Parent's expense, in connection with obtaining such protective order;
_provided_ , that if in the absence of a protective order or the receipt of a
waiver by Parent, you are nonetheless, upon the advice of counsel, required or
requested to disclose Confidential Information, you may disclose such
Confidential Information but only to the extent so required to be disclosed
upon the advice of counsel, (b) Confidential Information that is or becomes
generally available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by a
Restricted Person in violation of this paragraph or that is or becomes
available to a Restricted Person on a non-confidential basis from a source
that is not known by such Restricted Person to be bound by a confidentiality
obligation to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, (c) with the prior written
consent of Parent, or (d) in connection with any required Tax disclosures or
to enforce your rights under the Merger Agreement or this Letter of
Transmittal). For purposes hereof "Confidential Information" shall mean any
information concerning (a) the businesses or affairs of the Group Companies
and/or (b) the negotiation, terms and conditions of the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the
extent applicable, if you are an investment fund or other similar vehicle, you
and your Affiliates may provide general information about the subject matter
of the Merger Agreement in connection with your fund raising, marketing,
informational or reporting activities of the kind customarily provided with
respect to investments of this nature.

  


 

  

You hereby agree that the Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and,
with respect to the release granted in respect of the Released Claims, the
Releasees, shall be third party beneficiaries of your representations,
warranties, undertakings and agreements, with full rights as such.

 _IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION_

  

Under United States federal income tax laws, a holder that receives payments
may be subject to backup withholding on such payments. To prevent backup
withholding, a holder that is a U.S. Person who receives payments is required
to provide the Surviving Corporation and Parent (as payer) with such holder's
correct taxpayer identification number ("TIN") on the enclosed Form W-9 (or
otherwise establish a basis for exemption from backup withholding) and certify
under penalty of perjury that such TIN is correct and that such holder is not
subject to backup withholding. If such holder is an individual, the TIN is his
or her social security number. If the Surviving Corporation or Parent is not
provided with the correct TIN, a penalty may be imposed by the IRS, and any
payment may be subject to backup withholding.

  

Certain holders (including, among others, all corporations and foreign
individuals and entities) are not subject to these backup withholding and
reporting requirements. Exempt holders should indicate their exempt status on
Form W-9 or applicable Form W-8. In order for a foreign individual or entity
to qualify as an exempt recipient, such individual or entity should submit a
Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable, signed under penalties of perjury,
attesting to such individual's or entity's exempt status. The applicable Form
W-8 can be obtained from the Exchange Agent or at the link below. Please note
that there are additional Form W-8s if the W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E does not apply
to your particular situation. The W-8 forms can be accessed at the IRS
website: http://www.irs.gov.

  


 

  

If backup withholding applies, the Surviving Corporation or Parent is required
to backup withhold, currently at a rate of 28%, on any payments made to the
holder or other payee. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Rather,
the United States federal income tax liability of persons subject to backup
withholding will be reduced by the amount of tax withheld provided that the
required information is timely given to the IRS. If withholding results in an
overpayment of taxes, a refund may be obtained from the IRS.

  

Purpose of Form W-9

  

Form W-9 and instructions to the form are enclosed with this Letter of
Transmittal. Please also read through the instructions to Form W-9.

Appraisal Rights

  


 

  

(See attached)

  

  

  

  

  

  

  


    


    

§ 262 Appraisal rights

  

(a) Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock
on the date of the making of a demand pursuant to subsection (d) of this
section with respect to such shares, who continuously holds such shares
through the effective date of the merger or consolidation, who has otherwise
complied with subsection (d) of this section and who has neither voted in
favor of the merger or consolidation nor consented thereto in writing pursuant
to § 228 of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of
Chancery of the fair value of the stockholder's shares of stock under the
circumstances described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As used in
this section, the word "stockholder" means a holder of record of stock in a
corporation; the words "stock" and "share" mean and include what is ordinarily
meant by those words; and the words "depository receipt" mean a receipt or
other instrument issued by a depository representing an interest in 1 or more
shares, or fractions thereof, solely of stock of a corporation, which stock is
deposited with the depository.

  

(b) Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series
of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger or consolidation to be
effected pursuant to § 251 (other than a merger effected pursuant to § 251(g)
of this title and, subject to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, § 251(h) of
this title), § 252, § 254, § 255, § 256, § 257, § 258, § 263 or § 264 of this
title:

  

(1) Provided, however, that, except as expressly provided in § 363(b) of this
title, no appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the
shares of any class or series of stock, which stock, or depository receipts in
respect thereof, at the record date fixed to determine the stockholders
entitled to receive notice of the meeting of stockholders to act upon the
agreement of merger or consolidation, were either: (i) listed on a national
securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more than 2,000 holders; and
further provided that no appraisal rights shall be available for any shares of
stock of the constituent corporation surviving a merger if the merger did not
require for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the surviving
corporation as provided in § 251(f) of this title.

  

(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(l) of this section, appraisal rights under
this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock
of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof are required by the terms
of an agreement of merger or consolidation pursuant to §§ 251, 252, 254, 255,
256, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for such stock anything
except:

  

a. Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger
or consolidation, or depository receipts in respect thereof;

  

b. Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect
thereof, which shares of stock (or depository receipts in respect thereof) or
depository receipts at the effective date of the merger or consolidation will
be either listed on a national securities exchange or held of record by more
than 2,000 holders;

  

c. Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts
described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a. and b. of this section; or

  

d. Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and cash in
lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the
foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a., b. and c. of this section.

     

(3) In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation party
to a merger effected under § 251(h), § 253 or § 267 of this title is not owned
by the parent immediately prior to the merger, appraisal rights shall be
available for the shares of the subsidiary Delaware corporation.

  

(4) In the event of an amendment to a corporation's certificate of
incorporation contemplated by § 363(a) of this title, appraisal rights shall
be available as contemplated by § 363(b) of this title, and the procedures of
this section, including those set forth in subsections (d) and (e) of this
section, shall apply as nearly as practicable, with the word "amendment"
substituted for the words "merger or consolidation," and the word
"corporation" substituted for the words "constituent corporation" and/or
"surviving or resulting corporation."

  

(c) Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that
appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any
class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate of
incorporation, any merger or consolidation in which the corporation is a
constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets
of the corporation. If the certificate of incorporation contains such a
provision, the procedures of this section, including those set forth in
subsections (d) and (e) of this section, shall apply as nearly as is
practicable.

  

(d) Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:

  

(1) If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are
provided under this section is to be submitted for approval at a meeting of
stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting,
shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the record date for
notice of such meeting (or such members who received notice in accordance with
§ 255(c) of this title) with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are
available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section that appraisal
rights are available for any or all of the shares of the constituent
corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if
1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114
of this title. Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such
stockholder's shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking of
the vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of
such stockholder's shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably
informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the
stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholder's
shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not
constitute such a demand. A stockholder electing to take such action must do
so by a separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the
effective date of such merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting
corporation shall notify each stockholder of each constituent corporation who
has complied with this subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented
to the merger or consolidation of the date that the merger or consolidation
has become effective; or

  

(2) If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to§ 228, § 251(h), §
253, or § 267 of this title, then either a constituent corporation before the
effective date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or resulting
corporation within 10 days thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any
class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to
appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or consolidation and that
appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such class or series
of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a
copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock
corporation, a copy of§ 114 of this title. Such notice may, and, if given on
or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify
such stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation. Any
stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20

     

days after the date of mailing of such notice or, in the case of a merger
agreement approved pursuant to § 25l(h) of this title, within the later of the
consummation of the tender or exchange offer contemplated by § 25l(h) of this
title and 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice, demand in writing
from the surviving or resulting corporation the appraisal of such holder's
shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the
corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder
intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such holder's shares. If such
notice did not notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, either (i) each such constituent corporation shall send a
second notice before the effective date of the merger or consolidation
notifying each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such
constituent corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights of the effective
date of the merger or consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting
corporation shall send such a second notice to all such holders on or within
10 days after such effective date; provided, however, that if such second
notice is sent more than 20 days following the sending of the first notice or,
in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 25l(h) of this title, later
than the later of the consummation of the tender or exchange offer
contemplated by § 25l(h) of this title and 20 days following the sending of
the first notice, such second notice need only be sent to each stockholder who
is entitled to appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such
holder's shares in accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the
secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation
that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall,
in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.
For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive either
notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that
shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given,
provided, that if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the
merger or consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If no
record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective date, the
record date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day
on which the notice is given.

  

(e) Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation,
the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder who has complied
with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise
entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a
petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of
the stock of all such stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time
within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any
stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that
proceeding as a named party shall have the right to withdraw such
stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the
merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of the
merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the
requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof, upon written
request, shall be entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the
merger or resulting from the consolidation a statement setting forth the
aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation
and with respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the
aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such written statement shall be
mailed to the stockholder within 10 days after such stockholder's written
request for such a statement is received by the surviving or resulting
corporation or within l0 days after expiration of the period for delivery of
demands for appraisal under subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever
is later. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the
beneficial owner of shares of such stock held either in a voting trust or by a
nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person's own name, file a
petition or request from the corporation the statement described in this
subsection.

  

(f) Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy
thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting corporation, which shall
within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register in
Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the
names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their
shares and with whom agreements as

     

to the value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving or
resulting corporation. If the petition shall be filed by the surviving or
resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by such a duly
verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall
give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by
registered or certified mail to the surviving or resulting corporation and to
the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein stated. Such
notice shall also be given by 1 or more publications at least 1 week before
the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in the
City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the Court deems advisable.
The forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the
Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting
corporation.

  

(g) At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the
stockholders who have complied with this section and who have become entitled
to appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded
an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates
to submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation
thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder
fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the proceedings as
to such stockholder.

  

(h) After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the
appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the
Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal
proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall determine the fair value
of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the merger or consolidation, together with
interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value.
In determining such fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant
factors. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good
cause shown, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date
of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at
5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as
established from time to time during the period between the effective date of
the merger and the date of payment of the judgment. Upon application by the
surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to
participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion,
proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the
stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on
the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to
subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted such stockholder's
certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may
participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such
stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this section.

  

(i) The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares,
together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting corporation to
the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such
stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the
case of holders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to
the corporation of the certificates representing such stock. The Court's
decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be
enforced, whether such surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of
this State or of any state.

  

(j) The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon
the parties as the Court deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon
application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the
expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal
proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and the
fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all
the shares entitled to an appraisal.

  

(k) From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no
stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided in subsection (d) of
this section shall be entitled to vote such stock

     

for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on
the stock (except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of
record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger or
consolidation); provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall
be filed within the time provided in subsection (e) of this section, or if
such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a
written withdrawal of such stockholder's demand for an appraisal and an
acceptance of the merger or consolidation, either within 60 days after the
effective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of
this section or thereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then
the right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed
as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such approval may
be conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just; provided, however that
this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not
commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party
to withdraw such stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms
offered upon the merger or consolidation within 60 days after the effective
date of the merger or consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of this
section.

  

(l) The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares
of such objecting stockholders would have been converted had they assented to
the merger or consolidation shall have the status of authorized and unissued
shares of the surviving or resulting corporation.
