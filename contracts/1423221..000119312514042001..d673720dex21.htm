the purchase and sale of the LLC Interests contemplated hereby shall take
place at a closing (the "Closing") to be held either: (i) on the last day of
the month in which such conditions have been satisfied or waived if the last

Section 2.05 Purchase Price Adjustment

 

(a) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and
deliver to Seller a statement setting forth the Closing Date Net Working
Capital (the "Purchase Price Adjustment Statement") and a statement setting
forth BuyerÂ’s calculation of the Indebtedness of the Company and Subsidiary as
of the Closing (such amount, the "Closing Indebtedness Amount", and such
statement of the Closing Indebtedness Amount, together with the Purchase Price
Adjustment Statement, the "Adjustment Statements"). The Purchase Price
Adjustment Statement shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a
basis consistent with the Financial Statements.

(b) Each party shall provide the other party and its representatives with
reasonable access to the Business Records and relevant personnel and

-11- (c) If Seller disagrees with the determination of the Closing Date Net Working
Capital or Indebtedness as set forth in the Adjustment Statements, Seller
shall notify Buyer in writing of such disagreement within thirty (30) days
after delivery of the Adjustment Statements to Seller (the "Objection
Disputes"). During the thirty (30) day period of its review, Seller shall
have reasonable access to any documents, schedules or work papers used in the
preparation of the Adjustment Statements. The failure of Seller to deliver
written notice of an Objection Dispute to Buyer within thirty (30) days after
delivery of the Adjustment Statements to Seller shall be deemed acceptance of
the Adjustment Statements and agreement to BuyerÂ’s calculation of Closing Date
New Working Capital and Indebtedness as set forth in the Adjustment
Statements.

(d) Subject to Section 2.05(c), Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good
faith to resolve any Objection Dispute and any resolution agreed to in writing
by Buyer and Seller shall be final and binding upon the parties. If Buyer and
Seller are unable to resolve all Objection Disputes within twenty (20) days
of delivery of written notice of such Objection Disputes by Seller to Buyer,
then the disputed matters shall be referred for final determination within
fifteen (15) days thereafter to an independent accounting firm (the
"Accounting Arbitrator") that Buyer and Seller shall jointly select that is
an accounting firm of national standing and that is not the independent
auditor of (and does not otherwise serve as a Consultant to) either Buyer or
the Company. If Buyer and Seller are unable to agree upon an Accounting
Arbitrator within such time period, then the Accounting Arbitrator shall be an
accounting firm of national standing designated by the American Arbitration
Association in New York, New York; provided, that such firm shall not be the
independent auditor of (or otherwise serve as a Consultant to) either Buyer or
the Company. The Accounting Arbitrator shall only consider those items and
amounts set forth on the Adjustment Statement as to which Buyer and Seller
have disagreed within the time periods and amounts and on the terms specified
in Section 2.05(c) and Section 2.05(d) and must resolve all unresolved
Objection Disputes in accordance with the terms and provisions of this
Agreement. The Accounting Arbitrator shall deliver to Buyer and Seller, as
promptly as practicable and in any event within sixty (60) days after its
appointment, a written report setting forth the resolution of any unresolved
Objection Disputes determined in accordance with the terms herein. The
Accounting Arbitrator shall select as a resolution the position of either
Buyer or Seller for each Objection Dispute (based solely on presentations and
supporting material provided by the parties and not pursuant to any
independent review) and may not impose an alternative resolution. Such report
shall be final and binding upon all of the parties to this Agreement. The term
"Final Closing Date Net Working Capital" shall mean the Closing Date Net
Working Capital agreed to by Buyer and Seller and/or resulting from the
decision of the Accounting Arbitrator, or if Seller fails to deliver written
notice of disagreement to Buyer within the thirty (30) day period provided in
Section 2.05(c). The term "Final Closing Indebtedness" shall mean the Closing
Indebtedness Amount agreed to by Buyer and Seller and/or resulting from the
decision of the Accounting Arbitrator, or if Seller fails to deliver written
notice of disagreement to Buyer within the thirty (30) day period provided in
Section 2.05(c). The fees, expenses and costs of the Accounting Arbitrator
shall be borne equally by Buyer and Seller.

 



-12- (e) The Closing Consideration Amount shall be adjusted as follows:

 

(i) in the event that the Final Closing Date Net Working Capital is greater
than $23,847,000 (the "Target Net Working Capital"), then the Closing
Consideration Amount shall be increased dollar-for-dollar to the extent the
Final Closing Date Net Working Capital exceeds the Target Net Working Capital;

 

(ii) in the event that the Final Closing Date Net Working Capital is less than
Target Net Working Capital, then the Closing Consideration Amount shall be
decreased dollar-for-dollar to the extent that the Target Net Working Capital
exceeds the Closing Date Net Working Capital;

 

(iii) the Closing Consideration Amount shall be decreased dollar-for-dollar
for Indebtedness; and

 

(iv) the term "Adjustment Amount" shall mean the net aggregate amount of any
such increases or decreases in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of this Section
2.05(e). If the Closing Consideration Amount is decreased pursuant to this
Section 2.05(e), Seller will pay Buyer an amount equal to the Adjustment
Amount. If the Closing Consideration Amount is increased pursuant to this
Section 2.05(e), Buyer will pay Seller an amount equal to the adjustment of
the Adjustment Amount.

 

(f) Any Purchase Price Adjustment shall be paid by Buyer or Seller, as
applicable, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by the party receiving such payment within five (5) Business Days
after the final determination of the Purchase Price Adjustment.

occurred to cause the revocation of such determination letter from the
Internal Revenue Service or that could adversely affect the Union 401(k)
PlanÂ’s qualification under Section 401(a) of the Code. None of the assets of
the Union 401(k) Plan consist of stock or other securities of Seller.

 

(c) No "Prohibited Transaction," within the meaning of Section 4975 of the

or Section 414(b) of the Code (an "ERISA Affiliate"), within the six-year

to contribute to, any such multi-employer plan. Neither Seller, the Company,

incurred any material liability to the Company with respect to any Seller

member, manager or consultant, except as a result of any partial plan
termination resulting from this Agreement; or (iii) limit or restrict the
ability of Buyer or its Affiliates to merge, amend or terminate any Benefit
Plan, in each case, as a result of the execution of this Agreement.

compensation plan within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and that is

of the Code and applicable guidance thereunder during the respective time

its Employees, customers, lenders, suppliers, regulators and others having
business relationships with the Company. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, from the date hereof until the Closing Date, except as
consented to in writing by Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), Seller shall not:

(y) cause or permit the Company to take any action that would cause any of the
changes, events or conditions described in Section 3.07 to occur; or

(z) cause or permit the Company to: (i) settle, compromise or fail to timely
pay any material Tax liability of the Company or Subsidiary when due (taking
into account any applicable extensions); (ii) fail to file any material Tax
Return of the Company or Subsidiary when due (taking into account any
applicable extensions), which Tax Returns shall be prepared consistent with
the past practices, except as otherwise required by applicable Law; or (iii)
file or amend any material Tax election for the Company or Subsidiary or amend
any material Tax Return of the Company or Subsidiary other than in the
ordinary course of business.

 



-32- Section 6.02 Access to Information. From the date hereof until the Closing,
Seller shall, and shall cause the Company to: (a) afford Buyer and its
Representatives reasonable access to and the right to inspect all of the Real
Property, properties, assets, premises, books and records, contracts,
agreements and other documents and data related to the Company; (b) furnish
Buyer and its Representatives with such financial, operating and other data
and information related to the Company as Buyer or any of its Representatives
may reasonably request; and (c) instruct the Representatives of Seller and
the Company to cooperate with Buyer in its investigation of the Company;
_provided, however,_ that any such investigation shall be conducted during
normal business hours upon reasonable advance notice to Seller, under the
supervision of SellerÂ’s personnel and in such a manner as not to interfere
with the normal operations of the Company. All requests by Buyer for access
pursuant to this Section 6.02 shall be submitted or directed to such
individuals as Seller may designate in writing from time to time.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither Seller nor
the Company shall be required to disclose any information to Buyer if such
disclosure would, in SellerÂ’s sole discretion: (x) cause significant
competitive harm to Seller, the Company and their respective businesses if the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated; (y)
jeopardize any attorney-client or other privilege; or (z) contravene any
applicable Law, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the
date of this Agreement. Prior to the Closing, without the prior written
consent of Seller, which may be withheld for any reason, Buyer shall not
contact any suppliers to, or customers of, the Company and Buyer shall have no
right to perform invasive sampling or subsurface investigations of the Real
Property. Buyer shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, abide by the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement with respect to any access or
information provided pursuant to this Section 6.02.

 

Section 6.03 Supplement to Disclosure Schedules. From time to time prior to
the Closing, Seller shall have the right (but not the obligation) to
supplement or amend the Disclosure Schedules hereto with respect to any matter
first arising after the date hereof (each a "Schedule Supplement"). Any
disclosure in any such Schedule Supplement shall not be deemed to have cured
any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty contained in
this Agreement, including for purposes of the indemnification or termination
rights contained in this Agreement or of determining whether or not the
conditions set forth in Section 7.02 have been satisfied; _provided, however_
, that if Buyer has the right to, but does not elect to, terminate this
Agreement within five Business Days of its receipt of such Schedule
Supplement, then Buyer shall be deemed to have irrevocably waived any right
to terminate this Agreement with respect to such matter and, further, shall
have irrevocably waived its right to indemnification under Section 8.02 with
respect to such matter.

 

Section 6.04 Resignations. Seller shall deliver to Buyer written resignations,
effective as of the Closing Date, of the officers and managers of the
Company.

 



-33- Section 6.05 Employees; Benefit Plans.

 

(a) Buyer acknowledges that all persons employed by the Company as of the
Closing will continue as employees of Company immediately after the Closing.
At the Closing, Buyer shall and shall cause the Company to provide each
Employee who remains employed immediately after the Closing ("Company
Continuing Employee") with: (i) base salary or hourly wages which shall
be determined by Buyer in its sole discretion; (ii) target bonus
opportunities (excluding equity-based compensation), if any, which shall be
determined by Buyer in its sole discretion; (iii) retirement and welfare
benefits which shall be determined by Buyer in its sole discretion; and (iv)
severance benefits which shall be determined by Buyer in its sole discretion.
Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, the terms and conditions of such Company
Continuing EmployeesÂ’ employment, including but not limited to such matters
as wages, employee benefits, hours and working conditions, shall be determined
by Buyer in its sole discretion. Buyer may terminate at any time after the
Closing the employment of any Company Continuing Employee. Seller will not
take any action which would impede, hinder, interfere or otherwise compete
with BuyerÂ’s effort to retain Company Continuing Employees. This Section 6.05
is solely for purposes of defining the obligations between Buyer and Seller
concerning the employees of Seller who are employed solely in connection with
the Business that immediately prior to the Closing Date and shall in no way be
construed as creating any employment or other contract between Buyer and any
such person or as restricting the right of Buyer to terminate or change the
terms and conditions of the employment of a Company Continuing Employee who
becomes an employee of Buyer; _provided_ that, subject to Section 6.20, Buyer
shall cause the Company to continue to fulfill all obligations under any and
all agreements or arrangements that provide for or contain an understanding
with respect to severance pay, post-employment liabilities or obligations for
the benefit of a Company Continuing Employee.

(b) The Seller shall terminate the CompanyÂ’s participation in all SellerÂ’s
Benefit Plans (other than any such plan covering solely employees of the
Company or Subsidiary and any individual severance agreement identified in
Section 3.14(a) of the Disclosure Schedules), with such termination to
be effective as of the Closing Date and the employees of the Company and
Subsidiary will no longer continue accruing further rights, interests or
entitlements under such plans or programs after the Closing Date; _provided,
however_ , that, as long as the Transition Services Agreement is in effect,
until May 31, 2014 (or such earlier date as the Seller and the Buyer may
agree), the Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) administer
the plans maintained by the Company that provide medical, dental, vision,
long-term disability, accidental death and dismemberment insurance, life
insurance, and employee assistance benefits and health and dependent care
spending accounts for the Company Continuing Employees pursuant to the
Transition Services Agreement (the "Continuing Welfare Plan Coverage") and
(ii) provide the payroll services with respect to Company Continuing Employees
set forth in the Transition Services Agreement (together with the Continuing
Welfare Plan Coverage, the "HR Services"). Prior to the Closing, as long as
the Transition Services Agreement is in effect, the Seller and the Buyer will
reasonably cooperate to effect the HR Services, which may include the
establishment of plans to provide for the Continuing Welfare Plan Coverage,
the hiring of, and entering into agreements with, third-party administrators;
provided that no such agreements shall be entered into without the consent of
both the Seller and the Buyer. The Buyer shall pay the third party
administrators or the Seller for all costs and expenses of the HR Services
incurred from and after the Closing Date, which costs and expenses shall be
determined as set forth in the Transition Services Agreement.

 



-34- (c) Seller will assume or retain (i) all employment-related liabilities with
respect to all individuals who, immediately prior to Closing are receiving
long-term disability benefits under a Seller Benefit Plan, including without
limitation the long-term disability benefits, medical, dental and vision
coverage and all other compensation or benefits to which such individuals are
or may be entitled, and such individuals shall not be considered Company
Continuing Employees for purposes of this Agreement, (ii) all liabilities for
post-retirement medical or other post-employment benefits for all employees
and their dependents of the Company retired prior to the Closing and (iii) all
liabilities for benefits or coverage being provided and to be provided
pursuant to Section 4980B of the Code to any employees or former employees
(and any of their respective dependents) with respect to whom a "qualifying
event" (within the meaning of Section 4980B of the Code) occurred prior to the
Closing. Seller shall indemnify the Buyer against any and all liabilities
assumed or retained by Seller pursuant to this Section 6.05(c)(i), (ii) and
(iii) (each a "Seller Retained Benefit Liability" and together the "Seller
Retained Benefit Liabilities").

 

(d) With respect to any employee benefit plan maintained by Buyer or the
Subsidiary (collectively, "Buyer Benefit Plans") in which any Company
Continuing Employees will participate effective as of the Closing, Buyer
shall, or shall cause the Company to, recognize all service of the Company
Continuing Employees with the Company or the Subsidiary, as the case may be as
if such service were with Buyer, for only vesting and eligibility purposes in
any Buyer Benefit Plan in which such Company Continuing Employees are be
eligible to participate after the Closing Date; _provided, however,_ such
service shall not be recognized to the extent that (x) such recognition would
result in a duplication of benefits or (y) such service was not recognized
under the corresponding Benefit Plan. Seller will provide Buyer with the
information described in the preceding sentence in a timely fashion.

(e) Seller shall take all action necessary to effect prior to the Closing (i)
the transfer of sponsorship of the Union 401(k) Plan to the Company, (ii) the
establishment of, and the transfer of all of the assets of the Union 401(k)
Plan to, a separate trust for the assets of the Union 401(k) Plan, (iii) the
amendment of the Union 401(k) Plan to eliminate the stock or other securities
of the Seller as an investment alternative under the Union 401(k) Plan and
(iv) the entry into all agreements and the establishment of all administrative
processes necessary for the Union 401(k) Plan to operate on a standalone
basis. Seller shall provide to Buyer, prior to the execution of any agreement
or trust document related to the foregoing, drafts of such agreements or
documents and shall incorporate any changes thereto reasonably requested by
Buyer.

(f) Seller shall take all actions necessary so that, effective immediately
prior to the Closing, the Company will cease to be a participating employer
in the SellerÂ’s Salaried 401(k) Plan (the "Seller 401(k) Plan"). Company
Continuing Employees who are participants in the Seller 401(k) Plan
immediately prior to the Closing Date will be eligible to participate in a
defined contribution plan maintained by Buyer, the Company or the Subsidiary
(the "Buyer 401(k) Plan") as soon as practicable after the Closing Date. The
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Buyer 401(k)
Plan to accept rollover contributions, including loan amounts, but excluding
after-tax amounts, on behalf of each Company Continuing Employee, with respect
to amounts distributable to such Company Continuing Employees from the Seller
401(k) Plan.

 



-35- This Section 6.05 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit
of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section 6.05,
express or implied, shall confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies
of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 6.05.
Nothing contained herein, express or implied, shall be construed to
establish, amend or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the terms set forth
in this Section 6.05 shall not create any right in any Employee or any other
Person to any continued employment with the Company, Buyer or any of their
respective Affiliates or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind
whatsoever.

 

Section 6.06 Manager and Officer Indemnification and Insurance.

 

(a) Buyer agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses
and exculpation by the Company now existing in favor of each Person who is
now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to
the Closing Date, an officer or manager of the Company, as provided in the
Organizational Documents of the Company, in each case as in effect on the date
of this Agreement, or pursuant to any other agreements in effect on the date
hereof and disclosed in Section 6.06(a) of the Disclosure Schedules, shall
survive the Closing Date and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their respective terms.

(b) The Company shall, and Buyer shall cause the Company to (i) maintain in
effect for a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date, if available,
the current policies of managersÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance maintained
by the Company immediately prior to the Closing Date (provided that the
Company may substitute therefor policies, of at least the same coverage and
amounts and containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous to
the managers and officers of the Company when compared to the insurance
maintained by the Company as of the date hereof), or (ii) obtain as of the
Closing Date "tail" insurance policies with a claims period of six (6) years
from the Closing Date with at least the same coverage and amounts, and
containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous to the
managers and officers of the Company, in each case with respect to claims
arising out of or relating to events which occurred on or prior to the Closing
Date (including in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement).

(c) The obligations of Buyer and the Company under this Section 6.06 shall not
be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any manager
or officer to whom this Section 6.06 applies without the consent of such
affected manager or officer (it being expressly agreed that the managers and
officers to whom this Section 6.06 applies shall be third-party beneficiaries
of this Section 6.06, each of whom may enforce the provisions of this Section
6.06).

 

(d) In the event Buyer, the Company or any of their respective successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper provision shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Buyer or the Company, as the case may
be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 6.06.

 



-36- Section 6.07 Confidentiality. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the
Confidentiality Agreement remains in full force and effect and, in addition,
covenants and agrees to keep confidential, in accordance with the provisions
of the Confidentiality Agreement, information provided to Buyer pursuant to
this Agreement. If this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to the
Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement and the provisions of this Section 6.07
shall nonetheless continue in full force and effect.

 

Section 6.08 Governmental Approvals and Other Third-party Consents.

 

(a) Each party hereto shall, as promptly as possible, use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain, or cause to be obtained, all
consents, authorizations, orders and approvals from all Governmental
Authorities that may be or become necessary for its execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the performance of its obligations pursuant to this
Agreement. Each party shall cooperate fully with the other party and its
Affiliates in promptly seeking to obtain all such consents, authorizations,
orders and approvals. The parties hereto shall not willfully take any action
that will have the effect of delaying, impairing or impeding the receipt of
any required consents, authorizations, orders and approvals. If required by
the HSR Act and if the appropriate filing pursuant to the HSR Act has not been
filed prior to the date hereof, each party hereto agrees to make an
appropriate filing pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement within fifteen Business Days after the date
hereof and to supply as promptly as practicable to the appropriate
Governmental Authority any additional information and documentary material
that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act.

(b) Without limiting the generality of BuyerÂ’s undertaking pursuant to this
Section 6.08, Buyer agrees to take such actions as may be reasonably necessary
to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust,
competition or trade regulation Law that may be asserted by any Governmental
Authority or any other party so as to enable the parties hereto to close the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as possible including
taking or committing to take actions that after the Closing would
limit BuyerÂ’s freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain,
one or more of the businesses, product lines or assets of the Company that
would not, in the aggregate, be material to the business of the Company and
Subsidiary taken as a whole, in each case as may be required in order to
avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary
restraining order or other order in any suit or proceeding, which would
otherwise have the effect of materially delaying or preventing the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided,
however_ , that nothing contained in this Agreement shall require or obligate
Buyer to, and Seller shall not, without the prior written consent of Buyer,
sell, divest, dispose of, or hold separate any businesses, products, plants,
services, or assets of Buyer, Seller, Company, or any of their respective
Subsidiaries. In addition, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to defend through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in court by any
party that is not a Governmental Authority that would or could reasonably be
expected to prevent the consummation of the Closing.

 



-37- (c) All written and material analyses, appearances, meetings, discussions,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, filings, arguments, and proposals made by
or on behalf of either party before any Governmental Authority or the staff or
regulators of any Governmental Authority, in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereunder (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not including any
interactions between Seller or the Company with Governmental Authorities in
the ordinary course of business, or any disclosure which is not permitted by
Law) shall be disclosed to the other party hereunder in advance of any
filing, submission or attendance, it being the intent that the parties will
consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the views
of one another, in connection with any such analyses, appearances, meetings,
discussions, presentations, memoranda, briefs, filings, arguments, and
proposals, provided that any such disclosures or provisions of information by
one party to the other may be made on a counsel-only basis to the extent
required under applicable Law or as appropriate to protect confidential
business information. Each party shall give notice to the other party with
respect to any meeting, discussion, appearance or contact with any
Governmental Authority or the staff or regulators of any Governmental
Authority, with such notice being sufficient to provide the other party with
the opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting, discussion,
appearance or contact to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Authority. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this
Agreement, Seller agrees that Buyer (i) shall have the right to determine and
direct the strategy and process by which the parties will seek required
approvals under any antitrust, competition or trade regulation Law and (ii)
shall take the lead in all joint meetings and communications with any
Governmental Authority.

 

 __(d) Seller and Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to give all
notices to, and obtain all consents from, all third parties that are
described in __Section 3.05 __of the Disclosure Schedules; _provided,
however,_ that Seller shall not be obligated to pay any consideration therefor
to any third party from whom consent or approval is requested. __

normal business hours, to such books and records.

 



-38- (b) In order to facilitate the resolution of any claims made by or against or
incurred by Buyer or the Company after the Closing, or for any other

relate to the Company and its operations for periods prior to the Closing;

Company reasonable access (including the right to make, at BuyerÂ’s expense,
photocopies), during normal business hours, to such books and records.

(c) Neither Buyer nor Seller shall be obligated to provide the other party
with access to any books or records (including personnel files) pursuant to
this Section 6.09 where such access would violate any Law.

party hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take such actions
as are necessary to expeditiously satisfy the closing conditions set forth in

or stock exchange requirements (based upon the reasonable advice of counsel),

this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise
communicate with any news media without the prior written consent of
the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), and the parties shall cooperate as to the timing and contents of any
such announcement.

 

Section 6.12 Further Assurances. Following the Closing, each of the parties
hereto shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, execute and
deliver such additional documents, instruments, conveyances and assurances,

provisions hereof and give effect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(a) Promptly following the date hereof, Seller shall, or shall cause its
Affiliates to, as applicable, undertake and diligently pursue the direction
of the completion by the Company (including its personnel), which completion
may occur after the Closing Date, of the repairs, construction and renovation
of the Decatur Cold Mill such that the Decatur Cold Mill operates at the
capacity and with the functionality at least equal to the minimum standards
set forth in Section 6.13 of the Disclosure Schedules. The costs, fees and
expenses arising from the construction set forth in Section 6.13(a) of
the Disclosure Schedules shall be an expense of Seller and shall not be an
expense of Buyer.

 



-39- (b) From and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide, and shall cause both
the Company and Subsidiary to provide, such information, cooperation and
assistance, that is reasonably required in order for Seller to fulfill its
obligations under this Section 6.13, and Seller shall reimburse Buyer for (i)
the actual out-of-pocket costs and expenses and (ii) Personnel Costs, in each

and after the Closing Date, and solely in connection with the performance of
its obligations under this Section 6.13, Seller shall have reasonable access
at reasonable times pre-arranged with Buyer to the Decatur Cold Mill
_provided, however_ , that Seller shall use its reasonable efforts to avoid
and mitigate any interruption of or interference with the CompanyÂ’s or
BuyerÂ’s business activities at the Decatur Cold Mill.

 

Section 6.14 Transfer Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration, filing, recordation, real estate transfer, value added and
other similar Taxes, charges or fees resulting from, relating to, or arising
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement ("Transfer
Taxes") shall be borne and paid by Buyer when due. Buyer shall, at its own
expense, timely file, or cause to be timely filed, all necessary Tax Returns
or other documentation with respect to any Transfer Taxes, and, if required by
applicable Law, the Seller will join in the execution of any such Tax Returns
and other documentation.

Section 6.15 Tax Returns.

 

(a) Seller shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, all Income Tax Returns
required to be filed by the Company or the Subsidiary after the Closing Date
with respect to any Tax Period ending on or before the Closing Date. Any such
Income Tax Return shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practice
(unless otherwise required by Law) and shall be submitted by Seller to Buyer
for BuyerÂ’s review and reasonable comment at least 30 days prior to the due
date (including extensions) for filing such Income Tax Return. If Buyer has
any reasonable objections to any item on any such Income Tax Return, Buyer
shall, within 15 days after delivery of such Income Tax Return, notify the
Seller in writing that Buyer so objects, specifying with particularity any
such item and stating the specific factual or legal basis for any such
reasonable objection. If a notice of objection is not duly delivered, Buyer
shall timely (taking into account applicable extensions) file, or cause the
Company or the Subsidiary, as applicable, to timely (taking into account
applicable extensions) file, such Income Tax Return. If a notice of objection
is duly delivered, Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith and use
commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such items. If Buyer and Seller are
unable to reach such agreement within 5 days after receipt by Seller of such
notice, the disputed items shall be resolved by the national office of a firm
of independent accountants of nationally recognized standing appointed by
mutual agreement of Seller and Buyer (the "Independent Accountants") and
any determination by the Independent Accountants shall be final. The
Independent Accountants shall resolve any disputed items within 10 days of
having the item referred to them pursuant to such procedures as they may
require. If the Independent Accountants are unable to resolve any disputed
items before the due date (including extensions) for such Income Tax Return,
Buyer shall timely (taking into account applicable extensions) file, or cause
the Company or the Subsidiary, as applicable, to timely (taking into account
applicable extensions) file, such Income Tax Return and then Buyer shall
amend, or cause to be amended, such Income Tax Return to reflect the
Independent AccountantsÂ’ resolution. The costs, fees and expenses of the
Independent Accountants, and any associated costs and fees (including in
connection with the revised Tax Return), shall be borne equally by Buyer and
Seller. Subject to the indemnification obligations of Seller pursuant
to Section 8.02(c) and SellerÂ’s obligations pursuant to the next sentence,
the Company or the Subsidiary, as applicable, shall be responsible for timely
paying (taking into account all valid extensions) all Taxes reflected on any
such Income Tax Return to the applicable Governmental Authority. Not later
than three (3) Business Days prior to the due date (taking into account all
valid extensions) for any payment required under any such Income Tax Return,
the Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount of such Taxes reflected on such
Income Tax Return that are the obligation of Seller pursuant to Section
8.02(c).

 



-40- (b) Buyer shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, all Tax Returns required to
be filed by the Company or the Subsidiary after the Closing Date with respect
to a Pre-Closing Period (other than any Income Tax Return described in Section
6.15(a)). Any such Tax Return shall be prepared in a manner consistent with
past practice (unless otherwise required by Law) and shall be submitted by
Buyer to Seller for SellerÂ’s review and reasonable comment at least 30 days
prior to the due date (including extensions) for filing such Tax Return. If
Seller has any reasonable objections to any item on any such Tax Return,
Seller shall, within 15 days after delivery of such Tax Return, notify Buyer
in writing that Seller so objects, specifying with particularity any such item
and stating the specific factual or legal basis for any such reasonable
objection. If a notice of objection is not duly delivered, Buyer shall timely
(taking into account applicable extensions) file, or cause the Company or the
Subsidiary, as applicable, to timely (taking into account applicable
extensions) file, such Tax Return. If a notice of objection is duly delivered,
Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith and use commercially reasonable
efforts to resolve such items. If Buyer and Seller are unable to reach
such agreement within 5 days after receipt by Buyer of such notice, the
disputed items shall be resolved by the Independent Accountants under the
procedures provided for in Section 6.15(a). If the Independent Accountants are
unable to resolve any disputed items before the due date (including
extensions) for such Tax Return, Buyer shall timely (taking into account
applicable extensions) file, or cause the Company or the Subsidiary, as
applicable, to timely (taking into account applicable extensions) file, such
Tax Return and then Buyer shall amend, or cause to be amended, such Income Tax
Return to reflect the Independent AccountantsÂ’ resolution. Subject to the
indemnification obligations of Seller pursuant to Section 8.02(c) and
SellerÂ’s obligations pursuant to the next sentence, the Company or the
Subsidiary, as applicable, shall be responsible for timely paying (taking into
account all valid extensions) all Taxes reflected on any such Tax Return to
the applicable Governmental Authority. Within three (3) Business Date after
the later of (i) a written request by Buyer, or (ii) the due date (taking into
account all valid extensions) for any payment required under any such Tax
Return, Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount of such Taxes reflected on Tax
Return that are the obligation of Seller pursuant to Section 8.02(c).

 



-41- Section 6.16 Allocation of Straddle Period Taxes. In the case of Taxes that
are payable with respect to a Straddle Period, the portion of any such Taxes
that is attributable to the portion of the Pre-Closing Period of such Straddle
Period shall be:

 

(a) in the case of Taxes that are either (i) based upon or related to income
or receipts, or (ii) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or
assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible), deemed
equal to the amount that would be payable if the Tax period ended on the day
prior to the Closing Date; and

 

(b) in the case of Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis with respect to
the assets or capital of the Company or the Subsidiary, deemed to be the
amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period, multiplied by a fraction
the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on the day prior to the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle
Period.

Section 6.17 Amended Tax Returns. Notwithstanding any other provision in this
Agreement to the contrary, Buyer shall not, and shall not cause or permit any
of its Affiliates or the Company, the Subsidiary or any of their Affiliates
to, without the prior written consent of Seller (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), (i) amend any Tax Return of
the Company or the Subsidiary that covers a Pre-Closing Period (other than
amendments pursuant to Section 6.15) or (ii) make any Tax election with
respect to the Company or the Subsidiary that has retroactive effect to any
Pre-Closing Period.

Section 6.18 Refunds. The amount or economic benefit of any refund (whether
in cash or as a credit against or offset to any Tax) in respect of any Tax of
the Company or the Subsidiary attributable to any Pre-Closing Period received
by Buyer, the Company, the Subsidiary or any of their respective Affiliates
(other than any amount or economic benefit (i) resulting from the carryback of
losses attributable to a Post-Closing Period being carried back to a Pre-
Closing Period or (ii) included as a Current Asset and taken into account in
the calculation of the Final Closing Date Net Working Capital) shall be for
the account of Seller, and the recipient thereof shall pay such amount
(including any interest received thereon) to Seller within ten (10) days
after any such refund is received, credited, or applied as an offset, net of
any reasonable out of pocket expenses paid to third parties in connection with
obtaining such refund, including any Income Taxes imposed on the receipt
of such refund (including any Income Tax imposed on any interest received
thereon).

Section 6.19 Tax Treatment and Tax Allocation.

(a) For U.S. federal income tax purposes (and state, local, and foreign income
Tax purposes where applicable), each of Seller and Buyer intend for the
purchase of the LLC Interests pursuant to this Agreement to be treated as a
purchase and sale of all the assets of the Company and the Subsidiary (subject
to all the liabilities of the Company and the Subsidiary). Consistent with
such treatment and for the avoidance of doubt, all of the U.S. federal income
tax attributes of Seller or the Seller Consolidated Group attributable to the
Company and the Subsidiary from any Pre-Closing Period shall remain
with Seller and/or the Seller Consolidated Group. Each of Seller and Buyer
shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to, report the purchase of the
LLC Interests pursuant to this Agreement consistent with such intended
treatment for all U.S. federal income tax purposes (and state, local, and
foreign income Tax purposes where applicable). Except as otherwise required by
applicable Law, each of Seller and Buyer agrees that it will not, and will not
permit its Affiliates to, take any position for Tax purposes (whether on any
Tax Return, in any Tax proceeding, or otherwise) that is inconsistent with
such intended treatment.

 



-42- (b) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing, Buyer shall deliver to Seller an
allocation schedule (the "Initial Allocation Schedule") allocating the
Closing Consideration Amount (together with the liabilities of the Company and
the Subsidiary and other amounts required to be treated as part of the
purchase price of U.S. federal income tax purposes) among the assets of the
Company and the Subsidiary in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. If Seller has any reasonable
objections to any item on the Initial Allocation Schedule, Seller shall,
within thirty (30) days after delivery of the Initial Allocation Schedule,
notify Buyer in writing that Seller so objects, specifying with particularity
any such item and stating the specific factual or legal basis for any such
reasonable objection. If a notice of objection is not duly delivered or if
Seller does not have any reasonable objections to the Initial Allocation
Schedule, then the Initial Allocation Schedule shall become final and
binding thirty (30) days after BuyerÂ’s delivery of the Initial Allocation
Schedule to Seller. If a notice of objection is duly delivered, Buyer and
Seller shall negotiate in good faith and use commercially reasonable efforts
to resolve such items. If Buyer and Seller are unable to reach such agreement
within thirty (30) days after receipt by Buyer of such notice, the disputed
items shall be resolved by an independent party appointed by mutual agreement
of Seller and Buyer and any determination by such independent party shall be
final and binding. The costs, fees and expenses of such independent party
shall be borne equally by Buyer and Seller. A final and binding allocation
schedule under this Section 6.19(b) shall be the "Final Allocation Schedule".
Except as otherwise required by applicable Law, (i) each of Seller and Buyer
shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to, report for Tax purposes and
file all Tax Returns consistent with the Final Allocation Schedule, and (ii)
each of Seller and Buyer will not, and will not permit of any of its
Affiliates to, take any position for Tax purposes (whether on any Tax Return,
in any Tax proceeding, or otherwise) that is inconsistent with the Final
Allocation Schedule. Any adjustment of the Closing Consideration Amount, and
to any other items of consideration, cost or expense taken into account in the
Final Allocation Schedule for U.S. federal income tax purposes, shall be
allocated in a manner consistent with the Final Allocation Schedule.

Section 6.20 Tax Cooperation. Each of Buyer and Seller, and each of its
Affiliates, shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested
by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns of or with
respect to the Company or the Subsidiary or during the course of any audit,
litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes of or attributable to the
Company or the Subsidiary. Such cooperation shall include the retention and
(upon the other partyÂ’s request) the provision of records and
information that are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or
other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis
to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. Buyer, Seller, the Company and the Subsidiary agree, and following
the Closing, Buyer agrees to cause the Company and the Subsidiary, (a) to
retain all books and records in its possession with respect to Tax matters
pertaining to the Company and the Subsidiary for any Tax period beginning on
or before the Closing Date until the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations (and, to the extent notified by the Buyer or Seller, any
extensions thereof) of the respective Tax periods, and to abide by all record
retention agreements entered into with any Governmental Authority, and (b) to
give the other party reasonable written notice prior to transferring,
destroying or discarding any such books and records and, on receipt of such
notice, if the other party so requests, Buyer, Seller or the Company, as the
case may be, shall allow the other party to take possession of such books and
records. Buyer and Seller further agree, upon request, to use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any
Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed on Seller, Buyer, the
Company, the Subsidiary, or any of their respective Affiliates (including
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby).

 



-43- Section 6.21 Retention Agreements. Effective as of the Closing, Buyer shall
assume all of SellerÂ’s rights, duties and obligations with respect to each of
the Retention Agreements listed in Section 6.21 of the Disclosure Schedules
(the "Retention Agreements"), other than the payment of the special retention
bonus that is set forth in paragraph 2 of each of the Retention Agreements.
Seller shall be responsible for the payment of the special retention bonus
that is set forth in paragraph 2 of the Retention Agreements. Seller shall
also reimburse Buyer for one-half of the base salary continuation severance
costs triggered, if any, within six (6) months after the Closing Date as set
forth in Section 6.21 of the Disclosure Schedules.

 

Section 6.22 Hedging Arrangements. At or prior to Closing, Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to assign to the Company, and the Company
shall assume any and all outstanding metal hedging arrangements entered into
by Seller on behalf of the Company, or shall undertake such other similar
arrangements as the parties may mutually agree.

Agreement, the representations and warranties contained herein shall survive
the Closing and shall remain in full force and effect until the date that is
eighteen months from the Closing Date; provided that representations of Seller

asserted in good faith with reasonable specificity (to the extent known at
such time) and in writing by notice from the non-breaching party to the
breaching party prior to the expiration date of the applicable survival period
shall not thereafter be barred by the expiration of such survival period and
such claims shall survive until finally resolved.

 



-46- Section 8.02 Indemnification By Seller. Subject to the other terms and
conditions of this Article VIII, from and after the Closing, Seller shall
indemnify Buyer, its Affiliates, and their respective officers, directors,
employees, shareholders, agents, representatives, successors and assigns
("Buyer Indemnified Parties," each a "Buyer Indemnified Party") against, and
shall hold Buyer Indemnified Parties harmless from and against, any and all
Losses incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon, Buyer Indemnified Parties
based upon, arising out of, with respect to or by reason of:

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations or warranties
of Seller contained in this Agreement; or

(b) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant, agreement or obligation to
be performed by Seller pursuant to this Agreement;

(c) any and all Pre-Closing Taxes;

 

(d) any and all Seller Retained Benefit Liabilities; or

 

(e) the SellerÂ’s amendment of the Union 401(k) Plan described in Section
6.05(e).

 

Section 8.03 Indemnification By Buyer. Subject to the other terms and
conditions of this Article VIII, from and after the Closing, Buyer shall
indemnify Seller, its Affiliates, and their respective officers, directors,
employees, shareholders, agents and representatives, successors and assigns
("Seller Indemnified Parties", each a "Seller Indemnified Party") against,
and shall hold Seller Indemnified Parties harmless from and against, any and
all Losses incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon, Seller Indemnified
Parties based upon, arising out of, with respect to or by reason of:

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations or warranties of
Buyer contained in this Agreement;

 

(b) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant, agreement or obligation to
be performed by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement;

 

(c) other than those Losses for which Buyer Indemnified Parties are entitled
to indemnification under this Agreement, the operation of the business of the
Company or the Subsidiary, whether prior to, on or after the Closing,
including without limitation those Assumed Liabilities assumed by Nichols
Aluminum, Inc. as of November 1, 2007 pursuant to the Nichols
Assignment Agreement and including, by way of example and not limitation, (i)
any Losses arising out of any proceeding related to the above where any Seller
Indemnified Party is or becomes a party to such proceeding, and (ii) any
Losses arising out of any claim related to the above against any insurance
policy where Seller or Subsidiary was, is or becomes a named insured,
including but not limited to all costs associated with self-insured retentions
and financial collateral incurred by Seller; or

(d) any violation of the WARN Act resulting from actions occurring following
the Closing Date.

 



-47- Section 8.04Certain Limitations. The party making a claim under this
Article VIII (either a Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party,
as the case may be) is referred to as the "Indemnified Party", and the party
against whom such claims are asserted under this Article VIII is referred
to as the "Indemnifying Party". The indemnification provided for in Section
8.02 (other than indemnification for claims based upon a breach of any of the
Surviving Representations) shall be subject to the following limitations:

(a) The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for
indemnification under Section 8.02(a), until the aggregate amount of all
Losses in respect of indemnification under Section 8.02(a) exceeds $1,500,000
(the "Deductible"), in which event the Indemnifying Party shall only
be required to pay or be liable for Losses in excess of the Deductible. With
respect to any claim as to which the Indemnified Party may be entitled to
indemnification under Section 8.02(a), the Indemnifying Party shall not be
liable for any individual or series of related Losses which do not exceed
$50,000 (which Losses shall not be counted toward the Deductible).

(b) The aggregate amount of all Losses for which an Indemnifying Party shall
be liable pursuant to Section 8.02(a), shall not exceed $10,000,000.

 

(c) Payments by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to Section 8.02 or Section 8.03
in respect of any Loss shall be limited to the amount of any liability or
damage that remains after deducting therefrom any insurance proceeds and any
indemnity, contribution or other similar payment received by the Indemnified
Party (or the Company) in respect of any such claim.

(d) Each Indemnified Party shall take, and cause its Affiliates to take, all
reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss upon becoming aware of any event or
circumstance that would be reasonably expected to, or does, give rise thereto.

(e) With respect to any indemnification matter arising under Environmental
Law, Buyer and Seller shall act in the "Cost Effective Manner", which shall
mean the most cost effective methods for investigation, remediation, removal,
corrective action, containment, monitoring or other response action permitted
by applicable Environmental Laws determined from the perspective of a
reasonable business person acting without regard to the availability of
indemnification hereunder to achieve compliance with Environmental Laws (it
being understood that (A) such Cost Effective Manner shall include, where
appropriate, the use of risk-based remedies, institutional or engineering
controls, or deed restrictions, provided such controls do not unreasonably
interfere with BuyerÂ’s ability to conduct the Business in the manner conducted
as of the Closing Date and (B) to the extent needed to resolve any actual
conflict with a contractual obligation existing as of the Closing Date, said
contractual obligation shall be deemed the Cost Effective Manner.) In no event
shall Seller be responsible for any remedial action to address a Hazardous
Material in any building material or to the extent that any environmental
response results in a process improvement having a net financial benefit to
Buyer.

(f) Seller shall not be liable under this Article VIII for any Losses based
upon or arising out of any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the
representations or warranties of Seller contained in this Agreement if Buyer
had actual knowledge of such inaccuracy or breach prior to the date hereof.

 



-48- (g) For the avoidance of doubt, no Indemnified Party will be entitled to be
indemnified pursuant to this Article VIII for any Losses to the extent such
Losses are reflected in the Final Closing Date Net Working Capital.

 

Section 8.05 Indemnification Procedures.

 

(a) Third-Party Claims. If any Indemnified Party receives notice of the
assertion or commencement of any action, suit, claim or other legal
proceeding made or brought by any Person who is not a party to this Agreement
or an Affiliate of a party to this Agreement or a Representative of the
foregoing (a "Third-Party Claim") against such Indemnified Party with respect
to which the Indemnifying Party is obligated to provide indemnification under
this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party prompt
written notice thereof. The failure to give such prompt written notice shall
not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification
obligations, except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party
forfeits rights or defenses by reason of such failure. Such notice by the
Indemnified Party shall describe the Third-Party Claim in reasonable detail,
shall include copies of all material written evidence thereof and shall
indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has
been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party
shall have the right to participate in, or by giving written notice to the
Indemnified Party, to assume the defense of any Third-Party Claim (other than
any Third-Party Claims arising under Environmental Law) at the
Indemnifying PartyÂ’s expense and by the Indemnifying PartyÂ’s own counsel, and
the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith in such defense. In the
event that the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third-Party
Claim, subject to Section 8.05(b), it shall have the right to take such
action as it deems necessary to avoid, dispute, defend, appeal or make
counterclaims pertaining to any such Third-Party Claim in the name and on
behalf of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall have the right,
at its own cost and expense, to participate in the defense of any Third-Party
Claim with counsel selected by it subject to the Indemnifying PartyÂ’s right to
control the defense thereof. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to
compromise or defend such Third-Party Claim or fails to promptly notify the
Indemnified Party in writing of its election to defend as provided in this
Agreement, the Indemnified Party may, subject to Section 8.05(b), pay,
compromise, defend such Third-Party Claim and seek indemnification for any and
all Losses based upon, arising from or relating to such Third-Party Claim.
Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with each other in all reasonable respects
in connection with the defense of any Third-Party Claim, including making
available (subject to the provisions of Section 6.07) records relating to such
Third-Party Claim and furnishing, without expense (other than reimbursement
of actual out-of-pocket expenses) to the defending party, management employees
of the non-defending party as may be reasonably necessary for the preparation
of the defense of such Third-Party Claim.

 



-49- (b) Settlement of Third-Party Claims. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into settlement of any
Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as
provided in this Section 8.05(b). If a firm offer is made to settle a Third-
Party Claim without leading to liability or the creation of a financial or
other obligation on the part of the Indemnified Party and provides, in
customary form, for the unconditional release of each Indemnified Party from
all liabilities and obligations in connection with such Third-Party Claim and
the Indemnifying Party desires to accept and agree to such offer, the
Indemnifying Party shall give written notice to that effect to the
Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm
offer within fifteen days after its receipt of such notice, the Indemnified
Party may continue to contest or defend such Third-Party Claim and in
such event, the maximum liability of the Indemnifying Party as to such Third-
Party Claim shall not exceed the amount of such settlement offer. If the
Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm offer and also fails to assume
defense of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may settle the
Third-Party Claim upon the terms set forth in such firm offer to settle such
Third-Party Claim. If the Indemnified Party has assumed the defense pursuant
to Section 8.05(a), it shall not agree to any settlement without the written
consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed).

 

(c) Direct Claims. Any claim by an Indemnified Party on account of a Loss
which does not result from a Third-Party Claim (a "Direct Claim") shall be
asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying Party prompt written
notice thereof. The failure to give such prompt written notice shall not,
however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations,
except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or
defenses by reason of such failure. Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall
describe the Direct Claim in reasonable detail, shall include copies of all
material written evidence thereof and shall indicate the estimated amount, if
reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the
Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days after its
receipt of such notice to respond in writing to such Direct Claim. During
such 30-day period, the Indemnified Party shall allow the Indemnifying Party
and its professional advisors to investigate the matter or circumstance
alleged to give rise to the Direct Claim, and whether and to what extent any
amount is payable in respect of the Direct Claim and the Indemnified Party
shall assist the Indemnifying PartyÂ’s investigation by giving such information
and assistance (including access to the CompanyÂ’s premises and personnel and
the right to examine and copy any accounts, documents or records) as the
Indemnifying Party or any of its professional advisors may reasonably request.
If the Indemnifying Party does not so respond within such 30-day period, the
Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have rejected such claim, in which case
the Indemnified Party shall be free to pursue such remedies as may be
available to the Indemnified Party on the terms and subject to the
provisions of this Agreement.

Section 8.06 Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. All indemnification
payments made under this Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment to the
Closing Consideration Amount for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by
applicable Law.

 



-50- Section 8.07 Exclusive Remedies. Subject to Section 10.11, the
parties acknowledge and agree that their sole and exclusive remedy with
respect to any and all claims (other than claims arising from fraud on the
part of a party hereto in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement) for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant,
agreement or obligation set forth herein or otherwise relating to the subject
matter of this Agreement, shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions
set forth in this Article VIII. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party
hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted under Law, any and all rights,
claims and causes of action for any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant, agreement or obligation set forth herein or otherwise relating to
the subject matter of this Agreement (including any rights, claims and causes
of action under Environmental Law) it may have against the other parties
hereto and their Affiliates and each of their respective Representatives
arising under or based upon any Law, except pursuant to the indemnification
provisions set forth in this Article VIII. Nothing in this Section 8.07 shall
limit any PersonÂ’s right to seek and obtain any equitable relief to which any
Person shall be entitled pursuant to Section 10.11 or to seek any remedy on
account of fraud by any party hereto.

the words "without limitation"; (b) the word "or" is not exclusive; and (c)
the words "herein," "hereof," "hereby," "hereto" and "hereunder" refer to

Articles and Sections of, and Disclosure Schedules and Exhibits attached to,
this Agreement; (y) to an agreement, instrument or other document means such
agreement, instrument or other document as amended, supplemented and modified
from time to time to the extent permitted by the provisions thereof; and (z)

requiring construction or interpretation against the party drafting an

and Exhibits referred to herein shall be construed with, and as an integral
part of, this Agreement to the same extent as if they were set forth verbatim
herein.

 

Section 10.04 Headings. The headings in this Agreement are for reference only
and shall not affect the interpretation of this Agreement.

Section 10.05 Severability. If any term or provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of
this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in
any other jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner
in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as
originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

 

Section 10.06 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the sole and entire agreement of the parties to this
Agreement with respect to the subject matter contained herein and therein, and
supersede all prior and contemporaneous representations, warranties,
understandings and agreements, both written and oral, with respect to such
subject matter. In the event of any inconsistency between the statements in
the body of this Agreement, the Exhibits and Disclosure Schedules (other than
an exception set forth in the Disclosure Schedules), the statements in the
body of this Agreement will control.

Section 10.07 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Neither party may assign its rights or
obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other party,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. No assignment
shall relieve the assigning party of any of its obligations hereunder.

Section 10.08 No Third-party Beneficiaries. Except as provided in Section
6.06 and Article VIII, this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns and nothing
herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
Person or entity any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

 



-54- Section 10.09 Amendment and Modification; Waiver. This Agreement may only be
amended, modified or supplemented by an agreement in writing signed by each
party hereto. No waiver by any party of any of the provisions hereof shall be
effective unless explicitly set forth in writing and signed by the party so
waiving. No waiver by any party shall operate or be construed as a waiver in
respect of any failure, breach or default not expressly identified by such
written waiver, whether of a similar or different character, and whether
occurring before or after that waiver. No failure to exercise, or delay in
exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege arising from this Agreement
shall operate or be construed as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude
any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right,
remedy, power or privilege.

 

Section 10.10 Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
internal laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or
conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any
other jurisdiction).

(b) ANY LEGAL SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR BASED UPON THIS
AGREEMENT, THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY MAY BE INSTITUTED IN THE FEDERAL COURTS OF THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA OR THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE IN EACH CASE LOCATED IN THE
COUNTY OF NEW CASTLE, AND EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE EXCLUSIVE
JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS IN ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING. SERVICE OF
PROCESS, SUMMONS, NOTICE OR OTHER DOCUMENT BY MAIL TO SUCH PARTYÂ’S ADDRESS
SET FORTH HEREIN SHALL BE EFFECTIVE SERVICE OF PROCESS FOR ANY SUIT, ACTION OR
OTHER PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT. THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY OBJECTION TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY
SUIT, ACTION OR ANY PROCEEDING IN SUCH COURTS AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVE AND AGREE
NOT TO PLEAD OR CLAIM IN ANY SUCH COURT THAT ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR
PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT
FORUM.

 

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES AND, THEREFORE, EACH SUCH PARTY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT
OF ANY LEGAL ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE
OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR
THEREBY. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO
REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER IN THE
EVENT OF A LEGAL ACTION, (B) SUCH PARTY HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF
THIS WAIVER, (C) SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) SUCH PARTY

specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity.

each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall be
deemed to be one and the same agreement. A signed copy of this Agreement
delivered by facsimile, e-mail or other means of electronic transmission shall
