AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (as hereinafter amended, modified or changed
from time to time in accordance with the terms hereof, this "Agreement"),
dated as of July 29, 2016, is by and among Energy Future Holdings Corp., a
Texas corporation (the "Company"), Energy Future Intermediate Holding Company
LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("EFIH"), NextEra Energy, Inc., a
Florida corporation ("Parent"), and EFH Merger Co., LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company and direct wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub").

RECITALS

WHEREAS, on April 29, 2014, the Company and certain entities in which it,
directly or indirectly, holds an equity interest, including TCEH and EFCH
(each as defined below) and their respective Subsidiaries (as defined below)
(collectively, the "Debtors") commenced voluntary cases under chapter 11 of
title 11 of the United States Code, 11 U.S.C. § 101 et seq. (as amended, the
"Bankruptcy Code") in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of
Delaware (the "Bankruptcy Court"), which cases are currently pending before
the Honorable Christopher S. Sontchi and jointly administered for procedural
purposes only under Case No. 14-10979, and any proceedings relating thereto
(collectively, the "Chapter 11 Cases");

WHEREAS, the Debtors continue to operate their respective businesses as
debtors-in-possession under Sections 1107(a) and 1108 of the Bankruptcy Code;

WHEREAS, the Company, EFIH, Parent and the other parties thereto, entered into
the Plan Support Agreement dated as of the date hereof (the "Plan Support
Agreement"), pursuant to which each of the parties thereto has agreed, among
other things, to support the Plan of Reorganization (as defined below);

WHEREAS, under the Plan of Reorganization (as defined below), prior to the
Effective Time (as defined below), the EFH Debtors and EFIH Debtors (as such
terms are defined in the Plan of Reorganization) (collectively, the "E-Side
Debtors"), on the one hand, and the TCEH Debtors (as such term is defined in
the Plan of Reorganization), on the other, will have been separated from
common ownership under the Company, subject to the terms of this Agreement and
the Plan of Reorganization;

WHEREAS, subject to approval of this Agreement by the Bankruptcy Court, the
Company, EFIH, Parent and Merger Sub have determined to engage in a strategic
business combination as more fully set forth below;

WHEREAS, the Debtors will file an amended Chapter 11 plan of reorganization,
as provided in the Plan Support Agreement and attached hereto as Exhibit A (as
such plan may be further amended, modified or changed from time to time in
accordance with the terms and conditions thereof and the Plan Support
Agreement, the "Plan of Reorganization");

WHEREAS, under the Plan of Reorganization, on or before the TCEH Effective
Date (as defined below), Texas Competitive Electric Holdings Company LLC, a
Delaware limited



9 

liability company and a wholly owned, indirect subsidiary of the Company
("TCEH"), and the other TCEH Debtors, together with certain other direct and
indirect Subsidiaries of the Company identified in the Plan of Reorganization,
shall be restructured in a transaction intended to qualify as a reorganization
under Section 368(a)(1)(G) and 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "Code") and a taxable transfer of certain assets to a separate
subsidiary of Reorganized TCEH (the "Preferred Stock Entity") in the Preferred
Stock Sale (as defined below) (the steps in this clause, collectively, the
"Reorganized TCEH Spin-Off").

WHEREAS, TCEH formed a new wholly-owned subsidiary, TEX Energy LLC
("Reorganized TCEH"), that (a) will be treated as disregarded from the Company
for U.S. federal income tax purposes until the date on which the Reorganized
TCEH Spin-Off is consummated (the "TCEH Effective Date") and (b) will be the
"controlled corporation" in connection with the Reorganized TCEH Spin-Off. New
Holdco (as defined below) will be treated as disregarded from the Company for
U.S. federal income tax purposes until the TCEH Effective Date, pursuant to
which certain assets of TCEH and the Company will be transferred to New Holdco
in connection with the Preferred Stock Sale.

WHEREAS, on the TCEH Effective Date, all claims against the TCEH Debtors,
except for liabilities assumed by Reorganized TCEH or a subsidiary thereof
pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, will be cancelled in connection with
the Reorganized TCEH Spin-Off.

WHEREAS, (a) TCEH will transfer all of TCEH's interests in its Subsidiaries
(excluding the stock of TCEH Finance, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("TCEH
Finance")) to Reorganized TCEH (the "TCEH Contribution"); and (b) the EFH
Debtors will transfer to Reorganized TCEH the equity interests in EFH
Corporate Services Company ("EFH Corporate Services"), EFH Properties Company
and the other Subsidiaries of EFH specified in the Plan of Reorganization and
the Separation Agreement (as defined below), and will also contribute certain
other assets and liabilities related to the TCEH Debtors' operations, all as
provided in the Plan of Reorganization and the Separation Agreement (as
defined below) (such entities, together with TCEH and Reorganized TCEH and

Stakeholders shall, notwithstanding the foregoing, continue to have the right
to receive such cash consideration (if any) to be paid out in accordance with
the Plan of Reorganization. All of the Shares, when so converted (including if
a Share is converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration having no
value), shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled
and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate that immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented a Share (each a "Certificate") and
each holder of a Share held in uncertificated book-entry form (the "Book-Entry
Shares") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive the Class A Stock Consideration or Class B Stock Consideration
(including any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be
issued or paid in consideration therefor in accordance with Section 4.2(g)),
as applicable, upon delivery of a fully completed and validly executed letter
of transmittal and, in

20 

the case of certificated Shares, upon the surrender of such Certificate(s) and
at the times provided in this Agreement or the Plan of Reorganization.

(b) Merger Sub. Each membership interest in Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one
(1) membership interest unit in the Surviving Company, which shall be held by
Parent, and shall constitute the only issued and outstanding limited liability
company membership interests of the Surviving Company.

Section 4.2 Exchange of Certificates.

(a) Exchange Agent. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall enter into an
exchange agent agreement with an exchange agent selected by Parent with the
Company's prior approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) (the "Exchange Agent"). The Exchange Agent shall act
as exchange agent, registrar and transfer agent for the purpose of exchanging
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, for the Merger Consideration applicable
thereto. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the
Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Shares immediately prior to
the Effective Time, for exchange in accordance with this Article IV, a
sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock to issue the aggregate
Stock Consideration. All such Parent Common Stock deposited with the Exchange
Agent is hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund".

(b) Exchange Procedures. As soon as reasonably practicable after entry of the
EFH Confirmation Order (as defined below) and in any event not later than the
third (3rd) Business Day following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Book-Entry
Share that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding
Shares, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to such Certificates and Book-Entry
Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares, as applicable, to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and
have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably specify)
and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares in exchange for whole shares of Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to Section 4.2(g). Upon surrender of a Certificate
or Book-Entry Share for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (as promptly as
possible but in any event within three (3) Business Days following such
surrender) that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be
in uncertificated book-entry form through a direct registration system unless
a physical certificate is requested), that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article IV and cash in lieu of any
fractional share of Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 4.2(g), and
each Certificate or Book Entry Share so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, the proper number of shares
of Parent Common Stock may be issued to



21 

a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate or Book-Entry
Share so surrendered is registered if such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the
Person requesting such issuance shall pay any transfer or other taxes required
by reason of the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock to a Person other
than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share or
establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid
or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
4.2(b), each Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time
after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender the Merger Consideration applicable thereto, which the holder
thereof has the right to receive in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, including, for the
avoidance of doubt, cash in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common
Stock payable as part of the Merger Consideration applicable thereto, in
accordance with Section 4.2(g), together with any unpaid dividends or
distributions thereon with a record date on or after the Effective Time
payable at such time in accordance with Section 4.2(k). No interest shall be
paid or will accrue on the Merger Consideration or any cash payable to holders
of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to the provisions of this
Article IV. The portion of the Merger Consideration receivable by any holder
of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be aggregated with respect to all
Shares held by such holder immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
following such aggregation, the Exchange Agent shall determine the number of
whole and fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled for purposes of this Article IV.

(c) Transfers. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers
on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Company of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificate or Book-Entry Share is presented to the Surviving
Company, Parent or the Exchange Agent for transfer, it shall be cancelled and
exchanged for the Merger Consideration applicable thereto to which the holder
thereof is entitled pursuant to and in accordance with this Article IV,
together with any unpaid dividends or distributions thereon with a record date
on or after the Effective Time payable at such time in accordance with Section
4.2(k).

(d) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary
amount and upon such terms as may be required by Parent as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Company with respect to
such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will treat such Person as having
delivered his, her or its Certificate for purposes of Section 4.2(b).

(e) Withholding Rights. Each of Parent and the Surviving Company shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any
other applicable state, local or foreign Tax (as defined below) Law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Company or Parent, as the
case may be, such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by Parent or the
Surviving Company, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity,

22 

and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made
by the Surviving Company or Parent, as the case may be.

(f) No Further Ownership Rights in the Shares. After the Merger, no dividends
or other distributions with respect to capital stock of the Surviving Company
with a record date on or after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder
of any un-surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Shares. The shares of Parent
Common Stock issued, and cash paid (if any), in accordance with the terms of
this Article IV upon the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as
applicable, and delivery of a duly completed and validly executed letter of
transmittal, including any cash paid pursuant to Section 4.2(g), shall be
deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

(g) Fractional Shares.

(i) No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, no dividend or
distribution by Parent shall relate to such fractional share of Parent Common
Stock and such fractional share of Parent Common Stock shall not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a shareholder of Parent but, in lieu
thereof, each holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be
entitled to a cash payment in accordance with the provisions of this Section
4.2(g).

(ii) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, the Exchange
Agent shall determine the excess of (A) the number of whole shares of Parent
Common Stock delivered to the Exchange Agent by Parent pursuant to Section
4.2(a) representing the EFH Stock Consideration over (B) the aggregate number
of whole shares of Parent Common Stock to be distributed to former holders of
Shares pursuant to Section 4.2(b) (such excess being herein called the "Excess
Shares"). Following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall, on behalf of
former shareholders of the Company, sell the Excess Shares at then-prevailing
prices on the NYSE all in the manner provided in Section 4.2(g)(iii). The
parties hereto acknowledge that payment of the cash consideration in lieu of
issuing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock was not separately bargained
for consideration but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes
of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Parent that would otherwise be
caused by the issuance of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock.

(iii) The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent shall be executed on
the NYSE through one or more member firms of the NYSE and shall be executed in
round lots to the extent practicable. The Exchange Agent shall use reasonable
efforts to complete the sale of the Excess Shares as promptly as practicable
following the Effective Time, in the Exchange Agent's sole judgment,
consistent with obtaining the best execution of such sales in light of
prevailing market conditions. Until the net proceeds of such sale or sales
have been distributed to the holders of Certificates formerly representing
Shares or Book-

23 

Entry Shares, the Exchange Agent shall hold such proceeds in trust for such
holders (the "Common Shares Trust"). The Surviving Company shall pay all
commissions, transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction costs,
including the expenses and compensation of the Exchange Agent incurred in
connection with such sale of the Excess Shares. The Exchange Agent shall
determine the portion of the Common Shares Trust to which each former holder
of Shares is entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount of the aggregate net
proceeds composing the Common Shares Trust by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such former
holder of Shares would otherwise be entitled pursuant to Section 4.1(a) and
the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock to which all former holders of Shares would otherwise be
entitled pursuant to Section 4.1(a).

(iv) As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if
any, to be paid to holders of Certificates formerly representing Shares or
Book-Entry Shares with respect to any fractional share of Parent Common Stock,
the Exchange Agent shall pay such amounts to such holders of Certificates
formerly representing Shares or Book-Entry Shares, without interest, subject
to and in accordance with the terms of Section 4.2(b).

(h) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund or Common
Shares Trust that remains undistributed for one hundred eighty (180) days
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any
holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who have not theretofore
complied with this Article IV shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment
of their portion of the Merger Consideration (including any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock) and any dividends or distributions
with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date on or after the
Effective Time.

(i) No Liability. None of Parent, the Company, EFIH, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Company or the Exchange Agent or any of their respective directors, officers,
employees, representatives and agents shall be liable to any Person in respect
of any shares of Parent Common Stock, any unpaid dividends or distributions
with respect thereto with a record date after the Effective Time or any cash
in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, in each case delivered to
a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall not have been
surrendered prior to the earlier of (i) any time set forth in the terms of the
Plan of Reorganization and (ii) five (5) years after the Effective Time (or
immediately prior to such earlier date on which any portion of the Stock
Consideration (including any cash in lieu of fractional shares payable to a
holder of such Certificate formerly representing Shares or Book-Entry Shares
pursuant to this Article IV) or any dividends or distributions payable with a
record date on or after the Effective Time with respect to any shares of
Parent Common Stock comprising the Stock Consideration, would escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Entity), any such Stock Consideration,
dividends, and cash shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,



24 

become the property of the Surviving Company, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(j) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash in
the Exchange Fund or Common Shares Trust as directed by Parent in (i) short-
term obligations of the United States of America (the "U.S."), (ii) short-term
obligations for which the full faith and credit of the U.S. is pledged to
provide for the payment of principal and interest and/or (iii) short-term
commercial paper rated the highest quality by each of Moody's Investors
Service Inc. and Standard and Poor's Ratings Service. Any interest and other
income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent, which shall
also be responsible for any tax on such income. Parent shall promptly replace
any cash held in the Exchange Fund or Common Shares Trust with the Exchange
Agent lost through any investment made pursuant to this Section 4.2(j).

(k) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. After the Merger, no
dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock
with a record date on or after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder
of any un-surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Shares until such Certificate
or Book-Entry Shares is surrendered for exchange in accordance with this
Article IV. Subject to the effect of applicable Law, following surrender of
any such Certificate or Book Entry Shares, there shall be issued and/or paid
to the holder of the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange
therefor, without interest, at the time of such surrender, any unpaid
dividends or other distributions with a record date on or after the Effective
Time theretofore payable with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock.

Section 4.3 Adjustments to Prevent Dilution. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of (i) the Effective Time
and (ii) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VIII,
the outstanding shares of Reorganized EFH Common Stock are changed into a
different number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination,
consolidation or exchange of shares, or any similar event occurs, then any
number or amount contained herein which is based upon the number of shares of
Reorganized EFH Common Stock will be appropriately adjusted.

effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to
other entities engaged in the relevant business in Texas or other relevant

as the Plan of Reorganization relates to the E-Side Debtors) shall not

(b) Capital Structure.

(i) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 2,000,000,000
shares of common stock no par value, of the Company (the "EFH Common Stock")
of which 1,669,861,379.02 shares of EFH Common Stock are outstanding as of the

issuance of shares of Reorganized EFH Common Stock in connection with the
Issuance, such shares of Reorganized EFH Common Stock will be duly authorized,

or exercisable for, or giving any Person a right to subscribe for or acquire,
any equity securities of the Company, the reorganized Company or any of their
Subsidiaries, and no securities or obligations evidencing such rights are
authorized, issued or outstanding.

(ii) Except as set forth on Section 5.1(b)(ii) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, none of the Subsidiaries of the Company own any shares of EFH Common
Stock. Section 5.1(b)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a list
of the Company's Subsidiaries and the Company's and each other Person's equity
interests in such Subsidiaries. Except as set forth on Section 5.1(b)(ii) of
the Company Disclosure Letter, each of the outstanding shares of capital stock
or other equity securities of each of the Company's Subsidiaries is duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, in the case of
capital stock, and, in the case of equity securities that are not capital
stock, the owners of such equity securities have no obligation to make capital
contributions or other payments with respect to such equity securities under
the organizational or governing documents of the applicable Subsidiary of the
Company or under applicable Law or to make payments to creditors of the
applicable Subsidiary of the Company solely by reason of ownership of such
equity securities. Except as set forth on Section 5.1(b)(ii) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, the ownership interests in each Subsidiary is owned by the

facility and restrictions on transfer arising under applicable securities
laws. Except as set forth on Section 5.1(b)(ii) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into any
commitment, arrangement or agreement, or are otherwise obligated, to
contribute capital, loan money or otherwise provide funds or make additional
investments in any other Person, other than any such commitment, arrangement
or agreement with respect to, direct or indirect, wholly owned Subsidiaries of
the Company or pursuant to a Contract (as defined below) binding on the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and set forth in Section 5.1(b)(ii) of the
Company Disclosure Letter. For purposes of this Agreement, a "wholly owned
Subsidiary" shall include any Subsidiary of the Company (or Parent) of which
all of the shares of capital stock or other equity interests are owned by the
Company (or Parent) or one or more wholly owned Subsidiaries of the Company
(or Parent), as applicable.

(iii) Except as set forth in Section 5.1(b)(iii) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, there are no shareholder agreements, voting trusts or other agreements
or understandings to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party
or by which any of the foregoing is bound relating to the voting or
registration of any equity securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

(iv) Except with respect to the right to vote on a plan of reorganization of
the Debtors under the Bankruptcy Code in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases,
no bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries having the right to vote on any matters on which equity holders
of the Company or its Subsidiaries may vote, are issued or outstanding.

(c) Corporate Authority. Each of the Company and EFIH has all requisite
corporate or limited liability company, as applicable, power and authority and
has taken all corporate or limited liability company, as applicable, action
necessary in order to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Closing Date
Transactions and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each of the Company and EFIH
and subject only to entry of the Approval Order (as defined below),
constitutes a valid and binding agreement of each of the Company and EFIH and
no vote or consent of any equity holder of the Company or EFIH, or any other
corporate or limited liability company action, is necessary to approve this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby on behalf of the Company and
EFIH (other than the requisite votes for approval of the Plan of
Reorganization under the Bankruptcy Code). This Agreement is enforceable
against each of the Company and EFIH in accordance with its terms subject to
entry of the Approval Order. The Board of Directors of the Company (the
"Company Board") has taken all action so that neither Parent nor Merger Sub
will be an "affiliated shareholder" (as such term is defined in Section 21.602
of the TBOC) or prohibited from entering into or consummating a "business
combination" (as such term is defined in Section 21.604 of the TBOC) with the
Company as a result of the execution of this Agreement or the consummation of

(iii) Except as set forth on Section 5.1(e)(iii) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, the Company maintains internal control over financial reporting (as
defined in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable, under the Exchange Act). Such
internal control over financial reporting is effective in providing reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, in each
case, in each case, in all material respects. Except as has not had,
individually or in the aggregate, a material effect on the nature or
reliability of the information disclosed in the Company's periodic reports
filed under the Exchange Act,



33

known to it, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in its internal controls over financial
reporting.

relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate,
including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or
Person, on the other hand) or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined
in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), where the result, purpose or

Person, trade or business that, together with the Company, is or was treated
as a single-employer within the meaning of Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of
the Code or Section 4001(b) of ERISA ("ERISA Affiliate") has, during any time

Plan or Multiemployer Plan that would reasonably be expected to result in
material liability to Parent or the Oncor Entities (other than the EFH
Retirement Plan and the Oncor Retirement Plan) after the Closing. Since the
Applicable Date, no ERISA Event (as defined below) has occurred or is
reasonably expected to occur with respect to any Assumed Pension Plan or the

(v) There is no material pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened claims, actions, suits, court or Governmental Entity proceedings,
and arbitrations relating to the Assumed Plans, other than routine claims for
benefits, that would reasonably be expected to result in material liability to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or to Parent. There are no pending or,
to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened audits or investigations



38 

by any Governmental Entity involving any Assumed Plan that would reasonably be
expected to result in material liability to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or to Parent.

(vi) Except for any payments made at or prior to the Effective Time, none of
the execution of this Agreement, the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, nor a termination or resignation of employment
following the Effective Time will result in an obligation of Parent or the
Surviving Company after the Effective Time with respect to any Non-Oncor
Employee to severance pay or any material increase in severance pay. Except as
set forth in Section 5.1(h)(vi) of the Company Disclosure Letter, neither the
execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions

compensation insurance.

employees and other participants who are eligible participants under the
written terms of such Assumed Plan.

indemnification or advancement of expenses, neither Parent nor the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries will have any obligations or liabilities with respect
to any employees of Reorganized TCEH or its Subsidiaries or the Contributed

set forth in reasonable detail in Parent's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2015, Parent's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
quarter ended March 31, 2016 and Parent's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed
since December 31, 2015, in each case, filed with the SEC prior to the date
hereof and to the extent the relevance of such disclosure of any item therein
is reasonably apparent from the information disclosed (other than disclosures
in the "Risk Factors" sections thereof or any such disclosures included in
such filings that are cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature) (it
being agreed that such disclosures shall not be exceptions to Section 5.2(a)
and 5.2(d)(i)), or in the disclosure letter delivered to the Company by Parent
prior to entering into this Agreement (the "Parent Disclosure Letter") (it



51 

being agreed that disclosure of any item in any section or subsection of the
Parent Disclosure Letter shall be deemed disclosure with respect to any other
section or subsection of the Parent Disclosure Letter to which the relevance
of such item is reasonably apparent from the information disclosed, provided
that no such disclosure shall be deemed to qualify Section 5.2(f), unless
expressly set forth in Section 5.2(f), of the Parent Disclosure Letter)),
Parent and Merger Sub each hereby represent and warrant to the Company and
EFIH, as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date, that:

(a) Organization, Good Standing and Qualification. Each of Parent and Merger
Sub is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization and has all
requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and operate
its properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted
and is qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign
corporation in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of
its assets or properties or conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except where the failure to be so organized, qualified or in
such good standing, or to have such power or authority, has not had and would
not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect
(as defined below). Parent has made available to the Company a complete and
correct copy of the certificate of formation and operating agreement or
comparable governing documents of each of Parent and Merger Sub, each as
amended through the date hereof.

(b) Capital Structure.

(i) The authorized capital stock of Parent consists of 800,000,000 shares of
Parent Common Stock, of which 461,995,594 shares of Parent Common Stock were
issued and outstanding as of the date hereof and 100,000,000 shares of Serial
Preferred Stock, none of which is issued or outstanding on the date hereof.
All of the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock have been duly authorized
and are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. As of the date hereof,
other than up to 4,600,000 shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to
the (A) terms of outstanding awards under employee incentive awards for
employees of Parent, or (B) pursuant to this Agreement, there were no options
to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock issued and outstanding. Except as
set forth in this Section 5.2(b) there are no preemptive or other outstanding
rights, options, warrants, conversion rights, stock appreciation rights,
performance units, redemption rights, repurchase rights, agreements,
arrangements, calls, commitments or rights of any kind that obligate Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries to issue or sell any shares of capital stock or other
equity securities of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any securities or
obligations convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for, or giving any
Person a right to subscribe for or acquire, any equity securities of Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries, and no securities or obligations evidencing such
rights are authorized, issued or outstanding except in connection with the
Merger.

(ii) Upon any issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to this
Agreement, such shares of Parent Common Stock will be duly authorized,



52 

validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, approved for listing on the
NYSE, subject only to official notice of issuance, and freely saleable and not
subject to any resale restrictions except to the extent such restrictions are
due to the status of the holder thereof.

(c) Corporate Authority. No vote of holders of capital stock of Parent is
necessary to approve this Agreement, the Oncor Letter Agreement, the Closing
Date Transactions, or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate or limited liability
company, as applicable, power and authority and has taken all corporate or
limited liability company, as applicable, action necessary in order to
execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Oncor
Letter Agreement and any other agreement contemplated herein to be entered
into by Parent or Merger Sub. This Agreement, the Plan Support Agreement and
the Oncor Letter Agreement have been duly executed and delivered by each of
Parent and Merger Sub and each constitutes a valid and binding obligation of
Parent and Merger Sub. This Agreement and the Oncor Letter Agreement are
enforceable against each of Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its
terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.

(d) Governmental Filings; No Violations; Etc.

(i) Other than the Vermont Insurance Approval, FERC Approval, the PUCT
Approval, the FCC Approval, and filings in respect thereof and the filings
and/or notices (A) pursuant to Section 1.5, (B) required as a result of facts
or circumstances solely attributable to the Company or its Subsidiaries, a
direct or indirect change of control thereof, or the operation of their
businesses, (C) under the HSR Act and (D) under the Securities Act with
respect to any registration statement to be filed with the SEC on Form S-4
(the "Form S-4") or other applicable registration statement in connection with
the issuance by Parent of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to this
Agreement, (E) under the Exchange Act, (F) under any securities or "blue sky"
laws of any jurisdiction in connection with the issuance by Parent of Parent
Common Stock issuable pursuant to this Agreement, and (G) with the NYSE in
connection with the listing by Parent on the NYSE of the shares of Parent
Common Stock issuable pursuant to this Agreement (other than those items set
forth in clauses (A) and (B), all such approvals being collectively the
"Parent Approvals"), no notices, reports or other filings are required to be
made by Parent or Merger Sub with, nor are any consents, registrations,
approvals, permits or authorizations required to be obtained by Parent or
Merger Sub from, the Bankruptcy Court or any Governmental Entity in connection
with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and
Merger Sub and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Closing Date
Transactions and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except
those the failure of which to make or obtain has not had and would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.





53 



(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and
Merger Sub do not, and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, constitute
or result in (A) a breach or violation of, or a default under, the certificate
of incorporation, certificate of formation or bylaws or comparable governing
documents of Parent or Merger Sub or the comparable governing instruments of
any of Parent's Subsidiaries; (B) with or without notice, lapse of time or
both, a breach or violation of, a termination (or right of termination) or a
default under, the creation or acceleration of any obligations or the creation
of a Lien on any of the assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant
to, any Contracts binding upon Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any Laws
or governmental or non-governmental permit or license to which Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries is subject; (C) any change in the rights or obligations of
any party under any such Contracts; or (D) assuming compliance with the
matters referred to in Section 5.2(d)(i), a violation of any Law to which
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is subject, except, in the case of clause
(B), (C) or (D) above, for any breach, violation, termination, default,
creation, acceleration or change that has not had and would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(e) Parent Reports; Financial Statements.

(i) Parent has filed or furnished, as applicable, on a timely basis, all
forms, statements, certifications, reports and other documents (including
exhibits, financial statements and schedules thereto, and other information
incorporated therein) required to be filed or furnished by it with the SEC
pursuant to the Exchange Act or the Securities Act or any Contract governing
any indebtedness of Parent requiring such filings to be made since the
Applicable Date (the forms, statements, certifications, reports and documents
filed or furnished since the Applicable Date and those filed or furnished
subsequent to the date hereof, including any amendments thereto, the "Parent
Reports"). Each of the Parent Reports, including any financial statements or
schedules included therein, at the time of its filing or being furnished
complied or, if not yet filed or furnished, will comply in all material
respects with the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act applicable to the Parent Reports. As of their respective
dates (or, if amended prior to, or after, the date hereof, as of the date of
such amendment), the Parent Reports filed with or furnished to the SEC prior
to the date hereof did not, and any Parent Reports filed with or furnished to
the SEC subsequent to the date hereof will not, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they were made, not misleading. There are no
outstanding or unresolved comments received from the SEC staff with respect to
the Parent Reports. None of the Parent Reports is, to the knowledge of Parent,
the subject of ongoing SEC review.



54 



(ii) Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by
reference into the Parent Reports as amended prior to the date hereof
(including the related notes and schedules) fairly presents in all material
respects, or, in the case of Parent Reports filed after the date hereof, will
fairly present in all material respects the financial position of Parent and
its consolidated Subsidiaries as of its date (and if amended, as of the date
of the last such amendment prior to the date hereof) and each of the
statements of consolidated income, comprehensive income, cash flows and
shareholders' equity included in or incorporated by reference into the Parent
Reports (including any related notes and schedules), as finally amended prior
to the date hereof, fairly presents in all material respects, or in the case
of Parent Reports filed after the date hereof, will fairly present in all
material respects the financial position, results of operations and cash
flows, as the case may be, of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries for the
periods set forth therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to
notes and normal year-end adjustments), in each case in accordance with GAAP,
except as may be noted therein.

(iii) Parent maintains internal control over financial reporting (as defined
in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable, under the Exchange Act). Such
internal control over financial reporting is effective in providing reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, in each
case, in all material respects. Except as has not had, or would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material effect on
the nature or reliability of the information disclosed in Parent's periodic
reports filed under the Exchange Act, (A) Parent maintains disclosure controls
and procedures required by Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that
are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Parent is
recorded and reported on a timely basis to the individuals responsible for the
preparation of Parent's filings with the SEC and other public disclosure
documents (including Parent's chief executive officer and chief financial
officer) and (B) Parent has not disclosed, and is not required to disclose,
based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date of this Agreement, to
Parent's outside auditors and the audit committee of Parent's board of
directors, and has not had, (1) any significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that are
reasonably likely to adversely affect Parent's ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information and (2) any fraud, known to Parent,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in Parent's internal controls over financial reporting.

(iv) Except as has not had and would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, each of Parent and its
Subsidiaries is in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither Parent
nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has a commitment to become a
party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet partnership or any similar
Contract or arrangement (including any

55 

Contract or arrangement relating to any transaction or relationship between or
among Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any
unconsolidated Affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or
limited purpose entity or Person, on the other hand) or any "off-balance sheet
arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), where
the result, purpose or effect of such Contract or arrangement is to avoid
disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material liabilities of,
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in the Parent Reports or the financial
statements included therein.

(f) Absence of Certain Changes. Since December 31, 2015, there has not
occurred a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether
accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise), other than liabilities and
obligations (A) set forth in Parent's consolidated balance sheet as of
December 31, 2015, including the notes thereto, included in the Company
Reports, (B) incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice since December 31, 2015, (C) incurred in connection with the Closing
Date Transactions or any other transaction or agreement contemplated by this
Agreement, (D) pursuant to any Contract that would be required to be filed by
Parent as a "material contract" (as such term is defined in item 601(b)(10) of
Regulation S-K of the Securities Act, except for any such Contract that is a
Benefit Plan) or that was or is material to the business, operations or
financial condition of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (but not
including any liability for breach thereunder), or (E) that has not had and
would not have, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.

For purposes of this Agreement "Parent Material Adverse Effect" means (i) any
fact, event, change, effect, development, circumstance or occurrence that,
individually or together with all other facts, events, changes, effects,
developments, circumstances or occurrences, has had or would reasonably be
expected to have a material and adverse effect on, or change in, the financial
condition, business, assets, liabilities or results of operations of Parent
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (for the avoidance of doubt any
reference in any provision hereof to any item that "would have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect", or any similar phrase, shall be interpreted as
"individually or in the aggregate, has had or would be reasonably expected to
have, a Parent Material Adverse Effect" (and such interpretation shall extend
to the negative expression of such phrase, or any similar phrase, mutatis
mutandis), or (ii) anything that prevents, materially restricts, or materially
impairs Parent or Merger Sub from consummating the Closing Date Transactions;
provided, however, that, none of the following shall constitute or be taken
into account in determining whether there has been or is a Parent Material
Adverse Effect:

(i) (x) changes or developments in general economic or political conditions or
the securities, credit or financial markets, in general, globally or outside
of or in the U.S. or in the State of Texas or (y) changes that are the result
of acts of war or terrorism or any hurricane, tornado, tsunami, flood,
earthquake or other natural disaster or other weather-related event,
circumstance or development (other than such acts of war or terrorism or any
hurricane, tornado, tsunami, flood, earthquake or other natural disaster or
other weather-related event,

56 

circumstance or development that cause any physical damage or destruction to
or render physically or operationally unusable any facility or property of
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries);

(ii) any adoption, implementation, promulgation, repeal, modification,
reinterpretation or proposal of any rule, regulation, ordinance, order,
protocol or any other Law of or by any national, regional, state or local
regulatory Governmental Entity (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the
RTOs);

(iii) changes or developments generally affecting electric transmission or
distribution systems (other than changes or developments that render
operationally unusable any facility or property of Parent or Merger Sub or any
of their respective Subsidiaries);

(iv) changes or developments that are the result of factors generally
affecting any industry in which Parent or its Subsidiaries operate;

(v) any loss or threatened loss of, or adverse change or threatened adverse
change in, the relationship of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries with its
customers, employees, regulators, financing sources or suppliers to the extent
caused by the pendency or the announcement of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or Plan of Reorganization;

(vi) changes, effects or developments to the extent relating to the entry into
this Agreement, the performance of actions or obligations required to be taken
by a party hereunder or consented to in writing by the Company and EFIH,
including any change in Parent's or any of its Subsidiaries' credit ratings to
the extent resulting therefrom;

(vii) changes or developments in GAAP or authoritative interpretation thereof
after the date hereof; and

(viii) any failure by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to meet any internal
or public projections or forecasts or estimates of revenues or earnings for
any period, in and of itself, provided that the exception in this clause shall
not prevent or otherwise affect a determination that any change, effect or
development underlying such failure has resulted in, or contributed to, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect;

provided, further, that (x) facts, events, changes, effects, developments,
circumstances or occurrences set forth in clauses (i) through (iv) above may
be taken into account in determining whether there has been or is a Parent
Material Adverse Effect to the extent such matters, changes, effects or
developments have a disproportionate and adverse effect on Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to other entities engaged in the
relevant business in Texas or other relevant geographic area and (y) any
condition or requirement attached to any order or approval issued by the PUCT,
FERC or FCC that is necessary or was sought in order to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and/or the Plan of Reorganization
(solely as the Plan of Reorganization

57 

relates to the E-Side Debtors) shall not constitute, or be deemed to
contribute, to a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(g) Litigation. There are no civil, criminal or administrative actions, suits,
complaints, enforcement actions, penalty assessments, claims, hearings,
arbitrations, investigations, inquiries, audits or other proceedings (formal
or informal, public or non-public) pending or, to the knowledge of Parent,
threatened in writing against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case
that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. None of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party
to or subject to the provisions of any judgment, settlement, order, writ,
injunction, decree or award of any Governmental Entity specifically imposed
upon Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective businesses,
assets or properties which, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(h) Available Funds. Parent and Merger Sub currently have available to them,
and on or before the Effective Time, will have available to them, (i) all
funds necessary to satisfy Parent's and Merger Sub's obligations to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions required of it by this Agreement,
including funding the Merger Sub Cash Amount, the DIP Repayment and the
payment of all of Parent's and Merger Sub's fees and expenses related to the
foregoing and to satisfy all other payment obligations required to be paid or
satisfied by Parent or Merger Sub in connection therewith, and (ii) the
authority to issue shares of Parent Common Stock necessary to effect the
Merger described in Section 1.4. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree
that the consummation of the DIP and Second Lien Note Repayments, the Merger,
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, is not conditional
upon the receipt by Parent or Merger Sub or availability of the proceeds of
any financing and that any failure by Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the
Merger on the Closing Date (provided that at such time the conditions to the
Closing set forth in Section 7.1 and 7.2 are otherwise satisfied or are to be
satisfied at the Closing), by reason of absence of financing, shall constitute
a breach by Parent and/or Merger Sub of this Agreement.

(i) Merger Sub. All of the issued and outstanding membership interests of
Merger Sub are validly issued and outstanding and are, and at the Effective
Time will be, owned by Parent. Merger Sub has not conducted any business prior
to the date hereof and has no, and prior to the Effective Time will have no,
assets, liabilities or obligations of any nature other than those incident to
its formation and pursuant to this Agreement.

(j) Brokers. No agent, broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to any
brokerage, finder's or other fee or commission in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or
on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for which the Company could have any
liability prior to the Effective Time.

(k) Taxes. Merger Sub is classified as a disregarded entity and as a division
of Parent for federal income tax purposes. Parent is classified as a
corporation for federal income tax purposes. Parent and Merger Sub have not
taken or agreed to take any action, and are not aware of any facts or
circumstances, in each case, that would prevent or

58 

impede, or would reasonably be expected to prevent or impede, the Merger from
qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code.

(l) Regulatory Status. Parent is a public utility holding company under the
Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 ("PUHCA"). Merger Sub is not a
public utility holding company under PUHCA. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is a
public utility under the Federal Power Act.

(m) Oncor Entities. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the ability of the
Company and EFIH to exercise control over the Oncor Entities, or cause the
Oncor Entities to take any action, is limited due to applicable Law and the
provisions set forth in the Oncor Agreements.

(n) Certain Subsidiaries. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that,
for purposes of determining the satisfaction of the condition set forth in
Section 7.2(a), none of the representations and warranties of the Company and
EFIH in this Agreement shall be deemed to be untrue, or fail to be true, due
to the existence of any liability of a Spin-Off Entity or any other Subsidiary
of the Company that will dissolve, liquidate, merge out of existence or be
abandoned in accordance with the Plan of Reorganization and applicable Law, in
each case which will be fully and unconditionally discharged at or prior to
the Effective Time pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization or otherwise.

(o) Disclaimer of Other Representations and Warranties. EACH OF PARENT AND
MERGER SUB (INDIVIDUALLY AND ON BEHALF OF THEIR RESPECTIVE SUBSIDIARIES)
ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT NEITHER THE COMPANY NOR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES
MAKES ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO ANY
MATTER WHATSOEVER EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ONCOR
LETTER AGREEMENT, AS APPLICABLE, OR IN ANY CERTIFICATE DELIVERED BY THE
COMPANY OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES TO PARENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS HEREOF OR
THE ONCOR LETTER AGREEMENT, AND SPECIFICALLY (BUT WITHOUT LIMITING THE
GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING) THAT NEITHER THE COMPANY NOR ANY OF ITS
SUBSIDIARIES MAKES ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY WITH RESPECT TO (X) ANY
PROJECTIONS, ESTIMATES OR BUDGETS OF THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES
DELIVERED OR MADE AVAILABLE TO PARENT (OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS,
DIRECTORS, MANAGERS, EMPLOYEES OR REPRESENTATIVES) OF FUTURE REVENUES, RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS (OR ANY COMPONENT THEREOF), CASH FLOWS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION
(OR ANY COMPONENT THEREOF) OF THE COMPANY AND/OR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES OR
(Y) THE FUTURE BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY AND/OR ANY OF ITS
SUBSIDIARIES.

binding letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, term sheet, agreement
or commitment (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement), that
constitutes an Acquisition Proposal, or requires, or would reasonably be
expected to cause, the Company or EFIH to terminate this Agreement (a "Company
Acquisition Agreement").

(e) Prior to the Company or EFIH, as applicable, terminating this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.3(e) or Section 8.3(f), as the case may be, (A) the
Company shall provide prior written notice to Parent of the submission of any
Acquisition Proposal for which the Company or EFIH is prepared to terminate
this Agreement at least three (3) Business Days prior to terminating this

such Acquisition Proposal, the identity of the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal and a copy of the most current draft of each Company Acquisition
Agreement related thereto ("Company Notice") (it being understood that neither
the Company nor EFIH shall enter into any agreement or commitment which

a condition to the submission of an Acquisition Proposal, from furnishing the
Company Notice), and (B) the Company Board or the board of managers of EFIH,
as the case may be, shall have determined in good faith (in each case, after

and based on advice of such counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal is a
Superior Proposal, and after such three (3)

67 

Business Days the Company Board or the board of managers of EFIH, as the case
may be, may terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.3(e) or Section
8.3(f), as applicable and enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement, if
concurrently with such termination, it determines in its sole discretion after
consultation with its independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel,
and based on advice of such counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal is a
Superior Proposal and, that as a result, the failure to terminate this
Agreement is inconsistent with its fiduciary duties. In determining whether to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.3(e) or Section 8.3(f), the
relevant board shall take into account all changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Parent after the date hereof in response to such a
Company Notice, and any other information deemed relevant or appropriate by
such board. The obligations set forth in this Section 6.2(e) are in addition
to those set forth in the other provisions of this Section 6.2, including for
the avoidance of doubt Section 6.2(f).

(f) Following the entry of the Approval Order, the Company or EFIH shall as
promptly as reasonably practicable (i) and in any event before engaging in, or
continuing, any material discussions with any Person (or its Representatives)
who submits, or has submitted, an Acquisition Proposal, or providing material
information to such Person (or its Representatives), enter into an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement with such Person (to the extent an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement is not already in effect with such Person), and
advise Parent in writing of each such Acquisition Proposal, the material terms
and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal (including any material
changes to such material terms and conditions promptly after receipt thereof)
and provide to Parent a copy of each Company Acquisition Agreement relating to
such Acquisition Proposal and the identity of such Person and its
Representatives; (ii) make available to Parent and Merger Sub any material
information that it or its Representatives make available to each such Person
described in preceding clause (i) or its Representatives which was not
previously made available to Parent or Merger Sub, concurrently with the
making available of such information to such Person or its Representatives;
and (iii) inform Parent and Merger Sub of any material developments with
respect to each Acquisition Proposal described in this sentence. The
obligations set forth in this Section 6.2(f) shall apply with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal submitted before or after the date hereof, and the
Company and EFIH acknowledge and agree that, to the extent an Acquisition
Proposal which meets the requirements for discussions or other actions to
occur as contemplated by this Section 6.2 is submitted by or on behalf of a
Person with whom the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has previously entered
a confidentiality agreement, such obligations set forth in this Section 6.2(f)
may require an amendment to such agreement in order for such Acquisition
Proposal to be pursued by the Company or EFIH. To the extent that Parent or
any of its Affiliates receive the identity of any other potential acquiror
from the Company or EFIH pursuant to this Section 6.2, the recipient thereof
shall maintain the confidentiality of such identity, and shall only share such
identity with its legal advisors for purposes of receiving legal advice.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, during the period
beginning at the date of the entry of the Confirmation Order and continuing
until the earlier of the Termination Date or the Closing Date, the Company and
EFIH and their Representatives shall have the right to: (x) solicit, initiate,
encourage, induce or facilitate

68 

Backup Plan Proposals, including by way of providing access to non-public
information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries to any Person pursuant
to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; (y) enter into, maintain or
continue discussions or negotiations with respect to Backup Plan Proposals or
otherwise cooperate with or assist or participate in, or facilitate any such
inquiries, proposals, discussions or negotiations; and (z) adopt, approve,
recommend, or enter into a definitive agreement with respect to or propose to
adopt, approve, recommend, or enter into a definitive agreement with respect
to (publicly or otherwise) any such Backup Plan Proposal; provided, however,
that the Company and EFIH shall use commercially reasonable efforts (x) to
keep confidential any solicitation, negotiation, facilitation, and
documentation by any Debtor of a Backup Plan Proposal and (y) to enter into
confidentiality agreements with any counterparty to any agreement regarding
support for and/or financing of a Backup Plan Proposal, which confidentiality
agreement provides that the existence and terms of such Backup Plan Proposal
shall be kept confidential and shall not be publicly disclosed, except in each
case to the extent required by applicable Law.

(h) For purposes of this Agreement:

"Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement" means a confidentiality agreement that
contains provisions that are not less favorable in the aggregate to the
Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement and, solely to
the extent executed after the date of this Agreement, does not prohibit the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries from providing information to Parent that
Parent is expressly entitled to receive from the Company in accordance with
this Section 6.2.

"Acquisition Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or offer from or by a
Person (other than Parent or any of its Subsidiaries and their respective

business combination or similar transaction involving the Company and/or one
or more of its Subsidiaries, or (ii) any other transaction involving the
Company and/or one or more of its Subsidiaries which results in the direct or
indirect acquisition of more than 20% of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis or in the direct or indirect acquisition
of more than 20% of the equity interests or voting power of the Company, EFIH
or any of the Oncor Entities provided, however, that a Backup Plan Proposal
(as defined below) shall not constitute an Acquisition Proposal.

"Backup Plan Proposal" means an any inquiry, proposal or offer that (i) would
constitute an Acquisition Proposal (including, for the avoidance of doubt, a
standalone plan of reorganization negotiated with existing creditors of the
Company or EFIH) but for its express exclusion from the definition of
Acquisition Proposal and, (ii) by its terms, contemplates consummation or
closing of such Backup Plan Proposal only after

69 

termination of this Agreement other than a termination arising as a result of
the adoption, approval, recommendation, or entry into a definitive agreement
with respect to such Backup Plan Proposal.

"Superior Proposal" means a bona fide Acquisition Proposal (except that
references to 20% shall be changed to 50%) which the Company Board or the
board of managers EFIH, as the case may be, determines in good faith would, if
consummated, result in a superior transaction to the Company or EFIH, as
applicable, than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement after
consultation with its independent financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, and based on advice of such counsel, and, taking into account (x) the
likelihood and timing of consummation and (y) all material legal, financial
(including the financing terms of any such proposal), conditionality,
regulatory and other aspects of such proposal, in each case as compared to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

the other hand, agree not to schedule, to the extent reasonably practicable,
any substantive meetings or substantive communications with any Governmental
Entity or in pursuit of obtaining any necessary clearances pursuant to the HSR
Act (other than with respect to any governmental approvals relating
exclusively to the Reorganized TCEH Spin-Off, the Reorganized TCEH
Contributions, the Preferred Stock Sale or the Reorganized TCEH Conversion)
regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Plan of
Reorganization (solely as the Plan of Reorganization relates to the E-Side
Debtors) without giving the other party or its Representatives a reasonable
opportunity to participate in such meeting or communication to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Entity and to the extent with respect to
matters involving any of the Applications, unless Parent reasonably believes
that such participation would be imprudent provided that Parent may not
exclude the Company or EFIH from any such meeting or communication if a
Governmental Entity has requested that the Company or EFIH participate, and in
any event the parties hereto shall keep each other reasonably apprised of all
material substantive communications with Governmental Entities (other than
with respect to any governmental approvals relating exclusively to the
Reorganized TCEH Spin-Off, the Reorganized TCEH Contributions, the Preferred
Stock Sale or the Reorganized TCEH Conversion) of which they are aware
regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Plan of
Reorganization (solely as the Plan of Reorganization relates to the E-Side
Debtors). Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company and EFIH, on
the other hand, shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain the PUCT
Approval and the FERC Approval as expeditiously as possible.

(ix) In the event that the Company and Parent agree in writing upon the use of
common counsel or consultants with respect to the negotiation, preparation or
filing of any necessary consent, registration, approval, permits and/or
authorizations under this Section 6.3(a), they shall share equally the fees
and expenses of such counsel and consultants.

(b) Information. Subject to Section 6.3(f), the Company and EFIH, on the one
hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall, upon request by the
other, furnish the other with all information concerning itself, its
Subsidiaries and controlled Affiliates (other than, with respect to the
Company, the Oncor Entities, subject to Section 6.21 and with respect to
Parent, its regulated Subsidiaries and regulated controlled Affiliates),
directors, officers and equityholders and such other matters as may be
reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with any statement, filing,
notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
or any of their respective Subsidiaries (other than the Oncor Entities subject
to Section 6.21 hereof) to or with any Governmental Entity in connection with
the Applications.

(c) Status. Subject to Section 6.3(f) and the instructions of the Bankruptcy
Court or any Governmental Entity, the Company and EFIH, on the one hand, and
Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall keep the other reasonably
apprised of the status

73 

of material matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the Plan of Reorganization (solely as the Plan of
Reorganization relates to the E-Side Debtors), including, upon reasonable
request, promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or other
communications received by Parent or Merger Sub or the Company or EFIH, as the
case may be, or any of their Subsidiaries (other than the Oncor Entities,
subject to Section 6.21), from the Bankruptcy Court or any third party and/or
any Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Plan of Reorganization (solely as the Plan of Reorganization
relates to the E-Side Debtors). The Company and EFIH will also keep Parent
reasonably and regularly advised of the status and progress of, and provide to
Parent any information reasonably requested by Parent regarding, any other
consents of the Bankruptcy Court or any Governmental Entities required in
connection with the implementation and consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Plan of Reorganization that are related to or could
reasonably be expected to affect the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(d) Regulatory Matters. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, without limiting the generality of the other undertakings pursuant
to this Section 6.3, each of the Company and EFIH and Parent and Merger Sub
shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, the
following actions:

(i) the prompt provision to each and every federal, state, local or foreign
court or Governmental Entity (including the FCC, the FERC and the PUCT) with
jurisdiction over any Company Approvals or Parent Approvals of information and
documents reasonably requested by any such court or Governmental Entity or
that are necessary, proper or advisable to permit consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Plan of Reorganization
(solely as the Plan of Reorganization relates to the E-Side Debtors);

(ii) with respect to the HSR Filing, obtaining the expiration or earlier
termination of any waiting period under the HSR Act applicable to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and with respect to the FCC
Approval, the FERC Approval and the PUCT Approval and all other approvals and
consents of a Governmental Entity, obtaining all such necessary approvals and
avoiding the entry or enactment of any permanent, preliminary or temporary
injunction or other order, decree, decision, determination, judgment or Law
that, individually or in the aggregate, would be reasonably likely to prevent,
enjoin or otherwise prohibit, or materially impair, restrain or restrict, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Plan of Reorganization
(solely as the Plan of Reorganization relates to the E-Side Debtors),
including Parent and Merger Sub, subject to the first sentence of the last
paragraph of Section 6.3(e), taking all actions required by, and accepting all
conditions and/or requirements imposed under the terms of any, consent,
registration, order, approval or authorization issued by any Governmental
Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the Plan of Reorganization to the extent that



74 

any such condition or requirement is a Key Regulatory Term or is not otherwise
a Burdensome Condition; and

(iii) in the event that any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction,
decision, order, judgment, determination, decree or Law is entered, issued or
enacted, or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered, issued or enacted,
in any proceeding, review or inquiry of any kind that would make consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Plan of
Reorganization (solely as the Plan of Reorganization relates to the E-Side
Debtors) unlawful or that would prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit, or
materially impair, restrain or restrict, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Plan of Reorganization (solely as the Plan of Reorganization
relates to the E-Side Debtors), vacate, modify, reverse, suspend, prevent,
eliminate, avoid, remove or comply with such actual, anticipated or threatened
injunction, decision, order, judgment, determination, decree or enactment so
as to permit prompt consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(e) Acceptable Conditions. Notwithstanding the obligations set forth in this
Section 6.3 or elsewhere in this Agreement, (A) Parent and Merger Sub shall
not be required to, and (B) the Company, EFIH and their Subsidiaries (other
than the Oncor Entities, subject to Section 6.21) shall not be permitted to,
without the prior written consent of Parent, take any action pursuant to this
Section 6.3 or otherwise if the taking of such efforts or action, individually
or in the aggregate, would result in a Burdensome Condition.

"Burdensome Condition" means any term or condition, order, sanction,
requirement, law, rule or regulation that, individually or in the aggregate,
would, or would be reasonably expected to have a material and adverse effect
on, or change in, the condition (financial or otherwise), business, assets,
liabilities or results of operations (i) of Oncor and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, or (ii) of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as whole; provided
that, for purposes of this clause (ii) Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, shall be deemed to be a consolidated group of entities that is the size
and scale of the Oncor Entities; provided, however, that terms or conditions,
orders, sanctions, requirements, laws, rules or regulations that result in
changes or developments generally affecting electric transmission or
distribution systems in the State of Texas shall not be deemed to be, or
contribute to, a Burdensome Condition (except such changes or developments
affecting electric transmission or distribution systems in the State of Texas
shall be taken into account in determining whether there has been or is a
Burdensome Condition to the extent such changes, or developments have a
disproportionate and adverse effect on Oncor and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (where Parent and its
Subsidiaries, including the Oncor Entities, are deemed to be a consolidated
group of entities that is the size and scale of the Oncor Entities), as
compared to other entities engaged in the relevant business in the State of
Texas); provided, further, that, the approval of any of the Key Regulatory
Terms, or any comparable condition, requirement or similar item that, in each
case, is substantively the same

75 

or results in the same effect as any of the Key Regulatory Terms, by the PUCT
shall not be deemed to be, or contribute to, a Burdensome Condition, but
adverse variations or changes to any of the Key Regulatory Terms may
contribute to, or be, a Burdensome Condition; and provided, further, however,
that the PUCT Approval shall be deemed to be a Burdensome Condition (X) if the
PUCT Approval does not approve changes of control of Oncor (a) pursuant to
which Parent and its Affiliates will own, directly or indirectly, all of the
equity securities of Oncor and (b) pursuant to which Parent and its Affiliates
will own, directly or indirectly, all of the equity securities of Oncor (other
than indirect interests in Oncor that are issued to the public, interests
issued to directors, officers and employees of the Oncor Entities pursuant to
a management equity incentive plan and direct or indirect interests held by
the current members of Oncor and their successors), (Y) if the PUCT Approval
imposes (i) any requirement, restriction, limitation or condition on Parent's
ability to, directly or indirectly, appoint, remove and replace from time to
time any individual who serves on the board of directors of Oncor or Oncor
Holdings from time to time (and otherwise to fill vacancies on such boards of
directors) or the process for the appointment, removal or replacement of such
directors or (ii) imposes any requirement, restriction, limitation or
condition on the qualifications for the directors of the Oncor Entities
(including the independence thereof) other than requiring that no more than a
majority of the directors of Oncor Holdings and Oncor shall consist of persons
who qualify as "independent" in accordance with the rules and regulations of
the NYSE, provided that, if any such requirement, restriction, limitation or
condition pursuant to this clause (Y) is only effective during periods in
which Parent and its subsidiaries, other than Oncor and Oncor Holdings, have
outstanding new debt that is solely or almost entirely dependent on the
revenues of Oncor, then such requirement, restriction, limitation or condition
shall not, in and of itself, be deemed to be a Burdensome Condition, or (Z) if
the PUCT Approval imposes any requirement, restriction, limitation, condition
or obligation that limits or prevents any of the Oncor Entities from making
distributions, dividends or other payments to Parent or its Affiliates, except
in the case of this clause (Z), (i) as provided for in the Key Regulatory
Terms without modification thereto, or any comparable condition, requirement
or similar item that, in each case, is substantively the same or results in
the same effect as any of the Key Regulatory Terms, or (ii) for any condition
that would restrict the Oncor Entities from making distributions, dividends or
other payments to Parent or its Affiliates if such distribution, dividend or
other payments would cause Oncor's actual equity ratio to fall below the
equity ratio established by the Commission from time to time, as such actual
equity ratio appears in Oncor's annual Earnings Monitoring Report, and, except
in the case of each of clauses (X), (Y) and (Z), as would not cause any
nationally recognized rating agency, rating Parent, any of Parent\'s
Affiliates or any securities issued by Parent or any of its Affiliates, (1) to
assign to Parent, any of its Affiliates (including any Affiliate that is an
issuer of indebtedness) or any securities issued by Parent or any of its
Affiliates, a lower rating, or (2) to place Parent, any of its Affiliates
(including any Affiliate that is an issuer of indebtedness) or any securities
issued by Parent or any of its



76 

Affiliates, on credit watch or negative outlook, in the case of clause (ii) in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or as a result
of the Merger (as reasonably demonstrated by Parent to the Company).

Nothing in this Agreement, including this Section 6.3, shall require, or be
construed to require, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates to agree
to the sale, license, divestiture, hold separate or other disposition of any
assets, categories of assets or businesses or other segments of Parent or
Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates (other than the Company and
its Subsidiaries). In the event that the Company or its Subsidiaries are
required to agree to the sale, license, divestiture, hold separate or other
disposition of any assets, categories of assets or businesses of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with obtaining a Company Approval,
then such requirement may contribute to, or be, a Burdensome Condition.

(f) Confidentiality. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all information disclosed
pursuant to this Section 6.3 shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement
and nothing in this Section 6.3 shall require any party (i) to violate any of
its binding obligations with respect to confidentiality, (ii) to disclose any
privileged information or (iii) to violate any applicable Laws or Orders;
provided, that, as applicable, each of the Company and EFIH, on the one hand,
and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, provide notice to each other that any information is being
withheld pursuant to this provision and shall use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to find a mutually agreeable solution to any
such confidentiality and/or privilege concerns, including providing any such
privileged information pursuant to a joint defense agreement.

Section 6.4 Access and Reports. Subject to applicable Law, upon reasonable
notice, the Company and EFIH shall (and each shall cause its Subsidiaries
(other than the Oncor Entities) to) afford Parent's officers and other
Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours throughout the
period from the date hereof through the earlier of the Termination Date and
the Effective Time, to its employees, properties, books, contracts and records
and, during such period, the Company and EFIH shall (and each shall cause its
Subsidiaries (other than the Oncor Entities) to) furnish to Parent all such
information concerning its business, properties, facilities, operations and
personnel as Parent reasonably requests; provided that, no investigation
pursuant to this Section 6.4 shall (a) unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries or (b) affect or be deemed to
modify any representation or warranty made by the Company herein, and
provided, further, that the foregoing shall not require the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to (i) permit any inspection, or to disclose any information,
that in the reasonable judgment of the Company or such Subsidiary would result
in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties or violate any of its
or any of its Subsidiaries' obligations with respect to confidentiality if the
Company or such Subsidiary shall have used reasonable best efforts to furnish
such information in a manner that does not result in any such disclosure,
including obtaining the consent of such third party to such inspection or
disclosure, (ii) disclose any privileged information of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries if the Company or such Subsidiary shall have used reasonable
best efforts to furnish such information in a manner that does not result in
the loss of such privilege or (iii) permit any invasive environmental
investigation or sampling, including a Phase II environmental assessment. All
information requested pursuant to this Section 6.4 shall be governed by the
Confidentiality Agreement.

77 



Section 6.5 Publicity. The initial press release or press releases regarding
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
the Closing Date Transactions, shall be in a form mutually acceptable to
Parent and the Company and thereafter the Company, EFIH and Parent each shall
consult with each other to the extent reasonably practicable prior to issuing
any press releases or otherwise making public announcements (except as
required by Law) with respect to the Closing Date Transactions.

Section 6.6 Employee Benefits.

(a) Pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization or otherwise, the Company and EFIH
shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to take all such actions
within their control as may be necessary, appropriate or desirable to transfer
the sponsorship, maintenance and administration of, and all liabilities (and
related contracts or agreements with third parties) in respect of, the
Contributed Plans to Reorganized TCEH or its Subsidiaries on or prior to the
date of the Reorganized TCEH Spin-Off. As soon as administratively practicable
following the Reorganized TCEH Spin-Off, Reorganized TCEH shall transfer the
liabilities related to the post-retirement health, life, dental and vision
benefits for participants previously employed by certain discontinued
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries and their predecessors, and the
participants' beneficiaries (identified by employee number) set forth on
Schedule 6.6(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter (the "DiscOp OPEB
Participants") and the related accrued benefits liabilities (the "DiscOp OPEB
Liabilities") from the EFH Retiree Welfare Plan to a new mirror health and
welfare plan established by Reorganized TCEH or another plan reasonably
acceptable to Parent and the Company (the "New DiscOp OPEB Plan" which such
plan shall be transferred to and assumed by the Company or one of its
Subsidiaries prior to or on the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, upon
the transfer of the New DiscOp OPEB Plan to the Company or its Subsidiary, the
New DiscOp OPEB Plan (including the DiscOp OPEB Liabilities) shall be an
Assumed Plan and the Surviving Company shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Reorganized TCEH and its Subsidiaries from and against any claim,
action, suit, proceeding relating to any modification or termination of the
post-retirement health and life benefits to any DiscOp OPEB Participants on or
after the Closing Date. Parent, the Company and Reorganized TCEH shall take
all actions necessary to effectuate the transfer of the New DiscOp OPEB Plan
from Reorganized TCEH to Parent or Company as soon as administratively
practicable following the establishment of such plan, but in any event prior
to the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, during the period beginning on the Reorganized TCEH Spin-Off date
and ending on the date the New DiscOp OPEB Plan is assumed by the Company or
its Subsidiary as set forth in this Section 6.6, the Company, Surviving
Company or its Subsidiaries shall reimburse Reorganized TCEH and its
Affiliates for all claims incurred by DiscOp OPEB Participants under the EFH
Retiree Welfare Plan or New DiscOp OPEB Plan, as applicable, plus any
reasonable out of pocket expenses incurred by Reorganized TCEH and its
Affiliates in providing such benefits. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except
as otherwise provided herein (including, without limitation, the Assumed
Plans) or in the Split Participant Agreement (as defined below), none of
Parent, any Oncor Entity or any of their Affiliates shall assume or otherwise
incur any liability or obligation under any compensatory, severance or similar
arrangement in

78 

respect of any Non-Oncor Employee (as defined below), it being understood that
Reorganized TCEH and Oncor shall enter into the Split Participant Agreement.
For purposes of Section 6.6(a):

"Non-Oncor Employee" means consistent with past practices (i) any individual
employed by the Company, EFIH, TCEH, Reorganized TCEH or any of their
respective Affiliates (other than the Oncor Entities) on or immediately
following the Reorganized TCEH Spin-Off or (ii) any individual formerly
employed by TCEH or any Affiliate of TCEH or Reorganized TCEH (which for this
purpose would constitute an Affiliate immediately following the Closing Date),
other than an Oncor Employee;

"Oncor Employee" means consistent with past practices (i) any individual
employed by an Oncor Entity on or immediately following the Closing Date or
(ii) any individual formerly employed by an Oncor Entity or, by any
predecessor regulated electric utility business on a full time basis, who
terminated employment with and did not subsequently become employed by a non-
Oncor Entity; and

"Split Participant Service" means service of Oncor Employees or Non-Oncor
Employees, as applicable, whose employment includes service with both the
Oncor Entities (or a predecessor regulated electric business) and a business
of the Company or its Affiliates other than the Oncor Entities.

(b) EFIH, the Company and Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain unconditional bankruptcy court approval authorizing the termination and
distribution of all payments and obligations under the Discharged Plans (other
than any such Discharged Plans that are equity based plans or the Ebasco
Services of Canada Limited Pension Plan) prior to the effective date of the
Plan of Reorganization under which the Non-Qualified Plans are to be
discharged; provided, however, if EFIH, the Company and Parent cannot obtain
such unconditional bankruptcy court approval prior to such date, such
Discharged Plans will be terminated as the effective date of the Plan of
Reorganization under which the Non-Qualified Plans are to be discharged and
paid out and all associated liabilities discharged in accordance with the
terms and procedures of such Plan of Reorganization.

(c) Prior to the Closing Date, Oncor and Reorganized TCEH (or Opco (as defined
in the Separation Agreement)) shall execute and deliver a Split Participant
Agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit F (the "Split
Participant Agreement").

(d) No provision of this Agreement shall obligate Parent or the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to continue the employment of any employee
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Oncor Entities)
after the Closing Date.







79 

(e) The Company and Parent agree to cooperate in good faith using commercially
reasonable efforts to minimize the risk of any Contributed Plan and Assumed
Plan becoming a "multiple employer plan" (within the meaning of Section 413 of
the Code) or "multiple employer welfare plan" (within the meaning of Section
3(40) of ERISA) following the Closing Date.

(f) The Company and Parent agree to work together in good faith to develop
such timelines, plans, agreements, and communications, and to exchange such
information as is necessary to effectuate the intent of this Section 6.6 in an
orderly manner.

(g) For a period of ninety (90) days immediately following the Closing Date,
neither Parent nor the Surviving Company shall close any facility or lay off
any Employees of the Surviving Company or its Subsidiaries, if such closure or
layoff would result in any material obligations or liabilities for Reorganized
TCEH.

(h) The provisions of this Section 6.6 are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and no current or former Employee or any other
individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third
party beneficiary of this Agreement, and nothing herein shall be (i) construed
as an amendment to any Benefit Plan for any purpose, or (ii) give any employee
or former employee or any other individual associated therewith or any
employee benefit plan or trustee thereof or any other third person any right
to enforce the provisions of this Section 6.6 or (iii) obligate Parent, the
Merger Sub, Reorganized TCEH or any of their respective Affiliates to (A)
maintain any particular benefit plan or refrain from amending or terminating
any benefit plan, except as provided otherwise in the Split Participant
Agreement or (B) retain the employment of any particular employee.

Section 6.7 Expenses. The Surviving Company shall pay all charges and
expenses, including those of the Exchange Agent, in connection with the

administrative expenses of the Debtors' estates addressed in the Plan of
Reorganization, whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Closing Date
Transactions and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall
be paid by the party incurring such expense.

Section 6.8 Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance.

(a) From and after the Effective Time for a period of six (6) years, the
Surviving Company agrees that it will indemnify and hold harmless, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law (and the Surviving Company shall
also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, provided that, the Person to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined
that such Person is not entitled to indemnification), each present and former
director, manager and officer of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries
(together, the "Indemnified Parties") against any costs or expenses (including
reasonable and necessary attorneys' fees and experts' fees), and sums which an
Indemnified Party



80 

becomes legally obligated to pay solely as a result of judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages, settlements or liabilities (collectively, "Costs")
arising out of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or related to
such Indemnified Parties' service as a manager, director or officer of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or other services performed by such persons
at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at or prior to the
Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
provided, however, that the Surviving Company shall not indemnify any
Indemnified Party for any Costs brought about or contributed to in fact by
fraudulent act by such Indemnified Party; and provided, further, that the
Surviving Company shall not be obligated to reimburse any Indemnified Party
for any Costs unless and until such Indemnified Party has exhausted the limits
of recovery from any other Person obligated to indemnify and reimburse such
Indemnified Party (unless the Company has agreed otherwise in writing prior to
the date hereof with any such other Person, in which case this proviso shall
be limited with respect to such other Person to the extent of such agreement).

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall obtain, effective as of the
Effective Time, and fully pay the premium for a run-off of (i) the Company's
and its Subsidiaries' existing directors', managers' and officers' insurance
policies as of the date hereof, and (ii) the Company's existing fiduciary
liability insurance policies as of the date hereof, in each case for a claims
reporting or discovery period of at least six (6) years from and after the
Effective Time with respect to any claim based on alleged acts or omissions
occurring during any period of time at or prior to the Effective Time (it
being understood that, with respect to any claim arising from actual or
alleged acts or omissions of such Persons in their capacity as a current or
former director or officer or other Representative of any of TCEH Companies or
the SpinCo Group (each as defined in the Separation Agreement), such period
shall be limited to the period on or prior to the TCEH Effective Date) from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company's
current insurance carrier with respect to directors' and officers' liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, "DandO Insurance")
with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less
advantageous than the coverage provided under the Company's existing policies
with respect to any actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading
statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or any matter claimed
against a current or former director or officer or other Representative of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of him or her serving in such
capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions or actions contemplated
by this Agreement). If the Company, after its good faith efforts to obtain, is
unable to obtain such run-off insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the
Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to,
continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least six (6) years from and
after the Effective Time the DandO Insurance in place as of the date hereof with
terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less
advantageous than the coverage provided under the Company's existing policies
as of the date hereof, or the Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Company to, use reasonable best efforts to purchase comparable
DandO Insurance for such six-year period with terms, conditions, retentions and
limits of liability that are at least as

81 

favorable as provided in the Company's existing policies as of the date
hereof; provided, however, that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving
Company be required to expend for such policies pursuant to this sentence an
annual premium amount in excess of 200% of the annual premiums currently paid
by the Company for such insurance; and provided, further, that if the annual
premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Company
shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not
exceeding such amount.

(c) If the Surviving Company or any of its successors or assigns shall (i)
consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any individual, corporation or other entity, then, and in each such case,
proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Company shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this
Section 6.8.

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.8 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties.

(e) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Section 6.8 shall be in
addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the certificate
of incorporation or formation or bylaws, operating agreement or comparable
governing documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under any
applicable Contracts or Laws. All rights to indemnification and exculpation
from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time and rights to advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in
favor of any Indemnified Party as provided in the certificate of formation,
bylaws, operating agreement or comparable governing documents of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or any indemnification agreement between such
Indemnified Party and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be
continued or be assumed by the Surviving Company following the Merger and
shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would
adversely affect any right thereunder of any such Indemnified Party for a
period of six (6) years after the Effective Time.

Section 6.9 Resignation of Directors and Officers. Pursuant to the Plan of
Reorganization, except as otherwise may be agreed by Parent in writing, the
Company Board, all officers of the Company and all members of any board of
directors or similar governing body and all officers of any Subsidiary of the
Company (other than the Oncor Entities), in each case who are in office
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be deemed to have resigned from
such position(s) effective at the Effective Time. In addition, immediately
prior to the Effective Time, EFIH shall cause the Member Directors (as defined
in the Oncor Holdings LLC Agreement) to resign and shall provide to the boards
of directors of Oncor Holdings and Oncor EFIH's written consent to the
resignation of the Independent Directors (as defined in the LLC Agreements) of
each of Oncor Holdings and Oncor.

Section 6.10 Bankruptcy Court Matters. The Company and EFIH shall comply with
the following covenants and agreements contained in the Plan Support Agreement
as if such



82 

covenants and agreements were set forth herein, solely to the extent they
affect the rights of Parent or Merger Sub: Section 3, Sections 4.02(a) and
Sections 7.02 through and including 7.05.

Section 6.11 Listing and SEC Registration. Parent shall use its best efforts
to cause (i) the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to this
Agreement to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice
of issuance, and (ii) all state securities or "blue sky" authorizations to
have been received, in each case, as promptly as practicable after the date of
the entry of the EFH Confirmation Order, and in any event prior to the Closing
Date. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall use its best efforts to seek a
"no-action" letter from the SEC seeking confirmation that the issuance of the
Parent Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement is exempt from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act and from applicable state securities laws,
pursuant to Section 1145 of the Bankruptcy Code. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, prior to seeking the "no-action" letter (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect
thereto, Parent (i) shall provide the Company and EFIH an opportunity to
review and comment on such document or response (including the proposed final
version of such document or response) and (ii) shall consider in good faith
all comments reasonably proposed by the Company or EFIH. In the event that the
staff of the SEC does not issue a favorable "no action" letter with respect to
the application of Section 1145 of the Bankruptcy Code in connection with the
issuance described above, (a) Parent shall use it best efforts to, as
applicable, cause the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to this
Agreement to be registered with the SEC on Form S-4 or other applicable
registration statement on or before the Closing Date and (b) Parent and the
Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts to cause all of the
information supplied by it or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Oncor
Entities) for inclusion or incorporation by reference into the Form S-4 or
other applicable registration statement at the time such registration
statement becomes effective under the Securities Act, not to contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

Section 6.12 Parent and Merger Sub Waiver. Subject to the receipt by Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company and EFIH of a reciprocal release from Reorganized TCEH
and its Subsidiaries pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization which is
substantially consistent with the release contained herein, except as set
forth in Section 6.12 of the Parent Disclosure Letter, each of Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company and EFIH, acknowledges and agrees that, effective from and
after the Closing, to the fullest extent allowed by Law, Reorganized TCEH and
any of its Subsidiaries and their respective directors, employees, managers,
equityholders, successors and assigns (the "TCEH Released Persons") shall be
deemed released and discharged by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and EFIH,
and each of their respective Subsidiaries from any and all Claims and causes
of action, Debts, liabilities and obligations, of any nature, whether known or
unknown, in law or equity, including any derivative claims, asserted on behalf
of the E-Side Debtors, that Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and EFIH, and each
of their respective Subsidiaries would have been legally entitled to assert in
their own right before the effectiveness of such release (whether individually
or collectively) or on behalf of the holder of any Claim or Interest (the
"TCEH Released Claims"), and except for obligations issued or required to be
paid pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, all entities that have held,
hold, or may hold TCEH Released Claims are permanently enjoined, from and
after the Closing Date, from taking any



83 

of the following actions against the TCEH Released Persons: (i) commencing or
continuing in any manner any action or other proceeding of any kind on account
of or in connection with or with respect to any such claims or interests; (ii)
enforcing, attaching, collecting, or recovering by any manner or means any
judgment, award, decree, or order against such entities on account of or in
connection with or with respect to any such claims or interests; (iii)
creating, perfecting, or enforcing any lien or encumbrance of any kind against
such entities or the property or the estates of such entities on account of or
in connection with or with respect to any such claims or interests; (iv)
asserting any right of setoff, subrogation, or recoupment of any kind against
any obligation due from such entities or against the property of such entities
on account of or in connection with or with respect to any such claims or
interests unless such entity has timely asserted such setoff right in a
document filed with the Bankruptcy Court explicitly preserving such setoff,
and notwithstanding an indication of a claim or interest or otherwise that
such entity asserts, has, or intends to preserve any right of setoff pursuant
to applicable law or otherwise; and (v) commencing or continuing in any manner
any action or other proceeding of any kind on account of or in connection with
or with respect to any such claims or interests released or settled pursuant
to the Plan of Reorganization. Subject to the receipt by Parent, the Surviving
Company and EFIH of a reciprocal indemnity from Reorganized TCEH and its
Subsidiaries pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization which is substantially
consistent with the indemnity contained herein, each of Parent, the Surviving
Company and EFIH hereby agrees, on behalf of itself, effective from and after
the Closing, to indemnify and hold harmless each of the TCEH Released Persons
from and against, and in respect of, any and all losses, liabilities, damages,
obligations, costs or expenses (including reasonable legal fees) incurred by
or on behalf of any TCEH Released Person as a result of such entity's
violation of this Section 6.12.

Section 6.13 Tax-Free Reorganization Treatment. The parties to this Agreement
intend that the Merger will qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a)
of the Code, and each shall not, and shall not permit any of its respective
Subsidiaries or controlled Affiliates (other than the Oncor Entities) to take
any action, or fail to take any action, that would reasonably be expected to
jeopardize the qualification of the Merger as a reorganization under Section
368(a) of the Code.

Section 6.14 Tax Matters.

(a) Private Letter Ruling. The Company, on behalf of the Debtors, has received
a private letter ruling (the "Private Letter Ruling") from the IRS in response
to a written request, dated June 10, 2014 (the "Initial Ruling Request," and
together with all related materials and supplements thereto filed with respect
to the Initial Ruling Request, the "Initial IRS Submissions"). The Private
Letter Ruling addresses certain issues related to the qualification of the
Reorganized TCEH Contributions, the Reorganized TCEH Conversion, and the
Reorganized TCEH Spin-Off as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Sections
368(a)(1)(G), 355 and 356 of the Code (collectively, the "Intended Tax-Free
Treatment") and certain other matters. The parties hereto acknowledge and
agree that the Private Letter Ruling is acceptable to the parties hereto with
respect to the Intended Tax-Free Treatment. The transactions contemplated by
this Agreement are not conditioned on the receipt of any additional rulings
from the IRS, other than the Supplemental Rulings (defined below).





84 

(b) Supplemental Ruling. The Company shall be responsible for the preparation
and filing with the IRS of one or more supplemental ruling requests that,
among other things, request rulings that address the effect of the Merger on
certain of the rulings received in the Private Letter Ruling, as reflected on
Exhibit I (such request, the "Supplemental Ruling Request," the rulings
granted pursuant to thereto, the "Supplemental Rulings," and the materials to
be filed in respect of the Supplemental Ruling Request, the "Supplemental IRS
Submissions").

(c) Supplemental IRS Submissions. The Company shall be responsible for the
preparation and filing of the Supplemental IRS Submissions. The Company shall
provide tax counsel of Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on drafts of all IRS Submissions and any pre-filing agreement or
closing agreement that is intended to satisfy the requirements of Section
7.1(d) or that could reasonably be determined to affect the treatment of the
restructuring transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Plan of
Reorganization to be submitted or entered into on or after the date hereof.
The Company agrees to supplement or modify any Supplemental IRS Submissions
and agreements related to Supplemental IRS Submissions as may be reasonably
requested by Parent; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required
to supplement or modify any Supplemental IRS Submission, request any
additional ruling, or modify any ruling being requested with respect to the
Initial Private Letter Ruling (other than with respect to the effect of the
Merger) if the Company determines, in its reasonable discretion, that making
such supplement, modification, or request could result in any delay in
obtaining the Supplemental Ruling or be otherwise detrimental to the process
of obtaining the Supplemental Ruling. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree
that it is anticipated that this Agreement and the facts related to the
contemplated Merger will be disclosed to the IRS pursuant to a Supplemental
IRS Submission. To the extent that the Company, in its good faith judgment, or
upon a reasonable request by any other person, considers any information
included in an IRS Submission or a Supplemental IRS Submission (or drafts
thereof) to be confidential, the Company may redact such documents to exclude
such information before providing such documents to Parent. Subject to the
foregoing, the Company shall provide Parent with copies of each Supplemental
IRS Submission promptly following the filing thereof.

(d) IRS Communications and Cooperation. The Company shall notify Parent of any
substantive communications with the IRS regarding the Supplemental IRS
Submissions and restructuring transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
by the Plan of Reorganization. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a single
Representative from Parent shall be (i) given the opportunity to participate
in all scheduled communications with the IRS concerning the Supplemental
Ruling Requests or any restructuring transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and by the Plan of Reorganization, including, (A) all scheduled
conference calls and in-person meetings, to the extent a Representative of the
TCEH First Lien Creditors or Reorganized TCEH is given the opportunity to
participate in such communications, conference calls, or in-person meetings;
and (ii) updated in a timely fashion regarding any unscheduled communications
from the IRS or any other communication with respect to which a Representative
of Parent does not participate. The Company and Parent agree to cooperate and
use their reasonable best efforts to assist in obtaining the rulings requested

85 

in the Supplemental Ruling Requests (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
the requested rulings, if any, that are not Fundamental Rulings described on
Exhibit I), including providing such appropriate information and
representations as the IRS shall reasonably require in connection with the
Supplemental Rulings or any restructuring transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and by the Plan of Reorganization. The Company and Parent agree to
use their commercially reasonable efforts to provide any appropriate
information and additional representations, and to implement any changes to
the restructuring transactions contemplated by this Agreement and by the Plan
of Reorganization to the extent such changes would not, unless otherwise
agreed by Parent, result in (x) a material economic detriment to Parent or the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries (y) the issuance of common
stock by Parent or its Affiliates, if requested by the IRS in order to issue
reasonably satisfactory Supplemental Rulings.

(e) Tax Opinion. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the tax opinion contemplated by Section 7.3(c),
if applicable, and Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain the tax opinion contemplated by Section 7.2(e), if applicable.

(f) Tax Matters Agreement. Prior to, but contingent upon the Reorganized TCEH
Spin-Off, the Company and Reorganized TECH shall duly execute and deliver a
Tax Matters Agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit G (the "Tax Matters
Agreement"), in accordance with the Plan of Reorganization.

Section 6.15 Registration Rights. To the extent that any recipients of any
Parent Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement would become or continue to be
affiliates of Parent for purposes of Rule 144 under the Securities Act as a
result of receipt of such Parent Common Stock, Parent shall provide such
recipients customary registration rights pursuant to a registration rights
agreement effective as of the Effective Time reasonably satisfactory to the
Company.

Section 6.16 Transition Services Agreement; Separation Agreement. At the
Closing, the Company and Reorganized TCEH shall duly execute and deliver a
Transition Services Agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit H (the
"Transition Services Agreement"). Prior to, but contingent upon the
Reorganized TCEH Spin-Off, the Company and Reorganized TCEH and Opco (as
defined in the Separation Agreement) shall duly execute and deliver a
Separation Agreement (the "Separation Agreement") substantially in the form of
Exhibit J, in each case in accordance with the Plan of Reorganization.
Following the execution of the Separation Agreement, the Company shall (i) use
its reasonable best efforts to comply with its covenants and other obligations
thereunder, and (ii) enforce its rights and remedies thereunder in the event
of a breach by Reorganized TCEH or Opco.

Section 6.17 Notice of Current Events. From and after the date of this
Agreement until the Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall promptly
notify each other orally and in writing upon becoming aware of any (i)
occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event that, individually or in the
aggregate, would reasonably be expected to cause any condition to the
obligations of the other party to effect the Closing not to be satisfied; (ii)
written notice from any third party (other than a notice that has been
previously identified pursuant to the Company Disclosure Letter) alleging that
the consent of such party is or may be required in connection

86 

with the Closing Date Transactions or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the Plan of Reorganization; and (iii) written notice of any
proceeding commenced or, to the Knowledge of the Company or Parent, threatened
against the Company, Parent or their respective Subsidiaries (other than the
Oncor Entities), that has had or would have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect;
provided, however, that in each case the delivery of any notice pursuant to
this Section 6.17 shall not cure any breach of any representation or warranty
requiring disclosure of such matter prior to the date of this Agreement or
otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to either Party,
and the failure to deliver any such notice shall not affect any of the
conditions set forth in Article VII.

Section 6.18 Drag-Along Rights.

(a) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that the Offer
(together with this Agreement to the extent referred to therein) constitutes
an offer by Parent and Merger Sub to purchase (i) all of the LLC Units in
Oncor held indirectly by the Company and (ii) all of the LLC Units in Oncor
that are owned by Oncor Management and by TTI as provided for in Section
3.3(a) of the Investor Rights Agreement.

(b) So long as Parent and Merger Sub have not (x) rescinded the Offer or (y)
amended or modified the Offer in a manner that violates the Investor Rights
Agreement, at any time following the receipt of a written request from Parent
and prior to the Termination Date, the Company shall (i) prepare a Required
Sale Notice (as such term is defined in the Investor Rights Agreement) in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Company and consistent
with Section 3.3 of the Investor Rights Agreement and the terms of this
Agreement and (ii) promptly deliver such Required Sale Notice to TTI.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6.7, all reasonable
out-of-pocket Costs incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(including those of its Representatives) after the date of this Agreement in
connection with (i) this Section 6.18, (ii) the Offer or (iii) delivery of the
Required Sale Notice to TTI, shall be paid, or reimbursed, by Parent in
immediately available funds within thirty (30) days after termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms (1) except if the Company or EFIH
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.3(e) or Section 8.3(f), in
which event no amounts shall be payable by Parent, and (2) other than any
Costs arising from a material breach by the Company or EFIH of its obligations
under this Agreement (including under this Section 6.18 and Section 6.19) with
respect to such matters or from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
the Company or EFIH in connection with such matters.

(d) Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and
its and their respective Representatives from and against any and all Costs
suffered or reasonably incurred by them in connection with (i) this Section
6.18, (ii) the Offer, or (iii) the Required Sale Notice, other than any Costs
arising from a material breach by the Company or EFIH of its respective
obligations under this Agreement (including under





87 

this Section 6.18 and Section 6.19) with respect to such matters or the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Company or EFIH in connection with
such matters.

(e) Parent and Merger Sub shall be responsible for their own Costs in
connection with (i) this Section 6.18, (ii) the Offer or (iii) delivery of the
Required Sale Notice to TTI.

Section 6.19 Enforcement of Certain Investor Rights.

(a) Following the execution of this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub shall use
reasonable efforts to negotiate and execute definitive documentation with TTI
(or, if applicable, its equityholders) providing for the acquisition of the
Minority Interest as of the Closing Date for consideration in an amount
sufficient to satisfy the applicable requirements of Section 3.3 of the
Investor Rights Agreement and otherwise on terms to be mutually agreed by
Parent, Merger Sub and TTI (or, if applicable, its equityholders). Solely to
the extent that, at any time after the date that is thirty (30) days from the
date on which the Required Sale Notice is delivered in accordance with Section
6.18, (x) neither Merger Sub nor any of its Affiliates has executed definitive
documentation with TTI (or, if applicable, its equityholders) providing for
the acquisition of the Minority Interest, (y) Merger Sub and Parent have
complied, in all material respects, with their obligations under this Section
6.19(a) and (z) Parent and Merger Sub have neither rescinded the Offer nor
amended or modified the Offer in a manner that violates the Investor Rights
Agreement, Parent or Merger Sub shall be entitled to send a written notice to
the Company requesting that the Company commence an Enforcement Action (as
defined below). The parties hereto hereby agree that Parent and Merger Sub
shall have complied with their respective obligations under this Section
6.19(a) to the extent Parent, Merger Sub or an Affiliate of Parent has made
and not rescinded a good faith offer to TTI consistent with the Offer and
otherwise made good faith efforts to propose the basis for negotiations and
propose draft definitive documentation providing for the acquisition of the
Minority Interest as of the Closing Date consistent with the terms of the
Offer and the Investor Rights Agreement.

(b) Promptly following, and in no case more than fourteen (14) Business Days
after, the delivery of the written notice described in Section 6.19(a), the
Company shall file an action (the "Enforcement Action") in the Bankruptcy
Court (or, if the Bankruptcy Court issues a final order confirming that it
does not have jurisdiction over the Enforcement Action, another appropriate
court mutually agreed in good faith by the Company and Parent) that seeks any
or all of the following remedies (as determined by consultation among the
parties hereto, but including, at a minimum, the remedies described in clauses
(i) and (ii) below): (i) a determination that the Company has the right to
enforce the Drag-Along Rights and TTI is accordingly bound to consummate the
sale of the Minority Interest at the Closing, (ii) a determination that TTI is
obligated to take such actions as may be reasonably required on its part in
connection with consummating the IPO Conversion Plan (provided the Company
shall not be required to file an Enforcement Action including this remedy if
the Company, based on the advice of outside counsel, reasonably determines
that an actual case or controversy regarding such obligation does not exist at
that time; provided further, that if TTI indicates that it will



88 

not comply with its obligations in connection with the IPO Conversion within
thirty (30) days of delivery of the Required Sale Notice any temporal
requirement for a case or controversy to exist shall be deemed to be
satisfied, (iii) a determination, if applicable, that TTI has failed to comply
with its obligations under the Investor Rights Agreement with respect to the
Drag-Along Rights contained therein or with respect to the IPO Conversion
Plan, (iv) enforcement of any other obligations of TTI arising under the
Investor Rights Agreement or the Oncor LLC Agreement, in each case solely
relating to the matters described in clause (i) and/or (ii) above and (v) any
other remedy available to the Company at law or in equity in connection with
such matters. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall have no obligation
to bring any other action (whether in law, equity or otherwise) against TTI
pursuant to this Section 6.19; provided, however, that, to the extent that TTI
or any of its Affiliates commences any action relating to the matters
identified in this Section 6.19 against the E-Side Debtors or any of their
Affiliates, the Company or such other Person shall as promptly as practicable
seek to remove any such action to the Bankruptcy Court and, to the extent
applicable, seek to enforce the automatic stay against such action pending
removal.

(c) The Enforcement Action shall be conducted by the Company with counsel
selected by the Company, in its reasonable discretion, which may include
Kirkland and Ellis LLP. To the extent that Parent and/or Merger Sub move to
intervene in and otherwise participate in the Enforcement Action, at their own
cost and expense and with their own counsel (which may include Chadbourne and
Parke LLP), the Company and EFIH shall not oppose such motion, or knowingly
take any action with the intent of preventing, restricting or hindering Parent
or Merger Sub from intervening and participating in the Enforcement Action,
and shall support the their right to intervene in the Enforcement Action for
any and all purposes related to the Enforcement Action (including related
counterclaims) with full rights of participation.

(d) To the extent that, after the commencement of the Enforcement Action, (i)
none of Merger Sub or any of its Affiliates has executed definitive
documentation with TTI (or, if applicable, its equityholders) providing for
the acquisition of the Minority Interest, (ii) Parent and Merger Sub have
complied, in all material respects, with their obligations under Section 6.19
and (iii) Merger Sub has neither rescinded the Offer nor amended or modified
the Offer in a manner that violates the Investor Rights Agreement, the Company
shall prosecute the Enforcement Action diligently until entry of a final order
resolving the Enforcement Action in its entirety. Subject to the terms of this
Section 6.19, the Company and Parent shall (and shall cause their respective
attorneys and advisors to) cooperate with each other and use reasonable best
efforts to take all actions, and do, or cause to be done, all things
reasonably necessary or advisable to achieve a Successful Outcome (as defined
below) of the Enforcement Action, including preparing and filing all
documentation reasonably required in connection therewith. A "Successful
Outcome" means obtaining the applicable remedies referred to in clauses (i)
through (iv) of Section 6.19(b) or entering into a settlement or compromise of
the Enforcement Action as set forth in Section 6.19(f).

(e) In connection with the Enforcement Action, the Company and EFIH shall (i)
provide Parent, Merger Sub and their designated advisors with a reasonable



89 

opportunity to review in advance and provide comments to any material filings
made in connection therewith, and consider those comments in good faith, (ii)
reasonably consult with, and consider in good faith the views of, Parent,
Merger Sub and their designated counsel in connection with the prosecution,
defense and/or settlement of such Enforcement Action and (iii) allow Parent,
Merger Sub and their designated legal advisors to attend, and, if permitted by
applicable Law (and only if appropriate agreements are entered into designed
to minimize the risk of waiving, and with the intention of maintaining, any
privilege or work product doctrine), participate in, all material meetings,
communications and proceedings with respect to such Enforcement Action.
Without limitation to the foregoing sentence, the Company shall consult with,
and consider in good faith the views of, Parent and Merger Sub regarding all
material strategic decisions relating to the conduct of the Enforcement
Action, and Parent shall be entitled to set the timing for the filing of any
summary judgment or other dispositive motion and for any trial or other
significant hearing; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything to
contrary in this Section 6.19, the Company shall be entitled to refrain from
taking any action proposed by Parent that it reasonably determines (based on
the advice of its counsel) is (A) likely to have a material and adverse effect
on the ability of the Company and/or EFIH to effectuate the Closing Date
Transactions or the other transactions contemplated hereby or in the Plan of
Reorganization, or (B) inconsistent with its board of directors' applicable
fiduciary duties. Subject to the limitations set forth in the first sentence
of Section 6.19(d), the Company shall, and shall direct its counsel to, use
reasonable best efforts to take all steps to prosecute the Enforcement Action
as promptly as reasonably practicable, including filing motions with the
court, as appropriate, to seek a ruling on expedited treatment for the
Enforcement Action, and Parent (including designated legal counsel and other
advisors) shall use its and their reasonable best efforts to support and
assist the Company in fulfilling its obligations with respect to the
Enforcement Action.

(f) Without limiting any other provision of this Section 6.19, the Company
shall not settle or compromise any Enforcement Action or consent to the entry
of any order in connection therewith without the prior written consent of
Parent (in its sole discretion). Parent shall be entitled to cause the Company
to settle or compromise any Enforcement Action or consent to the entry of any
order in connection therewith without the consent of the Company so long as
(i) any such settlement or compromise, and any payment obligations in
connection therewith, shall be contingent on the occurrence of the Closing and
(ii) Parent provides advance notice of at least five (5) Business Days to the
Company of the proposed terms of such settlement or compromise and the Company
does not notify Parent in writing within such five (5) Business Day period
that the Company has reasonably determined (based on the advice of its
counsel) that such settlement or compromise (A) is likely to have a material
and adverse effect on the ability of the Company and/or EFIH to effectuate the
Closing Date Transactions or the other transactions contemplated hereby or in
the Plan of Reorganization, or (B) is inconsistent with its board of
directors' applicable fiduciary duties.

(g) The Company shall cause its counsel to track separately all fees and
expenses incurred in connection with the Enforcement Action as part of its
ongoing fee application process. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
Section 6.7, the



90 

Company shall invoice Parent for all reasonable and documented fees and
expenses incurred by it and its Affiliates in connection with the Enforcement
Action on a monthly basis and such invoices shall be payable by Parent in
immediately available funds within thirty (30) days after termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms (except if the Company or EFIH
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.3(e) or Section 8.3(f), in
which event no amounts shall be payable by Parent).

(h) In addition, Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its
Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives from and against any
and all Costs suffered or reasonably incurred as a result of actions taken
pursuant to this Section 6.19, to the extent such actions are taken during the
period from the date of this Agreement to its termination in accordance with
it terms except if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.3(e) or
Section 8.3(f) and other than any Costs arising from a material breach by the
Company or EFIH of its respective obligations under this Section 6.19 or from
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Company in connection with
the Enforcement Action.

(i) If requested by Parent, the Company, EFIH and their respective advisors
shall promptly consent to, execute and deliver to Parent a mutually agreeable
common interest or joint defense or prosecution agreement regarding the
defense and/or prosecution of any Enforcement Action that is consistent with
the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.19. For purposes of this Agreement,
the term "Enforcement Action" shall include any appeals therefrom.

Section 6.20 IPO Conversion Plan.

(a) The Company hereby agrees that it shall (i) reasonably promptly (but in no
event later than ten (10) Business Days) following the receipt of the Approval
Order, approve the IPO Conversion Plan, (ii) reasonably promptly (but in no
event later than ten (10) Business Days) following written request of Parent,
deliver notice to Oncor of the Company's intent to undertake the IPO
Conversion pursuant to the IPO Conversion Plan (the "IPO Conversion Plan
Notice") and (iii) undertake the steps of the IPO Conversion Plan reasonably
requested by Parent.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6.7, all reasonable
out-of-pocket Costs incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(including those of its Representatives) after the date of this Agreement in
connection with (i) this Section 6.20, (ii) the IPO Conversion Plan or (iii)
delivery of the IPO Conversion Plan Notice to Oncor, shall be paid, or
reimbursed, by Parent in immediately available funds within thirty (30) days
of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms (except if
the Company or EFIH terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.3(e) or
Section 8.3(f), in which event no amounts shall be payable by Parent and other
than any Costs arising from a material breach by the Company or EFIH of its
respective obligations under this Agreement (including under Section 6.19 and
this Section 6.20) or the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
Company or EFIH in connection with such matters. Parent and Merger Sub shall
be responsible for their own Costs in connection

91 

with (i) this Section 6.20, (ii) the IPO Conversion Plan or (iii) delivery of
the IPO Conversion Plan Notice to Oncor.

(c) Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and
its and their respective Representatives, if this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms from and against any and all Costs suffered or
reasonably incurred by them in connection with (i) this Section 6.20, (ii) the
IPO Conversion Plan, or (iii) delivery of the IPO Conversion Plan Notice to
Oncor, other than any Costs arising from a material breach by the Company or
EFIH of its respective obligations under this Agreement (including under
Section 6.19 and this Section 6.20) or from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Company or EFIH in connection with such matters.

Section 6.21 Oncor Entities.

(a) Each of the Company and EFIH covenants that it will exercise its rights to
consent and vote (if any) under the Oncor Agreements as direct or indirect
equity owners of the Oncor Entities in a manner intended to cause the Oncor
Entities to comply with each of their respective covenants and agreements set
forth in the Oncor Letter Agreement, the Investor Rights Agreement and under
applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledge and agree that neither the Company nor EFIH shall be required, in
connection with such party's obligations under this Section 6.21, and their
reasonable best efforts shall not include any obligation, to (A) pay any
amounts to the Oncor Entities or any other Person or incur any liabilities or
other obligation, (B) execute or enter into or perform any new agreement
(other than an agreement contemplated hereby or in the Plan of Reorganization
or that confirms or makes effective its obligations hereunder), or (C) breach
any Law or commence any Action against any Person, including any of the Oncor
Entities or their respective officers and managers, other than the Enforcement
Action.

(b) Each of the Company and EFIH shall, and shall cause each of their
respective Subsidiaries to not permit Oncor Holdings to take, or permit Oncor
to take, any of the actions set forth in the Oncor Holdings LLC Agreement or
the Oncor LLC Agreement, in each case that require the approval or consent of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

Section 6.22 Financing.

(a) Prior to the date hereof, Parent has provided the Company with a
description of the potential debt financing (the "Debt Financing") and equity
financing (the "Equity Financing" and together with the Debt Financing, the
"Financing") it may incur in order to raise proceeds sufficient to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Prior to the earlier of the
Closing Date and the Termination Date, the Company agrees to use reasonable
best efforts to provide, and to use reasonable best efforts to cause its
Subsidiaries (other than Oncor Entities, subject to Section 6.21) and their
respective officers and employees to provide, reasonable cooperation in
connection with the arrangement of the Financing; provided that, Parent shall
use reasonable best



92 

efforts to provide the Company with notice of any information needed by Parent
as soon as reasonably practicable. The Company's reasonable best efforts
contemplated by this Section 6.22 include the following: (i) assisting with
the preparation of customary materials for rating agencies and rating agency
presentations, offering documents, private placement memoranda, bank
information memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents required in
connection with the Financing, together with procuring customary authorization
letters authorizing the distribution of information to prospective lenders or
investors (which customary authorization letters shall be required
notwithstanding the reasonable best efforts standard required of the Company
above); (ii) furnishing (x) all information and data reasonably requested by
Parent to prepare all pro forma financial statements customary in connection

(which, for the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall require financial
information otherwise required by Rule 3-10 and Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X
(provided that information with respect to assets, liabilities, revenue and
EBITDA with respect to non-guarantors in the aggregate shall be provided) or

arranging the Financing has reasonably requested, including under applicable

letters, releases of liens and other instruments of termination or discharge
reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the repayment of

unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its

(b) From and after the date hereof until the earlier of the Termination Date

the Company and EFIH acknowledge that their cooperation obligations set forth

to cooperate with any such efforts, provided such cooperation obligations are
limited to those set forth in Section 6.22(a).

(c) Prior to the Closing Date, none of the Company, its Subsidiaries and its
and their respective Representatives shall be required to take any action that
would subject such Person to actual or potential liability, to bear any cost

payment or incur any other liability or provide or agree to provide any
indemnity in connection with the Financing or their performance of their
respective obligations under this Section 6.22 or any information utilized in

6.22. The Company hereby consents to the use of the logos of the Company and
its Subsidiaries in connection with the Financing; provided that such logos

harm or disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the reputation or
goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(d) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the consummation by
Parent of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Plan of
Reorganization is not conditional upon the consummation of, or the receipt by
Parent or Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates of the proceeds of, the
Financing.

Article VII

Conditions

Section 7.1 Conditions to All Parties' Obligations. The obligations of each
party to effect the Closing are subject to the satisfaction or mutual waiver
(as determined by the Company and, to the extent EFIH would be adversely
affected by the Company's actions, EFIH, on the one hand, and by Parent, on
the other hand) of the following conditions at or prior to the Closing:

(a) Bankruptcy Orders. The Bankruptcy Court shall have entered (in a form
which is not materially inconsistent, in any substantive legal or economic
respect, with the rights and obligations of the Company or EFIH or Parent or
Merger Sub hereunder or in the Plan of Reorganization) (i) the order of the
Bankruptcy Court approving this Agreement, including, among other things,
approval of the Termination Fee and the Company\'s and EFIH\'s entry into and
performance of their obligations under this Agreement and the related
agreements (the "Approval Order"); (ii) an order, in form reasonably
satisfactory to Parent, confirming the Plan of Reorganization with respect to
the E-Side Debtors and authorizing all of the transactions and agreements
contemplated by this Agreement (the "EFH Confirmation Order"); and (iii) an
order confirming the Plan of Reorganization with respect to the TCEH Debtors,
which in each case shall be in full force and effect and not subject to any
stay.

(b) Orders. No court or other Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction
shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any Law or order
(whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that is in effect and restrains,
enjoins, renders illegal or otherwise prohibits consummation of the Closing
Date Transactions.

(c) Opinion of Counsel with respect to the Reorganized TCEH Spin-Off. By the
time of the Reorganized TCEH Spin-off the Company and Reorganized TCEH shall
have obtained an opinion of nationally recognized counsel or accounting firm
selected by the Company in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the
Company and Parent at a "should" or higher level, to the effect that the
Reorganized TCEH Contributions, Reorganized TCEH Conversion and Reorganized
TCEH Spin-Off meet the requirements of Sections 368(a)(1)(G), 355 and 356 of
the Code and including the Fundamental Opinions listed in Exhibit I; provided
however, that if the Fundamental Rulings of Exhibit I in respect of section
368 continuity of interest, active trade or business, section 355 continuity
of interest, and/or section 355(d) cannot be obtained because insufficient
information is available regarding the reorganization of the E-Side Debtors,
but all other conditions to the Closing have been satisfied, then the opinion
may assume such provisions are satisfied by the provision of a representation
that the Company and its Subsidiaries has no plan or intention to enter into
any transaction that is inconsistent with the Intended Tax-Free Treatment. In
rendering such opinion, the party providing the opinion shall be permitted to
rely upon reasonable representations, including a representation that the
Company and its Subsidiaries have no plan or intention at the time of the
Reorganized TCEH Spin-Off to take any action that is inconsistent with the
Intended Tax-Free Treatment.



95 



(d) TCEH Separation. The Reorganized TCEH Spin-Off shall have occurred in all
material respects in accordance with the Plan of Reorganization and the
Private Letter Ruling.

(e) Closing Debt. Assuming the Closing Date Transactions are consummated,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Oncor
Entities) will have any indebtedness for borrowed money immediately following
the Effective Time.

(f) Private Letter Rulings. The Initial Private Letter Ruling shall remain in
full force and effect and shall not have been revoked or withdrawn, and the
Supplemental Rulings shall have been obtained by the Company from the IRS in a
form reasonably satisfactory to Parent; provided, however, that (A) a
particular ruling that, in the reasonable determination of Parent covers
substantially the same subject matter as any one or more of the Supplemental
Rulings set forth in Exhibit I shall not be grounds for concluding that the
Supplemental Rulings (collectively) are not reasonably satisfactory to Parent
due to its failure to include such ruling, (B) in the event a specific
Supplemental Ruling set forth in Exhibit I is not given because the IRS
communicates that there is no significant issue with respect to the requested
ruling, the absence of such ruling shall not, standing alone (or collectively)
be grounds for concluding the Supplemental Rulings (collectively) are not
reasonably satisfactory to Parent provided that Parent, and unless waived by
Parent, the Company, obtain an opinion of nationally recognized tax counsel,
in form and substance acceptable to Parent, at a "will" level with respect to
the issue that was initially requested pursuant to the Supplemental Ruling
Request, or (C) a pre-filing agreement (including an agreement in accordance
with Revenue Procedure 2016-30) or closing agreement with the IRS shall be
acceptable in lieu of such specific Supplemental Ruling set forth in Exhibit
I, provided that such agreement is both (i) binding on the IRS to the same
degree as a private letter ruling or is otherwise acceptable to Parent in its
reasonable discretion and (ii) contains, in the reasonable determination of
Parent conclusions that are substantially similar, and have substantially the
same practical effect, to those contained in the specific rulings initially
requested pursuant to the Supplemental Ruling Requests.

(g) Tax Matters Agreement. Prior to, but contingent upon the Reorganized TCEH
Spin-Off, the Tax Matters Agreement shall have been entered into between the
Company and Reorganized TCEH, in accordance with the terms hereof and the Plan
of Reorganization, shall be in full force and effect and shall not have been
amended, modified or supplemented without the consent of Parent.

(h) Split Participant Agreement. Prior to, but contingent upon the Reorganized
TCEH Spin-Off, the Split Participant Agreement, shall have been entered into
between Oncor and Reorganized TCEH, in accordance with the terms hereof, the
Plan of Reorganization and the Oncor Letter Agreement, shall be in full force
and effect and shall not have been amended, modified or supplemented without
the consent of Parent.

(i) NYSE Listing and SEC Registration. The shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable pursuant to this Agreement shall have been approved for listing on
the NYSE, subject only to official notice of issuance, shall be freely
saleable and not subject to any

96 

resale restrictions except to the extent such restrictions are due to the
status of the holder thereof, and either (i) the Form S-4, or other
registration statement as applicable, shall have become and continue to be
effective under the Securities Act and shall not be the subject of any stop
order or proceedings seeking a stop order, and Parent shall have received the
state securities or "blue sky" authorizations necessary for the issuance of
the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued as the Stock Consideration or
(ii) the SEC shall have issued a favorable "no-action" letter to the effect
that the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act

Oncor and Oncor Holdings in the Oncor Letter Agreement shall be true and
correct in all respects on the date hereof and as of the Closing as though
made on and as of such date and time (except where any failures of any such

the aggregate, would, or would be reasonably expected to have a material and
adverse effect on, or change in, the condition (financial or otherwise),
business, assets, liabilities or results of operations (i) of Oncor and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii) of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken

from McDermott, Will and Emery LLP. In rendering such opinion, such tax counsel
providing the opinion shall be permitted to rely upon reasonable
representations, including a representation that the Company and its
Subsidiaries had no plan or intention at the time of the Reorganized TCEH
Spin-Off and that the Company and its Subsidiaries and Reorganized TCEH have
no intention at the time of the Merger to take, and did not take, any action

being, the "Termination Date"), provided, further, that, the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this clause (a) shall not be available to

(b) if any order of any court or other Governmental Entity permanently
restraining, enjoining, rendering illegal or otherwise prohibiting, directly
or indirectly, consummation of the Closing Date Transactions shall have become
final and non-appealable; provided, however, that the termination right in

become untrue after the date of this Agreement, as if, in each such case, such
representation or warranty were required by the Agreement to be true on and as
of each such date between the date hereof and the Closing Date, which breach
or failure of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement to be true or
to be performed (i) would result in a failure of a condition set forth in any
provision of Section 7.1 or Section 7.3 (which for the purpose of such clauses
it shall be assumed such breach is continuing as of the Closing) and (ii)
cannot be, or has not been, cured within thirty (30) Business Days after
Parent's receipt of written notice thereof from the Company or EFIH; provided,
however, that the termination right in this clause (a) shall not apply if

Parent, used commercially reasonable efforts to challenge before the
Bankruptcy Court) that is inconsistent with this Agreement or the Plan of
Reorganization;

(d) by the Company and EFIH (acting together) if the Chapter 11 Cases are
dismissed or converted to a case under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code and
neither such dismissal or conversion contemplates the Closing Date
Transactions; provided, that such dismissal or conversion was not proposed or
supported by the Company or EFIH (and which the Company and EFIH, to the
extent requested by Parent, used commercially reasonable efforts to challenge
before the Bankruptcy Court);

(e) until the entry of the EFH Confirmation Order, by the Company if
concurrently with such termination, the Company Board determines in its sole
discretion after consultation with its independent financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, and based on the advice of such counsel, that the
failure to terminate this Agreement is inconsistent with its fiduciary duties,
provided that a material breach of the Company's or EFIH's obligations under
Section 6.2 has not provided the basis for such determination;

(f) until the entry of the EFH Confirmation Order, by EFIH if concurrently
with such termination, the board of managers of EFIH determines in its sole
discretion after consultation with its independent financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, and based on the advice of such counsel, that the
failure to terminate this Agreement is inconsistent with its fiduciary duties,
provided that a material breach of the Company's or EFIH's obligations under
Section 6.2 has not provided the basis for such determination; or

(g) by the Company and EFIH (acting together) upon any termination of the Plan
Support Agreement in accordance with its terms as to the Company, EFIH, Parent
or Merger Sub.

Section 8.4 Termination by Parent. This Agreement may be terminated at any
time prior to the Closing by Parent:

(a) if there has been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement made by the Company and/or EFIH in this Agreement, or any such
representation or warranty shall have become untrue after the date of this
Agreement, as if, in each such case, such representation or warranty were
required by the Agreement to be true on and as of each such date between the
date hereof and the Closing Date, which

103 

breach or failure of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement to be
true or to be performed (i) would result in a failure of a condition set forth
in any provision of Section 7.1 or Section 7.2 (which for the purpose of such
clauses it shall be assumed such breach is continuing as of the Closing), and
(ii) cannot be or has not been cured within thirty (30) Business Days after
the Company's or EFIH's receipt of written notice thereof from Parent;
provided, however, that the termination right in this clause (a) shall not
apply if either Parent or Merger Sub is then in breach of this Agreement or
the Oncor Letter Agreement in a manner that would result or has resulted in
any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 or Section 7.3 not being
satisfied;

(b) if there has been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement made by Oncor or Oncor Holdings under the Oncor Letter Agreement, or
any such representation or warranty shall have become untrue after the date of
this Agreement, as if, in each such case, such representation or warranty were
required by the Agreement to be true on and as of each such date between the
date hereof and the Closing Date, which breach or failure of a representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement to be true or to be performed (i) would result
in a failure of a condition set forth in any provision of Section 7.1 or
Section 7.2 (which for the purpose of such clauses it shall be assumed such
breach is continuing as of the Closing) and (ii) cannot be or has not been
cured within thirty (30) Business Days after the Company's, EFIH's, Oncor's
and Oncor Holdings' receipt of written notice thereof from Parent; provided,
however, that the termination right in this clause (b) shall not apply if
either Parent or Merger Sub is then in breach of this Agreement or the Oncor
Letter Agreement in a manner that would result or has resulted in any of the
conditions set forth in Section 7.1 or Section 7.3 not being satisfied;

(c) if the Company and/or EFIH fail to consummate the Closing on or prior to
the date required by Section 1.4; provided, however, that the termination
right in this clause (c) shall not apply if either Parent nor Merger Sub is
then in breach of this Agreement or the Oncor Letter Agreement in a manner
that would result or has resulted in the failure to consummate the Closing;

(d) if the Company or EFIH files or expressly supports in the Bankruptcy Court
a plan of reorganization that is inconsistent in any substantive legal or
economic respect with this Agreement and the Plan of Reorganization (solely as
it the Plan of Reorganization relates to the E-Side Debtors) and such
inconsistency cannot be or has not been cured within thirty (30) Business Days
after the Company's or EFIH's receipt of written notice thereof from Parent
(which notice must occur within five (5) Business Days of the filing of such
Plan);

(e) if the Bankruptcy Court enters an order, or if the Company or EFIH files a
motion seeking entry of an order, approving any sale or other disposition
(other than a sale or other disposition permitted by this Agreement) of (i)
any material portion of the assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries or (ii)
any equity interests in EFIH or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Oncor
Entities), to any Person(s) other than Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates (excluding those Subsidiaries to be transferred to



104 

Reorganized TCEH or disposed of, in each case pursuant to this Agreement
and/or the Plan of Reorganization);

(f) if a trustee is appointed in the Chapter 11 Cases pursuant to Section 1104
of the Bankruptcy Code;

(g) if any Chapter 11 Case, other than the cases relating to (i) LSGT Gas
Company LLC, (ii) EECI, Inc., (iii) EEC Holdings, Inc., and (iv) LSGT SACROC,
Inc., is dismissed or converted to a case under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy
Code and neither such dismissal or conversion contemplates the Closing Date
Transactions and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

(h) if the Bankruptcy Court orders the substantive consolidation of (i) the
chapter 11 estates of the Company and/or EFIH and/or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, on one hand, with (ii) the chapter 11 estates of EFCH and/or any
of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand;

(i) upon any termination of the Plan Support Agreement in accordance with its
terms as to the Company, EFIH, Parent or Merger Sub;

(j) if the Bankruptcy Court does not enter an order approving this Agreement
within forty-five (45) days of the date of this Agreement; or

(k) if Parent, Merger Sub, Oncor and Oncor Holdings fail to enter into the
Oncor Letter Agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit K
within seven (7) days following the date hereof; provided however if Parent
has not terminated this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.4(k) thirteen
(13) days after such seven (7) day period elapses, this Section 8.4(k) shall
be of no further force and effect and Parent shall have no such right to
terminate this Agreement.

Section 8.5 Effect of Termination and Abandonment.

(a) In the event of a termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Article
VIII, this Agreement shall become void and of no further force or effect and
no party shall have any liability to any other party hereto (or of any of its
Representatives or Affiliates) with respect hereto; provided, however, and
notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, that, (i) this
Section 8.5(a) and the provisions set forth in the second sentence of Section
9.1 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the parties hereto may
have further liability with respect thereto, and (ii) liability may exist for
willful or intentional breaches of this Agreement (where willful or
intentional breach means a breach of this Agreement by a party that has actual
knowledge that its action (or failure to act) would reasonably be expected to
breach this Agreement) by a party prior to the time of such termination and,
in the case of Parent and Merger Sub, any failure to have sufficient
immediately available funds at the Closing for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (which liability the parties
hereto acknowledge and agree shall not be limited to reimbursement of expenses
or out-of-pocket costs).



105 



(b) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Article VIII and any
alternative transaction is consummated (including any transaction or
proceeding that permits the E-Side Debtors that are the direct or indirect
owners of Oncor Holdings to emerge from the Chapter 11 Cases) pursuant to
which neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates will obtain direct or indirect
ownership of 100% of Oncor Holdings and Oncor Holdings' approximately 80%
equity interest in Oncor, then, subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy
Court, no later than five (5) days following the consummation of such
alternative transaction, the Company and EFIH shall pay to Parent the
Termination Fee (as defined below), by wire transfer, as directed by Parent,
in immediately available funds; provided, however, that the Termination Fee
(as defined below) will not be payable if this Agreement is terminated (i)
pursuant to Section 8.1, (ii) by Parent pursuant to Section 8.2(a) and the
receipt of the PUCT Approval (without the imposition of a Burdensome
Condition) is the only condition set forth in Article VII not satisfied or
waived in accordance with this Agreement (other than those conditions that by
their nature or pursuant to the terms of this Agreement are to be satisfied at
the Closing) or 8.2(b), or 8.4(g) (unless the Chapter 11 Cases are dismissed
or converted to Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code with respect to the Company
or EFIH in which case the Termination Fee is payable) or Section 8.4(i) if the
Plan Support Agreement is terminated pursuant to a breach thereof by Parent or
Merger Sub, or (iii) by the Company pursuant to Section 8.3(a), 8.3(b), or
8.3(g) to the extent that the Plan Support Agreement is terminated pursuant to
a breach thereof by Parent or Merger Sub. In the event the Company and EFIH
pay the Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 8.5(b), such payment shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub against the Company,
EFIH and their respective Affiliates, Representatives, creditors or
shareholders with respect to any breach of this Agreement prior to such
termination. Subject to the Bankruptcy Court's approval of the Termination
Fee, the Company's and EFIH's obligation to pay the Termination Fee pursuant
to this Section 8.5(b) shall survive the termination of this Agreement. The
Termination Fee, to the extent approved by the Bankruptcy Court, shall
constitute an administrative expense of the Company and EFIH under the
Bankruptcy Code. "Termination Fee" shall mean an amount equal to $275,000,000,
inclusive of all expense reimbursements, including reasonable and documented
professional fees of Parent and Merger Sub; provided that, in no event shall
such claim be senior or pari passu with the superpriority administrative
claims granted to the secured parties pursuant to the DIP Facility (as in
effect on the date hereof).

(c) The parties hereto acknowledge that the agreements contained in this
Section 8.5 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the parties hereto would not
enter into this Agreement.

Section 9.7 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including any exhibits or
schedules hereto including as actually executed), the Company Disclosure
Letter, the Parent Disclosure Letter, the Oncor Letter Agreement, the Plan
Support Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement, dated June 1, 2016, by and
among Parent, the Company and EFIH and, pursuant to a Joinder dated June 1,
2016, Oncor (the "Confidentiality Agreement") and the other agreements named
herein constitute the entire agreement of the parties hereto with respect to
the subject matter hereof, and cancel, merge and supersede all other prior or
contemporaneous oral or written agreements, understandings, representations
and warranties both written and oral, among the parties hereto, with respect
to the subject matter hereof. EACH PARTY HERETO AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PLAN SUPPORT
AGREEMENT AND THE ONCOR LETTER AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARENT AND MERGER SUB NOR
THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES MAKES ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES, AND EACH HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OR AS TO THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY OTHER
INFORMATION, MADE BY, OR MADE AVAILABLE BY, ITSELF OR ANY OF ITS
REPRESENTATIVES, WITH RESPECT TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THE NEGOTIATION,
EXECUTION OR DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY
THIS AGREEMENT, NOTWITHSTANDING THE DELIVERY OR DISCLOSURE TO THE OTHER OR THE
OTHER'S REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY DOCUMENTATION OR OTHER INFORMATION WITH RESPECT
TO ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE FOREGOING.

Section 9.8 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as provided in Section 6.8,
and Section 6.12, Parent, Merger Sub, EFIH and the Company hereby agree that
their respective representations, warranties and covenants set forth herein
are solely for the benefit of the other parties hereto, in accordance with and
subject to the terms of this Agreement, and this Agreement is not intended to,
and does not, confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights
or remedies hereunder, including the right to rely upon the representations
and warranties set forth herein. The parties hereto further agree that the
rights of third party beneficiaries under Section 6.8 shall not arise unless
and until the Effective Time occurs. The representations and warranties in
this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and
are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. In some instances, the
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters
regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Consequently,
Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the



110 

representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

Section 9.9 Obligations of Parent. Whenever this Agreement requires a
Subsidiary of Parent, including Merger Sub, to take any action, such
requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to
cause such Subsidiary to take such action.

Section 9.10 Remedies. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement was not performed by
the Company, EFIH, Parent or Merger Sub in accordance with the terms hereof
and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy
therefor. As a result, prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Article VIII, each party shall be entitled to specific performance to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and of the terms hereof (including the obligation
to consummate the Closing Date Transactions and the other transactions
contemplated herein, subject to the terms and conditions hereof), without
proof of actual damages (and each party hereby waives any requirement for the
securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy) in addition to
any other remedy at law or equity. The parties hereto further agree not to
assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for
any such breach.

Section 9.11 Transfer Taxes. To the extent payable under applicable Law
(notwithstanding section 1146 of the Bankruptcy Code), all transfer,
documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other similar such Taxes and
fees (including penalties and interest) incurred in connection with the Merger
shall be paid by the Surviving Company when due.

Section 9.12 Definitions. Each term set forth in the Table of Defined Terms is
defined on the page of this Agreement set forth opposite such term.

Section 9.13 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule or Law, or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected
in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that
any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties hereto as closely
as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are fulfilled to the extent possible.

Section 9.14 Interpretation; Construction.

(a) The table of contents and headings herein are for convenience of reference
only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to
limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. Where a reference in
this Agreement is made to a section or exhibit, such reference shall be to a
section of or exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Such
exhibits are an integral part of this Agreement as if fully set forth herein.
Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this
Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words



111 

"without limitation." The words "hereof," "hereto," "hereby," "herein" and
"hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement. The term "made available" and words of similar import means that
the relevant documents, instruments or materials were either (i) posted and
made available to the other party or its designated Representatives on the
Intralinks due diligence data site maintained by the Company for purposes of
the transaction(s) contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) sent to the other
party or its representatives directly, or (iii) publicly available by virtue
of the relevant party's filing of a publicly available final registration
statement, prospectus, report, form, schedule or definitive proxy statement
filed with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, in each
case, at least five (5) Business Days prior to the date hereof or such prior
date with respect to which such documents, instruments or materials were
represented by a party to have been made available to the other party. The
words "shall" and "will" have the same meaning.

(b) The parties hereto have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting
this Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties hereto, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision
of this Agreement.

(c) Subject to the first paragraphs of Sections 5.1 and 5.2, respectively,
each of the Company, EFIH, Parent and Merger Sub has, or may have, set forth
information in its respective Disclosure Letter in a section thereof that
corresponds to the section of this Agreement to which it relates. The fact
that any item of information is disclosed in a Disclosure Letter to this
Agreement shall not be construed to mean that such information is required to
be disclosed by this Agreement.

Section 9.15 Assignment. This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation
of law or otherwise without the prior written consent of the non-assigning
parties hereto (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). Any purported assignment in violation of this Agreement is void.

Re: Offer to Purchase LLC Units

Ladies and Gentlemen:

Reference is made to (i) the Second Amended and Restated Limited Liability
Company Agreement of Oncor Electric Delivery Company LLC, dated as of November
5, 2008 (as amended, the "Oncor LLC Agreement"), among Oncor Electric Delivery
Holdings Company LLC ("Oncor Holdings"), Oncor Management Investment LLC
("Oncor Management") and Texas Transmission Investment LLC ("TTI") and (ii)
the Investor Rights Agreement, dated as of November 5, 2008 (the "Investor
Rights Agreement"), among Oncor Electric Delivery Company LLC ("Oncor"), Oncor
Holdings, TTI and Energy Future Holdings Corp. ("EFH"). Capitalized terms used
herein without definition have the respective meanings set forth in the
Investor Rights Agreement.

As you are aware, as of the date hereof, (i) EFH, Energy Future Intermediate
Holding Company LLC ("EFIH"), NextEra Energy Inc., a Florida corporation
("Parent") and EFH Merger Co., LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub") are entering into an
Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of the date hereof (the "Merger
Agreement"), a copy of which is attached as Exhibit A hereto, (ii) Parent,
EFH, EFIH, and certain of EFH's direct and indirect subsidiaries and certain
supporting creditors (each as set forth therein) are entering into a Plan
Support Agreement, and (iii) EFH and certain entities in which it, directly or
indirectly, holds an equity interest, including Texas Competitive Electric
Holdings Company LLC and Energy Future Competitive Holdings Company LLC and
their respective Subsidiaries (as defined in the Merger Agreement)
(collectively, the "Debtors"), are filing an amended plan of reorganization
under chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code, 11 U.S.C. § 101 et
seq. in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware and
jointly administered for procedural purposes only under Case No. 14-10979 (the
"Plan of Reorganization") that contemplates certain restructuring transactions
that include, among other things, the merger of reorganized EFH with and into
Merger Sub, with Merger Sub surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
(the "Merger"). The Plan of Reorganization, which is an integral element of
the Merger transaction is an exhibit to and incorporated as part of the Merger
Agreement.

This letter constitutes an EFH Sale Proposal and represents an offer to
purchase (i) all of the LLC Units in Oncor held indirectly by EFH, which
transaction will be implemented through the Merger, and (ii) all of the LLC
Units in Oncor that are owned by members of Oncor other than Oncor Holdings.
The final amount of consideration to consummate the Merger (including the
purchase of the LLC Units in Oncor held indirectly by EFH in connection
therewith) will be determined at the time of the Merger based on certain
adjustments provided for in the Merger Agreement and the Plan of
Reorganization and will be paid for in cash and Parent Common Stock (as
defined in the Merger Agreement) in accordance therewith. The consummation of
the transactions as contemplated by this EFH Sale Proposal will result in a
Change of Control.

The form of the purchase agreement to be entered into in order to provide for
the purchase and sale of the LLC Units held by members of Oncor other than
Oncor Holdings will be provided to TTI and Oncor Management prior to or
concurrently with the delivery by EFH of a Required Sale Notice as
contemplated by Section 3.3(a) of the Investor Rights Agreement. Such purchase
agreement will contain provisions that satisfy the conditions of Section
3.3(d) of the Investor Rights Agreement. Among other things, the form of
consideration to be paid to holders of LLC Units other than Oncor Holdings
will be cash and/or Parent Common Stock, and the amount of such consideration
will be at least equal to the amount of the purchase price for the LLC Units
held by TTI that is required pursuant to Section 3.3 of the Investor Rights
Agreement. Such purchase price will, among other things, be sufficient so that
TTI will achieve an IRR on its initial investment in the LLC Units which
exceeds the IRR Hurdle.

The purchase of LLC Units in accordance with this offer is a part of a merger
that when consummated at the Closing, will result in Parent owning more of the
equity interests in Oncor than the relevant Related Entity or its Affiliates.

We are available at your earliest convenience to address any questions that
you may have about our offer. We look forward to working with you to complete
the purchase contemplated hereby.

Exhibit C

IPO Conversion Plan

The following constitutes the "IPO Conversion Plan" that is expected to be
implemented in connection with or following the Merger at the election of
NextEra Energy, Inc. ("Parent") and its implementation shall constitute an
"IPO Conversion" as such term is defined in the Investor Rights Agreement. The
IPO Conversion Plan may be amended, modified or supplemented from time to time
by Parent subject to the prior written consent of the Company and EFIH (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Capitalized
terms used herein and not otherwise expressly defined shall have the meaning
set forth in the Agreement and Plan of Merger.

| 
---|--- 

1.

|

Parent will form a new entity ("IPO Corp"), which will initially be wholly-
owned and controlled, either directly or indirectly through Affiliate(s), by
Parent. 

| 
---|--- 

2.

|

IPO Corp will acquire a 100% controlling interest, and a minority economic
interest, in the Merger Sub, thereby indirectly owning a minority economic
interest in Oncor. 

| 
---|--- 

3.

|

Parent intends to cause IPO Corp to conduct an initial public offering ("IPO")
of a class of securities of IPO Corp ("IPO Securities"), which will represent
a minority of the voting interests in IPO Corp and an indirect minority
economic interest in Oncor. Assuming no exercise of the TTI Conversion
(defined below), immediately after the IPO, Parent, either directly or
indirectly through Affiliate(s), will own the remainder of the voting
interests and none of the economic interests in IPO Corp. 

| 
---|--- 

4.

|

Pursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement, TTI will have the right to transfer
all or a portion of its LLC Units (as such term is defined in the Investor
Rights Agreement) in Oncor for securities of IPO Corp to reflect its
proportionate economic and voting rights in Oncor (the "TTI Conversion"). 

| 
---|--- 

5.

|

Parent will have right to exchange interests in Merger Sub for securities of
IPO Corp, including IPO Securities. 

| 
---|--- 

6.

|

Notwithstanding the IPO and/or the TTI Conversion, Parent will have control of
IPO Corp and Merger Sub, either directly or indirectly through Affiliate(s).

SCHEDULE I

POST-RETIREMENT WELFARE BENEFITS

WHEREAS, that certain Agreement entered into by and between TXU Electric
Delivery Company, a Texas corporation, and TXU Energy Company LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company, dated March 10, 2005 (the "Original Agreement") set
forth certain provisions regarding the allocation to Oncor of a portion of the
cost for post-retirement welfare benefits to be provided to Split Participants
(which benefits are currently provided under the Oncor Retiree Welfare Plan
but which benefits may be provided through a successor plan to the Oncor
Retiree Welfare Plan in the future (such plan, together with any such
successor plan (but not including the OSPP (as defined below)), collectively
referred to as the "Oncor Plan")) to certain current and future eligible Split
Participants as listed on Exhibit A to the Administration Manual (as defined
in Section 4 below) who are eligible for a retiree benefits subsidy as of the
date hereof, as such Exhibit A may be amended from time to time in accordance
with the provisions of the Administration Manual (the "Oncor Plan Split
Participants");

WHEREAS, that certain Split Participant Agreement entered into by and between
Oncor and EFH, dated April 28, 2014 and effective July 1, 2014 (the "2014
Agreement") modified the Original Agreement;

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Original Agreement, as modified by the 2014
Agreement, Oncor is obligated to fund that portion of the welfare benefit
costs for the Oncor Plan Split Participants with respect to such Oncor Plan
Split Participants' service allocated to Oncor under the Aon Hewitt Welfare
Letter, and EFH is obligated to fund the remaining welfare benefit costs of
the Oncor Plan Split Participants, in each case, less the Oncor Plan Split
Participants' contributions;

WHEREAS, pursuant to the 2014 Agreement, beginning on January 1, 2015, Oncor
began administering the Oncor Plan, and EFH agreed to pay Oncor for EFH's
portion of the costs associated with providing welfare benefits coverage for
the Oncor Plan Split Participants (including certain administrative costs);

WHEREAS, as a result of the Separation and the Transfer, Oncor and RTCEH will
not be under "common control" within the meaning of Section 414(c) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or part of a "control
group" within the meaning of Section 3(40)(B)(ii) of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA");

WHEREAS, as a result of the lack of common control under ERISA, among other
things, the Oncor Plan could be a multiple employer welfare arrangement as
defined in Section 3(40) of ERISA (a "MEWA") treated as self-insured for
purposes of the Texas Insurance Code if both RTCEH and Oncor were to continue
to fund the Oncor Plan as described in the 2014 Agreement beyond the
Separation and Transfer;

WHEREAS, the Parties desire to amend and restate within this Schedule I the
2014 Agreement to: (a) provide for the establishment of a separate post-
retirement welfare benefit plan for the benefit of the Oncor Plan Split
Participants that is a "fully-insured" plan; (b) permit





5 

the subsequent conversion of such fully-insured plan to a "self-funded" or
"partially-funded" plan if a written and binding advisory opinion from the
Employee Benefits Security Administration of the U.S. Department of Labor
("DOL") is issued to the effect that the Oncor Split Participant Plan is not a
MEWA as defined in 3(40) of ERISA (such "fully-insured" and/or "self-funded"
or "partially-funded" plan is hereinafter referred to as the "Oncor Split
Participant Plan" or "OSPP"); and (c) set forth the funding obligations of
RTCEH and Oncor under the OSPP; and WHEREAS, it is the intention of the
Parties that RTCEH's and Oncor's obligations with respect to the costs of
post-retirement welfare benefits for the Oncor Plan Split Participants under
the OSPP shall continue to be allocated in a manner consistent with the past
practices of Oncor and EFH under the Oncor Plan prior to the Separation and
the Transfer and in accordance with the Aon Hewitt Welfare Letter.

NOW, THEREFORE, the Parties hereby agree as follows:

| 
---|--- 

1.

|

Transition Period. Oncor will continue to provide medical (including
prescription drug coverage), vision, life insurance and dental benefits to the
Oncor Plan Split Participants, to the extent eligible, under the Oncor Plan,
on the same terms and conditions as heretofore provided under the Oncor Plan
(including on a self-insured basis for purposes of medical, prescription drug,
and dental coverage) through the last day of the calendar year following the
year of the Separation and Transfer, or such earlier date as determined in
Oncor's discretion (the "Transition Period"), provided however, that Oncor
shall have given advance written notice to RTCEH of such earlier date not less
than ninety (90) days prior to such date. During the Transition Period, RTCEH
shall pay its portion of (i) the aggregate benefit obligation costs, subject
to the cap established by EFH in 2012 (as further described in the
Administration Manual (as defined below) and the memorandum from Aon Hewitt to
EFH, dated August 7, 2015 (the "Aon Memorandum"), attached hereto as Exhibit
I-B), with respect to medical, prescription drug, vision, life insurance and
dental benefits for each Oncor Plan Split Participant, and (ii) the
Administrative Costs (as defined below), each of the foregoing as allocated
pursuant to the Aon Hewitt Welfare Letter and historical practice between
Oncor and EFH except, in each instance, as may be provided otherwise in the
Administration Manual. During the Transition Period, RTCEH shall not amend or
terminate the amount of its contribution (determined consistent with the Aon
Hewitt Welfare Letter) that it provides for Oncor Plan Split Participant
benefit obligation costs. 

| 
---|--- 

2.

|

Establishment of Separate Oncor Split Participant Plan. 

| 
---|--- 

a.

|

Effective no later than immediately following the end of the Transition
Period, Oncor shall have established, with insurers selected by Oncor, a
separate fully-insured post-retirement welfare benefit plan for the Oncor Plan
Split Participants and shall have transferred the liabilities associated with
such fully-insured plan from the Oncor Plan to the OSPP. 

| 
---|--- 

b.

|

At any time, either Party may apply for a written and binding advisory opinion
from the DOL to the effect that the OSPP or a similar alternative

post-retirement welfare benefit arrangement is not, or would not be, a MEWA.
In the event that such requested advisory opinion is obtained to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Parties, the Parties may mutually agree to
convert the funding status of the OSPP from a fully-insured arrangement to a
"self-funded" or "partially-funded" arrangement.

3\. Coverage and Benefits under the Oncor Split Participant Plan.

a. No later than immediately following the end of the Transition Period, to
the extent an Oncor Plan Split Participant is or would otherwise become
eligible for medical (including prescription drug coverage), vision, dental,
and life insurance benefits under the Oncor Plan according to its terms in
effect as of the end of the Transition Period, such Oncor Plan Split
Participant shall be or will become eligible for such benefits under the OSPP.
Subject to Section 9, Oncor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to offer
benefits under the OSPP that are in the aggregate substantially equivalent to
those benefits offered to former Oncor employees who are retirees under the
Oncor Plan ("Substantial Coverage Equivalence"); provided, however that
Oncor's obligations pursuant to this sentence shall be deemed satisfied if it
(i) determines, in its sole but good faith judgment, that no available
insurance product provides Substantial Coverage Equivalence and (ii) offers an
insurance product that, in its sole but good faith judgment, provides benefits
that are as close as reasonably possible to Substantial Coverage Equivalence.
The determination of Substantial Coverage Equivalence shall not take into
account any incremental cost attributable to the OSPP's status as a fully-
insured plan when compared to the Oncor Plan's status as a self-insured
arrangement. Oncor shall be deemed to comply with this Section 3(a) if both:
(i) Oncor determines, in its sole but good faith judgment, that the cost to
the Oncor Plan Split Participants of benefits that provide Substantial
Coverage Equivalence is unduly burdensome to the Oncor Plan Split
Participants, and (ii) Oncor instead provides such benefit options based on
and reflecting the Oncor Subsidy (as defined below) that, in Oncor's sole but
good faith judgment, are collectively in the best interests of the Oncor Plan
Split Participants. Nothing in this Section 3 shall diminish Oncor's
obligations under Section 9.

| 
---|--- 

b.

|

As further set forth in the Administration Manual, Oncor shall timely provide
to RTCEH information on the benefits and coverages to be provided under the
OSPP, including any changes in benefits, as compared to the benefits provided
to former Oncor employees who are retirees under the Oncor Plan. Any active
employees who will be eligible for benefits under the OSPP following
retirement will not be eligible for such benefits under any welfare plans
maintained by RTCEH after retirement so long as this Schedule I is in effect.
Active employees who are future eligible Oncor Plan Split Participants shall
continue to be credited with service for purposes of determining the premium
subsidies provided to them by 

 





7 

Oncor and RTCEH for post-retirement welfare benefits in accordance with the
practice in effect for such crediting of service as of the date of this
Agreement. Oncor shall for all purposes, including those relating to the Oncor
Plan Split Participants, be the sponsor of the OSPP, and Oncor or its designee
shall be the plan administrator for the OSPP. In no event shall Oncor be (i)
limited in any way in offering benefits to participants under any of its other
plans as it determines, in its sole but good faith judgment, or (ii) required
to incur any expense related to benefits offered to Oncor Plan Split
Participants that is greater than has been determined reasonable by the Public
Utility Commission of Texas pursuant to Section 36.065 of the Texas Utilities
Code (the Public Utility Regulatory Act (PURA)).

4\. Allocation of Costs under the Oncor Plan and the Oncor Split Participant
Plan.

| 
---|--- 

a.

|

The Aon Hewitt Welfare Letter describes the current and past practices of
allocating the costs associated with providing post-retirement welfare benefit
coverage for the Oncor Plan Split Participants between Oncor and EFH,
including the practices prior to the Separation and the Transfer, and the
Parties agree that such practices will be continued by RTCEH and Oncor
following the Separation and the Transfer for so long as this Schedule I is in
effect except as otherwise provided herein or in the Administration Manual.
RTCEH and Oncor will each continue to pay its own portion of the costs
(including Administrative Costs, as defined below) associated with providing
welfare benefit coverage for the Oncor Plan Split Participants according to
the allocations set forth in the Aon Hewitt Welfare Letter subject to both:
(i) as to the RTCEH portion of the costs, the cap described in the
Administration Manual and the Aon Memorandum; and (ii) the ability of RTCEH
and Oncor to reduce the amount of their respective contributions in accordance
with the provisions described in this Agreement. 

| 
---|--- 

b.

|

Following the Transition Period, RTCEH shall not amend or terminate the amount
of the contribution it provides for Oncor Plan Split Participant premium
subsidies unless it provides at least one hundred fifty (150) days' notice to
Oncor and such advanced notice to Oncor Plan Split Participants as required by
any applicable law of such amendment or termination, and provided that such
amendment or termination may only become effective as of the first day of a
plan year. RTCEH shall be fully responsible for any additional administrative
expenses that may be incurred by Oncor as a result of RTCEH's amendment and
termination of the premium subsidies it provides to the Oncor Plan Split
Participants. 

c. For each plan year that the OSPP is a fully-insured arrangement, RTCEH will
pay Oncor for RTCEH's share of the costs associated with providing post-
retirement welfare benefits to the Oncor Plan Split Participants (including
the annual premium, Administrative Costs and the Overhead Fee, as defined
below) calculated using the methodologies described in the Aon Hewitt Welfare
Letter in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 4 and the
administration manual attached hereto as Exhibit I-C containing details
regarding the operations and administration of the Oncor Plan during the
Transition Period and the OSPP following the Transition







8 

Period, developed and mutually agreed to by the Parties and as amended from
time to time by written consent of the Parties to the extent specified therein
(the "Administration Manual"). Oncor shall invoice RTCEH monthly for RTCEH's
monthly premium subsidy, and monthly share of the Administrative Costs and
Overhead Fee. Each invoice shall have sufficient details as to the
Administrative Costs as to allow RTCEH to identify and reconcile its share of
the Administrative Costs. RTCEH will pay Oncor any undisputed amount of an
invoice within thirty (30) days of receipt and disputed amounts shall be
reconciled in accordance with the dispute resolution process set forth in the
Administration Manual.

d. As further set forth in the Administration Manual, Oncor will perform
periodic true-up calculations of RTCEH's aggregate premium subsidies paid to
Oncor. Oncor will notify RTCEH in writing of the results of these true-up
calculations promptly after the calculations are completed and will, upon
request, provide RTCEH with the information relied upon to make its
calculations. As further set forth in the Administration Manual, Oncor will
also perform periodic true-up calculations of RTCEH's share of the
Administrative Costs paid to Oncor. Oncor shall keep and retain full and
accurate records relating to the calculation of RTCEH's aggregate premium
subsidies, the Administrative Costs including RTCEH's allocable share of such
costs, vendor invoices, insurance carrier statements and any true-up
calculations (the "SPA Records"). Oncor shall preserve such SPA Records for
each calendar year for seven (7) calendar years following the end of such
calendar year. During such period, RTCEH or its agents shall have the right,
at RTCEH's sole expense, to review such SPA Records during Oncor's normal
business hours, provided that such right may be exercised by RTCEH no more
than once per calendar year. For any year that the OSPP is a self-insured
arrangement or is a partially fully-insured and partially self-insured
arrangement, the Parties agree that the terms of the Administration Manual
shall govern the payment, subsidy and true-up calculations associated with the
OSPP. Any disputed amounts shall be reconciled in accordance with the dispute
resolution process set forth in the Administration Manual, provided, however,
that RTCEH must notify Oncor of any disputed amounts by within two (2) years
after receipt of a true-up calculation. After two (2) years from receipt of a
true-up calculation, RTCEH may not dispute any item in such true-up
calculation and Oncor will have no obligation to make any reimbursements
pursuant to such true-up calculation.

| 
---|--- 

e.

|

For purposes of this Schedule I, "Administrative Costs" shall mean with
respect to the plan under which the Oncor Plan Split Participants are being
provided with post-retirement welfare benefits, the total annual amount of
administrative costs and expenses incurred by Oncor, relating to Oncor Plan
Split Participants, in sponsoring, maintaining and administering the Oncor
Plan or the OSPP (as applicable), including without limitation, proportionate
costs associated with communications to Oncor Plan Split Participants, third
party vendor/benefit provider administrative costs and costs of legal
compliance (e.g., preparing Form 5500s, summaries of benefits and coverage,
summary plan descriptions, summary annual reports and other applicable
reporting and disclosure requirements), set-up and other costs associated with
creating and adopting the OSPP, costs associated with developing an open 

 





9 

enrollment process for Oncor Plan Split Participants and calculating premium
subsidies, and external actuarial, legal, consulting and accounting fees and
costs of Oncor in sponsoring, maintaining and administering the Oncor Plan or
the OSPP (as applicable).

| 
---|--- 

f.

|

Commencing on January 1 following the date of this Agreement, in addition 

to the Administrative Costs described above, RTCEH will pay Oncor an annual
administration fee as set forth in the Administration Manual to cover a
portion of administrative overhead expenses Oncor incurs with respect to
maintenance of the Oncor Plan or the OSPP (as applicable) (the "Overhead
Fee").

| 
---|--- 

5\.

|

Administration. Oncor shall in all respects be responsible for the customary
administration of retiree welfare benefits for the Oncor Plan Split
Participants. For the avoidance of doubt, such administration services shall
include but may not be limited to: benefit distributions; vendor selection,
oversight and management; benefits strategy and plan design; participant
communications, including but not limited to those required by law; benefit
accounting and claims processing; issue resolution; IRS Form W-2 processing
for group term life insurance coverage; Retiree Club communications and
inquiries; participant data and records management; selection and rollout of
technology and support; and engagement of actuarial, accounting, consulting
and legal services related to the Oncor Plan, OSPP, and any other arrangement
by which Oncor provides the Oncor Subsidy. Oncor agrees that it will give
RTCEH a reasonable opportunity to preview all participant communications
created by or under Oncor's direction that relate to material plan changes or
amendments prior to the distribution of such communications to the Oncor Plan
Split Participants. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, RTCEH will be responsible for any initial communications to Oncor
Plan Split Participants regarding any reduction in or termination of its
payment of premium subsidies for post-retirement welfare benefits provided
under the Oncor Plan or the OSPP (as applicable) on behalf of Oncor Plan Split
Participants. RTCEH agrees that it will give Oncor a reasonable opportunity to
preview any such communications prior to the distribution of such
communications to the Oncor Plan Split Participants and will notify Oncor of
the anticipated distribution date for such communications. Oncor agrees that
it will send to RTCEH a copy of all communications provided to Oncor Plan
Split Participants contemporaneous with the distribution of such
communications to such Oncor Plan Split Participants. 

| 
---|--- 

6.

|

Oncor Plan and OSPP Amendment, Modification or Termination. Nothing in this
Schedule I shall be deemed to constitute a provision of, or an amendment to
the Oncor Plan, OSPP or any other benefit plan maintained by either Oncor or
RTCEH. During the Transition Period, Oncor agrees it will not materially amend
or modify (with an amendment or modification being deemed material only if
such amendment or modification would require Oncor to send a summary of
material modifications to participants under applicable law) or terminate the
Oncor Plan or, if applicable, the OSPP with respect to the benefits available
to the Oncor Plan Split Participants, other than as contemplated herein or as
required by applicable law, without the written consent of RTCEH, which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld. Subject to the requirements of
Section 9 herein, in the event that either (i) RTCEH reduces the amount of the
contribution 

 





10 

that it provides for Oncor Plan Split Participant benefits under the OSPP by
50% or more as compared to the contributions of EFH as of immediately before
the date of this Agreement (a "50% RTCEH Subsidy Reduction") or (ii) RTCEH
fails to make any payment due under this Schedule I (including the
Administration Manual) within ninety (90) days of its due date, Oncor may, in
its sole and absolute discretion, modify or terminate the OSPP.

| 
---|--- 

7.

|

No Third Party Beneficiary Rights. Nothing in this Schedule I shall create any
third party beneficiary rights for any individual, including without
limitation, any Oncor Plan Split Participant or his/her dependents, nor shall
this Schedule I be deemed to provide any Oncor Plan Split Participant or
dependent, or any other individual, with any right to continued coverage under
the OSPP or any other plan of Oncor or RTCEH. This Schedule I relates solely
to the Oncor Plan Split Participants and does not affect Oncor's welfare
benefit obligations related to any participant who is not an Oncor Plan Split
Participant. 

| 
---|--- 

8.

|

Schedule I Amendment, Modification, or Termination. 

| 
---|--- 

a.

|

This Schedule I may be amended or terminated by written agreement of the
Parties. 

| 
---|--- 

b.

|

This Schedule I will automatically terminate in the event that Oncor
terminates the Oncor Plan during the Transition Period or each of the Oncor
Plan, the OSPP, and any alternative arrangement provided under Section 9
following the Transition Period. 

| 
---|--- 

c.

|

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that RTCEH
shall fail to pay the contribution that it provides for Oncor Plan Split
Participant benefits within: (i) thirty (30) days of its due date, Oncor may,
subject to any limitations set forth in the Administration Manual, invoice the
Oncor Plan Split Participants for such amounts unpaid by RTCEH, and (ii)
ninety (90) days of its due date, Oncor may terminate the OSPP and provide
benefits to such Oncor Plan Split Participants from and after the date of the
OSPP termination pursuant to Section 9 below. 

| 
---|--- 

9.

|

Oncor's Post-Separation and Transfer Obligation. Notwithstanding any other
provision in this Agreement to the contrary, Oncor shall after the Separation
and Transfer offer an arrangement under which Oncor shall provide a subsidy
("Oncor Subsidy") for post-retirement medical (including prescription drug
coverage) and life insurance benefits for Oncor Plan Split Participants, as
applicable, for as long as Oncor offers such benefits and provides a per-
participant subsidy for such benefits to retirees under the Oncor Plan. If
upon (i) a 50% RTCEH Subsidy Reduction or (ii) a failure of RTCEH to make any
payment due under this Schedule I (including the Administration Manual) within
ninety (90) days of its due date, Oncor terminates the OSPP pursuant to
Section 6 or Section 8(c), for as long as Oncor offers such benefits and
provides a per-participant subsidy for such benefits to retirees under the
Oncor Plan, Oncor shall determine the benefits to be offered to Oncor Plan
Split Participants in its sole and absolute discretion under this Section 9
(which shall in all events include the Oncor Subsidy and may include cash
payments to the Oncor Plan Split Participants equal to the Oncor Subsidy in
lieu of the provision of any post-retirement benefits), and Sections 3 and 6
shall have no further force or effect.

10.

|

Cooperation. The Parties agree to cooperate with each other in any reasonable
manner to carry out the terms of this Agreement. RTCEH acknowledges and agrees
that in order to facilitate operation of the Oncor Plan and the OSPP, as the
case may be, Oncor will need information from RTCEH with respect to each Oncor
Plan Split Participant who retired or retires from RTCEH or its affiliates and
their predecessors, and RTCEH agrees to provide such information to Oncor in
the manner and at the times specified in the Administration Manual. Oncor
acknowledges and agrees that Oncor shall provide to RTCEH information required
to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement, including, without
limitation, Oncor Plan Split Participant contact information, information
regarding plan amendments, actuarial data, and accounting information, on an
annual basis, or more frequently upon request as may be further specified in
the Administration Manual. The Parties agree to work together in good faith,
as necessary, to implement an appropriate approach that satisfies any new
regulatory requirements applicable to the OSPP in the future.

SCHEDULE II

RETIREMENT PLAN OBLIGATIONS

WHEREAS, the Parties acknowledge that, pursuant to the Plan, RTCEH has assumed
the EFH Retirement Plan from EFH and as a result RTCEH sponsors, maintains and
administers (or, if applicable, will sponsor, maintain and administer) the EFH
Retirement Plan that covers certain Split Participants ("EFH Split
Participants");

WHEREAS, the Separation Agreement by and between TXU Corp., a Texas
corporation and Oncor Holdings dated October 10, 2007 set forth certain
provisions regarding the shared funding of pension benefits under the EFH
Retirement Plan for the EFH Split Participants (such provisions are
hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Funding Agreement");

WHEREAS, RTCEH shall for all purposes be the sponsor of the EFH Retirement
Plan and RTCEH or its designee shall be plan administrator for the EFH
Retirement Plan;

WHEREAS, the Parties desire and agree to continue to share the costs of
funding of the EFH Retirement Plan as described in this Schedule II; and NOW,
THEREFORE, the Parties hereby agree as follows:

1\. Aon Calculation Method. The Parties acknowledge and agree to continue to
utilize the methods of allocating liabilities, costs and expenses associated
with the EFH Retirement Plan that are in effect on the date hereof, including
(i) the method of allocating any amount that may be required to be contributed
to any trust established for the purpose of funding benefits under the EFH
Retirement Plan, and (ii) the method for allocating between the Parties
pension liabilities, costs and expenses under the EFH Retirement Plan (which
method is described in the direct 2008 rate case testimony filed with the
Public Utilities Commission of Texas by Don Shipman, and more specifically
described in the letter from Aon Hewitt to EFH dated November 13, 2012,
addressing pension benefits, which is attached hereto as Exhibit II-A
(together with any mutually-agreed upon updates to said allocations, the "Aon
Calculation Method")). The Parties agree that the Aon Calculation Method is
fair, appropriate and non-arbitrary, and that, pursuant to such method, each
Party will bear its fair share of such liabilities, costs and expenses. The
term "Allocable Liabilities" shall mean, with respect to each Party, the
projected benefit obligations allocated to such Party by the enrolled actuary
for the EFH Retirement Plan in accordance with the Aon Calculation Method. The
Parties further agree that Allocable Liabilities shall be calculated by taking
into account, if applicable, (i) any plan termination liability; (ii) any
premiums payable to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the "PBGC");
(iii) the cost of obtaining annuities; and (iv) any other costs or expenses
under the EFH Retirement Plan. The term "Allocable Assets" shall mean, with
respect to each Party, the fair value of the plan assets allocated to such
Party by the enrolled actuary for the EFH Retirement Plan in accordance with
the Aon Calculation Method. For avoidance of doubt, the Parties acknowledge
that the Aon Calculation Method utilizes Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles ("GAAP") to calculate Allocable Liabilities and Allocable Assets
for an ongoing plan and a plan undergoing a "standard" plan termination as
defined in ERISA § 4041(b), and that the Aon Calculation Method utilizes the
actuarial assumptions outlined in 29



13 

C.F.R. § 4044 in the event of a "distress" or "involuntary" plan termination
as defined in ERISA § 4041(c) or 4042. RTCEH shall not alter or otherwise
change the Aon Calculation Method without the prior written agreement of Oncor
other than as otherwise required by law. RTCEH as sponsor of the EFH
Retirement Plan may amend the EFH Retirement Plan at any time, as required by
federal laws, in order to ensure that the EFH Retirement Plan maintains its
qualified plan status and is in compliance with the requirements of any
applicable collective bargaining agreement, ERISA, the Code and other
applicable laws. Except as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence,
RTCEH further agrees it will not amend, modify or terminate the EFH Retirement
Plan during the Transition Period without the consent of Oncor, which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld and will not, without the consent of Oncor,
which will not be unreasonably withheld, amend, modify or terminate the EFH
Retirement Plan at any time thereafter if such amendment, modification or
termination reflects a material increase in the accrued benefit provided to
any Split Participant and that would result in a material increase in Oncor's
Allocable Liabilities with respect to the EFH Retirement Plan.

2\. Ongoing Reimbursement by Oncor to RTCEH in Respect of EFH Retirement Plan.

a. Prior to the start of each plan year commencing after the year of the
Separation and Transfer, the actuary for the EFH Retirement Plan will send a
statement to Oncor and RTCEH identifying each Party's share of the required
minimum contributions (determined in accordance with Code Section 412 and
ERISA Section 302) (each such contribution a "Minimum Contribution," and
collectively, the "Minimum Contributions") with respect to the EFH Retirement
Plan for such plan year and the due dates for the same, together with
supporting documentation showing the calculation of such Minimum
Contributions. Each Party's share of each Minimum Contribution shall be
calculated by multiplying the amount of such Minimum Contribution by the
percentage determined by dividing (i) such Party's "Allocable Share of
Unfunded Benefit Liabilities" (as defined below) by (ii) the sum of (A) such
Party's Allocable Share of Unfunded Benefit Liabilities plus (B) the other
Party's Allocable Share of Unfunded Benefit Liabilities (each such Party's
portion of the Minimum Contribution as so determined is hereafter referred to
as such Party's "Allocable Share of Minimum Contribution"). In the event the
sum of all of Oncor's Allocable Share of Minimum Contributions for a plan year
exceeds its Allocable Share of Unfunded Benefit Liabilities for such plan
year, Oncor's total Allocable Share of Minimum Contributions for such plan
year shall be reduced to equal its Allocable Share of Unfunded Benefit
Liabilities for such plan year, and RTCEH shall be responsible for the
difference. In the event the Allocable Share of Unfunded Benefit Liabilities
for both Oncor and RTCEH are both zero, but there is a scheduled minimum
contribution for the year, all scheduled contributions will be allocated to
RTCEH.

| 
---|--- 

b.

|

If the actuary cannot provide an allocation prior to the first required
contribution for a plan year, the Parties agree that the actuary may provide
an allocation based on an estimate of the contribution and its allocation
(with any differences between the estimated allocation and the final
allocation reflected in subsequent contributions after the final allocation is
completed). 

 







14 

| 
---|--- 

c.

|

For each plan year, the actuary for the EFH Retirement Plan will perform a
true-up calculation of each Party's Allocable Share of Unfunded Benefit
Liabilities for such plan year and shall adjust each Party's Allocable Share
of Minimum Contribution accordingly for the next plan year. 

| 
---|--- 

d.

|

RTCEH shall tender each Minimum Contribution (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, Oncor's Allocable Share of Minimum Contribution and RTCEH's Allocable
Share of Minimum Contribution) to the EFH Retirement Plan trust no later than
ten (10) days prior to its due date. Within ten (10) days of receipt by Oncor
from RTCEH of written documentation evidencing RTCEH's contribution to the
trust established for the EFH Retirement Plan of the total Minimum
Contribution due (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Oncor's Allocable
Share of Minimum Contribution and RTCEH's Allocable Share of Minimum
Contribution), Oncor agrees to pay to RTCEH its Allocable Share of Minimum
Contribution. In the event RTCEH does not contribute all or a portion of a
Minimum Contribution to the trust established for the EFH Retirement Plan by
the due date of such Minimum Contribution, Oncor may tender the unpaid portion
of its Allocable Share of Minimum Contribution on behalf of RTCEH directly to
the trust established for the EFH Retirement Plan. Notwithstanding any
provision of this Schedule II to the contrary, the payment by Oncor of its
funding obligation under this Section 2 is conditioned on RTCEH making a
corresponding contribution in respect of its Allocable Share of Minimum
Contribution. Oncor's payment to RTCEH pursuant to this Section 2 shall
reimburse RTCEH for the amount RTCEH tendered to the EFH Retirement Plan with
respect to Oncor's Allocable Share of Minimum Contribution. 

| 
---|--- 

e.

|

For purposes of this Schedule II, the term "Allocable Share of Unfunded
Benefit Liabilities" with respect to each Party shall mean the positive
difference (if any) between (i) the applicable Party's Allocable Liabilities
minus (ii) the applicable Party's Allocable Assets, as determined in
accordance with Section 1 of this Schedule II on an ongoing basis. If a
Party's Allocable Assets exceeds such Party's Allocable Liabilities, the
Party's Allocable Share of Unfunded Benefit Liabilities shall be zero. In
calculating a Party's "Allocable Share of Unfunded Benefit Liabilities,"
Allocable Assets and Allocable Liabilities shall be determined as of the end
of the year preceding the relevant contribution year. 

| 
---|--- 

f.

|

For the year in which the Separation and Transfer occurs, the Party's agree to
provide any required minimum funding contributions in accordance with a
statement to be provided by the actuary following the effective date of this
Agreement. 

| 
---|--- 

3.

|

Specific Event Reimbursement by Oncor to RTCEH in Respect of EFH Retirement
Plan. In the event that in any given plan year the enrolled actuary of the EFH
Retirement Plan determines that any of the benefit restrictions under Code
Section 436 ("Benefit Restrictions") may, in its reasonable discretion, apply
to the EFH Retirement Plan, the enrolled actuary shall calculate the
contribution amount owed by each Party to avoid the Benefit Restrictions based
on each Party's Allocable Share of Unfunded Benefit Liabilities and shall
advise the Parties of the timing of the required contributions; provided,
however, that if a Party's Allocable Share of Unfunded Benefit Liabilities is
zero, the other Party shall tender the entire contribution amount necessary to
avoid the Benefit Restrictions. 

 





15 

Oncor shall, upon written request from RTCEH, which request shall include
supporting documentation showing the calculation of such contribution amount
owed and evidence of RTCEH's payment to the trust under the EFH Retirement
Plan of such amount (the "Benefit Restriction Request"), timely tender to
RTCEH its Allocable Share of Unfunded Benefit Liabilities up to the maximum
amount required to avoid Benefit Restrictions. For the avoidance of doubt,
Oncor shall not remit payment to RTCEH in accordance with this Section 3 until
RTCEH has contributed such amount to the trust under the EFH Retirement Plan.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Schedule II to the contrary, the payment
by Oncor of its funding obligation under this Section 3 is conditioned on
RTCEH making a corresponding contribution in respect of its Allocable Share of
Unfunded Benefit Liabilities unless RTCEH's Allocable Share of Unfunded
Benefit Liabilities is zero at the time such contribution is necessary. RTCEH
shall timely tender its Allocable Share of Unfunded Benefit Liabilities up to
the maximum amount owed to avoid Benefit Restrictions as well as the amount of
the Benefit Restriction Request to the EFH Retirement Plan trust. Oncor's
payment of the Benefit Restriction Request to RTCEH shall reimburse RTCEH for
the amount RTCEH tendered to the EFH Retirement Plan with respect to the
Benefit Restriction Request. In the event that RTCEH fails to timely tender
the amount of the Benefit Restriction Request to the EFH Retirement Plan
trust, Oncor will tender the amount of the Benefit Restriction Request on
behalf of RTCEH directly to the EFH Retirement Plan trust.

| 
---|--- 

4.

|

Plan Termination. In the event that RTCEH wishes to terminate the EFH
Retirement Plan under a standard or distress termination, RTECH shall provide
Oncor with notice of at least one hundred fifty (150) days prior to the
proposed termination date. In the event RTCEH receives written notice of the
PBGC's intent to initiate an involuntary termination of the EFH Retirement
Plan, RTCEH shall promptly provide Oncor with such written notice. In the case
of a standard, distress, or involuntary plan termination, the EFH Retirement
Plan enrolled actuary shall calculate the (i) plan termination liability and
(ii) any other costs or expenses under the EFH Retirement Plan, in accordance
with the assumptions for terminating such plan and each Party shall pay its
respective share of the plan termination liability by the date indicated by
the enrolled actuary, which shall in each case be prior to the date(s)
mandated by ERISA. Notwithstanding any provision of this Schedule II to the
contrary, in the event that Oncor has a funding obligation under this Section
4 as a result of a standard termination, the payment by Oncor of its funding
obligations under this Section 4 is conditioned on RTCEH making a
corresponding contribution in respect of its share of such termination
liabilities. Upon satisfaction of Oncor's payment of such liability and other
costs and expenses, Oncor shall have no further obligation to RTCEH in respect
of the EFH Retirement Plan other than as provided in this Agreement. 

| 
---|--- 

5.

|

Contributing Sponsor Status. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement or Schedule II to the contrary, the Parties acknowledge and agree
that Oncor's obligation in respect of the funding of the EFH Retirement Plan
is solely a contractual obligation to RTCEH under this Agreement and that
Oncor shall be liable under this Schedule II only for its Allocable Share of
Unfunded Benefit Liabilities and shall not be liable for RTCEH's Allocable
Share of Unfunded Benefit Liabilities under the EFH Retirement Plan. It is the
intent of the Parties that Oncor is not and will not become a "contributing 

 



16 

sponsor" of the EFH Retirement Plan as such term is defined in ERISA Section
4001(a)(13), and nothing contained in this Schedule II or otherwise in this
Agreement shall be construed otherwise.

| 
---|--- 

6.

|

Plan Administrative Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in Exhibit II-B,
the Parties agree that Permissible Expenses (as defined below) shall be
charged against each party's Allocable Assets in proportion to each party's
Allocable Assets compared to the total assets under the EFH Retirement Plan as
of the date designated by the plan administrator. The term "Permissible
Expenses" includes those expenses properly payable from the plan assets of the
EFH Retirement Plan in accordance with ERISA. Expenses that are not properly
payable from plan assets shall be allocated in accordance with historical
practice. 

| 
---|--- 

7.

|

Dispute Resolution. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, Oncor may engage its own enrolled actuary to calculate its Allocable
Liabilities, Allocable Assets, Allocable Share of Unfunded Benefit
Liabilities, and any and all payments to be made by Oncor in accordance with
this Schedule II. If the Parties' enrolled actuaries do not agree on any such
calculations, the Parties agree that they shall cause each enrolled actuary to
prepare and deliver to the other a statement setting forth the enrolled

result in the Basis Step-Up) in exchange for (i) the Preferred Stock Entity's

the Plan;

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Plan and the [Merger Agreement] (the "Merger
Agreement"), EFH will merge with and into Merger Sub following the
Distribution (and other interim transactions) (the "Merger"), with Merger Sub
surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent;

WHEREAS, it is intended that, if the Spin-Off occurs, for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, (a) the Contribution, the Reorganized TCEH Conversion and the
Distribution will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Sections
368(a)(1)(G), 355, and 356 of the Code, (b) the contribution described in
clause (a) of the definition of the Spin-Off Preferred Stock Sale will be
treated as a taxable sale of the assets of the Preferred Stock Entity pursuant

clause (a), the "Spin-Off Intended Tax Treatment" and, together with the
Taxable Separation Intended Tax Treatment (as defined below), the "Intended
Tax Treatment"), and (c) the Merger is intended to qualify as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and is not intended to cause
the Spin-Off to fail to qualify for the Spin-Off Intended Tax Treatment;

WHEREAS, if the Taxable Separation occurs, such Taxable Separation shall occur
pursuant to the Taxable Separation Memorandum, such Taxable Separation is
intended to include the transactions required or advisable to cause the TCEH
Debtors to directly or indirectly transfer all of their assets to Reorganized
TCEH (or one or more of its subsidiaries) in a transaction that is intended to
be treated as a taxable sale or exchange pursuant to Section 1001 of the Code
and not (in whole or in part) as a tax-free transaction (under Section 368 of
the Code or otherwise) (the "Taxable Separation Intended Tax Treatment");

WHEREAS, the Parties wish to (a) provide for the payment of Tax liabilities
and entitlement to refunds thereof, allocate responsibility for, and
cooperation in, the filing and defense of Tax Returns, and provide for certain
other matters relating to Taxes and (b) set forth certain covenants and
indemnities relating to the preservation of the Intended Tax Treatment;

WHEREAS, Reorganized TCEH is entering into this Agreement, in part, because
Holders of the TCEH First Lien Claims, including, significantly, the TCEH
First Lien Ad Hoc Committee, will not agree to support the Plan without the
protections provided for and represented by this Agreement; and

WHEREAS, this Agreement has been approved by the Bankruptcy Court and will be
effective upon the Distribution. In the event of any conflict between this
Agreement and the Plan, the Plan shall govern.

ARTICLE I

Definitions



Section 1.01 General. As used in this Agreement, the following terms shall
have the following meanings.

"Accounting Firm" has the meaning set forth in Section 9.02.

"Additional Spin-Off Preferred Stock Sale Tax" means (i) an amount (but not
less than zero) equal to fifty percent (50%) of U.S. federal alternative
minimum tax liability (including any adjustments pursuant to a Final
Determination), if any, that results from the limitation on the utilization of
the net operating losses to offset gain recognized from the Spin-Off Preferred
Stock Sale under Section 56(d)(1)(A) of the Code, plus (ii) an amount (but not
less than zero) equal to the regular Income Tax liability (and any corollary
state and local Tax liability) (excluding any alternative minimum Tax) of the
EFH Group in its taxable year in which the Spin-Off Preferred Stock Sale is
consummated and attributable to the Spin-Off Preferred Stock Sale, calculated
by determining the excess of (a) the EFH Group tax liability (determined, for
the avoidance of doubt, by taking into account the gain on the Spin-Off
Preferred Stock Sale pursuant to a Final Determination) over (b) the EFH Group
tax liability as Finally Determined, assuming the Spin-Off Preferred Stock
Sale did not occur and the Spin-Off was consummated without the Spin-Off
Preferred Stock Sale; provided, that for purposes of such calculation, it
shall be assumed that (w) in the event of a Tax-Free Transaction Failure
described in Section 2.05(a) or Section 2.05(b), such Tax-Free Transaction
Failure shall be ignored, and therefore (1) the Contribution, the Reorganized
TCEH Conversion and Distribution shall be treated as qualifying for clause (a)
of the definition of the Spin-Off Intended Tax Treatment, and (2) the EFH
Group shall be treated as recognizing no gain because of the application of
Sections 355(d) or 355(e) of the Code to the Distribution, (x) the

loss or deduction as a result of transactions occurring outside the ordinary
course of business in the taxable year that contains the Distribution Date
(other than (1) Specified Tax Items (if any) attributable to any Historical
TCEH Entity and (2) items directly resulting from other transactions expressly
contemplated by the Plan, solely to the extent the Plan relates to the
Reorganized TCEH Entities and to EFH Properties Company and EFH Shared
Services Debtors to the extent that assets thereof (rather than equity
interests therein) are transferred), and (z) the Agreed Tax Attributes shall
be as reported on the EFH Group's Tax Return as originally filed, but adjusted
to take into account, pursuant to any Final Determination, (1) any
disallowances or increases of such Agreed Tax Attributes (or the component
items of loss or deduction thereof) and (2) any utilization of such Agreed Tax
Attributes arising out of items of income or gain allocable to any Historical
TCEH Entity (other than any such utilization attributable to a Tax-Free
Transaction Failure (other than as a result of a Reorganized TCEH Breach));
provided, further, that in the event of a Tax-Free Transaction Failure
described in Section 2.05(a) or Section 2.05(b), the amount described in this
clause (ii) shall not exceed such amount determined as if clause (w) above did
not apply.

Code) of the EFH Group ended on the TCEH Effective Date and (b) without regard
to any income, gain, loss or deduction generated as a result of the Spin-Off
Preferred Stock Sale or transactions occurring outside the ordinary course of
business on the Distribution Date after the Spin-Off Preferred Stock Sale
(other than (x) Specified Tax Items (if any) attributable to any Historical
TCEH Entity and (y) items directly resulting from the Spin-Off or the Taxable

Section 2.01 Tax Returns.

(a) Tax Returns Prepared by EFH. EFH shall prepare and file (or cause to be
prepared and filed) each Tax Return required to be filed by a Reorganized EFH
Entity (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the U.S. federal income Tax
Return of the EFH Group and all state income and franchise Tax Returns
including members of the EFH Group for all periods ending on or before the
Distribution Date) and shall pay, or cause such Reorganized EFH Entity to pay,
all Taxes shown to be due and payable on each such Tax Return; provided, that
the Reorganized TCEH Entities shall jointly and severally reimburse EFH for
any such Taxes that are Reorganized TCEH Taxes, and EFH shall prepare and
provide to Reorganized TCEH for filing each Tax Return, if any, including EFH
Taxes required to be filed by a Reorganized TCEH Entity after the Distribution
Date; provided, however, that for any periods following the Distribution Date
but prior to the emergence of EFH from chapter 11 proceedings, obligations
with respect to the preparation and filing of Tax Returns shall be governed by
the Transition Services Agreement.

(b) Reorganized TCEH Entity Tax Returns. Reorganized TCEH shall prepare (other
than as specified in Section 2.01(a)) and file (or cause to be prepared and
filed) each Tax Return required to be filed by a Reorganized TCEH Entity after
the Distribution Date and shall pay, or cause be paid, all Taxes shown to be
due and payable on such Tax Return; provided, that the EFH Parties shall
jointly and severally reimburse Reorganized TCEH for any such Taxes that are
EFH Taxes.

Section 2.02 Tax Return Procedures.

(a) Manner of Tax Return Preparation. Subject to Section 5.03, unless
otherwise required by a Taxing Authority or by applicable law, the Parties
shall prepare and file all Tax Returns, and take all other actions, in a
manner consistent with this Agreement, including the applicable Intended Tax
Treatment, the Tax Materials, and (to the extent not in conflict with this
Agreement, the applicable Intended Tax Treatment and the Tax Materials)
commercial practice. All Tax Returns shall be filed on a timely basis (taking
into account applicable extensions) by the Party responsible for filing such
Tax Returns under this Agreement.

(b) Right to Review Certain Returns Prepared by EFH. In the case of any Tax
Return described in Section 2.01(a), (i) the portion (if any) of such Tax
Return that relates to Reorganized TCEH Taxes or would reasonably be expected
to adversely affect the Tax position of any Reorganized TCEH Entity shall (to
the extent permitted by law) be prepared in a manner described in Section
2.02(a) and (ii) EFH shall provide a draft of such Tax Return to Reorganized
TCEH for its review and comment at least thirty (30) days prior to the Due
Date for such Tax Return or, in the case of any such Tax Return filed on a
monthly basis or property Tax Return, ten (10) days. EFH shall consider in
good faith any reasonable comment received from Reorganized TCEH at least
three (3) days prior to the Due Date for such Tax Return. In the event that
neither the Intended Tax Treatment, the Tax Materials nor commercial practice
are applicable to a particular item or matter, EFH shall determine the
reporting of such item or matter in good faith in consultation with
Reorganized TCEH. The Parties shall negotiate in good faith to resolve all
disputed issues. Any disputes that the Parties are unable to resolve shall be
resolved by the Accounting Firm pursuant to Section 9.02. In the event that

13 

any dispute is not resolved (whether pursuant to good faith negotiations among
the Parties or by the Accounting Firm) prior to the Due Date for the filing of
any Tax Return, such Tax Return shall be timely filed as prepared by EFH and
such Tax Return shall be amended as necessary to reflect the resolution of
such dispute in a manner consistent with such resolution. For the avoidance of
doubt, the EFH Parties shall be jointly and severally responsible for any
interest, penalties or additions to Tax resulting from the late filing of any
Tax Return EFH is required to file under Section 2.01(a), except to the extent
that such late filing is primarily caused by the failure of any Reorganized
TCEH Entity to provide relevant information necessary for the preparation and
filing of such Tax Return.

(c) Right to Review Certain Returns Prepared by Reorganized TCEH. In the case
of any Tax Return described in Section 2.01(b) that relates to EFH Taxes or
that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the Tax position of any
Reorganized EFH Entity, (i) such Tax Return shall (to the extent permitted by
law) be prepared in a manner described in Section 2.02(a) and (ii) Reorganized
TCEH shall provide a draft of such Tax Return to EFH for its review and
comment at least thirty (30) days prior to the Due Date for such Tax Return,
or in the case of any such Tax Return filed on a monthly basis or property Tax
Return, ten (10) days. Reorganized TCEH shall consider in good faith any
reasonable comment received from EFH at least three (3) days prior to the Due
Date for such Tax Return. In the event that neither the Intended Tax
Treatment, the Tax Materials nor commercial practice are applicable to a
particular item or matter, Reorganized TCEH shall determine the reporting of
such item or matter in good faith in consultation with EFH. The Parties shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve all disputed issues. Any disputes that the
Parties are unable to resolve shall be resolved by the Accounting Firm
pursuant to Section 9.02. In the event that any dispute is not resolved
(whether pursuant to good faith negotiations among the Parties or by the
Accounting Firm) prior to the Due Date for the filing of any Tax Return, such
Tax Return shall be timely filed as prepared by Reorganized TCEH and such Tax
Return shall be amended as necessary to reflect the resolution of such dispute
in a manner consistent with such resolution. For the avoidance of doubt, each
Reorganized TCEH Entity shall be jointly and severally responsible for any
interest, penalties or additions to Tax resulting from the late filing of any
Tax Return Reorganized TCEH is required to file under Section 2.01(b) except
to the extent that such late filing is primarily caused by the failure of any
Reorganized EFH Entity to provide relevant information necessary for the
preparation and filing of such Tax Return.

(d) Tax Reporting. Unless otherwise required by law, if the Spin-Off occurs,
EFH and Reorganized TCEH, as applicable, shall file the appropriate
information and statements, as required by Treasury Regulations Sections
1.355-5(a) and 1.368-3, with the IRS, and shall retain the appropriate
information relating to the Contribution, the Reorganized TCEH Conversion and
the Distribution as described in Treasury Regulations Sections 1.355-5(d) and
1.368-3(d).

(e) Amendments. Any amendment of any Tax Return described in Section 2.01 of
any Reorganized TCEH Entity shall be subject to the same procedures required
for the preparation of such type of Tax Return of such Reorganized TCEH Entity
pursuant to this Section 2.02. Any amendment of any Tax Return described in
Section 2.01 of any Reorganized EFH Entity shall be subject to the same
procedures required for the preparation of such type of Tax Return of such
Reorganized EFH Entity pursuant to this Section 2.02.







14 

Section 2.03 Straddle Period Tax Allocation. To the extent permitted by law,
EFH and Reorganized TCEH shall elect, or cause an election to be made, to
close the taxable year of each Reorganized TCEH Entity as of the close of the
Distribution Date. In the case of any Straddle Period, the amount of any
Income Taxes attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on, or
beginning after, the Distribution Date shall be made by means of a closing of
the books and records of such Reorganized TCEH Entity as of the close of the
Distribution Date; provided, that in the case of Non-Income Taxes that are
periodic Taxes (e.g., property Taxes) and exemptions, allowances, and
deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (such as depreciation
deductions), such Taxes, exemptions, allowances, and deductions shall be
allocated between the portion of the Straddle Period ending at the end of the
Distribution Date and the portion beginning after the Distribution Date based
upon the ratio of (a) the number of days in the relevant portion of the
Straddle Period to (b) the number of days in the entire Straddle Period;
provided, however, that in allocating any such exemptions, allowances, or
deductions (or increase in such amounts) between the two periods that comprise
a Straddle Period, any such items that relate to an asset or property that was
sold, acquired or improved during the Straddle Period shall be allocated on a
daily basis solely among the days in the Straddle Period during which such
asset was owned or such improvement existed; provided, further, that Taxes
that are properly allocable (based on, among other relevant factors, factors
set forth in Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B)) to a portion
of the Distribution Date following the Distribution, shall be allocable to the
portion of the Straddle Period beginning after the Distribution Date.

Section 2.04 Allocation of Taxes.

(a) Income Taxes. Income Taxes (other than Income Taxes allocated pursuant to
Section 2.04(b), Section 2.04(d), and Section 2.05) shall be allocated in an
appropriate manner, consistent with commercial practice, and as follows:

(i) In the case of U.S. federal regular Income Taxes, in proportion to the
separate taxable income (calculated in a manner consistent with Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1552-1(a)(1) and determined without regard to any items
the Income Taxes for which are allocated pursuant to Section 2.04(b), Section
2.04(d), and Section 2.05) attributable to (x) any Reorganized EFH Entity
(treated as if all of the assets and liabilities of such entities were
combined into a single corporation) (such single corporation, the "EFH
Consolidated Corporation"), including any business or assets retained by such
entities following the Distribution Date, on the one hand, and (y) any
Reorganized TCEH Entity (treated as if all of the assets and liabilities of
such entities were combined into a single corporation) (such single
corporation, the "Reorganized TCEH Consolidated Corporation"), including any
business or assets contributed to or otherwise held by such entities following
the Distribution Date, on the other hand.

(ii) In the case of Texas Margin Tax, the methodology specified in Section
2.04(a)(i) shall be applied, and Texas Margin Tax shall be allocated, based on
the separate taxable margins of the EFH Consolidated Corporation, on the one
hand, and the Reorganized TCEH Consolidated Corporation, on the other hand.







15 

(b) Alternative Minimum Taxes. Alternative minimum Taxes (other than
alternative minimum Taxes allocated pursuant to Section 2.04(d) and Section
2.05) shall be allocated in proportion to the respective separate amounts of
alternative minimum tax of the EFH Consolidated Corporation, on the one hand,
and the Reorganized TCEH Consolidated Corporation, on the other hand.

(c) Non-Income Taxes. Except as provided in Section 2.04(d)(i), Non-Income
Taxes shall be allocated between the EFH Parties, on the one hand, and
Reorganized TCEH, on the other hand, based on the applicable items
attributable to or arising from any business retained by any Reorganized EFH
Entity, on the one hand, and any business contributed to (or otherwise held on
the Effective Date by) any Reorganized TCEH Entity, on the other hand, that
contribute to such Taxes (e.g., sales Taxes and value added Taxes shall be
allocated to the EFH Parties to the extent arising from taxable sales made by
any business retained by any Reorganized EFH Entity). In the event that any
Non-Income Tax is not attributable to (and does not arise from) any items
relating to any business (e.g., capital Taxes imposed based on the authorized
stock), such Non-Income Taxes shall be allocated between the EFH Parties, on
the one hand, and Reorganized TCEH, on the other hand, in proportion to the
net taxable income of any business retained by any Reorganized EFH Entity, on
the one hand, and any business contributed to (or otherwise held on the
Effective Date by) any Reorganized TCEH Entity, on the other hand.

(d) Other Taxes.

(i) Transfer Taxes, if any, related to or arising as a result of the Spin-Off
or the Taxable Separation shall be allocated one hundred percent (100%) to the
TCEH Parties. Transfer Taxes, if any, arising as a result of restructuring of
the EFH Parties or a direct or indirect acquisition of an interest in Oncor
shall be allocated one hundred percent (100%) to the EFH Parties. Other
Transfer Taxes, if any, will be allocated to the EFH Parties if they
constitute items attributable to the EFH Consolidated Corporation and to
Reorganized TCEH if they constitute items attributable to the Reorganized TCEH
Consolidated Corporation.

(ii) If the Spin-Off occurs, Income Taxes attributable to a Tax-Free
Transaction Failure shall be allocated as set forth in Section 2.05.

(iii) If the Spin-Off occurs, an amount (but not less than zero) equal to
fifty percent (50%) of U.S. federal alternative minimum tax liability
(including any adjustments pursuant to a Final Determination), if any, that
results from the limitation on the utilization of the net operating losses to
offset gain recognized from the Spin-Off Preferred Stock Sale under Section
56(d)(1)(A) of the Code shall be allocated to the EFH Parties.

(iv) If the Spin-Off occurs, the Additional Spin-Off Preferred Stock Sale Tax
shall be allocated to Reorganized TCEH.











16 

(v) If the Spin-Off occurs and there has been no Tax-Free Transaction Failure,
any discharge of indebtedness income or gain under Section 1001 of the Code
arising from any discharge of indebtedness shall be allocated to the EFH
Parties.

(e) Allocation of Tax Attributes. Tax Attributes, if any, remaining after the
Distribution (other than net operating losses) shall be allocated in
accordance with the Private

Letter Ruling or, if not addressed in the Private Letter Ruling, between the
Reorganized EFH

Entities, on the one hand, and the Reorganized TCEH Entities, on the other
hand, in accordance with the Code and Treasury Regulations, including Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1502-76 (and any applicable state, local and foreign
Laws) and, with respect to earnings and profits, as initially requested in the
IRS Submissions. The allocation of such Tax Attributes shall be determined by
treating the Reorganized TCEH Entities as one consolidated group and the
Reorganized EFH Entities as a separate and distinct consolidated group. Any
disputes shall be resolved by the Accounting Firm in accordance with Section
9.02. The EFH Parties and Reorganized TCEH hereby agree to compute all Taxes
consistently with the determination of the allocation of Tax Attributes
pursuant to this Section 2.04(e) unless otherwise required by a Final
Determination. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event the Taxable Separation
occurs, no Tax Attributes (other than tax basis) shall be allocated to the
Reorganized TCEH Entities unless otherwise required by a Final Determination.

Section 2.05 Allocation of Separation-Related Taxes. If the Spin-Off occurs:

(a) No-Fault. Income Taxes attributable to a Tax-Free Transaction Failure, to
the extent not allocated pursuant to Sections 2.05(b), (c) or (d), shall be
allocated to the EFH Parties.

(b) EFH Breach. Income Taxes principally attributable to a Tax-Free
Transaction Failure as a result of an EFH Breach shall be allocated to the EFH
Parties.

(c) Reorganized TCEH Breach. Incomes Taxes principally attributable to a Tax-
Free Transaction Failure as a result of Reorganized TCEH Breach shall be
allocated to the Reorganized TCEH Entities.

and Securities. Income Taxes principally attributable to a Tax-Free
Transaction Failure resulting from any action taken by the TCEH Creditors or
by holders of stock or securities in Reorganized TCEH with respect to their
interests that (i) causes the Distribution not to satisfy the continuity of
interest requirement set forth in Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1(e) or
1.355-2(c)(1), (ii) results in the imposition of any Income Taxes under
Section 355(d) or Section 355(e) of the Code with respect to the Distribution,
or (iii) results in the Distribution failing to satisfy the device test set
forth in Treasury Regulations Section 1.355-2(d), shall be allocated to
Reorganized TCEH.

Section 2.06 Audits/Redeterminations. Any redetermined Taxes or Tax Attributes
resulting from an audit shall be allocated between the EFH Parties, on the one
hand, and Reorganized TCEH, on the other hand, in the same manner as they
would have been allocated had the redetermined amounts been known at the time
the original Tax liability was computed.



17 

Section 2.07 Expenses. Except as provided in Section 9.02 in respect of the
Accounting Firm, each Party shall bear its own expenses incurred in connection
with this Article II.

Section 2.08 Timing of Payments. Any reimbursement of Taxes under Section 2.01
shall be made upon the later of (a) two (2) business days before the Due Date
of such payment of such Taxes and (b) ten (10) business days after the party
required to make such reimbursement has received notice from the party
entitled to such reimbursement. For the avoidance of doubt, a party may
provide notice of reimbursement of Taxes prior to the time such Taxes were
paid, and such notice may represent a reasonable estimate (provided, that the
amount of reimbursement shall be based on the actual Tax liability and not on
such reasonable estimate).

Article III

Indemnification

Section 3.01 Indemnification by the Reorganized EFH Entities. The Reorganized
EFH Entities, on a joint and several basis, shall pay (or cause to be paid),
and shall indemnify and hold each Reorganized TCEH Entity harmless from and
against, without duplication, all EFH Taxes and all losses or damages arising
out of, resulting from or relating to any breach by any Reorganized EFH Entity
of any EFH representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement
(including, in the case of a Tax-Free Transaction Failure pursuant to Section
2.05(b), any reduced depreciation, amortization or similar deduction or any
reduced loss or increased gain, in each case resulting from a reduction in the
income tax basis of any asset of any Reorganized TCEH Entity resulting from
such Tax-Free Transaction Failure pursuant to Section 2.05(b), such loss or
damage determined (a) without regard to any tax receivable agreement or
similar arrangement with respect to any Reorganized TCEH Entity and (b) taking
into account any Final Determinations relating to the income tax basis of any
asset immediately after the Spin-Off); provided, that for the avoidance of
doubt, for so long as the Oncor Entities have not executed a joinder to this
Agreement pursuant to Section 9.19, the Oncor Entities shall have no
obligation under this Section 3.01.

Section 3.02 Indemnification by the Reorganized TCEH Entities. The Reorganized
TCEH Entities, on a joint and several basis, shall pay (or cause to be paid),
and shall indemnify and hold each Reorganized EFH Entity harmless from and
against, without duplication, all Reorganized TCEH Taxes and all losses or
damages arising out of, resulting from or relating to any breach by any
Reorganized TCEH Entity of any Reorganized TCEH representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement in this Agreement.

Section 3.03 Characterization of and Adjustments to Payments.

(a) In the absence of a Final Determination to the contrary, for all Tax
purposes, EFH and Reorganized TCEH shall treat or cause to be treated any
payment required by this Agreement (other than any payment treated for Tax
purposes as interest) as either a contribution by EFH to Reorganized TCEH or a
distribution by Reorganized TCEH to EFH, as the case may be, occurring
immediately prior to the Distribution.







18 

(b) Any indemnity payment pursuant to this Agreement shall be (A) increased to
include (i) all reasonable accounting, legal, and other professional fees and
court costs and damages incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with
such indemnity payment and (ii) any Tax Cost to such Indemnified Party or its
Affiliates resulting from the receipt of (or entitlement to) such indemnity
payment and (B) decreased to account for any Tax Benefit that the Indemnified
Party or its Affiliates actually realizes by way of a Refund or a decrease in
Taxes reported on a filed Tax Return (in or with respect to a taxable year
that ends on or before December 31, 2021) in connection with the incurrence or
the payment by the Indemnified Party of such fees or costs or indemnifiable
amounts determined using a "with and without" methodology (treating any
deductions attributable to such fees or costs or indemnifiable amounts as the
last items claimed for any taxable year, including after the utilization of
any available net operating loss carryovers). In the event that any Tax Cost
or Tax Benefit is not actually realized at the time of the indemnity payment
by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party, the payment related to
such Tax Cost or Tax Benefit shall be paid at the time the Tax Cost or Tax
Benefit is actually realized.

Section 3.04 Timing of Indemnification Payments. Indemnification payments in
respect of any liabilities for which an Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Article III shall be paid by the Indemnifying
Party to the Indemnified Party within ten (10) days after written notification
thereof by the Indemnified Party, including reasonably satisfactory
documentation setting forth the basis for, and calculation of, the amount of
such indemnification payment. If an indemnification obligation is attributable
to a Tax which the Indemnified Party pays, but for which no Final
Determination has been made (such as a payment in response to an asserted
adjustment in audit, which adjustment remains subject to further challenge),
then the Indemnifying Party shall pay such amounts to the Indemnified Party
within ten (10) days after written notification thereof by the Indemnified
Party, including reasonably satisfactory documentation setting forth the basis
for, and calculation of, the amount of such indemnification payment, provided,
that, in the event that such amounts are returned or refunded to Indemnified
Party, the Indemnified Party shall pay such amounts to the Indemnifying Party
within (10) days of receipt thereof plus interest at a rate equal to the rate
provided in Section 9.04.

Section 3.05 Exclusive Remedy. Anything to the contrary in this Agreement
notwithstanding, but in all events subject to Article VIII, the EFH Parties
and the Reorganized TCEH Entities hereby agree that the sole and exclusive
monetary remedy of a party for any breach or inaccuracy of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in Section 6.01 shall be the
indemnification rights set forth in this Article III.

Section 3.06 No Duplicative Payment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, it is intended that the provisions of this Agreement will
not result in a duplicative payment of any amount required to be paid under
any other Transaction Agreement, and this Agreement shall be construed
accordingly.

Article IV

Refunds, Timing Differences, and Tax Attributes

Section 4.01 Refunds.





19 

(a) Except as provided in Section 4.02, EFH shall be entitled to all Refunds
of Taxes for which a Reorganized EFH Entity or its Affiliates is responsible
pursuant to Article III, and Reorganized TCEH shall be entitled to all Refunds
of Taxes for which Reorganized TCEH or its Affiliates is responsible pursuant
to Article III. A Party receiving a Refund to which the other Party is
entitled pursuant to this Agreement shall pay the amount to which such other
Party is entitled (less any Tax or other reasonable out-of-pocket costs
incurred by the first Party in receiving such Refund within ten (10) days
after the receipt of the Refund.

(b) To the extent that the amount of any Refund under this Section 4.01 is
later reduced by a Taxing Authority or in a Tax Proceeding, such reduction
shall be allocated to the Party to which such Refund was allocated pursuant to
this Section 4.01 and an appropriate adjusting payment shall be made.

Section 4.02 Timing Differences. If pursuant to a Final Determination any Tax
Attribute (including those allocated pursuant to Section 2.04(e)) is made
allowable to a Reorganized TCEH Entity as a result of an adjustment to any
Taxes for which an EFH Party is responsible hereunder (other than Taxes
attributable to a Tax-Free Transaction Failure described in Section 2.05(a) or
Section 2.05(b)) and such Tax Attribute would not have arisen or been
allowable but for such adjustment, or if pursuant to a Final Determination any
Tax Attribute is made allowable to a Reorganized EFH Entity as a result of an
adjustment to any Taxes for which Reorganized TCEH is responsible hereunder
(other than Taxes attributable to a Tax-Free Transaction Failure described in
Section 2.05(c) or 2.05(d)) and such Tax Attribute would not have arisen or
been allowable but for such adjustment, the Reorganized TCEH Entities (on a
joint and several basis) or the Reorganized EFH Entities (on a joint and
several basis), as the case may be, shall make a payment to either EFH or
Reorganized TCEH, as appropriate, within thirty (30) days after such Party (or
its Affiliates) actually realizes a Tax benefit by way of a Refund or a
decrease in Taxes reported on a filed Tax Return (in or with respect to a
taxable year that ends on or before December 31, 2021) that is attributable to
such Tax Attribute, determined using a "with and without" methodology
(treating any deductions or amortization attributable to such Tax Attributes
as the last items claimed for any taxable year, including after the
utilization of any available net operating loss carryovers); provided, that no
payment shall be made under this Section unless Reorganized TCEH or EFH, as
the case may be, has previously paid the Tax adjustment or indemnified the
other Party for such Tax adjustment. In the event of any overlap between
Section 3.03 and this Section 4.02, this Section 4.02 shall apply and Section
3.03 shall not apply.

Article V

Tax Proceedings

Section 5.01 Notification of Tax Proceedings. Within ten (10) days after an
Indemnified Party becomes aware of the commencement of a Tax Proceeding that
may give rise to an indemnity payment pursuant to Article III, such
Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of such Tax
Proceeding, and thereafter shall promptly forward or make available to the
Indemnifying Party copies of notices and communications relating to such Tax
Proceeding. The failure of the Indemnified Party to notify the Indemnifying
Party in writing of the commencement of any such Tax Proceeding within such
ten (10) day period or promptly forward any further notices or communications
shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any obligation which it may have
to the Indemnified Party under this Agreement except to the extent (and only
to the extent) that the Indemnifying Party is actually materially prejudiced
by such failure.



20 

Section 5.02 Tax Proceeding Procedures.

(a) EFH. EFH shall be entitled to contest, compromise, and settle any
adjustment that is proposed, asserted or assessed pursuant to any Tax
Proceeding with respect to any Tax Return it is responsible for preparing
pursuant to Article II; provided, that to the extent that such Tax Proceeding
relates to Reorganized TCEH Taxes or would reasonably be expected to
materially adversely affect the Tax position of any Reorganized TCEH Entity
for any Post-Distribution Period, EFH shall (i) keep Reorganized TCEH informed
in a timely manner of the material actions proposed to be taken by EFH with
respect to such Tax Proceeding, (ii) permit Reorganized TCEH at its own
expense to participate in the aspects of such Tax Proceeding that relate to
Reorganized TCEH Taxes, and (iii) not settle any aspect of such Tax Proceeding
that relates to Reorganized TCEH Taxes without the prior written consent of
Reorganized TCEH, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Reorganized TCEH shall have the
right to jointly control any Tax Proceeding that relates primarily to Taxes
for which Reorganized TCEH has an indemnification obligation pursuant to
Section 3.02.

(b) Reorganized TCEH. Except as otherwise provided in Section 5.02(a),
Reorganized TCEH shall be entitled to contest, compromise, and settle any
adjustment that is proposed, asserted or assessed pursuant to any Tax
Proceeding with respect to any Tax Return it is responsible for preparing
pursuant to Article II; provided, that to the extent that such Tax Proceeding
relates to EFH Taxes or would reasonably be expected to materially adversely
affect the Tax position of any Reorganized EFH Entity, Reorganized TCEH shall
(i) keep EFH informed in a timely manner of the material actions proposed to
be taken by Reorganized TCEH with respect to such Tax Proceeding, (ii) permit
EFH at its own expense to participate in the aspects of such Tax Proceeding
that relate to EFH Taxes, and (iii) not settle any aspect of such Tax
Proceeding that relates to EFH Taxes without the prior written consent of EFH,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the EFH Parties shall have the right to jointly
control any Tax Proceeding that relates primarily to Taxes for which EFH
Parties have an indemnification obligation pursuant to Section 3.01.

Section 5.03 Consistency. The Parties shall (and shall cause each of their
respective Subsidiaries to) take the position on all Tax Returns and in all
Tax Proceedings (including in supplemental ruling request submissions to the
IRS), unless otherwise required by a Final Determination, that (a) the
transactions contemplated by the Plan qualify for the Spin-Off Intended Tax
Treatment (in the case of the Spin-Off) or the Taxable Separation Intended Tax
Treatment (in the case of the Taxable Separation), and (b) the fair market
value of each Stepped-Up TCEH Asset on the Distribution Date is equal to the
value of such asset that has been reasonably agreed to by the TCEH Supporting
First Lien Creditors and the Debtors.















21

with) the facts in the Private Letter Ruling;

Subsidiaries not to:







23 

(i) propose or support an EFH Plan or any other transaction (A) pursuant to
which EFH or EFIH, directly or indirectly, transfers their indirect economic
interest in Oncor, the consummation of which would breach this Agreement or
(B) which would reasonably be expected to create a material risk of (x) a Tax-
Free Transaction Failure or (y) a breach by the EFH Parties of any term or
condition of this Agreement; and

(ii) take any action without the consent of Reorganized TCEH outside the
ordinary course of business that, in the reasonable determination of
Reorganized TCEH, would give rise to $250 million or more of net taxable
income recognized by the EFH Group (when combined with any other net taxable
income of the EFH Group, but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, (x) the
net taxable income arising in connection with the transactions constituting
the Spin-Off and (y) any Agreed Tax Attributes) in the same taxable year as
the TCEH Effective Date; provided, however, that in the event an EFH Party
seeks to take any action outside the ordinary course of business that, in the
reasonable determination of Reorganized TCEH, would give rise to $250 million
or more of net taxable income recognized by the EFH Group (when combined with
any other net taxable income of the EFH Group, but excluding, for the
avoidance of doubt, (x) the net taxable income arising in connection with the
Spin-Off Preferred Stock Sale and (y) any Agreed Tax Attributes) in the same
taxable year as the TCEH Effective Date, Reorganized TCEH shall consent to
such transaction if it concludes in its sole discretion that such transaction
will not give rise to a material risk of nonpayment of an amount owed (whether
due to such transaction or otherwise) under this Agreement or to an applicable
taxing authority.

(e) Additional Covenants.

(i) If the Plan is consummated without receiving the Private Letter Ruling (or
any Fundamental Ruling), then EFH shall continue to pursue the Private Letter
Ruling (or a supplemental Private Letter Ruling, if applicable) until a
determination is made by EFH and Reorganized TCEH (each making their
determination under a reasonable exercise of discretion) that the Private
Letter Ruling or supplemental Private Letter Ruling cannot be obtained. Parent
and Reorganized TCEH shall have the right to participate in any submissions
related to the Private Letter Ruling, including by (i) commenting on written
submissions, (ii) having participation in in-person conferences, (iii) having
participation in scheduled, substantive telephone conferences with the IRS,
and (iv) being updated promptly regarding any unscheduled communications with
the IRS or any other communications with respect to which Parent or
Reorganized TCEH does not participate; provided, however, that Parent and
Reorganized TCEH shall work in good faith with counsel for EFH to determine
the appropriate level of participation by any other persons in any particular
meeting or conference.

(ii) If the Plan is consummated after the receipt of the Private Letter
Ruling, supplemental submissions with respect to the Private Letter Ruling
shall be made to reflect any material developments with respect to the EFH

Treatment. Parent and Reorganized TCEH shall have the right to participate in
such supplemental submissions, including by (A) commenting on written
submissions, (B) having participation in in-person conferences, (C)



24 

having participation in scheduled, substantive telephone conferences with the

particular meeting or conference.

Article VII

Cooperation

Section 7.01 General Cooperation. The Parties shall each cooperate fully (and
each shall cause its respective Subsidiaries to cooperate fully) with all
reasonable requests in writing or via e-mail from another Party, or from an
agent, representative or advisor to such Party, in connection with the
preparation and filing of Tax Returns, claims for Refunds, Tax Proceedings,
Tax ruling requests, and calculations of amounts required to be paid pursuant
to this Agreement, in each case, related or attributable to or arising in
connection with Taxes of any of the Parties or their respective Subsidiaries
covered by this Agreement and the establishment of any reserve required in
connection with any financial reporting (a "Tax Matter"). Such cooperation
shall include the provision of any information reasonably necessary or helpful
in connection with a Tax Matter and shall include at each Party's own cost:

(i) the provision, in hard copy and electronic forms, of any Tax Returns (or
proforma returns) of the Parties and their respective Subsidiaries, books,
records (including information regarding ownership and Tax basis of property),
documentation, and other information relating to such Tax Returns (or proforma
returns), including accompanying schedules, related work papers, and documents
relating to rulings or other determinations by Taxing Authorities;

(ii) the execution of any document (including any power of attorney)
reasonably requested by another Party in connection with any Tax Proceedings
of any of the Parties or their respective Subsidiaries, or the filing of a Tax
Return or a Refund claim of the Parties or any of their respective
Subsidiaries; and

(iii) the use of the Party's reasonable best efforts to obtain any
documentation in connection with a Tax Matter.

Each Party shall make its employees, advisors, and facilities available,
without charge, on a reasonable and mutually convenient basis in connection
with the foregoing matters in a manner that does not interfere with the
ordinary business operations of such Party.

Section 7.02 Retention of Records. The EFH Parties and Reorganized TCEH shall
retain or cause to be retained all Tax Returns, schedules, and work papers,
and all material records or other documents relating thereto in their
possession, including all such electronic records, and shall maintain all
hardware necessary to retrieve such electronic records, in all cases until
sixty (60) days after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
(including any waivers or extensions





25 

thereof) of the taxable periods to which such Tax Returns and other documents
relate or until the expiration of any additional period that any Party
reasonably requests, in writing, with respect to specific material records and
documents. A Party intending to destroy any material records or documents
shall provide the other Party with reasonable advance notice and the
opportunity to copy or take possession of such records and documents. The
Parties will notify each other in writing of any waivers or extensions of the
applicable statute of limitations that may affect the period for which the
foregoing records or other documents must be retained.

Section 7.03 Failure to Perform. If a Party materially fails to comply with
any of its obligations set forth in Sections 7.01 or 7.02 upon reasonable
request and notice by the other Party, and such failure results in the
imposition of additional Taxes, the non-performing Party shall be liable in
full for such additional Taxes notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement.

Article VIII

Provisions of EFH Plan; Enforcement

Section 8.01 Provisions of EFH Plan.

(a) Each Party agrees not to attempt to seek or to argue that an EFH Plan, or
any other restructuring transaction (including a sale pursuant to Section 363
of the Bankruptcy Code) for any of the EFH Parties, can or should be confirmed
or approved by the Bankruptcy Court if (x) the consummation of such an EFH
Plan, or any other restructuring transaction (including a sale pursuant to
Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code) for any of the EFH Parties would
reasonably be expected to create a material risk of (A) a Tax-Free Transaction
Failure or (B) causing a breach by the EFH Parties of any term or condition of
this Agreement or (y) it provides that any claim (A) arising from a breach by
any of the EFH Parties of any term or condition of this Agreement or (B) for
indemnification under Section 3.01 is released or deemed discharged under an
EFH Plan.

(b) Each Party shall object to and oppose any proposed EFH Plan, or any other
restructuring transaction (including a sale pursuant to Section 363 of the
Bankruptcy Code) for any of the EFH Parties that (x) would reasonably be
expected to create a material risk of (A) a Tax-Free Transaction Failure or
(B) causing a breach by the Parties of any term or condition of this Agreement
or (y) provides that any claim (A) arising from a breach by any of the EFH
Parties of any term or condition of this Agreement or (B) for indemnification
under Section 3.01, is released or deemed discharged under an EFH Plan.

Section 8.02 Enforcement.



(a) Until the substantial consummation of an EFH Plan that is consistent with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement:

(i) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed by the EFH Parties
in accordance with their specific terms and that monetary damages, even if
available, would not





26 

be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that with respect to
each EFH Party, this Agreement shall be enforceable as against such EFH Party
by specific performance or other injunctive relief, without proof of actual
damages (and each EFH Party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or
posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), in addition to any other
remedy available against such EFH Party at law or equity. Each EFH Party
knowingly, voluntarily and unconditionally (i) waives its rights to revoke,
terminate, avoid, disaffirm or reject this Agreement, or any portion thereof,
pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code or other applicable law, including Section 365
of the Bankruptcy Code and (ii) agrees that it shall not support, directly or
indirectly, and shall oppose, any request by any other party-in-interest to
compel, require or otherwise request that this Agreement or any portion
thereof be revoked, avoided, disaffirmed, terminated or rejected for any
reason.

(ii) Without limiting in any manner the right to obtain specific performance
or other injunctive relief pursuant to Section 8.02(a)(i), if a Party elects
to seek monetary damages, any claim against an EFH Party under this Agreement
shall be non-dischargeable under any EFH Plan and entitled to superpriority
administrative claim status, junior only to (i) the EFIH First Lien DIP
Facility or a future EFIH Second Lien DIP Facility (if any) to the extent the
proceeds thereof are used solely to repay the EFIH Second Lien Note Claims (as
defined in the Plan) and for fees and expenses related to such repayment, (ii)
the Carve-Out (as defined in the EFIH First Lien DIP Order), and (iii) any of
the following fees owed by EFH (subject to the same caps applicable to the
Carve-Out): (A) all fees required to be paid to the Clerk of the Court and to
the Office of the United States Trustee under Section 1930(a) of title 28 of
the United States Code plus interest at the statutory rate; (B) reasonable
fees and expenses incurred by a trustee under Section 726(b) of the Bankruptcy
Code; and (C) to the extent allowed at any time, whether by interim order,
procedural order, or otherwise, all unpaid fees and expenses incurred by
persons or firms retained by (1) the EFH Debtors, pursuant to Section 327,
328, or 363 of the Bankruptcy Code, and (2) the EFH/EFIH Committee.

Article IX

Miscellaneous

Section 9.01 Governing law. This Agreement and all issues and questions
concerning the construction, validity, enforcement, and interpretation of this
Agreement (and all Schedules and Exhibits) shall be governed by, and construed
in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect
to any choice of law or conflict of law rules or provisions (whether of the
State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. In
furtherance of the foregoing, the internal laws of the State of Delaware shall
control the interpretation and construction of this Agreement (and all
Schedules and Exhibits), even though under that jurisdiction's choice of law
or conflict of law analysis, the substantive law of some other jurisdiction
would ordinarily apply.

Section 9.02 Dispute Resolution. In the event of any dispute among the Parties
as to any matter covered by Sections 2.02 or 2.04, the Parties shall appoint a
nationally recognized





27 

independent public accounting firm (the "Accounting Firm") to resolve such
dispute. In this regard, the Accounting Firm shall make determinations with
respect to the disputed items based solely on representations made by the EFH
Parties and Reorganized TCEH and their respective representatives, and not by
independent review, and shall function only as an expert and not as an
arbitrator and shall be required to make a determination in favor of one Party
only. The Parties shall require the Accounting Firm to resolve all disputes no
later than thirty (30) days after the submission of such dispute to the
Accounting Firm and agree that all decisions by the Accounting Firm with
respect thereto shall be final and conclusive and binding on the Parties. The
Accounting Firm shall resolve all disputes in a manner consistent with this
Agreement. The Parties shall require the Accounting Firm to render all
determinations in writing and to set forth, in reasonable detail, the basis
for such determination. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be
borne equally by the Parties. For the avoidance of doubt, any dispute among
the Parties as to any matter not covered by Sections 2.02 or 2.04 shall be
governed by the provisions set forth in Section 9.15.

Section 9.03 Tax Sharing Agreements. All Tax sharing, indemnification, and
similar agreements, written or unwritten, as between a Reorganized EFH Entity,
on the one hand, and a Reorganized TCEH Entity, on the other (other than this
Agreement and any other agreement for which Taxes is not the principal subject
matter), shall be or shall have been terminated (and, to the extent provided
under the Plan, settled) no later than the TCEH Effective Date and, after the
TCEH Effective Date, no Reorganized EFH Entity or Reorganized TCEH Entity
shall have any further rights or obligations under any such Tax sharing,
indemnification or similar agreement, except as provided in the Plan.

Section 9.04 Interest on Late Payments. With respect to any payment among the
Parties pursuant to this Agreement not made by the due date set forth in this
Agreement for such payment, the outstanding amount will accrue interest at a
rate per annum equal to the rate in effect for underpayments under Section
6621 of the Code from such due date to and including the payment date.

Section 9.05 Survival of Covenants. Except as otherwise contemplated by this
Agreement, the covenants and agreements contained herein to be performed
following the Distribution shall survive the Distribution in accordance with
their respective terms.

Section 9.06 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the
application of any such provision to any Person or circumstance shall be
declared judicially to be invalid, unenforceable or void, such decision shall
not have the effect of invalidating or voiding the remainder of this
Agreement, it being the intent and agreement of the Parties that this
Agreement shall be deemed amended by modifying such provision to the extent
necessary to render it valid, legal, and enforceable to the maximum extent
permitted while preserving its intent or, if such modification is not
possible, by substituting therefor another provision that is valid, legal, and
enforceable and that achieves the original intent of the Parties.

Section 9.07 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Exhibits, the other
Transaction Agreements, the Plan and the other documents referred to herein
shall constitute the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and shall supersede all previous negotiations,
commitments, and writings with respect to such subject matter. Except as
otherwise expressly provided herein, in the case of any conflict between the
terms of this Agreement and the terms of any other agreement, the terms of
this Agreement shall control.

Section 9.08 Assignment. This Agreement shall not be assigned or delegated by
a Party (in each case, whether (x) by merger, consolidation or dissolution of
a Party, (y) by contract, operation of law or (z) otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other Parties, and any purported assignment or
delegation in violation of this Agreement shall be null and void.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties hereby acknowledge that the
surviving entity of any merger involving any Party shall be entitled and
subject to all of the rights, benefits and obligations of the Company pursuant
to this Agreement. For purposes of this Section 9.08, the term "merger" refers
to any merger in which a Party is a constituent entity, regardless of whether
it is the surviving or merged entity. As a condition to, and prior to the
consummation of, any direct or indirect transfer or other disposition of all
or substantially all of its assets (whether in a single transaction or a
series of related or unrelated transactions) the Party engaging in such
transfer or other disposition shall require the transferee to assume all of
such Party's obligations hereunder.

Section 9.09 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Nothing in this Agreement, express
or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person (other than the
Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns) any legal or
equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason
of this Agreement, and, except as provided in Article III relating to certain
indemnitees, no Person shall be deemed a third party beneficiary under or by
reason of this Agreement.

Section 9.10 Performance. Each EFH Party shall cause to be performed, and
hereby guarantees the performance of, all actions, agreements, and obligations
set forth herein to be performed by an Affiliate of such EFH Party, and each
Reorganized TCEH Entity shall cause to be performed, and hereby guarantees the
performance of, all actions, agreements, and obligations set forth herein to
be performed by an Affiliate of Reorganized TCEH.

Section 9.11 Amendments; Waivers. This Agreement may not be amended except by
an instrument in writing signed by each of the Parties. No failure or delay by
any Party in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof
nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right hereunder. Any agreement
on the part of any Party to any such waiver shall be valid only if set forth
in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party.

Section 9.12 Interpretation. The Parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement, and in the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of
any provisions of this Agreement.

Section 9.13 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but
all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by
facsimile or portable document format (PDF) shall be as effective as delivery
of a manually executed counterpart of any such Agreement.









29 

Section 9.14 Confidentiality. Each Party shall hold and cause its directors,
officers, employees, advisors, and consultants to hold in strict confidence,
unless compelled to disclose by judicial or administrative process or, in the
opinion of its counsel, by other requirements of law, all information (other
than any such information relating solely to the business or affairs of such
party) concerning the other Party furnished it by such other Party or its
representatives pursuant to this Agreement (except to the extent that such
information can be shown to have been (a) in the public domain through no
fault of such Party or (b) later lawfully acquired from other sources not
under a duty of confidentiality by the party to which it was furnished), and
no Party shall release or disclose such information to any other Person,
except its directors, officers, employees, auditors, attorneys, financial
advisors, bankers or other consultants who shall be advised of and agree to be
bound by the provisions of this Section 9.13. Each Party shall be deemed to
have satisfied its obligation to hold confidential information concerning or
supplied by the other Party if it exercises the same care as it takes to
preserve confidentiality for its own similar information. Except as required
by law or with the prior written consent of the other Party, all Tax Returns,
documents, schedules, work papers and similar items and all information
contained therein, and any other information that is obtained by a Party or
any of its Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement, shall be kept confidential
by such Party and its Affiliates and representatives, shall not be disclosed
to any other Person, and shall be used only for the purposes provided herein.
If a Party or any of its Affiliates is required by law to disclose any such
information, such Party shall give written notice to the other Party prior to
making such disclosure.

Section 9.15 Waiver of Jury Trial. AS A SPECIFICALLY BARGAINED INDUCEMENT FOR
EACH PARTY TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT (WITH EACH PARTY HAVING HAD
OPPORTUNITY TO CONSULT COUNSEL), EACH PARTY EXPRESSLY AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES
THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT
OR ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR ANY OTHER TRANSACTION AGREEMENT, REGARDLESS OF WHICH PARTY INITIATES
SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING, AND ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT
OR ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR ANY OTHER TRANSACTION AGREEMENT SHALL BE TRIED IN A COURT OF
COMPETENT JURISDICTION BY A JUDGE SITTING WITHOUT A JURY.

Section 9.16 Jurisdiction; Service of Process. Any action with respect to this
Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder, or for recognition
and enforcement of any judgment in respect of this Agreement and the rights
and obligations arising hereunder brought by a Party or its successors or
assigns, in each case, shall be brought and determined exclusively in the
Bankruptcy Court (or, if the Bankruptcy Court declines to accept jurisdiction
over a particular matter, then the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware,
and if the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware declines jurisdiction, then
any state or federal court sitting in Delaware). Each Party hereby irrevocably
waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim
or otherwise, in any Action with respect to this Agreement (a) any claim that
is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named courts for
any reason other than the failure to serve in accordance with this Section
9.15, (b) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from







30 

jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such
courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise), and (c) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any
claim that (i) the Action in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum,
(ii) the venue of such Action is improper or (iii) this Agreement, or the
subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts. Each Party
further agrees that no Party to this Agreement shall be required to obtain,
furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a
condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section 9.15 and each
Party waives any objection to the imposition of such relief or any right it
may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or
similar instrument. The Parties hereby agree that mailing of process or other
papers in connection with any such action or proceeding in the manner provided
in Section 9.16, or in such other manner as may be permitted by law, shall be
valid and sufficient service thereof and hereby waive any objections to
service accomplished in the manner herein provided. NOTWITHSTANDING THIS
SECTION 9.15, ANY DISPUTE REGARDING SECTIONS 2.02 OR 2.04 SHALL BE RESOLVED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 9.02; PROVIDED, THAT THE TERMS OF SECTION 9.02 MAY BE
ENFORCED BY EITHER PARTY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS SECTION 9.15.

Section 9.17 Notices. All notices, requests, claims, demands, and other
communications to be given or delivered under or by the provisions of this

Any Party to this Agreement may notify any other Party of any changes to the
address or any of the other details specified in this paragraph; provided,
that such notification shall only be effective on the date specified in such
notice or five (5) Business Days after the notice is given, whichever is
later. Rejection or other refusal to accept or the inability to deliver
because of changed address of which no notice was given shall be deemed to be
receipt of the notice as of the date of such rejection, refusal or inability
to deliver. Any notice to any EFH Party will be deemed notice to all the
Reorganized EFH Entities, and any notice to Reorganized TCEH will be deemed
notice to all the Reorganized TCEH Entities.

Section 9.18 Headings. The headings and captions of the Articles and Sections
used in this Agreement and the table of contents to this Agreement are for
reference and convenience purposes of the Parties only, and will be given no
substantive or interpretive effect whatsoever.

Section 9.19 Effectiveness.

(a) Subject to Section 9.18(b), this Agreement shall become effective upon the
Distribution or the consummation of the Taxable Separation, as appropriate.

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, this
Agreement shall be null, void, and of no force or effect, without any action
required by any Party, (i)



33 

in the event of a Taxable Separation, unless EFH has received a private letter
ruling (or a legally binding agreement with the IRS, including a closing
agreement) that income realized upon the cancellation of the TCEH First Lien
Claims will be excluded from EFH's gross income pursuant to Section
108(a)(1)(A); and (ii) in the event of a Spin-Off, unless EFH has received a
private letter ruling (or a legally binding agreement with the IRS, including
a closing agreement), that (A) subject to the penultimate sentence of this
Section 9.18(b), income realized upon the cancellation of the TCEH First Lien
Claims will be excluded from EFH's gross income pursuant to Section
108(a)(1)(A); or that (B) (x) assuming the Distribution satisfies the
requirements of Section 368(a)(1)(G) and Section 355, EFH will recognize no
income or gain from the cancellation of the TCEH First Lien Claims; and (y) no
amount of the TCEH debt will be treated as having been (1) assumed by
[Reorganized TCEH] pursuant to Section 357(c) and Section 357(d) or (2)
treated as an amount realized in connection with the Preferred Stock Sale. In
the event that this Agreement becomes null, void and of no force or effect
pursuant to the foregoing sentence, the holders of TCEH First Lien Claims
reserve all rights to seek Bankruptcy Court approval of a Taxable Separation
or a Spin-Off that includes the Preferred Stock Sale, and EFH and EFIH reserve
all rights to object to such transactions. In the event the IRS informs the
Parties that a ruling or rulings required by this Section 9.18(b) are not
provided on the basis that such ruling does not present a significant issue,
the requirement to obtain such rulings can be satisfied by the provision of a
"will" opinion to EFH, in form and substance satisfactory to the EFH Parties
and Reorganized TCEH, without substantive qualifications, of a nationally
recognized law or accounting firm, which firm is reasonably acceptable to the
EFH Parties and Reorganized TCEH, addressing the matter covered by such
rulings. For the purposes of such opinion, each of the EFH Parties and
Reorganized TCEH acknowledges that Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison
LLP, Kirkland and Ellis LLP and KPMG LLP are reasonably acceptable to such
entity.

(c) This Agreement shall not become effective with respect to Merger Sub or
Parent until the Merger is consummated.

Section 9.20 Further Assurances. The EFH Parties shall cause each other Person
that is or becomes a Subsidiary of EFH (other than any such Person or
Subsidiary that is "ring fenced," including the Oncor Entities) to execute a
joinder to this Agreement (a) to become an EFH Party (effective as of the date
such Person becomes a Subsidiary of EFH or ceases to be "ring fenced") and (b)
to be bound by the obligations of the EFH Parties under this Agreement on a
joint and several basis. Reorganized TCEH shall cause each Reorganized TCEH
Entity on the date of this Agreement (y) to execute a joinder to this
Agreement to become a Reorganized TCEH Entity (effective as of the date of
this Agreement) and (z) to be bound by the obligations of the Reorganized TCEH
Entities under this Agreement on a joint and several basis.

and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound, the Parties
hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE 1 \- SERVICES

1.1 Transition Services.

(a) During the Term, OpCo hereby agrees to provide, or cause to be provided
(whether through one or more of its Subsidiaries or as permitted pursuant to
Section 1.2), to the Company and its Subsidiaries upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement (i) the services described on
Annex A attached hereto (the "Service Schedule"), (ii) as reasonably requested
by the Company, any other service historically provided to the Company and/or
its Subsidiaries during the period from April 29, 2014 through the date hereof
by EFH Corporate Services, OpCo and/or their respective Subsidiaries, or (iii)
if applicable, other services that may be agreed upon by the Parties in
writing after the date hereof ("Additional Services" and, together with the
services in clauses (i) and (ii), the "Transition Services"). In the event
that the Parties identify and agree upon Additional Services to be provided
under this Agreement, the Parties shall execute an amendment to this Agreement
that provides for the substitution of the relevant Service Schedule, or
additions or supplements to the relevant Service Schedule, in order to
describe such Additional Services and other specific terms and conditions
applicable thereto.







2 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, during the Term, the Parties agree, subject
to Article 6 hereof, that the Transition Services include, to the extent
applicable, the transitioning of information of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the Company and its Subsidiaries that such Company and/or
Subsidiary reasonably require to operate their businesses (including
historical books and records and electronic and other data related to the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries).

(c) In no event shall OpCo or its Affiliates be required to (i) lend any funds
to the Company or its Affiliates or (ii) make any payments or disbursements on
behalf of the Company, except to the extent the Company has previously
delivered to OpCo sufficient funds to make any such payment or disbursement.

(d) Subject to Section 1.1(f), unless otherwise expressly required under the
terms of any relevant Service Schedule hereto, the Tax Matters Agreement, the
Separation Agreement, the Split Participant Agreement, or as otherwise agreed
to by the Parties in writing, in providing the Transition Services, OpCo or
its Affiliates shall not be obligated to: (i) expend funds and other resources
beyond levels that would be customary and reasonable for any other nationally
recognized service provider to perform services that are similar to the
relevant Transition Services; (ii) maintain the employment of any specific
employee or subcontractor; (iii) purchase, lease or license any additional
(measured as of the date hereof) equipment or materials (expressly excluding
any renewal or extension of any leases or licenses required for OpCo to
perform the relevant Transition Services during the Term; provided, that such
extension or renewal shall be subject to Section 3.1 in all respects); or (iv)
pay any of the Company's costs related to its or any of its Affiliates'
receipt of the Transition Services.

(e) The Parties acknowledge the transitional nature of the Transition
Services. In this regard, the Company acknowledges and agrees that it has the
responsibility for the daily and strategic management of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and that the intent of this Agreement and the extent of the
Transition Services to be provided hereunder are for OpCo solely to provide,
during the Term, the back-office and administrative services necessary to
support the on-going daily operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries in a
reasonably prudent manner. Given the transitional nature of the Transition
Services, the Company acknowledges and agrees that OpCo may make changes from
time-to-time in the personnel performing the Transition Services, subject to
Section 1.1(f).

(f) Nothing in Section 1.1(d) or Section 1.1(e) shall alter the obligations of
OpCo to provide the Transition Services during the Term in accordance with the
other provisions of this Agreement, including with regard to type, skill,
care, quantity, scope, timeliness and diligence as provided in Section 1.4(a).

1.2 Personnel; Third-Party Providers.

(a) OpCo hereby agrees, except as otherwise provided in this Section 1.2, it
will not delegate its responsibilities under this Agreement to any
unaffiliated third Person (a "Third-Party Provider") without the Company's
express prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed; it being understood that it would be reasonable for
the Company not to consent to any delegation that would adversely change in
any material respect the obligations of the Company under this Agreement
(including any delegation that would obligate the Company to provide any
incremental credit support or that would materially increase the cost of the
services subject to such delegation)). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Parties acknowledge and agree that the Transition Services that have
historically been provided and supported by Third-Party Providers may be
provided and supported without the consent of the Company; provided that such
Third-Party Provider provision and support does not alter the obligations of
OpCo to provide the Transition Services during the Term in accordance with
this Agreement, including with regard to type, skill, care, quantity, scope,
timeliness and







3 

diligence as provided in Section 1.4(a); provided, further, that, without the
prior written consent of the Company (which consent may be withheld,
conditioned or delayed in the Company's sole discretion), in no event shall
OpCo enter into any arrangement or contract with a Third-Party Provider (1) in
the name of the Company (or any of its affiliates) on its behalf or (2) that
would reasonably be expected to result in the Company (or any of its
affiliates) being required to make, directly or indirectly, any payments to
such Third-Party Provider (or to Opco for services provided by any Third-Party
Provider) following completion of the Transition Services (except, for the
avoidance of doubt, any payments to OpCo for Transition Services performed in
accordance with this Agreement prior to the completion of the Transition
Services which may not have been paid but are otherwise due and payable in
accordance with this Agreement).

(b) In the event OpCo or a Third-Party Provider requires incremental credit
support in connection with the provision of Transition Services, OpCo may
request that the Company provide reasonable credit support to OpCo or such
Third Party Provider with respect thereto. In the event that the Company
elects not to provide such requested credit support (which it may do in its
sole discretion), the Company agrees that the fees to be charged hereunder
shall include any reasonable and documented incremental cost and expense that
OpCo or such Third Party Provider incurs in connection with providing OpCo or
such Third-Party Provider the required credit support for the applicable
Transition Services.

(c) OpCo shall perform its obligations under this Agreement as an independent
contractor. No employees or representatives of OpCo or a Third-Party Provider
shall be deemed to be employees or representatives of the Company. In
performing the Transition Services, such employees and representatives of OpCo
or a Third-Party Provider shall be under the direction, control and
supervision of OpCo or the Third-Party Provider, as applicable, and, subject
to compliance with the requirements set forth in the Service Schedule. OpCo or
the Third-Party Provider, as applicable, shall be solely responsible for
exercising all authority with respect to, and shall bear all liabilities
arising from, the employment (including termination of employment), assignment
and compensation of such employees or representatives (including the payment
of all salary and benefits and all premiums and remittances with respect to
employees used to provide any Transition Services hereunder).

(d) If a Third-Party Provider provides Transition Services in accordance with
this Agreement, such Third-Party Provider shall be a subcontractor engaged by
OpCo. OpCo shall cause each such Third Party Provider to be subject to service
standards and confidentiality provisions at least equivalent to those set
forth herein. OpCo shall remain responsible for the performance by it of all
of its obligations hereunder with respect to the Transition Services provided
by such Third-Party Provider.

1.3 Third Party Consents.

(a) The Parties acknowledge and agree that it may be necessary to obtain from
third parties certain consents, waivers, permits, licenses or sublicenses
("Consents") in order for (i) OpCo to use third-party applications,
Intellectual Property, systems, networks and similar services and functions in
the provision of Transition Services and/or (ii) the Company to receive
Transition Services.

(b) The Parties will cooperate and use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the Consents; provided, however, that the failure
to obtain any such Consent shall not relieve OpCo of its obligation to provide
the relevant Transition Service unless (A) the provision of such Transition
Service is prohibited by applicable Law or (B) such Consent cannot be obtained
in a timely manner after using commercially reasonable efforts. In either case
of clauses (A) or (B) in the preceding sentence, OpCo shall promptly notify
the Company thereof and the Parties will use their commercially reasonable
efforts to implement an alternative means of continuing the provision of the
applicable Transition Service for which the Consent is required, in accordance
with the service standards described in Section 1.4. Each Party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the effects (including the cost)
of such alternative means.



4 

1.4 Level of Service and Limitations.

(a) During the Term, OpCo shall perform, or cause to be performed, the
Transition Services (i) in a professional and workmanlike manner at a quality
substantially equivalent (including with regard to type, skill, care,
quantity, scope, timeliness and diligence) as provided by EFH Corporate
Services and/or any of its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business
during the twelve (12) month period prior to the Petition Date (or, to the
extent new services commenced following the Petition Date, during the twelve
(12) month period prior to the Effective Date) and (ii) in compliance with all
applicable Laws, in all material respects.

(b) During the Term, the Company shall (i) use commercially reasonable efforts
to terminate its need to receive the Transition Services as soon as
commercially practicable after the Effective Date and (ii) allow
representatives of OpCo reasonable access to its employees, facilities,
assets, advisors, systems and information as reasonably requested by OpCo for
purposes of rendering the Transition Services under this Agreement; provided,
that no such access shall unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations
of the Company and its Subsidiaries; and provided, further, that the Company
may exclude any OpCo personnel at its sole discretion from access to any of
its employees, facilities, assets, advisors, systems and/or information due to
a material violation by OpCo personnel of the Company's reasonable health,
safety, data security, conduct or other policies.

(c) In connection with its provision of the Transition Services under this
Agreement, OpCo shall be permitted to rely on any written information or data
provided by the Company, its Subsidiaries or its Representatives, to OpCo,
except to the extent that OpCo has actual knowledge that such information or
data is inaccurate.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, OpCo shall not
be obligated to (and shall not be obligated to cause any Third Party Provider
to) provide any Transition Services if the provision of such Transition
Services would (i) violate any Law or (ii) with respect to legal, accounting
or similar professional services, violate or be in contravention of any rules,
regulations or standards of practice promulgated by any organization or
authority governing such professional service; provided, however, in each
case, that the Parties shall work diligently together in good faith to obtain
or cause to be obtained such Transition Services (including, if applicable,
professional services) from another provider on a commercially reasonable
basis.

(e) During the Term, each Party agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts
to cooperate with the other Party in all matters relating to the provision and
receipt of the Transition Services and to effect an orderly transition of the
Transition Services. This Agreement is a purely commercial transaction between
the Parties and nothing stated in this Agreement shall operate to create any
partnership, or special or fiduciary duty between the Parties.

1.5 Project Managers. OpCo and the Company shall each appoint one or more
individuals to act as project managers (each, a "Project Manager") to (i)
serve as the primary contact for any issues arising out of the performance of
this Agreement or any portion of the Transition Services and (ii) be primarily
responsible for administering the orderly provision or receipt, as applicable,
of the Transition Services (or applicable portion thereof) on its behalf. The
initial Project Managers, as well as their respective addresses for notices
and other communications, are set forth in the Service Schedule. Each Party
agrees to provide reasonable access (in person, by telephone or electronically
via e-mail) during normal business hours to its Project Manager for problem
resolution. Either Party may replace its Project Manager at any time by
providing notice in accordance with Section 7.5, such replacement to be
effective as of the date of the other Party's receipt of such notice.









5 

1.6 No Service Warranty. Except to the extent provided in Section 1.2(d) and
Section 1.4(a), OpCo makes no warranties or representations relating to the
Transition Services or the results of the Transition Services hereunder and
hereby disclaims all representations or warranties, whether express, implied
or statutory, with respect to its performance under this Agreement, including
without limitation any warranty of adequacy, merchantability or fitness for a
particular purpose.

1.7 No Conflicts. OpCo hereby represents and warrants to the Company that,
except as set forth on Annex B attached hereto, to the knowledge of OpCo
(after reasonable inquiry) (i) the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
OpCo and (ii) the performance by OpCo of its obligations under this Agreement
do not violate, in any material respect, applicable Law .

ARTICLE 2 \- TERM AND TERMINATION

2.1 Term. The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and
shall continue until the earlier of (i) the date that is twelve (12) months
from the Effective Date for tax services referred to in Annex A or six (6)
months from the Effective Date for other Transition Services and (ii) the
termination of all Transition Services pursuant to Section 2.2 or Section 2.3
(the "Term"). At the end of the Term all rights and obligations under this
Agreement shall cease, except (a) the rights and obligations that are
expressly stated to survive termination pursuant to Section 2.4 and (b) rights
and obligations that have accrued prior to such termination, including the
obligation to pay any amounts that have become due and payable prior to such
termination.

2.2 Discontinuation of Services. During the Term, the Company may terminate
any particular Transition Service (whether provided directly or indirectly by
OpCo and/or any of its Affiliates or by any Third-Party Provider) and
eliminate it from the scope of the Transition Services provided under this
Agreement upon at least thirty (30) days' (or such other amount of time as
mutually agreed in writing between the Parties) prior written notice to OpCo,
and following such termination the Company shall only be liable to OpCo for
the Fees (as defined below) owed to OpCo in connection with, and attributable
to, the provision of such discontinued Transition Services to the extent
attributable to the period on and before such discontinuation. During the
Term, the Parties shall cooperate as reasonably required to effectuate an
orderly and systematic transfer to the Company, or any such Person at the
request of the Company, of all of the duties and obligations previously
performed by OpCo (whether provided directly or indirectly by Opco and/or any
of its Affiliates or by any Third-Party Provider) under this Agreement that
the Company desires to continue following the Term.

2.3 Early Termination.

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement
or any particular Transition Service may be terminated prior to the expiration
of the Term as follows:

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

with respect to any particular Transition Service, by the Company pursuant to
Section 2.2; 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

by mutual written consent of the Company and OpCo; or 

 









6 

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

by the Company, on the one hand, or OpCo, on the other hand, if the other
Party is in material breach of any of its covenants or obligations set forth
in this Agreement and fails to cure such breach as promptly as reasonably
practicable but in any event within twenty (20) Business Days (or ten (10)
Business Days with respect to any failure to make a required payment under
this Agreement that is not subject to a good faith dispute pursuant to Section
3.3) after receipt of written notice thereof from the other Party (which
notice must specify, in reasonable detail, the nature of such breach). 

2.4 Survival. The termination of this Agreement with respect to any particular
Transition Service pursuant to Section 2.2 or Section 2.3 shall not affect the
provisions of this Agreement and the Service Schedule with respect to a
Transition Service not terminated. Neither the termination of this Agreement
with respect to any particular Transition Service pursuant to Section 2.2 or
Section 2.3 nor the expiration of the Term shall affect (i) the liability of a
Party for a breach of this Agreement prior to the termination or expiration
hereof, (ii) the Parties' obligations set forth in this Section 2.4, Article
5, Article 6 and Article 7, which shall survive any termination or expiration
of this Agreement and (iii) any rights or obligations arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement that have vested, matured or accrued prior to
such termination or expiration, including, the right of OpCo to receive any
and all amounts owed to OpCo hereunder to the extent attributable to the
period on and before such termination or expiration.

ARTICLE 3 \- COMPENSATION

3.1 Fees. In consideration for the provision of the Transition Services, the
Company shall pay to OpCo all reasonable and documented fees, costs, and
expenses (including employee-related, overhead, general and administrative
expenses) incurred by OpCo related directly to the Transition Services
provided during the Term, plus a twenty-five percent (25%) additional mark-up
on all such fees, costs and expenses, excluding from the mark-up all fees,
costs and expenses invoiced, directly or indirectly, by any Third-Party
Provider (which for the avoidance of doubt will be payable by the Company
solely at the amount invoiced by the Third-Party Provider) (collectively, the
"Fees"). Annex C attached hereto sets forth a good faith "ballpark" estimate
of all Fees that OpCo expects the Company will incur under this Agreement
during the Term for the Transition Services that OpCo expects will be required
to support the on-going daily operations of the Company and its subsidiaries
in a reasonably prudent manner (it being understood that such the amounts set
forth on Annex C are an estimate and the actual Fees to be incurred may differ
from such estimate and OpCo shall, except as otherwise provided under this
Agreement, have no liability solely as a result of such difference).

3.2 Invoices. Within ten (10) Business Days after the end of each calendar
month, OpCo (on behalf of itself and each of its Subsidiaries providing
Transition Services) shall submit an invoice (each, an "Invoice") to the
Company setting forth (i) a reasonably detailed description of the Transition
Services provided by OpCo and its Subsidiaries during such calendar month and
(ii) reasonable documentation and supporting detail of the Fees owing for such
Transition Services (including any third-party invoices related thereto).

3.3 Time of Payment; Disputes; Interest; No Deductions.

(a) The Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, all undisputed amounts due
under this Agreement within thirty (30) days after receipt of the applicable
Invoice. Such payment shall be made in immediately available funds by bank
wire transfer to an account designated by OpCo.

(b) The Company shall promptly (and in no event later than thirty (30) days
following receipt of any Invoice) notify OpCo of any good faith objection of
the Company with regard to such Invoice and the failure to so object shall be
definitive evidence of the acceptance of such Invoice. If requested by the
Company, OpCo shall promptly furnish reasonable documentation to substantiate
the



7 

amounts invoiced, including listing the date(s), time(s) and amount(s) of the
Transition Services in question. Following any good faith invoice objection,
the Company and OpCo shall cooperate in good faith and use commercially
reasonable efforts to resolve any remaining dispute expeditiously, without
prejudice to either Party's rights under Section 7.3 or Section 7.8. The
Company shall pay all disputed amounts in accordance with the resolution of
such disputed amount within five (5) Business Days after such resolution.

(c) If the Company has not paid any undisputed amounts within thirty (30) days
after receipt of the applicable Invoice with respect thereto, such undisputed
amounts shall accrue interest at the lesser of (i) the maximum rate allowed by
applicable Law, and (ii) the prime rate published in The Wall Street Journal
plus 4% per annum, and the Company shall pay OpCo such accrued interest.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure of the Company to pay any material
undisputed amounts within thirty (30) days after receipt of the applicable
Invoice with respect thereto shall also constitute a material breach of this
Agreement.

3.4 Taxes.

(a) All Fees shall be exclusive of any goods and services taxes, value added
taxes or similar taxes on the performance or delivery of Transition Services
(collectively "Sales Taxes").

(b) To the extent that OpCo is obligated to collect and remit any Sales Tax in
respect of the Transition Services herein provided, the Company shall pay the
amount of such Sales Taxes to OpCo in addition to the Fees otherwise payable
hereunder. Any amount required to be paid under this Section 3.4(b) and not
paid by the due date for payment shall be subject to the late charges
specified in Section 3.3(c).

(c) Subject to Section 3.4(b), OpCo shall be responsible for and shall pay all
taxes, assessments or other charges against it in connection with the
Transition Services, including taxes on OpCo's income or profits thereon and
all taxes imposed on or assessed or levied against or on account of salaries
or other compensation or other benefits or amounts paid or provided to OpCo's
employees or subcontractors. OpCo accepts full and exclusive liability for and
shall indemnify, defend and hold the Company harmless from and against any and
all claims arising out of income or payroll taxes or withholding taxes
assessed or levied in respect of the provision of Transition Services
hereunder by any Governmental Entity.

(d) OpCo shall not be reimbursed for any (i) real or personal property taxes
on property it owns or leases, (ii) franchise, margin, privilege or similar
taxes on its business, (iii) payroll or employment taxes of its employees
(including income tax, social security taxes, unemployment compensation,
workers' compensation tax, other employment taxes or withholdings), (iv) taxes
based on its income or gross receipts or (v) withholding taxes. Should there
be any withholding tax required for payment made hereunder, the Company shall
have the right to withhold such amount from money due to OpCo under this
Agreement for payment of taxes, assessment or other charges. Such payment by
the Company shall relieve the Company of further obligation with respect to
any amount withheld and OpCo shall assist the Company by submitting the
necessary documents to support the application for the Company to recover such
amount later, if applicable.

(e) Within thirty (30) days after receiving notification of the commencement
of any Sales Tax, VAT or other similar tax audit by a tax authority which
involves the provision of any Transition Services or access to any facilities
provided hereunder, the Party receiving such notice shall notify the other
Party of such audit. Thereafter, the Party receiving such notice shall control
all proceedings taken in connection with such Sales Tax or VAT or other
similar tax audit and shall take







8 



reasonable steps to keep the other Party informed of the progress of any such
audit; provided, however, that where the other Party is liable to pay an
amount in respect of such Sales Tax, VAT or other similar tax pursuant to this
Section 3.4, the controlling Party shall not settle or otherwise compromise
such audit without the other Party's consent. The other Party shall have the
right (but not the duty) to participate in any proceeding to contest Sales
Tax, VAT or other similar liability, and shall have the right to retain tax
advisers or counsel at its own expense.

(f) Subject to applicable Law, the Parties shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate with each other in connection with obtaining any
available reduction of, or exemption from, any taxes due in respect of the
provision of Transition Services to the extent possible.

ARTICLE 4 \- FORCE MAJEURE

4.1 Force Majeure.

(a) If any Party is rendered unable, wholly or in part, by Force Majeure (as
defined below) to carry out its obligations under this Agreement, other than
obligations to make monetary payments, that Party shall give the non-affected
Party prompt written notice of the cause and extent of the Force Majeure, the
date of commencement thereof and the means proposed to be adopted to remedy or
abate such Force Majeure, following which the affected Party shall be excused
from performance of its obligations under this Agreement solely to the extent,
and for the period, that such performance is prevented by such Force Majeure.
The affected Party shall use commercially reasonable diligence to remove or
remediate the Force Majeure as quickly as possible and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to develop a mutually satisfactory solution to such Force
Majeure with the non-affected Party. If any Transition Service is interrupted
or suspended due to an event of Force Majeure, (i) the Company shall be
entitled to an equitable reduction of Fees payable for the affected Transition
Services and (ii) the Company shall have the right to immediately terminate
the affected Transition Service and/or any Transition Service linked to the
affected Transition Service.

(b) The term "Force Majeure" shall mean any act of God, industry wide strikes
directly impacting the Transition Services, act of the public enemy, war,
blockade, terrorism, public riot, lightning, fire, storm, flood, explosion,
governmental action, or other circumstance that is beyond the reasonable
control of the affected Party and which did not arise from the fraud, bad
faith, intentional or willful misconduct or gross negligence of the affected
Party.

ARTICLE 5 \- INDEMNIFICATION AND DISCLAIMER

5.1 The Company's Indemnity. SUBJECT TO SECTION 5.4, THE COMPANY HEREBY AGREES
TO INDEMNIFY, HOLD HARMLESS AND DEFEND OPCO AND OPCO'S SUBSIDIARIES AND ITS

ITS AFFILIATES AND SUCH THIRD PARTY PROVIDER OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES (WHETHER
OR NOT SUCH DISPUTE RELATES TO THE PROVISION OF THE TRANSITION SERVICES
HEREUNDER BUT SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDING ANY SUCH LOSSES CAUSED BY OR ARISING OUT
OF THE FRAUD, GROSS NEGLIGENCE, OR INTENTIONAL OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF, OR
MATERIAL BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT BY, ANY MEMBER OF THE COMPANY GROUP). FOR
THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, THE INDEMNITY IN THE PRECEDING SENTENCE SHALL NOT
EFFECT THE OBLIGATION OF THE COMPANY TO PAY FEES IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE
III.

5.3 Limited Liability of the OpCo Group. NO MEMBER OF THE OPCO GROUP shall
have any liability to any member of the company group, in contract, tort or
otherwise, for or in connection with (a) any transition Services provided or
to be provided or any access to any Facilities provided or to be provided by
OpCo pursuant to this agreement or (b) any actions or inactions of any company

except to the extent that any member of the company group suffers a Loss that
results from SUCH OPCO GROUP MEMBER'S MATERIAL BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT,
FRAUD, gross negligence, OR INTENTIONAL or willful misconduct in connection
with any such Services or access to any such Facilities.

5.4 Enforceability. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if
SECTION 5.1, SECTION 5.2 or any other provision herein modifying section 5.1
or section 5.2 contains an indemnity obligation that is unenforceable under
applicable law, then this ARTICLE 5 will be modified, read, construed and
enforced to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and any obligation
that is enforceable will remain in full force and effect and be binding on the
Parties.

Agreement on the basis that the Party had no notice or knowledge of such
provisions or that such provisions are not "conspicuous." The Parties
acknowledge and agree that the provisions contained in this Agreement that are
set out in "ALL CAPS" satisfy the "express negligence rule" (to the extent
applicable) and any other requirement at law or in equity that provisions
contained in a contract be conspicuously marked or highlighted.

ARTICLE 6 \- CONFIDENTIALITY

6.1 Confidential Information.

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, "Business Information" means all
confidential or proprietary business, financial or technical data, documents,
plans, intellectual property and other information, in whatever form, relating
to the operations, businesses or assets of a Party or its Affiliates (the
"Discloser") that is disclosed to, or received by, the other Party (the
"Recipient") in connection with the services or arrangements contemplated by
this Agreement. Each Recipient shall, and shall cause its Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, and contractors and its and their
Representatives to, hold the Business Information of the Discloser in
confidence and not to use or disclose such Business Information, except as
reasonably required for the purposes of this Agreement or otherwise expressly
permitted hereunder. Each Party (as the Recipient) shall use no less than the
same degree of care that it uses to protect its own confidential information
of similar sensitivity to protect the Business Information of the other Party,
but in no event less than a commercially reasonable degree of care. The
restrictions of this Article 6 shall not apply to Business Information that:







11 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a
violation of this Section 6.1 by the Recipient or its Affiliates, directors,
officers, employees, or contractors or its or their Representatives; 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

is developed by the Recipient or its Affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, or contractors or its or their Representatives without the use of
or reference to any of the Discloser's Business Information; 

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

is rightfully obtained by the Recipient or its Affiliates, directors,
officers, employees, or contractors or its or their Representatives from a
third-party source which such Person reasonably believes was not subject to
any legal, contractual or fiduciary duty to the Discloser; or 

| 
---|--- 

(iv)

|

is identified in writing by the Discloser as no longer proprietary or
confidential. 

(b) Nothing herein shall prevent a Recipient or its Affiliates, directors,
officers, employees, or contractors or its or their Representatives from
disclosing Business Information (i) as required by applicable Law or upon the
order of any court or administrative agency, (ii) upon the request or demand
of, or pursuant to any regulation of, any regulatory agency or authority
(including any self-regulatory agency, stock exchange or quotation system),
(iii) to the extent reasonably required in connection with the exercise of any
remedy hereunder in connection with the conduct or defense of any civil,
criminal or administrative actions, suits, complaints, enforcement actions,
penalty assessments, claims, hearings, arbitrations, investigations,
inquiries, audits or other proceedings (formal or informal, public or non-
public) (each, an "Action"), (iv) to its Affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, or contractors or its or their Representatives as necessary to
perform the Transition Services pursuant to the terms of this Agreement,
provided that such Persons are informed of the confidential nature of the
Business Information, and the Recipient shall be liable to the Discloser for
the use or disclosure thereof by such Person in violation of the terms hereof;
provided, further, that if Recipient or its Affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, or contractors or its or their Representatives is requested or
required pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) to disclose any Business Information
of the Discloser, such Recipient shall notify the Discloser promptly in
writing, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, of such requirement so
that the Discloser may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy or
waive compliance with this Article 6, and the Recipient or its Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, or contractors or its or their Representatives
(as applicable) shall disclose only that portion of such Business Information
which it believes in its reasonable judgment is legally required to be
disclosed and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
assurances that confidential treatment shall be accorded such Business
Information.

6.2 Length of Confidentiality Obligation. Each Party agrees to maintain and
protect the confidentiality of the Business Information of the other Party as
set forth in this Article 6 during the Term and for two (2) years after the
expiration of the Term.

ARTICLE 7 \- MISCELLANEOUS

7.1 Waiver of Compliance. Any failure of OpCo, on the one hand, or the
Company, on the other hand, to comply with an obligation, covenant, agreement
or condition contained in this Agreement may be expressly waived in writing by
the non-failing Party, but such waiver or failure to insist upon strict
compliance shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any
subsequent or other failure.







12 

7.2 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS

WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) EACH PARTY
HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 7.2.

7.3 Governing Law and Venue. THIS AGREEMENT, TOGETHER WITH ANY CLAIM, DISPUTE,
REMEDY OR LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY
RELIEF OR REMEDIES SOUGHT BY THE PARTIES, AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF
THE PARTIES HEREUNDER, SHALL BE CONSTRUED, PERFORMED AND ENFORCED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO
ITS PRINCIPLES OR RULES OF CONFLICT OF LAWS TO THE EXTENT SUCH PRINCIPLES OR
RULES WOULD REQUIRE OR PERMIT THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANOTHER
JURISDICTION. Each of the Parties (i) submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the Bankruptcy Court (or, if the Bankruptcy Court declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, then the Chancery Court of the State of
Delaware, and if the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware declines
jurisdiction, then any state or federal court sitting in Delaware) in any
Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement, (ii) agrees that all
claims in respect of such Action may be heard and determined in any such court
and (iii) agrees not to bring any Action arising out of or relating to this
Agreement (whether on the basis of a claim sounding in contract, tort or
otherwise) in any other court. Each of the Parties agrees that a final
judgment in any such Action shall be conclusive (subject to any appeals
therefrom) and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by Law. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and
effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby in any Delaware or federal court in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 7.3. Each of the Parties hereby
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such Action in any such court. Each
of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to service of
process in the manner provided for notices in Section 7.5. Nothing in this
Agreement will affect the right of any Party to serve process in any other
manner permitted by Law.

7.4 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts
(including by electronic means), each such counterpart being deemed to be an
original instrument, and all such counterparts taken together constituting one
and the same agreement.

7.10 Intellectual Property Rights.

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section 7.10, each of OpCo
and the Company and their respective Affiliates shall retain all right, title
and interest in and to their respective intellectual property and any and all
improvements, modifications and derivative works thereof. No license or right,
express or implied, is granted under this Agreement by OpCo, the Company or
their respective Affiliates in or to their respective intellectual property,
except that, solely to the extent required for the provision or receipt of the
Transition Services in accordance with this Agreement, each of OpCo and the
Company, for itself and on behalf of their respective Affiliates, hereby
grants to the other (and their respective Affiliates) a non-exclusive,
revocable, non-transferable license during the Term to such intellectual
property that is provided by the granting party to the other party
("Licensee") in connection with this Agreement, but only to the extent and for
the duration necessary for the Licensee to provide or receive the applicable
Transition Services as permitted by this Agreement. Upon the expiration of
such time, or the earlier termination of such Transition Service in accordance
with this Agreement, the license to the relevant intellectual property will
terminate; provided, however, that all licenses granted hereunder shall
terminate immediately upon the expiration or earlier termination of this
Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof. The foregoing license is
subject to any licenses granted by others with respect to intellectual
property not owned by OpCo, the Company or their respective Affiliates.

(b) Subject to the limited license granted in Section 7.10(a), in the event
that any intellectual property is created by OpCo (or a Third-Party Provider,
if applicable) in the performance of the Transition Services or provision of
access to the facilities, all right, title and interest throughout the world
in and to all such intellectual property shall vest solely in OpCo (or such
Third-Party Provider, if applicable) unconditionally and immediately upon such
intellectual property having been developed, written or produced.

(c) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, none of OpCo (or
its Affiliates) and the Company (or its Affiliates) shall have any rights or
licenses with respect to any intellectual property (including software),
hardware or facility of the other Party. All rights and licenses not expressly
granted in this Agreement or in any other agreement contemplated by the
transactions set forth in the Merger Agreement are expressly reserved by the
relevant Party. Each of OpCo and the Company shall from time to time execute
any documents and take any other actions reasonably requested by the other
Party to effectuate the intent of this Section 7.10.

7.11 No Assumption; Other Agreements. Nothing herein shall be deemed to (a)
constitute the assumption by OpCo or any of its Affiliates, or the agreement
to assume, any duties, obligations or liabilities of the Company or its
Affiliates whatsoever; or (b) alter, amend or otherwise modify any obligation
of the Parties or their Affiliates under the Separation Agreement, the Tax
Matters Agreement, the Split Participant Agreement or in any other agreement
contemplated by the transactions set forth in the Merger Agreement.

7.12 Severability. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable
and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any provision of
this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any circumstance,
is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable provision shall be
substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and
enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable provision
and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision
to other Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or
unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the
validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application thereof, in
any other jurisdiction.





16 

7.13 Interpretation; Construction.

(a) Headings herein are for convenience of reference only, do not constitute
part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or otherwise affect
any of the provisions hereof. Where a reference in this Agreement is made to a
section, annex or schedule, such reference shall be to a section of or annex
or schedule to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Such annexes and
schedules are an integral part of this Agreement and shall be treated as if
fully set forth herein. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by
the words "without limitation." The words "hereof," "hereto," "hereby,"
"herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this
Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not any particular
provision of this Agreement.

(b) The Parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement.

7.14 Assignment; Delegation

7.15 . This Agreement shall not be assigned or delegated by a Party (in each
case, whether (x) by merger, consolidation or dissolution of a Party, (y) by
contract, operation of law or (z) otherwise) without the prior written consent
of the other Parties, and any purported assignment or delegation in violation
of this Agreement shall be null and void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Company and OpCo hereby acknowledge that, following the Merger, Merger Sub, as
the surviving company in the Merger, shall be entitled and subject to all of
the rights, benefits and obligations of the Company pursuant to this
Agreement. For purposes of this Section 7.14, the term "merger" refers to any
merger in which a Party is a constituent entity, regardless of whether it is
the surviving or merged entity. As a condition to, and prior to the
consummation of, any direct or indirect transfer or other disposition of all
or substantially all of its assets (whether in a single transaction or a
series of related or unrelated transactions) the Party engaging in such
transfer or other disposition shall require the transferee to assume all of
such Party's obligations hereunder.

7.15 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (which includes the Service Schedule),
together with the Merger Agreement, the Separation Agreement, the Tax Matters
Agreement, the Split Participant Agreement and the other agreements
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement, and
supersedes all other prior agreements, understandings, representations and
warranties both written and oral, between the Parties, with respect to the
subject matter hereof.

Exhibit I

Private Letter Ruling and Tax Opinions1

The following are "Supplemental Rulings":

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

The unsecured EFH Creditors and the unsecured EFIH Creditors, to the extent
such creditors receive Common Stock in the EFH Issuances, will be treated as
"owners of the enterprise" with respect to EFH for purposes of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.355-2(c)(1). 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Persons receiving Reorganized EFH Common Stock pursuant to the EFH Issuances
will not be aggregated for purposes of applying Section 355(d) to the
Reorganized TCEH Spin-Off. 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

In addition to the specific Supplemental Rulings listed above, a ruling in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company and Parent that the
Merger does not cause Section 355(d) to apply to the Reorganized TCEH Spin-
Off. A ruling that provides that Parent will not be aggregated with persons
receiving Reorganized EFH Common Stock pursuant to the EFH Issuances shall be
a reasonably satisfactory ruling for these purposes 

The following are "Fundamental Opinions":

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

The following opinions of nationally recognized tax counsel or a Big Four
accounting firm (who shall be permitted to rely upon reasonable
representations, including a representation that the Debtors and Reorganized
TCEH have no plan or intention at the time of the Merger to take, and have not
taken, any action that is inconsistent with the Spin-Off Intended Tax
Treatment), at a "should" level: 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

Taking into account the Merger, the Contribution, Reorganized TCEH Conversion,
and Distribution should meet the requirements of Sections 368(a)(1)(G), 355,
and 356 of the Internal Revenue Code. 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

EFH should not recognize gain for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result
of the Contribution or the Reorganized TCEH Conversion other than gain
recognized pursuant to the transfer of assets to the Preferred Stock Entity
and the Preferred Stock Sale. 

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

EFH should recognize no gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes upon
the Distribution. 

 

________________________

1 Terms used but not defined in this Exhibit I shall have the meanings
ascribed to them in the Initial IRS Submissions.





| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

The following opinion of nationally recognized tax counsel or a Big Four
accounting firm (who shall be permitted to rely upon reasonable
representations, including a representation that the Debtors and Reorganized
TCEH have no plan or intention at the time of the Merger to take, and have not
taken, any action that is inconsistent with the Spin-Off Intended Tax
Treatment), at a "will" level that Section 355(g) will not apply to the
Reorganized TCEH Spin-Off.

Subsidiaries which are, or hold, TCEH Assets to, transfer, convey and deliver
to SpinCo or a member of the SpinCo Group designated by SpinCo, and SpinCo or
such member of the SpinCo Group, as applicable, shall accept from the Company

Liabilities.

(b) In furtherance of the transactions described in Section 2.1(a), on the
TCEH Effective Date:

(i) the Company and SpinCo shall, and the Company and SpinCo shall cause their
applicable Subsidiaries to, execute assignment and assumption agreements
substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A, and such additional
bills of sale, quitclaim deeds, stock or equity powers, certificates of title,
assignments of contracts and other instruments of transfer, conveyance and
assignment and other documents as are reasonably necessary to evidence the
transfer, conveyance and assignment of the TCEH Assets to SpinCo or the
applicable member of the SpinCo Group designated by SpinCo and the valid and
effective assumption of the Assumed Liabilities by SpinCo or the applicable
member of the SpinCo Group designated by SpinCo; and

(ii) the Contributed Plans will be transferred and assigned by the Company and
the applicable Debtors and assumed by OpCo pursuant to the Assignment and

Each of the assignments, transfers, assumptions and other transactions

respect to any transfer or assignment of any Acquired TCEH Assets or

(c) SpinCo hereby waives compliance by each and every member of the Company

respect to the transfer or sale of any or all of the Acquired TCEH Assets to
SpinCo.

7 

Section 2.2 Approvals and Notifications.

(a) The Parties will use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all
material Approvals and Notifications, if any, necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as soon as reasonably
practicable, including the Specified Approvals, if any.

(b) If the transfer or assignment of any Acquired TCEH Assets or assumption of
any Assumed Liabilities would violate, in any material respect, any applicable
Law or require any Approvals and Notifications or release which have not been
obtained or made, notwithstanding the receipt of the Specified Approvals, then
those Acquired TCEH Assets or Assumed Liabilities will be identified in
reasonable detail in a written notice given by any Party that would violate
such Law by the transfer or receipt of the Acquired TCEH Assets or the
assignment or assumption of the Assumed Liability or require such Approvals
and Notifications or release, and unless the Parties mutually shall otherwise
determine, the transfer or assignment of such Acquired TCEH Assets or the
assumption of such Assumed Liabilities, as the case may be, shall be
automatically deemed deferred and any such purported transfer, assignment or
assumption shall be null and void until such time as all such Approvals and
Notifications or releases have been obtained or made.

(c) If any transfer or assignment of any Acquired TCEH Asset or any assumption
of any Assumed Liability intended to be transferred, assigned or assumed
hereunder, as the case may be, is not consummated on the TCEH Effective Date,
as a result of the provisions of Section 2.2(b) or otherwise, then the Parties
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to effect such transfer, assignment
or assumption as promptly following the TCEH Effective Date as shall be
reasonably practicable. The member of the Company Group retaining such
Acquired TCEH Asset or such Assumed Liability, as the case may be, shall
thereafter hold such Acquired TCEH Asset or Assumed Liability, as the case may
be, for the use and benefit of the member of the SpinCo Group entitled thereto
(at the expense of the member of the SpinCo Group entitled thereto) until such
Acquired TCEH Asset or Assumed Liability is transferred and conveyed to, and
assumed by, or until such time as the Company, in good faith, concludes that
it is unable, using commercially reasonable efforts, to obtain or cause to be
obtained, any consent, approval or release required to transfer such Acquired
TCEH Asset or Assumed Liability to, a member of the SpinCo Group, and SpinCo
shall, or shall cause the applicable member of the SpinCo Group to, pay or
reimburse the Party retaining such Acquired TCEH Asset or Assumed Liability
for all amounts reasonably paid or incurred in connection with the retention
of such Acquired TCEH Asset or Assumed Liability. The Parties agree that, as
between the Parties, as of the TCEH Effective Date, the applicable member of
the SpinCo Group shall be deemed to have acquired complete and sole beneficial
ownership over all of the Acquired TCEH Assets, together with all rights,
powers and privileges incident thereto, and shall be deemed to have assumed in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement all of the Assumed Liabilities,
and all duties, obligations and responsibilities incident thereto, which such
member is entitled to acquire or required to assume pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement.

(d) With respect to any Acquired TCEH Assets or Assumed Liabilities described
in Section 2.2(c), each of the Company and SpinCo shall, and shall cause the
members of its respective Group to, (i) treat for all income Tax purposes and
for all purposes of the Tax Matters Agreement, (A) any Acquired TCEH Asset
retained by the Company Group as having been transferred to and owned by the
member of the SpinCo Group entitled to such Acquired TCEH Asset not later than
the TCEH Effective Date and (B) any Assumed Liability retained by the Company
Group as a liability having been assumed and owned by the member of the SpinCo
Group intended to be subject to such Assumed Liabilities not later than the
TCEH Effective Date and (ii) neither report nor take any income Tax position
(on a Tax Return or otherwise) inconsistent with such treatment (unless
required by a change in applicable Tax Law or good faith resolution of a
dispute with a Governmental Entity relating to income Taxes).







8 

(e) If and when any violation of Law or other impediment with respect to such
retained Acquired TCEH Asset or Assumed Liabilities has been resolved, the
transfer or assignment of the applicable Acquired TCEH Asset or the assumption
of the applicable Assumed Liability, as the case may be, shall be effected in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the applicable Assignment and
Assumption Agreement.

(f) Any member of the Company Group retaining an Acquired TCEH Asset or
Assumed Liability due to the deferral of the transfer or assignment of such
Acquired TCEH Asset or the deferral of the assumption of such Assumed
Liability, as the case may be, shall not, in connection with such retention,
be obligated, unless the Parties have executed documentation providing for
such asset or liability to be retained by such member of the Company Group
pursuant to Section 2.2(b), to expend any money whatsoever unless the
necessary funds are advanced (or otherwise made available) by SpinCo or the
member of the SpinCo Group entitled to the Acquired TCEH Asset or Assumed
Liability.

Section 2.3 Responsibility for Assumed Liabilities Retained by the Company. If
the Company or SpinCo is unable to obtain, or to cause to be obtained, any
consent, approval, amendment or release required to transfer an Assumed
Liability to a member or members of the SpinCo Group, then the applicable
member of the Company Group shall continue to retain such Assumed Liability
and, the applicable member of the SpinCo Group shall, as agent or
subcontractor for such member of the Company Group, as the case may be, pay,
perform and discharge fully all the obligations or other Liabilities of such
member of the Company Group that constitute or are caused by such Assumed
Liabilities, as the case may be, thereunder from and after the Contribution
Effective Time. From and after the Contribution Effective Time, OpCo shall
indemnify each Company Indemnified Party, and hold each of them harmless,
against any Liabilities arising from any such retained Assumed Liability;
provided that OpCo shall have no obligation to indemnify any Company
Indemnified Party that has engaged in any fraud, willful misconduct or knowing
and intentional violation of Law, in each case in connection therewith. The
Company shall cause each member of the Company Group without further
consideration, to pay and remit, or cause to be paid or remitted, to the
applicable member of the SpinCo Group, promptly all money, rights and other
consideration received by it or any member of the Company Group in respect of
such performance under any agreement, lease, license or other obligations or
Liabilities under any Assumed Liability retained by any member of the Company
Group; provided that the Company shall be entitled to offset any amounts owed
by the SpinCo Group to any member of the Company Group hereunder. If and when
any such consent, substitution, approval, amendment or release shall be
obtained, or the obligations under any agreement, lease, license or other
obligations or Liabilities under any Assumed Liability retained by any member
of the Company Group shall otherwise become assignable or able to be novated,
the applicable member of the Company Group shall promptly assign, or cause to
be assigned, all its obligations and other Liabilities thereunder or any
obligations of any member of the Company Group to the applicable member of the
SpinCo Group without payment of further consideration, and the applicable
member of the SpinCo Group shall, without the payment of any further
consideration, assume such obligations or other Liabilities in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement and the applicable Assignment and Assumption
Agreement.

be withheld, shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, provide notice

or any of its Subsidiaries' inadvertent failure to comply with this Section

Confidential Information is required to be disclosed may seek to obtain an
order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded
to designated portions of such Confidential Information, and the disclosing
Party shall reasonably cooperate with the other Party in connection with such
other Party\'s efforts to obtain confidential treatment or similar reliable
assurances that the relevant Confidential Information will remain
confidential. For purposes of this Section 3.5, such Confidential Information

(whether by contract or otherwise).

accordance with this Article III, Information that is not relevant to its
request shall promptly either destroy such Information or return it to the
providing Party, at the option of the providing Party, and if the receiving

personnel and agents of the members of its respective Group as witnesses and
any books, records or other documents within its control or which it otherwise
has the ability to make available, to the extent that any such person (giving
consideration to business demands of such directors, officers, employees,
other personnel and agents) or books, records or other documents may
reasonably be required in connection with any Action in which the requesting
Party may from time to time be involved, regardless of whether such Action is
a matter with respect to which indemnification may be sought hereunder;
provided, that no such access shall unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of such Party and its Subsidiaries; provided, further, that no
Party shall be required to make available to the requesting Party any such
persons or materials if doing so could be commercially detrimental, violate
any Law or agreement, or waive any attorney-client privilege held by such
Party provided, further, that, as applicable, the Party making such assertion
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, provide notice to the
receiving party that any Information is being withheld pursuant to this
proviso and the Parties shall use their respective commercially reasonable
efforts to find a mutually agreeable solution to any such commercial, legal
and/or privilege concerns, including, if applicable, by providing any
privileged Information pursuant to a joint defense agreement to be mutually
agreed and executed between the applicable Parties. The requesting Party shall
bear all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses in connection therewith.

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Section 3.7 are in
furtherance of the provisions of Section 3.1 and shall not be deemed to in any
way limit or otherwise modify the Parties' rights and obligations under
Section 3.1.

THE TRANSFEREE GOOD AND MARKETABLE TITLE, AND CLEAR OF ANY SECURITY INTEREST
OR ANY NECESSARY CONSENTS OR GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS ARE NOT OBTAINED OR THAT

Article V

releases and indemnification

Section 5.1 Termination of Guarantees. The Parties acknowledge and agree that
the obligations of the Company Group under or with respect to the EFH/TCEH
Guarantees shall be terminated and extinguished as of the Contribution
Effective Time pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization.



13 

Section 5.2 General Indemnification by OpCo. Subject to the provisions and
limitations of this Article V, from and after the Contribution Effective Time,
OpCo shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Person that after the
Contribution Effective Time is a member of the Company Group (including all
Affiliates of the Company) and each of their respective Representatives and,
as applicable, each of the heirs, executors, successors and assigns of any of
the foregoing (collectively, the "Company Indemnified Parties"), from and
against:

(a) any Assumed Liability, including the failure of any member of the SpinCo
Group or any other Person to pay, perform or otherwise promptly discharge any
Assumed Liability in accordance with its terms, whether prior to, at or after
the Contribution Effective Time;

(b) any TCEH Company Liability, including the failure of any member of the
SpinCo Group or any other Person to pay, perform or otherwise promptly
discharge any TCEH Company Liability in accordance with its terms, whether
prior to, at or after the Contribution Effective Time; and

(c) any Liability arising from any breach by any member of the SpinCo Group of
any covenant or other agreement (other than any representation or warranty)
set forth in this Agreement or in any Assignment and Assumption Agreement,
subject to any limitations of liability provisions and other provisions
applicable to any such breach set forth herein or therein.

Section 5.3 General Indemnification by the Company. Subject to the provisions
and limitations of this Article V, from and after the Contribution Effective
Time, the Company shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Person that
after the Contribution Effective Time is a member of the SpinCo Group
(including all Affiliates of SpinCo) and each of their respective
Representatives and, as applicable, each of the heirs, executors, successors
and assigns of any of the foregoing, from and against:

(a) any Excluded Liability, including the failure of any member of the Company
Group or any other Person to pay, perform or otherwise promptly discharge any
Excluded Liability in accordance with their respective terms, whether prior
to, at or after the Contribution Effective Time; and

(b) any Liability arising from any breach by any member of the Company Group
of any covenant or other agreement (other than any representation or warranty)
set forth in this Agreement or in any Assignment and Assumption Agreement,
subject to any limitations of liability provisions and other provisions
applicable to any such breach set forth herein or therein.

Section 5.4 Tax Indemnification. Notwithstanding anything in Article V to the
contrary, indemnification for Taxes and for other matters subject to the Tax
Matters Agreement is governed solely by the terms, provisions and procedures
of the Tax Matters Agreement and not by this Article V.

Section 5.5 Contribution. If the indemnification provided for in this Article
V shall, for any reason, be unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless any
Indemnified Party hereunder in respect of any Liability, then each
Indemnifying Party shall, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party,
contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result
of such Liability, in such proportion as shall be sufficient to place the
Indemnified Party in the same position as if such Indemnified Party were
indemnified hereunder, the Parties intending that their respective
contributions hereunder be as close as possible to the indemnification under
Section 5.2 and Section 5.3, as the case may be. If the contribution provided
for in the previous sentence shall, for any reason, be unavailable or
insufficient to put any Indemnified Party in the same position as if it were
indemnified under Section 5.2 or Section 5.3, as the case may be, then the
Indemnifying Party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such
Indemnified Party as a result of such Liability, in such proportion as shall
be appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by and the relative
fault of the indemnifying Party on the one hand and the Indemnified Party on
the other hand with respect to the matter giving rise to the Liability.





14 



Section 5.6 Indemnification Obligations Net of Insurance Proceeds and Other
Amounts. Any Liability subject to indemnification or contribution pursuant to
this Article V will be (a) net of Insurance Proceeds that are actually
received by the Indemnified Party, (b) decreased by any actual recoveries from
third parties pursuant to indemnification or otherwise with respect thereto,
(c) decreased by any Tax Benefit actually recovered, and (d) increased by any
Tax Cost actually incurred as a result of the receipt of (or entitlement to)
such indemnity payment, as applicable. Accordingly, the amount which any Party
(an "Indemnifying Party") is required to pay to any Person entitled to
indemnification under this Article V (an "Indemnified Party") will be reduced
by any such Insurance Proceeds and/or recoveries actually received from third
parties and/or Tax Benefits actually recovered, and increased by Tax Costs
actually incurred, in each case, by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party in
respect of the related Liability, as applicable. If an Indemnified Party
receives a payment (an "Indemnity Payment") required by this Agreement from an
Indemnifying Party in respect of any Liability and subsequently receives
Insurance Proceeds or any other recovery from a third party (including any Tax
Benefit actually recovered), then the Indemnified Party will pay to the
Indemnifying Party an amount equal to the lesser of (x) the amount of such
Insurance Proceeds or the amount actually received from the third party
(including any Tax Benefit actually recovered) and (y) the Indemnity Payment
previously received. If an Indemnified Party receives an Indemnity Payment
from an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Liability and subsequently incurs
Tax Costs associated by that Indemnity Payment, then the Indemnifying Party
will pay to the Indemnified Party an amount equal to those Tax Costs promptly
after receipt of a reasonably detailed statement of those Tax Costs given by
the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party within a reasonable period of
time (not to exceed six months) after the Tax Cost is actually incurred. In
the case of Tax Benefits, "actually recovered" means an Indemnified Party
actually realizes a Refund or a decrease in Taxes reported on a filed Tax
Return (in or with respect to a taxable year that ends on or before December
31, 2021) in connection with the incurrence or the payment by the Indemnified
Party of such fees or costs or indemnifiable amounts determined using a "with
and without" methodology (treating any deductions attributable to such fees or
costs or indemnifiable amounts as the last items claimed for any taxable year,
including after the utilization of any available net operating loss
carryovers). In the case of Tax Costs, "actually incurred" means an
Indemnified Party actually realizes a Tax Cost reported on a filed Tax Return
(in or with respect to a taxable year that ends on or before December 31,
2021) in connection with the receipt of (or entitlement to) an Indemnity
Payment determined using a "with and without" methodology (treating any
receipt of (or entitlement to) such Indemnity Payment as the last items
claimed for any taxable year, including after the utilization of any available
net operating loss carryovers). For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of
determining the amount "actually recovered" (for purposes of Tax Benefits) or
"actually incurred" (for purposes of Tax Costs), a netting approach shall be
taken for determining any increase or decrease, as the case may be, of taxable
income or loss, net operating losses, deductions or other Tax attributes.

Section 5.7 Procedures for Indemnification of Third Party Claims.

(a) If an Indemnified Party receives written notice that a Person (including
any Governmental Entity) that is not a member of the Company Group or the
SpinCo Group, or any Affiliate thereof, has asserted any claim or commenced
any Action (any such claim or Action, a "Third Party Claim") that may give
rise to an Indemnifying Party's obligation to indemnify pursuant to Section
5.2 or Section 5.3, as the case may be, then the Indemnified Party shall
provide the Indemnifying Party written notice thereof as promptly as
practicable (and no later than fifteen (15) Business Days, or sooner, if the
nature of the Third Party Claim so requires) after becoming aware of the Third
Party Claim. Such notice shall describe the Third Party Claim in reasonable
detail and include copies of all notices and documents (including court
papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party Claim.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure of an Indemnified Party to provide
notice in accordance with this Section 5.7(a) shall not relieve an
Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations under this Agreement,
except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by the
Indemnified Party's failure to provide notice in accordance with this Section
5.7(a).



15 



(b) Subject to this Section 5.7(b) and Section 5.7(c), an Indemnifying Party
may elect to control the defense of (and seek to settle or compromise), at its
own expense and with its own counsel, any Third Party Claim if the
Indemnifying Party irrevocably and unconditionally acknowledges its obligation
to indemnify the Indemnified Party in respect of such Third Party Claim in
accordance with and subject to the terms hereof. Within thirty (30) Business
Days after the receipt of notice from an Indemnified Party in accordance with
Section 5.7(a), the Indemnifying Party shall notify the Indemnified Party
whether the Indemnifying Party will assume responsibility for defending the
Third Party Claim. After receiving notice of an Indemnifying Party's election
to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, an Indemnified Party shall have
the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in (but not control)
the defense, compromise, or settlement thereof, but the Indemnified Party
shall be responsible for the fees and expenses of its counsel and, in any
event, shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such defense in
accordance with Section 5.7(f). If an Indemnifying Party has elected to assume
the defense of a Third Party Claim, then such Indemnifying Party shall be
solely liable for all fees and expenses incurred by it in connection with the
defense of such Third Party Claim and shall not be entitled to seek any
indemnification or reimbursement from the Indemnified Party for any such fees
or expenses incurred during the course of its defense of such Third Party
Claim.

(c) Notwithstanding Section 5.7(b), if, in the reasonable opinion of counsel
to the Indemnified Party, such Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party
have actual or potential differing defenses or conflicts of interest between
them that make joint representation inappropriate, then the Indemnified Party
shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in (but not
control) the defense, compromise, or settlement thereof, and the Indemnifying
Party shall bear the reasonable fees and expenses of one (and only one) such
counsel for all Indemnified Parties.

(d) If an Indemnifying Party elects not to assume responsibility for defending
a Third Party Claim, or fails to notify an Indemnified Party of its election
within thirty (30) Business Days after the receipt of notice from an
Indemnified Party as provided in Section 5.7(b), then the Indemnified Party
may defend the Third Party Claim at the cost and expense of the Indemnifying
Party; provided, that the Indemnified Party shall not be permitted to settle
or compromise any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. If the Indemnified Party is conducting the defense
against any such Third Party Claim, then the Indemnified Party and its counsel
shall keep the Indemnifying Party informed of all developments relating to
such Third Party Claim and provide copies of all relevant correspondence and
documents relating thereto.

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, without the prior
written consent of any Indemnified Party, no Indemnifying Party shall consent
to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement or compromise of any
pending or threatened Third Party Claim for which the Indemnified Party is
seeking or may seek indemnity pursuant to this Section 5.7 unless such
judgment or settlement is solely for monetary damages (which shall be fully
paid by the Indemnifying Party), does not impose any expense or obligation on
the Indemnified Party (other than obligations for which the Indemnified Party
is indemnified hereunder and which are fully paid by the Indemnifying Party),
does not involve any finding or determination of wrongdoing or violation of
Law by the Indemnified Party and provides for a full, unconditional and
irrevocable release of that Indemnified Party and its Affiliates and
Representatives from all liability in connection with the Third Party Claim.

(f) Each of the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to make available to the other, upon written
request, the former, current and future directors, officers, employees, other
personnel and agents of the members of its respective Group as witnesses and
any books, records or other documents within its control or which it otherwise
has the reasonable ability to make available, to the extent that any such
persons (giving consideration to business demands of such directors, officers,



16 

employees, other personnel and agents) or books, records or other documents
may reasonably be required in connection with the defense, settlement or
compromise, or the prosecution, evaluation or pursuit of any Third Party
Claim, and shall otherwise reasonably cooperate in such defense, settlement or
compromise, or such prosecution, evaluation or pursuit, as the case may be of
such Third Party Claim; provided, that no such cooperation shall unreasonably
interfere with the ongoing operations of such Party and its Subsidiaries;
provided, further, that no Party shall be required to make available to the
requesting Party any such Persons or materials if doing so would reasonably be
expected to be materially commercially detrimental, violate any Law or
agreement, or waive any attorney-client privilege held by such Party;
provided, further, that, as applicable, the Party asserting such detriment,
violation or privilege shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
provide notice to the receiving party that any Information is being withheld
pursuant to the foregoing proviso and the Parties shall use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to find a mutually agreeable solution to any
such commercial, legal and/or privilege concerns, including, if applicable, by
providing any privileged Information pursuant to a joint defense agreement to
be mutually agreed and executed between the applicable Parties. The
Indemnifying Party shall bear all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses
in connection therewith.

Section 5.8 Additional Matters.

(a) Indemnification or contribution payments in respect of any Liabilities for
which an Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification or contribution
under this Article V shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party to the
Indemnified Party as such Liabilities are incurred upon demand by the
Indemnified Party, including reasonably satisfactory documentation setting
forth the basis for the amount of such indemnification or contribution
payment, including documentation with respect to calculations made and
consideration of any Insurance Proceeds and/or recoveries from third parties
that actually reduce the amount of such Liabilities and/or Tax Benefits
actually recovered or Tax Costs actually incurred; provided, that no
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to condition, delay or withhold any
payment pending claim for, or receipt of, any Insurance Proceeds and/or
recoveries from third parties or actual recovery of any Tax Benefits or actual
incurrence of Tax Costs. The indemnity and contribution agreements contained
in this Article V shall remain operative and in full force and effect,
regardless of (i) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Indemnified
Party and (ii) the knowledge by the Indemnified Party of Liabilities for which
it might be entitled to indemnification or contribution hereunder.

(b) Any claim for indemnification under this Agreement which does not result
from a Third Party Claim shall be asserted by written notice given by the
Indemnified Party to the applicable Indemnifying Party. Such Indemnifying
Party shall have a period of thirty (30) days after the receipt of such notice
within which to respond thereto. If such Indemnifying Party does not respond
within such thirty (30)-day period, such Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to
have refused to accept responsibility to make payment. If such Indemnifying
Party does not respond within such thirty (30)-day period or rejects such
claim in whole or in part, such Indemnified Party, shall be free to pursue
such remedies as may be available to such party as contemplated by this
Agreement without prejudice to its continuing rights to pursue indemnification
or contribution hereunder.

(c) If payment is made by or on behalf of any Indemnifying Party to any
Indemnified Party in connection with any Third Party Claim, such Indemnifying
Party shall be subrogated to and shall stand in the place of such Indemnified
Party as to any events or circumstances in respect of which such Indemnified
Party may have any right, defense or claim relating to such Third Party Claim
against any claimant or plaintiff asserting such Third Party Claim or against
any other Person. Such Indemnified Party shall cooperate with such
Indemnifying Party in a reasonable manner, and at the cost and expense of such
Indemnifying Party, in prosecuting any subrogated right, defense or claim.





17 

Section 5.9 Exclusive Remedy; Limitations of Liability; Mitigation. After the
Contribution Effective Time, except for the rights under Section 7.13, the
indemnification and contribution provisions of this Article V shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy for the matters set forth herein and in any
Assignment and Assumption Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby and no party shall pursue or seek to pursue any other remedy.
Neither SpinCo or its Affiliates, on the one hand, nor the Company or its
Affiliates, on the other hand, shall be liable to the other for any
Liabilities arising under or relating to this Agreement, any Assignment and
Assumption Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby that
are (i) not direct, actual damages or (ii) special, indirect, consequential,
punitive, exemplary, remote, speculative or similar damages or lost profits
(except to the extent such lost profits constitute direct, actual damages) of
the other arising in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
(other than such damages described in this clause (ii) payable to a third
party in respect of a Third Party Claim). Any Indemnified Party that becomes
aware of a Liability for which it seeks indemnification or contribution under
this Article V shall to the extent required by law mitigate such Liability,
and the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any such Liability to the
extent that it is attributable to the failure of the Indemnified Party to use
such commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate to the extent required by
law. For the avoidance of doubt, no provision of this Agreement provides
indemnification for a breach, misrepresentation or violation under the Merger
Agreement.

Section 5.10 Survival of Indemnities. The rights and obligations of each of
the Company and SpinCo and their respective Indemnified Parties under this
Article V shall survive the sale or other transfer by any Party of any Assets
or businesses or the assignment by it of any Liabilities. Each Party hereby
agrees that prior to the consummation of any sale or transfer of all or
substantially all of the Assets of such Party, it will require the acquirer of
such Assets to assume the obligations of such Party under this Agreement as a
condition thereto.

Section 5.11 No Assumption of Discharged Liabilities; Obligations under
Transaction Agreements. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein shall
require or be construed to effectuate the assumption, for any period of time,
of any Liability or Tax discharged, released or otherwise satisfied (or to be
discharged, released or otherwise satisfied on the EFH Effective Date)
pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization. Additionally, for the avoidance of
doubt, nothing herein shall require or be construed to effectuate the
assumption, for any period of time or at all, of any obligations of any
Person, or otherwise affect in any way the rights or obligations of any of the
Parties or their respective Groups, under the Plan of Reorganization, the Tax
Matters Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement, the Split Participant
Agreement, the Merger Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement.

Article VI

[Reserved]



Article VII

Miscellaneous and General; Covenants



Section 7.1 Survival. The representations and warranties of the Parties set
forth in this Agreement (other than Section 4.4) shall not survive the
Distribution Effective Time, and shall cease to have any force or effect
immediately upon the Distribution Effective Time. The covenants and other
agreements contained in this Agreement, and liability for the breach of any
obligations thereunder, shall survive the Distribution Effective Time and
shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.

Section 7.2 Termination, Wind-Down and Distribution of EFH Non-Qualified
Benefit Plans and EFH Split Dollar Life Insurance Plan. In connection with the
termination, wind-down and distribution of the remaining liabilities and
obligations of the EFH Non-Qualified Benefit Plans and the EFH Split Dollar
Life Insurance Plan as contemplated by the Plan of Reorganization, the Parties
acknowledge and agree that (a) the Company shall (or cause the applicable
third party service provider to) provide SpinCo with, and accept all
reasonable comments of SpinCo to (i) drafts of all notices and other written
correspondence with participants in such EFH Non-Qualified Benefit Plans and
the EFH Split Dollar Life Insurance Plan as soon as reasonably practicable,
but, in each case, no later than five



18 

(5) Business Days prior to the date of such distribution to such participants
and (ii) any estimated calculations of payouts and distributions to such
participants promptly upon receipt of such calculations from the third party
administrator of such EFH Non-Qualified Benefit Plans or the EFH Split Dollar
Life Insurance Plan, as applicable, but in each case, no later than fifteen
(15) Business Days prior to the making of any such payments or distributions
with respect thereto and (b) SpinCo shall review, comment upon and approve as
soon after receipt as is administratively practicable (i) all such notices and
other written correspondence with participants in such EFH Non-Qualified
Benefit Plans and the EFH Split Dollar Life Insurance Plan and (ii) any such
estimated calculations of payouts and distributions to such participants, in
each case from such third parties as are assisting with such terminations,
wind-downs and distributions.

Section 7.3 Regulatory Matters. In connection with obtaining any required
approval by the Public Utility Commission of Texas (the "PUCT") with respect
to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or any other
transaction constituting a direct or indirect change of control of Oncor
Electric Delivery Company LLC that requires the approval of the PUCT (in each
case, the "PUCT Filing"), the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause, including by exercising its rights to consent and vote (if any) under
the Oncor Agreements as an indirect equity owner of Oncor, Oncor Electric
Delivery Company LLC to request from the PUCT, as part of the PUCT Filing, an
order stating that none of TCEH, SpinCo, or any subsidiaries or Affiliates of
SpinCo will, from and after the TCEH Effective Date, be subject to any
obligation set forth in the Final Order on Rehearing issued in PUCT Docket No.
34077 on April 24, 2008. The Company's obligations under this Section 7.3
including using its reasonable best efforts, shall not include any obligation
to (A) pay any amounts to the Oncor Entities (as defined in the Merger
Agreement) or any other Person or incur any liabilities or other obligation,
(B) execute or enter into or perform any new agreement (other than an
agreement contemplated hereby or in the Plan of Reorganization or that
confirms or makes effective its obligations hereunder), or (C) breach any Law
or commence any Action against any Person, including any of the Oncor Entities
or their respective officers and managers.

Section 7.4 DandO Insurance.

(a) During the period beginning on the date hereof and ending on the EFH
Effective Date, the Company agrees to and to cause its Subsidiaries to
maintain, as in effect immediately prior to the TCEH Effective Date (i) the
Company's and its Subsidiaries' directors', managers' and officers' insurance
policies, and (ii) the Company's fiduciary liability insurance policies ((i)
and (ii), collectively, the "EFH DandO Policies"), in each case, with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less advantageous
than the coverage provided under the Company's and its Subsidiaries' policies
as of immediately prior to the TCEH Effective Date with respect to any actual
or alleged error, misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission, neglect,
breach of duty or any matter claimed against a current or former director,
officer or other Representative of TCEH, the TCEH Companies, the Company Group
or the SpinCo Group or any of their respective Subsidiaries (collectively, the
"Pre-Spin Group") by reason of him or her serving in such capacity ("Wrongful
Acts") that existed or occurred on or prior to the TCEH Effective Date
(including in connection with this Agreement and the transactions or actions
contemplated by this Agreement).

(b) The Company agrees that, on or before the EFH Effective Date or any other
event constituting a change in control as described in Section IX(C)(2) of the
EFH DandO Policies (a "Company Change in Control"), it will obtain and fully pay
the premium for a run-off of the EFH DandO Policies for the benefit of each
member of the Pre-Spin Group and their respective current and former
directors, officers and other Representatives, in each case for a claims
reporting or discovery period of at least six (6) years from and after the EFH
Effective Date (or the effective date of such other Company Change in Control,
as applicable) with respect to any claim arising from actual or alleged
Wrongful Acts on or prior to the EFH Effective Date (it being understood that,
with respect to any claim arising from actual or alleged Wrongful Acts of such
Persons in their capacity as a current or former director or officer or other
Representative of any TCEH Company or the SpinCo Group, such period shall be
limited to the period on or prior to the TCEH Effective Date), from



19 

insurance carriers with the same or better credit rating as the insurance
carrier(s) for the EFH DandO Policies with terms, conditions, retentions and
limits of liability that are no less advantageous than the coverage provided
for members of the Pre-Spin Group and their respective current and former
directors, officers and other Representatives under the EFH DandO Policies with
respect to any actual or alleged Wrongful Act that existed or occurred on or
prior to the EFH Effective Date (the "Run-Off Coverage").

(c) If the Company, after its good faith efforts, is unable to obtain such
Run-Off Coverage as of the EFH Effective Date, then the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to purchase insurance comparable to the EFH DandO
Policies for such six-year period with terms, conditions, retentions and
limits of liability that are at least as favorable as provided in the EFH DandO
Policies; provided, however, that in no event shall the Company be required to
expend for such policies pursuant to this sentence an annual premium amount in
excess of 200% of the annual premiums paid by the Company for such insurance
as of immediately prior to the TCEH Effective Date; and provided, further,
that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the
Company shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost
not exceeding such amount.

(d) If the Effective Time under the Merger Agreement occurs and the Company
complies with its obligation under Section 6.8(b) of the Merger Agreement (as
such obligations are set forth in the Merger Agreement as of the date hereof
and without giving effect to any subsequent amendment thereof) and obtains the
"DandO Insurance" (as defined in the Merger Agreement), then the Company shall
be deemed to have satisfied its obligations under Section 7.4(b) and (c)
hereof; provided, however that this Section 7.4(d) shall have no effect and be

or contemporaneous oral or written agreements, understandings, representations
and warranties both written and oral, among the Parties, with respect to the
subject matter hereof. EACH PARTY HERETO AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, NONE OF THE SpinCo

hereby waived. Any requirements for the securing or posting of any bond with
such remedy are also hereby waived by each of the Parties.

Section 7.14 Severability. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed

provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any

unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or

authorship of any provision of this Agreement.

Section 7.16 Assignment; Delegation. This Agreement shall not be assigned or
delegated by a Party (in each case, whether (x) by merger, consolidation or
dissolution of a Party, (y) by contract, operation of law or (z) otherwise)

Exhibit A

Assignment and Assumption Agreements

(TCEH Assets)

ASSIGNMENT AND ASSUMPTION Agreement

This Assignment and Assumption Agreement (this "Agreement") is effective as of
[•], 2016, by and among Energy Future Holdings Corp., a Texas corporation (the
"Company"), Texas Competitive Electric Holdings Company LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company ("TCEH"), and TEX Energy LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company ("SpinCo").

WHEREAS, TCEH is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and SpinCo
is a direct wholly owned subsidiary of TCEH;

WHEREAS, the Company owns (i) the Acquired TCEH Assets (as defined in the
Separation Agreement referred to below) (the "EFH Contributed Assets") and
(ii) directly or indirectly, all of the outstanding equity interests of the
entities listed on Schedule B hereto (the "EFH Contributed Subsidiaries");

WHEREAS, TCEH owns (i) the assets identified on Schedule A hereto (the "TCEH
Contributed Assets," and together with the EFH Contributed Assets, the
"Contributed Assets") and (ii) directly or indirectly, all of the outstanding
equity interests of the entities listed on Schedule B hereto (the "TCEH
Contributed Subsidiaries"); and

WHEREAS, as contemplated by that certain Separation Agreement, dated as of the
date hereof, by and between the Company, SpinCo, and TEX Operations Company
LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and indirect wholly owned subsidiary
of TCEH (as amended, the "Separation Agreement"), the Company desires to
contribute, convey, transfer and assign the EFH Contributed Assets and the EFH
Contributed Subsidiaries, and TCEH desires to contribute, convey, transfer and
assign the TCEH Contributed Assets and the TCEH Contributed Subsidiaries, to
SpinCo.

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants set forth herein, and
for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

1. Capitalized Terms. Capitalized terms used herein and not defined herein have the meanings assigned to them in the Separation Agreement.

2. EFH Contribution. The Company hereby contributes, conveys, transfers and assigns the EFH Contributed Assets and the EFH Contributed Subsidiaries to SpinCo, and SpinCo hereby accepts such contribution, conveyance, transfer and assignment (the "EFH Contribution"). SpinCo hereby assumes and agrees to pay, discharge, perform or otherwise satisfy as and when due all liabilities and obligations of any kind and nature, in each case, arising out of facts, circumstances, events or conditions in existence before, on or after the date hereof of, under, related to, resulting from, or arising out of or in connection with, as applicable, the EFH Contributed Subsidiaries, the EFH Contributed Assets and all Assumed Liabilities (as defined in the Separation Agreement) (the "EFH Assumed Liabilities").











3. TCEH Contribution. TCEH hereby contributes, conveys, transfers and assigns the TCEH Contributed Assets and TCEH Contributed Subsidiaries to SpinCo, and SpinCo hereby accepts such contribution, conveyance, transfer and assignment (the "TCEH Contribution," and together with the EFH Contribution, the "Contributions"). SpinCo hereby assumes and agrees to pay, discharge, perform or otherwise satisfy all liabilities and obligations of any kind and nature arising out of or otherwise relating to the TCEH Contributed Assets and any other liabilities identified on Schedule C hereto (the "TCEH Assumed Liabilities," and together with the EFH Assumed Liabilities, the "Assumed Liabilities").

4. Further Assurances. In furtherance of the transactions described herein, the parties hereto shall, and shall cause their applicable subsidiaries to, execute such additional bills of sale, quitclaim deeds, stock or equity powers, certificates of title, assignments of contracts and other instruments of transfer, conveyance and assignment and other documents reasonably necessary to evidence the transfer, conveyance and assignment of the Contributed Assets to SpinCo and the valid and effective assumption of the Assumed Liabilities by SpinCo, including any which are not transferred on the date hereof as a result of Section 2.2(b) of the Separation Agreement or for any other reason.

5. Tax Treatment. For federal income tax purposes, at the time of the Contributions, each of TCEH and SpinCo is an entity that is disregarded as separate from the Company, and accordingly, the Contributions will have no federal income tax effect. For Texas sales and use tax purposes, the Contributions will be treated as (i) a transfer of intangible assets not subject to Texas sales and use tax, and/or (ii) a transfer of assets constituting a separate division, branch, or identifiable segment of a business that is exempt from Texas sales and use tax as an occasional sale.

6. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts (including by electronic means), each such counterpart being deemed to be an original instrument, and all such counterparts taken together constituting one and the same agreement.

7. Captions. The captions of the paragraphs herein are inserted for convenience of reference only and shall not be used in construing the terms and provisions hereof.

8. Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall inure to the benefit of, the parties hereto and their respective heirs, legal representatives, successors and permitted assigns.

9. Governing Law and Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial. 

(a) THIS AGREEMENT, TOGETHER WITH ANY CLAIM, DISPUTE, REMEDY OR ACTION ARISING
FROM OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR
ANY RELIEF OR REMEDIES SOUGHT BY ANY PARTY, AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF
THE PARTIES HEREUNDER, SHALL BE CONSTRUED, PERFORMED AND ENFORCED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO
ITS PRINCIPLES OR RULES OF CONFLICT OF LAWS TO THE EXTENT SUCH PRINCIPLES OR
RULES WOULD REQUIRE OR PERMIT THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANOTHER
JURISDICTION. Each of the parties hereto (i) submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court; provided that if the Bankruptcy Court
declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular Action, then the Chancery
Court of the State of Delaware, and if the Chancery Court of the State of
Delaware declines jurisdiction, then any state or federal court sitting in
Delaware, in any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement, (ii)
agrees that all claims in respect of such Action may be heard and determined
in any such court and (iii) agrees not to bring any Action arising out of or
relating to this Agreement (whether on the basis of a claim sounding in
contract, equity, tort or otherwise) in any other









court. Each of the parties agrees that a final judgment (subject to any
appeals therefrom) in any such Action shall be conclusive and may be enforced
in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided
by Law. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to
the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which
it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any Action arising out
of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in
any Delaware or federal court in accordance with the provisions of this
Section. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of
such Action in any such court. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally consents to service of process in the manner provided for
notices in the Separation Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the
right of any party to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT
(W) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (X) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS
AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (Y) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS
WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (Z) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS SECTION.

10. Limitations of Liability. The Liabilities of any party hereto arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be limited pursuant to and as provided in the Separation Agreement.

11. No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except for the indemnification rights under the Separation Agreement of any Indemnified Party in their respective capacities as such, the provisions of this Agreement and the Separation Agreement are solely for the benefit of the parties hereto and thereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns and are not intended to confer upon any Person, except the parties hereto and thereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, any rights or remedies hereunder and there are no third party beneficiaries of this Agreement or the Separation Agreement; and neither this Agreement nor the Separation Agreement shall provide any third party with any remedy, claim, liability, reimbursement, cause of action or other right in excess of those existing without reference to this Agreement or the Separation Agreement.

12. Assignment. Neither party shall assign its rights or obligations under this Agreement (by operation of law or otherwise) unless, such party concurrently assigns its rights and obligations under the Separation Agreement to the same assignee of its rights and obligations hereunder.

By virtue of such assignment and assumption, OpCo hereby possesses all rights and obligations of the applicable Agreement Parties under each of the Agreements. Effective as of the TCEH Effective Date, OpCo hereby assumes full responsibility for the performance of all obligations of the Agreement Party under each of the applicable Agreements. EFH, the Agreement Party and OpCo shall reasonably cooperate with each other to cause each of the Contributed Plans and Agreements to be amended, as necessary, to reflect the assignment, transfer and assumption evidenced hereby. To the extent that the transfer, acceptance and assignment of any of the Agreements require the consent of an individual employee, affiliate or third party, as applicable, the parties shall reasonably cooperate to obtain such consent.

3. Plan Administrator. From and after the TCEH Effective Date, the named fiduciary and plan administrator, as applicable, of each of the Contributed Plans shall be the applicable administrative committee, or other designee, of OpCo, which shall replace the applicable named fiduciary and plan administrator of EFH in such capacity, and shall have all responsibility and authority necessary or appropriate to administer the Contributed Plans in accordance with their terms. All policies and decisions adopted by the applicable EFH plan administrator prior to the TCEH Effective Date shall, unless and until changed by the applicable OpCo plan administrator, continue in effect. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, all funding and investment policies, loan, withdrawal and distribution procedures, procedures for processing domestic relations orders and qualified medical child support orders,









procedures for processing claims, and any other policies or procedures
relating to the administration of any of the Contributed Plans, previously
adopted by the applicable EFH plan administrator, shall remain in full force
and effect unless and until changed by the applicable OpCo plan administrator.

4. Fidelity Bond; Liability Insurance. EFH and OpCo shall timely notify the issuer of any fidelity bond or liability insurance policy relating to any Contributed Plan or Agreement of the transfer, assignment and assumption provided for herein, and the parties shall fully cooperate and take all action necessary to effectuate the transfer, assignment and assumption with respect to such fidelity bonds and insurance policies so as to ensure coverage of OpCo, the applicable OpCo plan administrators and all entities and individuals involved in the administration of the Contributed Plans and Agreements from and after the TCEH Effective Date. 

5. Effect on Employment. It is the intent of the parties, that the transfer of employment of employees from EFH, and certain of its affiliates (other than Oncor Electric Delivery Holdings Company, LLC and its subsidiaries), to OpCo shall be treated as a transfer of employment and not as a termination of employment for purposes of any of the Contributed Plans. In this connection, each employee shall be treated as if his/her employment has not been terminated as a result of the transfer from EFH, or an affiliate of EFH, to OpCo, and his/her service, for all purposes under each Contributed Plan and Agreement, shall be treated as continuous without any break in service related to such transfer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, consistent with the Plan of Reorganization, the Closing of the transactions contemplated in the Plan of Reorganization shall be deemed to constitute a change in control of EFH for purposes of the applicable Contributed Plans.

6. Employee Communications. OpCo shall be responsible for preparing and distributing summaries of material modifications and other communication materials to notify employees of the assignment, transfer and assumption evidenced hereby. EFH shall cooperate with OpCo in the preparation of such materials as may be reasonably requested by OpCo.

7. Reports to Governmental Agencies; Audits. From and after the TCEH Effective Date, OpCo shall be responsible for preparing, filing and/or distributing all required governmental reports relating to the Contributed Plans including without limitation, Annual Returns/Reports (Form 5500 Series), Summary Annual Reports, Annual Funding Notices, and all filings required under the Affordable Care Act. EFH shall, or shall cause its affiliates to, cooperate with OpCo, and provide OpCo with all information available to EFH or its affiliates, as OpCo may reasonably request, in connection with the preparation of such reports. Additionally, in the event of a governmental audit, investigation or inquiry relating to any of the Contributed Plans, EFH and OpCo shall fully cooperate with each other, and EFH shall, or shall cause its affiliates to, provide OpCo with all information or documentation in EFH's, or its affiliates' possession or control as may be reasonably requested by OpCo in connection with any such audit, investigation or inquiry. 

8. Transfer of Records. To the maximum extent allowed under applicable law, EFH shall, or shall cause its affiliates to, transfer to OpCo all records pertaining to the Contributed Plans and Agreements in EFH's, or its affiliates, possession or control as soon as reasonably practical following the Effective Date.

9. No Plan Amendment. Except as expressly provided for herein, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed or deemed to constitute an amendment to any Contributed Plan, and nothing in this Agreement shall limit, in any way, the right and authority of OpCo to amend each of the Contributed Plans, in whole or in part, from time to time.

10. No Third Party Beneficiary. Nothing in this Agreement shall create any rights in any person or entity other than the parties hereto, including without limitation any participant, beneficiary, dependent or other covered person under any Contributed Plan. 







11. Further Acts. The parties agree to take any and all further action and to execute any and all further documents as either of them may reasonably determine to be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the transfer, assignment and assumption of the Contributed Plans and the Agreements, and all other matters contemplated in this Agreement. 

12. Applicable Law. TO THE EXTENT NOT OTHERWISE GOVERNED BY FEDERAL LAWS SUCH AS ERISA AND THE CODE (AS SUCH TERMS ARE DEFINED IN THE MERGER AGREEMENT) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SUBSTANTIVE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS.

13. Binding Effect; Assignment. All of the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Neither party shall assign its rights or obligations under this Agreement (by operation of law or otherwise) unless, such party concurrently assigns its rights and obligations under the Separation Agreement to the same assignee of its rights and obligations hereunder.

14. Invalidity of Provisions. In the event that one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law, the validity, legality or enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof shall not be affected or impaired thereby.

15. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with that certain Separation Agreement, by and among EFH, OpCo and TEX Energy LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, dated as of the date hereof (the "Separation Agreement"), constitutes the whole and entire agreement between the parties hereto and supersedes any prior agreement, undertaking, declaration, commitment or representation, verbal or oral, with respect to the subject matter hereof.

16. Limitations of Liability. The liabilities of the parties hereto arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be limited pursuant to and as provided in the Separation Agreement.

17. Defined Terms. Capitalized terms not defined herein shall be given the meaning ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement, Plan of Reorganization or Separation Agreement. In the event of a conflict between any such definitions, the definition in the Merger Agreement shall be controlling.

18. Captions. The captions of the sections and paragraphs of this Agreement are for convenience and reference only and in no way define, limit or describe the scope or intent of this Agreement.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have caused this Agreement to be duly executed
as of the Effective Date.
