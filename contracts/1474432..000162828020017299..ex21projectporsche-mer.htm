incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, except that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be Portworx
Inc.;



(b)the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated as of
the Effective Time in a form acceptable to Parent; and



(c)the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately after
the Effective Time shall be those individuals designated by Parent in its sole
discretion.



1.5Conversion of Shares.



(a)Conversion. Subject to Sections 1.5(d), 1.7 and 1.8, at the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company, any stockholder of the Company or any other Person:



(i)each share of Company Capital Stock held in the Company's treasury or owned
by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time ("Disregarded Shares"), if any, shall be extinguished and
cancelled without payment of any consideration in respect thereof;



(ii)each share of Company Capital Stock (including each share of Company
Restricted Stock) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time held by each Non-Dissenting Stockholder (other than Disregarded Shares)
shall be converted automatically into the right to receive (following the
delivery of a Letter of Transmittal and the surrender of any certificates, if
any, or electronic transfer of Company Book Entry Shares, representing such
shares of Company Capital Stock in accordance with Section 1.8):



(A)an amount in cash equal to: (1) the Per Share Amount; minus (2) the Escrow
Contribution Amount for such share of Company Capital Stock held by such Non-
Dissenting Stockholder; minus (3) the Securityholders' Agent Expense Fund
Contribution Amount for such share of Company Capital Stock held by such Non-
Dissenting Stockholder; provided, that, for the avoidance of doubt, shares of
Company Restricted Stock shall not have any Escrow Contribution Amount or
Securityholders' Agent Expense Fund Contribution Amount; and



(B)any cash disbursements required to be made from the Escrow Fund and the
Securityholders' Agent Expense Fund with respect to such shares to the former
holder thereof in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement, if, as and when such disbursements are required to be made;



provided, however, 25% of the Merger Consideration otherwise payable to each
Founder pursuant to Section 1.5(a)(ii) in respect of Company Common Stock
excluding Company Restricted Stock (the "Holdback Amount") 

CONFIDENTIAL

will not be paid to such Founder. Each Founder's Holdback Amount shall count
towards such Founder's Aggregate Escrow Contribution Amount and shall be
deposited by Parent into the Escrow Fund pursuant to Section 1.5(c) (the
"Escrowed Holdback Amount"). The portion of such Founder's Holdback Amount
exceeding such Founder's Aggregate Escrow Contribution Amount, if any, shall
be held by Parent (the "Non-Escrowed Holdback Amount"). The Escrowed Holdback
Amount and the Non-Escrowed Holdback Amount will be distributed to each
Founder and/or Parent, as applicable, in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the respective Holdback Agreement; and



provided, further, that as to each share of Company Restricted Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, the right to receive
an amount in cash pursuant to Section 1.5(a)(ii) shall be subject to the same
restrictions and vesting arrangements that were applicable to such shares of
Company Restricted Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
paid within thirty (30) days following the applicable vesting date, and shall
be subject to Schedule 1.5.



(iii)each share of the common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted automatically into
one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the
Effective Time, all certificates representing the common stock of Merger Sub,
if any, and Company Book Entry Shares, shall be deemed for all purposes to
represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation
into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding
sentence.



The amount of cash, if any, that each holder is entitled to receive at any
particular time for each share of Outstanding Capital Stock held by such
holder or Outstanding In-the-Money Vested Options (as defined in Section
1.6(a)) or Outstanding Warrants (as defined in Section 1.6(d)) held by such
holder (as the case may be) shall be rounded to the nearest cent and the
aggregate amount of cash, if any, that each such holder is entitled to receive
at any particular time shall be computed after aggregating the cash amounts
payable at such time for all shares of each class and series of Outstanding
Capital Stock, all Outstanding In-the-Money Vested Options and all Outstanding
Warrants held by such holder.



(b) Definitions. For purposes of this Agreement:



(i)The "Aggregate Exercise Price" shall be the aggregate dollar amount payable
to the Company as purchase price for the exercise of all Outstanding In-the-
Money Vested Options and the Outstanding Warrants.



(ii)The "Aggregate Escrow Contribution Amount" for each Effective Time Holder
shall be determined by adding: (A) the aggregate Escrow Contribution Amounts
for the shares of Outstanding Capital Stock held by such Effective Time Holder
immediately prior to the Effective Time, (B) the aggregate 

CONFIDENTIAL

Escrow Contribution Amounts for the Outstanding In-the-Money Vested Options
held by such Effective Time Holder as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time and (C) the aggregate Escrow Contribution Amounts for the shares
purchasable under or otherwise subject to Outstanding Warrants held by such
Effective Time Holder as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.



(iii)The "Aggregate Pro Rata Share" for each Effective Time Holder shall be
determined by adding: (A) the aggregate Pro Rata Shares for the shares of
Outstanding Capital Stock held by such Effective Time Holder immediately prior
to the Effective Time (excluding such shares of Company Restricted Stock), (B)
the aggregate Pro Rata Shares for the Outstanding In-the-Money Vested Options
held by such Effective Time Holder as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time and (C) the aggregate Pro Rata Shares for the shares purchasable under or
otherwise subject to Outstanding Warrants held by such Effective Time Holder
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.



(iv)The "Escrow Amount" means $37,000,000.



(v)The "Escrow Contribution Amount" for each share of Outstanding Capital
Stock (excluding such shares of Company Restricted Stock), all Outstanding In-
the-Money Vested Options held by an Effective Time Holder, and each share of
Company Capital Stock purchasable under or otherwise subject to Outstanding
Warrants, in each case as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, equals
the product of: (A) the Escrow Amount; multiplied by (B) the Pro Rata Share
for each share of Outstanding Capital Stock or each share of Company Capital
Stock purchasable under or otherwise subject to Outstanding Warrants, as
applicable, or, for the Outstanding In-the-Money Vested Options held by each
Effective Time Holder as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, the
aggregate Pro Rata Share for such Outstanding In-the Money Vested Options.



(vi)The "Exchange Ratio" means the fraction having a numerator equal to the
Per Share Amount, and having a denominator equal to the average closing sale
price of one share of Parent Common Stock rounded to the nearest penny as
reported on the New York Stock Exchange for the period of 10 consecutive
trading days ending on (and including) the third trading day immediately
preceding the Closing Date (as adjusted as appropriate to reflect any stock
splits, stock dividends, combinations, reorganizations, reclassifications or
similar events).



(vii)The "Per Share Amount" shall be determined by dividing: (A) the sum of
the Purchase Price plus the Aggregate Exercise Price; by (B) the sum of
(without duplication): (1) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common
Stock (excluding any such shares that are shares of Company Restricted Stock);
plus (2) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock that are
issuable upon the conversion in full of all shares of Company Preferred Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time; plus (3) the aggregate
number of shares of Company Common Stock purchasable under or otherwise 

CONFIDENTIAL

subject to Outstanding In-the-Money Vested Options; plus (4) the aggregate
number of shares of Company Common Stock that are issuable upon the conversion
in full of all shares of Company Preferred Stock purchasable under or
otherwise subject to Outstanding Warrants; provided, however, that the New
Restricted Stock Units will not be included for the purpose of such
determination.



(viii)The "Pro Rata Share" for each share of Outstanding Capital Stock
(excluding such shares of Company Restricted Stock), each Outstanding In-the-
Money Vested Option, and each share of Company Capital Stock purchasable under
or otherwise subject to Outstanding Warrants, in each case as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be determined by dividing: (A) the total
Merger Consideration payable for such share or Outstanding In-the-Money Vested
Option pursuant to Sections 1.5(a)(ii), 1.6(a) and 1.6(d), as the case may be
(without regard to whether such Merger Consideration is contributed by such
Effective Time Holder to the Escrow Fund); by (B) the total Merger
Consideration payable to all Effective Time Holders pursuant to Sections
1.5(a)(ii) (except with respect to shares of Company Restricted Stock), 1.6(a)
and 1.6(d), as the case may be (without regard to whether such Merger
Consideration is contributed by the Effective Time Holders to the Escrow
Fund).



(ix)The "Purchase Price" shall be: (A) $370,000,000; minus (B) the Estimated
Closing Indebtedness Amount; minus (C) the Estimated Closing Company
Transaction Expenses; plus (D) the Estimated Closing Cash; plus (E) the
Estimated Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount (it being understood that all
amounts used in calculating the Purchase Price shall be based on the
corresponding amounts set forth and represented in the Merger Consideration
Certificate).



(x)The "Securityholders' Agent Expense Fund Contribution Amount" for each
share of Outstanding Capital Stock (excluding such shares of Company
Restricted Stock), all Outstanding In-the-Money Vested Options held by an
Effective Time Holder, and each share of Company Capital Stock purchasable
under or otherwise subject to Outstanding Warrants, in each case as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, equals the product of: (A) the
Securityholders' Agent Expense Fund Amount; multiplied by (B) the Pro Rata
Share for each share of Outstanding Capital Stock or each share of Company
Capital Stock purchasable under or otherwise subject to Outstanding Warrants,
as applicable, or, for the Outstanding In-the-Money Vested Options held by
each Effective Time Holder as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, the
aggregate Pro Rata Share for such Outstanding In-the Money Vested Options.



(c) Escrow Contribution. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, at the Closing, Parent shall withhold from the Purchase Price
payable pursuant hereto and deposit into an escrow account with Acquiom
Clearinghouse LLC, or any replacement escrow agent thereafter designated
pursuant to the Escrow Agreement (the "Escrow Agent"), to secure the
indemnification obligations of the Effective Time Holders under Section 10 of
this Agreement, an amount in cash equal to the Escrow 

CONFIDENTIAL

Amount (the "Escrow Fund"). The Escrow Fund shall be non-interest bearing and
shall be held by the Escrow Agent and disbursed by it solely for the purposes
of and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the provisions of
the escrow agreement to be entered into among Parent, the Securityholders'
Agent and the Escrow Agent on the Closing Date, substantially in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit F to this Agreement (the "Escrow Agreement"). The
terms and provisions of the Escrow Agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby are specific terms of the Merger, and the approval and adoption of
this Agreement and approval of the Merger by the Effective Time Holders
pursuant to written consents evidencing the Required Merger Stockholder Vote
and the Holdback Agreements, the Warrant Surrender Agreements and the Letters
of Transmittal shall constitute approval by such Effective Time Holders, as
specific terms of the Merger, and the irrevocable agreement of such Effective
Time Holders to be bound by and comply with, the Escrow Agreement and all of
the arrangements and provisions of this Agreement relating thereto, including
the deposit of the Escrow Amount into escrow and the indemnification
obligations set forth in Section 10 hereof.



(d) Adjustments. In calculating the consideration payable under this Section
1.5, Parent shall be entitled to rely on the representations and warranties
contained in Section 2.3, the Company Closing Certificate and the Merger
Consideration Certificate.



1.6Treatment of Company Options, Company Warrants and New Restricted Stock
Units.

(a)Vested Options.



(i)Subject to Sections 1.5(d) and 1.8(h), at the Effective Time, each Company
Option or portion thereof that is vested, outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior to the Effective Time (after giving effect to any vesting
that is contingent upon the completion of the Merger) (each, a "Vested
Option") shall be cancelled and the holder thereof shall be entitled to
receive pursuant to this Section 1.6(a), for such holder's Company Common
Stock subject to such Vested Options, an amount in cash equal to: (A) the Per
Share Amount minus the purchase price for the exercise of a share of Company
Common Stock subject to such Vested Option; multiplied by the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Vested Option held by such
holder; minus (B) the Escrow Contribution Amount; minus (C) the
Securityholders' Agent Expense Fund Contribution Amount; plus (D) any cash
disbursements required to be made from the Escrow Fund and the
Securityholders' Agent Expense Fund with respect to such Vested Options in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, if, as
and when such disbursements are required to be made. If the exercise price
payable in respect of a share of Company Common Stock subject to a Vested
Option equals or exceeds the Per Share Amount (an "Underwater Vested Option"),
then the amount payable hereunder with respect to such Vested Option shall be
zero. Each Vested Option, other than any Underwater Vested Option, is referred
to in this Agreement as an "Outstanding In-the-Money Vested Option". 

CONFIDENTIAL

(ii)Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all action that may be
necessary (under the Company Stock Plan or otherwise) to effectuate the
provisions of Section 1.6(a)(i) and to ensure that, from and after the
Effective Time, each holder of a Vested Option cancelled as provided in
Section 1.6(a)(i) shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the consideration specified in Section 1.6(a)(i), if any,
without interest (other than interest that may be accrued on the Escrow Fund).



(b)Unvested Options.



(i)At the Effective Time, each Company Option or portion thereof: (x) that is
unvested, outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time
(after giving effect to any vesting that is contingent upon the completion of
the Merger) (each, an "Unvested Option"); (y) held by a Continuing Employee
and (z) that has an exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject
to such Company Option that is less than the Per Share Amount (an "Outstanding
In-the-Money Unvested Option") shall be converted into and become an option to
purchase Parent Common Stock, and Parent shall assume such Outstanding In-the-
Money Unvested Option subject to the remainder of this Section 1.6(b)(i) (all
Outstanding In-the-Money Unvested Options that are assumed pursuant to this
Section 1.6(b)(i) are hereafter referred to as "Assumed Options"). All rights
to purchase shares of Company Common Stock under Assumed Options shall
thereupon be converted into rights to purchase Parent Common Stock.
Accordingly, from and after the Effective Time: (A) each Assumed Option may be
exercised solely for shares of Parent Common Stock; (B) the number of shares
of Parent Common Stock subject to each Assumed Option shall be determined by
multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were subject to
such Assumed Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange
Ratio, and rounding the resulting number down to the nearest whole number of
shares of Parent Common Stock; (C) the per share exercise price for a share of
Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each Assumed Option shall be
determined by dividing the per share exercise price of a share of Company
Common Stock subject to such Assumed Option, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, by the Exchange Ratio, and rounding the resulting exercise
price up to the nearest whole cent; (D) any restriction on the exercise of any
Assumed Option shall continue in full force and effect and the term,
exercisability and vesting schedule of such Assumed Option shall otherwise
remain unchanged as a result of the assumption or replacement of such Assumed
Option; provided, however, that no Assumed Options or portion thereof shall be
(1) exercisable prior to vesting or (2) an "incentive stock option" within the
meaning of Section 422 of the Code; and (E) the Parent's board of directors
and/or a committee thereof shall succeed to the authority and responsibility
of the Company's board of directors or any committee thereof with respect to
the administration of the Company Stock Plan. 

CONFIDENTIAL

(ii)Each Unvested Option that is held by a Non-Continuing Employee shall be
cancelled and extinguished at the Effective Time without any present or future
right to receive any portion of the Merger Consideration therefor.



(iii)Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions that may
be necessary (under the Company Stock Plan and otherwise) to: (A) effectuate
the provisions of Sections 1.6(b)(i) and 1.6(b)(ii); and (B) to ensure that,
from and after the Effective Time, holders of Unvested Options have no rights
with respect thereto other than those specifically provided in Sections
1.6(b)(i) and 1.6(b)(ii), if any.



For the avoidance of doubt, the Assumed Options shall not be adjusted as a
result of Section 1.8(h).



(c)New Restricted Stock Units.



(i)At the Effective Time, each New Restricted Stock Unit award held by a
Continuing Employee that is unexpired and outstanding as of the Effective Time
shall, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
be assumed by Parent. Each such New Restricted Stock Unit award so assumed by
Parent under this Agreement shall continue to have, and be subject to, the
same terms and conditions (including, if applicable, the vesting arrangements
and other terms and conditions set forth in the plan under which such New
Restricted Stock Unit award was issued and the applicable notice of grant of
stock unit or other applicable agreement) as are in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time, except that such New Restricted Stock Unit award shall
be settled by the issuance of that number of whole shares of Parent Common
Stock equal to the product (rounded down to the next whole number of shares of
Parent Common Stock, with no cash being payable for any fractional share
eliminated by such rounding) of the number of shares of Company Common Stock
that were issuable pursuant to such New Restricted Stock Unit award
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio. The
Merger shall not terminate any of the outstanding New Restricted Stock Units
held by Continuing Employees or accelerate the vesting or settlement of such
New Restricted Stock Units. Each New Restricted Stock Unit that is not assumed
by Parent pursuant to this Section 1.6(c) shall be cancelled for no
consideration as of the Effective Time.



(ii)Each New Restricted Stock Unit that is held by a Non-Continuing Employee
shall be cancelled and extinguished at the Effective Time without any present
or future right to receive any portion of the Merger Consideration therefor.



(iii)Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions that may
be necessary (under the New Stock Plan and otherwise) to: (A) effectuate the
provisions of Sections 1.6(c)(i) and 1.6(c)(ii); and (B) to ensure that, from
and after the Effective Time, holders of New Restricted Stock Units have no
rights with respect thereto other than those specifically provided in Section
1.6(c)(i). 

CONFIDENTIAL

(d)Warrants. Prior to the Closing, each warrant to purchase shares of Company
Capital Stock (a "Company Warrant") that is outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior to the Effective Time (each such Company Warrant being
referred to herein as an "Outstanding Warrant") shall, pursuant to a Warrant
Surrender Agreement and contingent on and effective immediately prior to the
Effective Time, be cancelled, terminated and extinguished as of the Effective
Time, and upon the cancellation thereof be converted into the right to
receive, in respect of each share of Company Capital Stock then vested and
subject to such Company Warrant immediately prior to such cancellation,
termination and extinguishment: (A) an amount in cash equal to: (1) the Per
Share Amount; minus (2) the Escrow Contribution Amount and the
Securityholders' Agent Expense Fund Contribution Amount for such share; minus
(3) the exercise price per share of Company Capital Stock subject to such
Company Warrant (it being understood that, if the exercise price payable in
respect of such share of Company Capital Stock issuable under any Company
Warrant equals or exceeds the Per Share Amount, the amount payable hereunder
with respect to such Company Warrant shall be zero); plus (B) any cash
disbursements required to be made from the Escrow Fund and the
Securityholders' Agent Expense Fund with respect to such share to the former
holder of such Company Warrant in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
and of the Escrow Agreement, if, as and when such disbursements are required
to be made. Each Warrant Surrender Agreement shall be in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit G. The Company shall take all actions that may be necessary
to ensure each holder of an Outstanding Warrant cancelled as provided in this
Section 1.6(d) shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the consideration specified in this Section 1.6(d), without
interest.



(e)Payment. Following the Effective Time, Parent: (i) shall cause to be paid,
no later than the second payroll date following the Closing Date, through the
payroll services of the applicable Acquired Entity or Parent to each holder of
an Employee Option that has delivered an Option Conversion Agreement, in the
form attached hereto as Exhibit E, to Parent, the consideration, if any,
specified in Section 1.6(a), without interest, less applicable withholding
Taxes; and (ii) shall cause to be paid promptly by the Payment Agent: (A) to
each holder of a Non-Employee Option entitled to a portion of the Merger
Consideration that has delivered an Option Conversion Agreement to Parent and
a Letter of Transmittal to the Payment Agent, the consideration, if any,
specified in Section 1.6(a), without interest; and (B) to each holder of an
Outstanding Warrant that has delivered a duly executed Warrant Surrender
Agreement to Parent and a Letter of Transmittal to the Payment Agent, the
consideration specified in Section 1.6(d), without interest.



(f)Discretionary Assumption of Company Stock Option Plan. At the Effective
Time, Parent may (but shall not be obligated to) assume the Company Stock Plan
or merge the Company Stock Plan into any equity compensation plan of Parent.
If Parent elects to so assume or merge the Company Stock Plan, then, under the
Company Stock Plan, Parent shall be entitled to grant stock awards, to the
extent permissible under applicable Legal Requirements, using the share
reserves of the Company Stock Plan as of the Effective Time (including any
shares subsequently returned to such share reserves as a result of the
termination of Assumed Options), except that: (i) shares covered by such 

CONFIDENTIAL

awards shall be shares of Parent Common Stock; (ii) all references in the
Company Stock Plan to a number of shares of Company Common Stock shall be
deemed amended to refer instead to a number of shares of Parent Common Stock
determined by multiplying the number of referenced shares of Company Common
Stock by the Exchange Ratio, and rounding the resulting number down to the
nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock; (iii) Parent's board of
directors and/or a committee thereof shall succeed to the authority and
responsibility of the Company's board of directors or any committee thereof
with respect to the administration of the Company Stock Plan; and (iv) the
Company Stock Plan shall be subject to administrative procedures consistent
with those in effect under Parent's equity compensation plan.



1.7Dissenting Shares.



(a)Effect on Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding any provisions of this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Capital Stock held by a holder
who has demanded and perfected a demand for appraisal of such holder's shares
of Company Capital Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and as of
the Closing has neither effectively withdrawn nor lost such holder's right to
such appraisal (the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the
applicable Merger Consideration, but shall be entitled to only such rights as
are granted by the DGCL. Parent shall be entitled to retain any Merger
Consideration not paid on account of such Dissenting Shares pending resolution
of the claims of such holders, and no other Person shall be entitled to any
portion of such retained Merger Consideration.



(b)Loss of Dissenting Share Status. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section
1.7(a), if any holder of shares of Company Capital Stock who demands appraisal
of such holder's shares under the DGCL shall effectively withdraw or lose
(through the failure to perfect or otherwise) such holder's right to appraisal
under the DGCL, then as of the Closing or the occurrence of such event,
whichever occurs later, such holder's shares of Company Capital Stock shall
automatically be converted into the right to receive the applicable Merger
Consideration, without interest thereon, promptly following the surrender of
the certificate or certificates representing such shares of Company Capital
Stock, if any, or electronic transfer of Company Book Entry Shares.



(c)Notice of Dissenting Shares. The Company shall give Parent: (i) prompt
notice of any demands for appraisal of shares of Company Capital Stock
received by the Company, withdrawals of any demands, and any other instruments
or notices served or otherwise delivered pursuant to the DGCL and received by
the Company; and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands for appraisal and the Company shall
not enter into any settlement in respect of any such demands for appraisal
without the consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unduly conditioned,
withheld or delayed). Following Closing, Parent shall, at its discretion, take
control of and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands for appraisal that are still outstanding at such time.



1.8Exchange of Certificates and Payment. 

CONFIDENTIAL

(a)Payment Agent. Acquiom Financial LLC, a Colorado limited liability company,
in its capacity as payments administrator, or another nationally recognized
bank or trust company selected by Parent shall act as payment administrator in
the Merger (the "Payment Agent"). On or promptly after the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit with the Payment Agent cash sufficient to pay the cash
consideration payable pursuant to Sections 1.5(a)(ii), 1.6(a)(i) (in respect
of Non-Employee Options) and 1.6(d), excluding (i) the Escrow Amount which
shall be deposited with the Escrow Agent and (ii) the Securityholders' Agent
Expense Fund Amount which shall be deposited with the Securityholders' Agent.
The cash amount so deposited with the Payment Agent is referred to as the
"Payment Fund." The Payment Fund will be non-interest bearing.



(b)Letter of Transmittal. Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent shall
instruct the Payment Agent to deliver (including by means of electronic
delivery) to each Person who is a record holder of Outstanding Capital Stock,
Outstanding Warrants and Non-Employee Options immediately prior to the
Effective Time: (i) a letter of transmittal substantially in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit H (including, but not limited to the following provisions:
(A) with respect to the Outstanding Capital Stock, a provision confirming that
delivery of Company Capital Stock or electronic transfer of Company Book Entry
Shares shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Company Capital Stock
shall pass, only upon delivery of applicable Company Stock Certificates, if
any, or electronic transfer of Company Book Entry Shares to the Payment Agent
and (B) a general release and a provision whereby such holder agrees to be
bound by the provisions of Sections 1.5, 1.6, 1.8, 10, 11.1 and the other
applicable provisions of this Agreement, a "Letter of Transmittal"); and (ii)
with respect to the Outstanding Capital Stock, instructions for use in
effecting the delivery of Company Stock Certificates, if any, or electronic
transfer of Company Book Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration
payable with respect to shares of Company Capital Stock; provided, that, the
Company shall not be required to issue Company Stock Certificates for any
shares of Outstanding Capital Stock that have previously been represented as
Company Book Entry Shares. Upon the delivery to the Payment Agent of a duly
completed and validly executed Letter of Transmittal and, (i) in the case of
the holders of the Outstanding Warrants, subject also to the delivery of the
Warrant Surrender Agreement, (ii) in the case of the holders of Non-Employee
Options entitled to a portion of the Merger Consideration, subject also to the
delivery of the Option Conversion Agreement and (iii) in the case of the
holders of the Outstanding Capital Stock, subject also to the surrender to the
Payment Agent of a Company Stock Certificate, if any (or an affidavit of lost
stock certificate as described in Section 1.8(e)) or confirmation of
electronic transfer of Company Book Entry Share by the Payment Agent, together
with a duly executed Letter of Transmittal and such other documents as Parent
or the Payment Agent may reasonably request (including a properly completed
and duly executed IRS Form W-9, or appropriate version of IRS Form W-8, as
applicable), each holder of such Outstanding Capital Stock, Outstanding
Warrants and/or Non-Employee Options entitled to a portion of the Merger
Consideration, as applicable, shall, subject to Section 1.8(h), if applicable,
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor cash in an amount equal to the
Merger Consideration, if any, that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to Sections 1.5 and 1.6 at the time of such surrender, and the
Company Stock Certificate or Company Book Entry Shares, as applicable, so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. From and after the Effective 

CONFIDENTIAL

Time, each Company Stock Certificate, Company Book Entry Share, Company
Warrant or Non-Employee Option shall be deemed to represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration payable with respect to each such Company
Stock Certificate, Company Book Entry Share, Company Warrant or Non-Employee
Option, and the holder of each such Company Stock Certificate, Company Book
Entry Share, Company Warrant or Non-Employee Option shall cease to have any
rights with respect to the shares of Company Capital Stock formerly
represented thereby, purchasable thereunder or into which such security was
convertible.



(c)Payments to Others. If payment of Merger Consideration in respect of shares
of Company Capital Stock converted pursuant to Section 1.5 is to be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name such shares of Company Capital
Stock are registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that any Company
Stock Certificate surrendered in respect thereof, if any (or an affidavit of
lost stock certificate as described in Section 1.8(e)), or confirmation of
electronic transfer of Company Book Entry Share by the Payment Agent, shall be
properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that
the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other
Taxes required by reason of such payment in a name other than that of the
registered holder thereof or shall have established to the satisfaction of
Parent that such Tax either has been paid or is not payable.



(d)Stock Transfer Books. As of the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of
the Company shall be closed and there shall not be any further registration of
transfers of shares of Company Capital Stock thereafter on the records of the
Company. If, after the Effective Time, certificates for shares of Outstanding
Capital Stock ("Company Stock Certificates"), if any (or an affidavit of lost
stock certificate as described in Section 1.8(e)), or confirmation of
electronic transfer Company Book Entry Share by the Payment Agent, are
presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged
for the Merger Consideration, if any, payable with respect to such shares as
provided for in Section 1.5. No interest shall accrue or be paid on any Merger
Consideration payable upon the surrender of a Company Stock Certificate or
confirmation of electronic transfer of Company Book Entry Share by the Payment
Agent, as applicable.



(e)Lost Certificates. In the event any Company Stock Certificate, if any (and
not an electronic Company Book Entry Share) representing shares of Outstanding
Capital Stock shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent may, in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of any Merger
Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Capital Stock previously
represented by such Company Stock Certificate, require the owner of such lost,
stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate to provide an appropriate
affidavit as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Payment
Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any affiliated party with respect
to such Company Stock Certificate.



(f)Undistributed Payment Funds. Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains
undistributed as of the date that is 180 days after the date of this Agreement
shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and the Effective Time Holders who 

CONFIDENTIAL

provided a Letter of Transmittal in accordance with this Section 1.8, shall
thereafter look only to Parent for satisfaction of their claims for the Merger
Consideration payable with respect to the shares of Company Capital Stock
without any interest thereon.



(g)Escheat. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
neither Parent nor any other Person shall be liable to any Effective Time
Holder or to any other Person for any amount paid to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or similar
applicable Legal Requirement. Any Merger Consideration or other amounts
remaining unclaimed three (3) years after the Effective Time (or such earlier
date immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to
or become property of any Governmental Body) shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Legal Requirements, become the property of Parent free and clear of
any Encumbrance.



(h)Withholding. Each of the Payment Agent, the Escrow Agent, Parent, the
Company, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and their respective agents
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable
pursuant to this Agreement or any Holdback Agreement (including all amounts to
be contributed to the Escrow Fund in accordance with Section 1.5(c)) such
amounts as any such Person determines in good faith are required to be
deducted or withheld therefrom or in connection therewith under the Code or
any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law or under any other applicable
Legal Requirement. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, and
remitted to the appropriate Governmental Body, such amounts shall be treated
for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to
whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.



1.9Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is reasonably determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation
or Parent with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and
property of Merger Sub and the Company, the officers and directors of the
Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of
Merger Sub, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.



1.10Closing Adjustment.



(a)The Company shall deliver to Parent no later than three (3) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date a statement (the "Estimated Statement") that sets
forth the Company's good faith estimates of (i) the Net Working Capital
("Estimated Net Working Capital Amount") and, based thereon, the Net Working
Capital Adjustment Amount (the "Estimated Net Working Capital Adjustment
Amount"), (ii) the Closing Cash ("Estimated Closing Cash"), (iii) the Closing
Indebtedness Amount ("Estimated Closing Indebtedness Amount"), (iv) the
Closing Company Transaction Expenses (the "Estimated Closing Company
Transaction Expenses") and, based thereon, (v) the Purchase Price (the
"Estimated Purchase Price"), together with reasonably detailed supporting
calculations demonstrating each component thereof. 

CONFIDENTIAL

(b)No later than ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare
and deliver to the Securityholders' Agent a statement that sets forth Parent's
calculation of (i) the Net Working Capital and, based thereon, the Net Working
Capital Adjustment Amount, (ii) the Closing Cash, (iii) the Closing
Indebtedness Amount, (iv) the Closing Company Transaction Expenses and, based
thereon, (v) the Purchase Price, together with reasonably detailed supporting
calculations demonstrating each component thereof (the "Closing Date
Statement").



(c)The Securityholders' Agent shall have thirty (30) days (the "Review
Period") after delivery of the Closing Date Statement in which to notify
Parent in writing (such notice, a "Closing Date Dispute Notice") of any
discrepancy in, or disagreement with, the items reflected on the Closing Date
Statement (and specifying the amount in dispute and setting forth in
reasonable detail the basis for such discrepancy or disagreement). During the
Review Period, the Securityholders' Agent and the Representatives of the
Securityholders' Agent shall have reasonable access, during normal business
hours, to all records and work papers of the Acquired Entities reasonably
requested by the Securityholders' Agent and related to the preparation of the
Closing Date Statement. If the Securityholders' Agent does not deliver a
Closing Date Dispute Notice to Parent during the Review Period, the Closing
Date Statement shall be deemed to be accepted in the form presented to the
Securityholders' Agent for the purposes of this Section 1.10. If the
Securityholders' Agent delivers a Closing Date Dispute Notice prior to
expiration of the Review Period, Parent and the Securityholders' Agent shall
negotiate in good faith to try and reach an agreement within thirty (30) days
after delivery of the Closing Date Dispute Notice (the "Negotiation Period")
as to any items identified in the Closing Date Dispute Notice as being in
dispute. To the extent that Parent and the Securityholders' Agent reach
agreement on any such disputed items during the Negotiation Period, then the
Final Closing Date Statement (as defined herein) shall incorporate any such
agreement.



(d)If, during the Negotiation Period, Parent and the Securityholders' Agent
fail to resolve all disputed items identified in the Closing Date Dispute
Notice (the "Final Dispute Items"), then all remaining disputed items shall be
submitted for final and conclusive determination by the Independent Accounting
Firm (it being understood that in making such determination, the Independent
Accounting Firm shall function as an expert and not an arbitrator). Each of
Parent and the Securityholders' Agent shall execute and deliver a customary
engagement letter as may be reasonably requested by the Independent Accounting
Firm. The Independent Accounting Firm's determination shall be (i) limited
solely to the items identified in the written submissions of Parent and the
Securityholders' Agent, (ii) based solely on the written submissions of Parent
and the Securityholders' Agent and the supporting documents submitted
therewith, and not by independent review, and (iii) made in accordance with
the Specified Accounting Principles. In resolving any disputed item, the
Independent Accounting Firm may not assign a value greater than the greatest
value for such item claimed by Parent or the Securityholders' Agent, or less
than the smallest value for such item claimed by Parent or the
Securityholders' Agent. As promptly as possible (but in no event later than
thirty (30) days after acceptance of its appointment), the Independent
Accounting Firm shall render a written report setting forth its determination
as to the disputed items. The 

CONFIDENTIAL

Independent Accounting Firm's determination shall be final and binding upon,
and non-appealable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns with respect to the Net Working Capital, the Net Working Capital
Adjustment Amount and any other Final Dispute Items, and not subject to
collateral attack for any reason absent manifest mathematical error or fraud.
The fees, costs and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be
allocated to and borne by Parent and the Securityholders' Agent (on behalf of
the Effective Time Holders) based on the inverse of the percentage that the
Independent Accounting Firm's determination (before such allocation) bears to
the total amount of the total items in dispute as originally submitted to the
Independent Accounting Firm. For example, if the aggregate value of the items
in dispute equals $1,000, and the Independent Accounting Firm awards $600 in
favor of the Securityholders' Agent (on behalf of the Effective Time Holders)
and $400 in favor of Parent, then sixty percent (60%) of the fees, costs and
expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm would be borne by Parent and forty
percent (40%) of such fees, costs and expenses would be borne by the
Securityholders' Agent (on behalf of the Effective Time Holders). Within five
(5) Business Days of the resolution of all disputed items identified in the
Closing Date Dispute Notice, whether by mutual agreement of Parent and the
Securityholders' Agent or a determination by the Independent Accounting Firm,
Parent shall prepare a revised version of the Closing Date Statement including
an updated Purchase Price (the "Final Purchase Price") reflecting such
resolution and shall deliver copies thereof to the Securityholders' Agent, and
such revised version (and all amounts set forth therein), if so properly
reflected, shall be considered final with respect to the Net Working Capital,
the Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount and any other Final Dispute Items
(the "Final Closing Date Statement"). For the avoidance of doubt, with respect
to the Closing Indebtedness Amount and the Closing Company Transaction
Expenses, no matter will be deemed to be a Final Dispute Item to the extent
that a third party claim arises with respect to the subject matter thereof.



(e)If the Final Purchase Price exceeds the Estimated Purchase Price (such
amount by which the Final Purchase Price exceeds the Estimated Purchase Price,
the "Purchase Price Excess Amount"), Parent shall, in accordance with the
Merger Consideration Certificate, (i) pay to the Payment Agent by wire
transfer of immediately available funds the applicable portion of the Purchase
Price Excess Amount for further distribution to the holders of Outstanding
Capital Stock, Non-Employee Options and Outstanding Warrants and (ii) cause to
be paid through the payroll services of the applicable Acquired Entity or
Parent the applicable portion of the Purchase Price Excess Amount due to each
holder of an Employee Option.



(f)If the Estimated Purchase Price exceeds the Final Purchase Price , then
Parent shall have the right to recover all or any portion of such difference
directly from the Escrow Fund (in which case the Securityholders' Agent (on
behalf of each Effective Time Holder) and Parent shall jointly instruct the
Escrow Agent to pay such difference to Parent out of the Escrow Fund, it being
understood that any remaining portion shall be paid directly by the Effective
Time Holders, based on their respective Aggregate Pro Rata Share. All payments
by the Effective Time Holders shall be made within ten (10) Business Days
following receipt of notice informing them that payment is due. 

CONFIDENTIAL

(g)If the Final Purchase Price is equal to the Estimated Purchase Price, there
shall not be any adjustment.



(h)Nothing in this Section 1.10 shall limit any rights of any Parent
Indemnitee as set forth in Section 10.

or threatened against any Acquired Entity in respect of any Tax, and there are
no matters relating to Taxes under discussion between any taxing authority and
an Acquired Entity. There are no liens for Taxes upon any of the assets of any
Acquired Entity except liens for current Taxes not yet due and payable (and

change in a method of accounting, or use of an improper method of accounting,
in each case for a taxable period that ends on or prior to the Closing Date,

Governmental Bodies; (ii) has never effectuated a "plant closing,"

opinion or advisory letter from the Internal Revenue Service with respect to
its qualification and the Tax-exempt status of its related trust, and no
circumstances exist which could result in Liability to any Acquired Entity in
respect of such qualified status or loss of such qualified status. No
fiduciary (within the meaning of Section 3(21) of ERISA) of any Acquired
Entity Employee Plan subject to Part 4 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA has
committed a breach of fiduciary duty with respect to that Acquired Entity
Employee Plan that could subject any Acquired Entity or an Acquired Entity
Service Provider to any Liability (including Liability on account of an
indemnification obligation). None of the Acquired Entities has incurred any
excise Taxes under Chapter 43 of the Code with respect to any Acquired Entity
Employee Plan and nothing has occurred with respect to any Acquired Entity
Employee Plan that could reasonably be expected to subject any Acquired Entity
to any such Taxes.



(m)Labor Relations and Claims. There have never been any, and there is no
Legal Proceeding, claim, arbitration, labor dispute, or grievance pending or,

benefits under such Acquired Entity Employee Plan.

CONFIDENTIAL

4.9Employment Agreements and Termination of Non-Continuing Employees. Parent
shall provide offer letters of continuing at-will employment, along with other
customary employee documents; provided, however, that in the case of certain
non-U.S. Acquired Entity Employees, Parent may extend the offer of a new
employment contract with Parent's local entity or provide a notice or
confirmatory acknowledgment that their employment will continue under the
existing terms and conditions of employment (each, an "Employment Offer
Letter"), within two (2) Business Days following Parent's public announcement
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to certain Acquired Entity
Employees as Parent determines (the "Offered Employees"); in any case, Parent
may request acknowledgment that such Acquired Entity Employees will be
governed by Parent's code of conduct, policies and training requirements.
Effective as of immediately prior to the Closing, the Company shall terminate,
to the extent that it is able to do so in compliance with applicable Legal
Requirements, the employment of each Acquired Entity Employee who is not a
Continuing Employee (each such Person, a "Non-Continuing Employee") and shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a separation agreement and
general release of claims from such individuals in favor of each Acquired
Entity and their Affiliates and Representatives. All contractors shall
continue providing services to the applicable Acquired Entity unless Parent
requests that the service of any such contractors be terminated, in which case
the Company shall terminate the engagement of such contractors prior to the
Closing and any costs associated with such terminations shall constitute
Company Transaction Expenses. Any non-U.S. Acquired Entity Employee who is
provided with an Employment Offer Letter and continues to be an employee of
any Acquired Entity, Parent or any Affiliate thereof shall be a "Non-U.S.
Continuing Employee" regardless of whether such individual's employment or
service to any Acquired Entity is deemed to have been terminated as of the
Closing, pursuant to local Legal Requirements or otherwise. The Company shall
be responsible for the payment of all final payments, wages, salary and
benefits and other remuneration, including, any severance, bonus, accrued
vacation, payment in lieu of notice period (including, but not limited to, any
payments owed under the WARN Act) and vacation pay or other payments or
amounts, due to Non-Continuing Employees, whether under Legal Requirements or
Contract (the "Non-Continuing Employee Compensation") with respect to their
services as employees of the Acquired Entities and the termination of their
employment, and all such payments shall be made to each Non- Continuing
Employee prior to the Closing Date and be considered Company Transaction
Expenses; provided, that no such costs, expenses or payments shall be borne by
the Company, and shall instead be Liabilities of Parent, to the extent arising
out of the employment of any Non-U.S. Continuing Employee. No later than the
Business Day prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall pay to each U.S.
Acquired Entity Employee an amount equal to all accrued paid time off of each
such Acquired Entity Employee as of the Closing Date, such that, as of the
Closing, such Acquired Entity Employees shall have no accrued paid time off
(such amount, in the aggregate, the "PTO Balance").



4.10Retention Pool. Prior to the Effective Time, on the written request of
Parent, the Company will grant a number of New Restricted Stock Units to
Continuing Employees from the shares remaining available for issuance under
the New Stock Plan having an aggregate economic value equal to $30,000,000
(the "Retention Pool"). Any such New Restricted Stock Units shall be allocated
to Continuing Employees as determined by Parent, in its sole discretion, after
consultation with the Company. All New Restricted Stock Units shall be issued
solely to those Persons who are Offered Employees and in the amounts set forth
in such allocation and shall be issued without consideration and shall vest
over a four year period. The number of New 

CONFIDENTIAL

Restricted Stock Units subject to any individual grant shall be expressed as a
dollar value, which such value shall be converted into a number of shares of
Company Common Stock no later than immediately prior to the Effective Time by
dividing (a) the specified dollar value of the applicable grant of New
Restricted Stock Units by (b) the Per Share Amount. Any New Restricted Stock
Units that are outstanding as of the Effective Time shall be treated in
accordance with Section 1.6(c). The New Restricted Stock Units shall vest as
follows: 25% of the total number of New Restricted Stock Units subject to a
given grant shall vest on September 20, 2021 and 1/16th of the total number of
New Restricted Stock Units subject to a given grant shall vest quarterly
thereafter, subject to the occurrence of the Closing and the grantee's
continuous eligible service through and including the applicable vesting date.



4.11Joinder and Support Agreements; Option Conversion Agreements. Prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall request and use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain (a) Joinder and Support Agreements from all holders of
Company Capital Stock and (b) Option Conversion Agreements from all holders of
Company Options.



4.12Foreign Subsidiary Transfer. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to execute a duly stamped share transfer
form by the individual identified in Schedule 1.3(b)(xx) in respect of his
ownership in the Foreign Subsidiary in favor of a nominee of Parent.

(b)Parachute Payments. The Company shall: (i) at least three (3) days prior to
the Closing Date and at least one day prior to the 280G Vote, use commercially
reasonable efforts to secure from each "disqualified individual" (within the
meaning of Section 280G(c) of the Code) who has received or has a right to
receive any payments and/or benefits as a result of or in connection with the
transactions contemplated herein that could be deemed to constitute "parachute
payments" (within the meaning of Section 

CONFIDENTIAL

280G of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder ("Section 280G"))
a waiver of such individual's rights to retain or receive some or all of such
payments and/or benefits (such waived payments and/or benefits, the "Waived

stockholder approval was obtained with respect to the Waived Section 280G
Payments; or (y) the Company stockholder approval of the Waived Section 280G

Payments shall not be made or provided. The Company shall provide to Parent
for its review and approval (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), at least two days prior to securing the waivers
required by clause "(i)" hereof, copies of all documents prepared by the
Company in connection with this Section 5.2(b), including the form of waiver

Consideration Certificate, all option and New Restricted Stock Unit
documentation relating to the Assumed Options and New Restricted Stock Units
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are assumed by
Parent), will maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for so

subject to any Company Options or New Restricted Stock Units assumed by Parent
that are held by Persons who do not become employees of Parent or a subsidiary
of Parent at the Effective Time or do not otherwise have a service
relationship with Parent or a subsidiary of Parent at the Effective Time. 

CONFIDENTIAL

5.5Employee Matters.



(a)Subject to Legal Requirements, nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon
any Continuing Employee or other service provider any right to continue in the
employment or service of Parent, any Acquired Entity or any of their
respective Affiliates, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the
rights of Parent, any Acquired Entity or any of their respective Affiliates,
which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate the
services of any Continuing Employee or other service provider at any time for
any reason whatsoever, with or without cause. In no event shall the terms of
this Agreement be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any "employee
benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or any other benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement maintained or sponsored by Parent, any
Acquired Entity or any of their respective Affiliates; or (ii) alter or limit
the ability of Parent, any Acquired Entity or any of their respective
Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any "employee benefit plan" as
defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA or any other compensation or benefit or
employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the Effective Time.
The provisions of this Section 5.5 are for the sole benefit of the parties to
this Agreement, and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or shall
be construed to confer upon or give to any Person (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, any Continuing Employee or other current or former
employee of the Company or any of its Affiliates), other than the parties
hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any legal or
equitable or other rights or remedies (including with respect to the matters
provided for in this Section 5.5 under or by reason of any provision of this
Agreement.



(b)Following the Closing, and subject to applicable Legal Requirements, Parent
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to treat the service of the
Continuing Employees with the Acquired Entities attributable to any period
before the Effective Time as service rendered to Parent or any Subsidiary or
Affiliate of Parent for purposes of eligibility, vesting and determination of
the level of benefits under Parent's vacation, severance, health and welfare,
and defined contribution plans (in each case, to the extent (i) the Continuing
Employee is otherwise eligible to participate in such plan and (ii) such
treatment is permissible under the Parent's plans), except where credit would
result in duplication of benefits. As a condition to Parent's obligation under
this Section 5.5(b), the Company shall provide Parent or its designee with all
information reasonably requested and necessary to allow Parent or its designee
to comply with such obligation. With respect to each health or welfare benefit
plan maintained by Parent or the Surviving Corporation for the benefit of
Continuing Employees, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, use commercially reasonable efforts to (A) cause to be waived any
eligibility waiting periods, any evidence of insurability requirements and the
application of any pre-existing condition limitations under such plan, and (B)
cause each Continuing Employee to be given credit under such plan for all
amounts paid by such Continuing Employee under any similar Acquired Entity
Employee Plan for the plan year that includes the Effective Time for purposes
of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such
amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the plans
maintained by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, for the plan
year in which the Effective Time occurs, in each case only to the extent
permitted by applicable Legal Requirements and the applicable plan(s). 

CONFIDENTIAL



(c)As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, subject to applicable
Legal Requirements, for a period of not less than 12 months after the Closing
Date (or if shorter, during the period of employment), Parent shall, or shall
cause the applicable employing Subsidiary of Parent (including the Surviving
Corporation or the Foreign Subsidiary) to, use commercially reasonable efforts
to permit each Acquired Entity Employee who continues employment with Parent
or the Surviving Corporation following the Effective Time (each, a "Continuing
Employee") to enroll in Parent's employee benefit plans or the employee
benefit plans of the applicable employing Subsidiary (together, "Parent
Plans") provided to similarly situated employees of Parent or the applicable
employing Subsidiary (taking into account relevant factors including the
Continuing Employee's level of responsibilities and geographic location), to
the extent permitted by the terms of, and to the extent the applicable
employees are eligible to enroll in, such Parent Plans.



5.6Company Indemnification Provisions.



(a)If the Merger is consummated, then, until the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to fulfill and
honor in all respects the obligations of the Company to its present and former
directors and officers (the "Covered Persons") pursuant to indemnification
agreements with the Company in effect on the date of this Agreement and set
forth in Schedule 5.6, and pursuant to the Charter Documents in effect as of

Policy until it is exhausted before recovery against Parent shall take place.

affect any Covered Person without the consent of such affected Covered Person.



6.Tax Matters



6.1Transfer Taxes. The liability for all transfer, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, registration and other such similar Taxes, and all conveyance fees,
recording charges and other similar fees and incurred in connection with
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby ("Transfer Taxes"), shall
be borne fifty percent (50%) by the Effective Time Holders and fifty percent
(50%) by Parent; provided, however, that any non-U.S. Taxes imposed on a 

CONFIDENTIAL

sale of a Subsidiary of the Company (or a deemed sale of the Subsidiary's
assets) upon the sale of the Company, shall be borne entirely by the Effective
Time Holders. The parties shall cooperate with each other in connection with
the filing of any Tax Returns relating to Transfer Taxes, including joining in
the execution of any such Tax Return or other documentation where necessary.
Parent and Effective Time Holders shall, upon request of the other party, use
their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other
document from any Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate
any Transfer Taxes. The party required by applicable law to file any Tax
Return relating to Transfer Taxes shall be responsible for preparing and
timely filing all such Tax Returns.



6.2Tax Returns.



(a)During the Pre-Closing Period, the Acquired Entities shall prepare and
timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns of the
Acquired Entities with a due date on or prior to the Closing Date (taking into
account all extensions properly obtained), and the Acquired Entities shall
remit or cause to be remitted any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns;
provided, however, the Acquired Entities will submit any such Tax Returns that
report income Taxes or other material Taxes to Parent for review and comment
at least 20 days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return, and will
consider in good faith any reasonable comments received in writing within 10
days of the Acquired Entity's delivery of such Tax Return to Parent.



(b)Parent shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely
filed (taking into account all extensions properly obtained) all Tax Returns
of the Acquired Entities that are first due after the Closing Date and that
relate in whole or in part to a Pre-Closing Tax Period ("Parent Prepared
Return"). To the extent any Parent Prepared Return relates in whole or part to
a Pre-Closing Tax Period, each such Parent Prepared Return shall be prepared
in a manner consistent with the past practice of the Acquired Entities, except
where Parent determines in good faith that preparing such Parent Prepared
Returns in such manner could be inconsistent with applicable Legal
Requirements. In the event that any Parent Prepared Returns shows any material
Pre-Closing Taxes that may form the basis for a claim of indemnification
against the Effective Time Holders pursuant to this Agreement, Parent will
submit such Parent Prepared Return to the Securityholders' Agent for review
and comment at least 20 days prior to the due date (or, if such Parent
Prepared Returns are required to be filed within 20 days after the date this
Agreement is signed, as soon as practicable after such date) (taking into
account all extensions properly obtained) for filing such Parent Prepared
Return, and Parent shall consider in good faith any reasonable comments
received in writing from the Securityholders' Agent within 10 days of Parent's
delivery of such Parent Prepared Return to the Securityholders' Agent;
provided, however, that any failure to so submit a Parent Prepared Return
shall not relieve the Effective Time Holders of any liability for Pre-Closing
Taxes with respect to such Parent Prepared Return (except to the extent the
Effective Time Holders are materially prejudiced by such failure). 

CONFIDENTIAL

6.3Post-Closing Tax Actions. Unless required by applicable Legal Requirements,
Parent and the Company shall not (x) amend any Tax Return of the Company with
respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, make any voluntary disclosures with
respect to Taxes for Pre-Closing Tax Periods, or make any Tax election that
has retroactive effect on any Pre-Closing Tax Period, in each case, without
first consulting with the Securityholders' Agent in good faith, or (y) take
any action after the Closing on the Closing Date outside the ordinary course
of business not contemplated by this Agreement without the prior consent of
the Securityholders' Agent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), in each case, to the extent any such action would reasonably be
expected to increase the Effective Time Holders' liability for Pre-Closing
Taxes under Section 10.2(a).



6.4Assistance and Cooperation. After the Closing Date, each of
Securityholders' Agent and Parent shall (and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to):



(a)timely sign and deliver such certificates or forms as may be reasonably
requested and necessary or appropriate to establish an exemption from (or
otherwise reduce), or file Tax Returns or other reports with respect to,
Transfer Taxes;



(b)reasonably assist the other party in preparing any Tax Returns of the
Acquired Entities;



(c)cooperate fully in preparing for and defending any audits of, or disputes
with taxing authorities regarding, any Taxes or Tax Returns of any Acquired
Entity;



(d)make available to the other party and to any taxing authority as reasonably
requested all information, records and documents relating to Taxes of any
Acquired Entity; and



(e)furnish the other party with copies of all correspondence received from any
taxing authority in connection with any Tax audit or information request with
respect to any such taxable period; provided, that, Parent shall only be
obliged to furnish copies of such correspondence to Securityholders' Agent to
the extent such audit or information request relates to Taxes for which the
Effective Time Holders may be liable under the terms of this Agreement, and in
no event shall the Securityholders' Agent be entitled to review or otherwise
have access to any income Tax Return, or information related thereto, of
Parent or its Affiliates.



6.5Termination of Tax Allocation Arrangements. Any Tax allocation, Tax
indemnity or Tax sharing agreement between an Acquired Entity, on the one
hand, and any Person (other than another Acquired Entity), on the other hand,
shall be terminated as to the applicable Acquired Entity on or prior to the
Closing, and after the Closing no Acquired Entity shall have any liability
thereunder.



6.6Ownership Changes. Prior to the Closing, the Company, and, after the
Closing, the Securityholders' Agent and the Effective Time Holders, agree to
cooperate with Parent and provide any factual information in their possession
or that can be obtained using commercially reasonable efforts and is
reasonably requested by Parent to determine the limitations, if any, on 

CONFIDENTIAL

the Company's Tax attribute carryforwards under Sections 382, 383 and 384 of
the Code. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, such information
may include: (a) information regarding the ownership of the equity of the
Company from the time the Company was formed through the Closing Date
(including any capitalization tables, option tables or redemption tables with
respect to the equity of the Company showing the ownership of Company stock
and/or options, the dates any such stock and/or options were issued or
transferred, and the prices and (if applicable) strike prices at which any
such stock and/or options were issued), (b) information regarding any
relationships between and/or among the holders of stock and/or options in the
Company, (c) any valuation-type spreadsheets, memoranda, offering documents,
board's resolutions or similar materials of the Company that have been
prepared by or for the Company in connection with any stock offerings, option
issuances, changes in option pricing or redemptions, if any, and (d) any
written analysis that has been conducted regarding whether there is any
limitation on its carryforwards under the foregoing Code sections.



6.7Straddle Period. In the case of any Straddle Period, the amount of any
Taxes (a) based on or measured by income, receipts or payroll of the Acquired
Entities, (b) imposed in connection with any sale, transfer or assignment or
any deemed sale, transfer or assignment of property or (c) sales and use
taxes, value-added taxes, employment taxes, withholding taxes or similar Taxes
for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined based on an interim closing
of the books as of the close of business on the Closing Date (and in the case
of any Taxes attributable to the ownership of any equity interest in any
partnership or other "flowthrough" entity or "controlled foreign corporation"
(within the meaning of Section 957(a) of the Code or any comparable state,
local or non-U.S. Law), as if the taxable period of such partnership or other
"flowthrough" entity or "controlled foreign corporation" ended as of the end
of the Closing Date) (provided, however, that any exemptions or allowances
that are calculated on an annual or other periodic basis shall be allocated
between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period in
proportion to the number of days in each such period), and the amount of other
Taxes of the Acquired Entities that relate to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall
be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is number of days in the
taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
number of days in such taxable period. For the avoidance of doubt, for
purposes of allocating Taxes imposed under Section 951A of the Code in respect
of the Foreign Subsidiary, the "qualified business asset investment" (as such
term is used in Section 951A(d) of the Code) in respect of the Pre-Closing Tax
Period shall equal the product of (i) the Foreign Subsidiary's "qualified
business asset investment" (as defined in Section 951A(d)(1) of the Code) for
the taxable year of the Foreign Subsidiary that includes the Closing Date
(determined as though such taxable year ended on the Closing Date), and (ii) a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the portion of such
taxable year ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
total number of days in such taxable year.

part of any of the Parent Indemnitees (regardless of whether obtained through
any investigation by any Parent Indemnitee or through disclosure by the

fair value of any Dissenting Shares is made by a court of competent
jurisdiction in connection with any such exercise of appraisal rights, 

CONFIDENTIAL

then the only portion of such fair value to be included in calculation of the

otherwise entitle a Parent Indemnitee to indemnification for Damages pursuant
to clauses "(i)" through "(viii)" above, inclusive (including any Legal
Proceeding commenced by any Parent Indemnitee for the purpose of enforcing any
of its rights under this Section 10).



(b)Damage to Parent. The parties acknowledge and agree that, if the Surviving
Corporation or any of the Acquired Entities suffers, incurs or otherwise
becomes subject to any Damages as a result of or in connection with any
inaccuracy in or breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
obligation, then (without limiting any of the rights of the Surviving
Corporation or any of the Acquired Entities as a Parent Indemnitee) Parent
shall also be deemed, by virtue of its ownership of the stock of the Surviving
Corporation or any Acquired Entity, to have incurred Damages as a result of
and in connection with such inaccuracy or breach.



10.3Limitations.



(a)Baskets.



(i)Subject to Section 10.3(b), the Effective Time Holders shall not be
required to make any indemnification payment pursuant to Section 10.2(a)(i) or
Section 10.2(a)(ix) (to the extent pertaining to a matter pursuant to Section
10.2(a)(i)) until such time as the total amount of all indemnifiable Damages
(including the Damages arising from such inaccuracy or breach and all other
Damages arising from any other inaccuracies or breaches of any representations
or warranties) that have been suffered or incurred by any one or more of the
Parent Indemnitees exceeds $1,000,000 in the aggregate (the "Basket Amount").
If the total amount of such Damages exceeds the Basket Amount, then the Parent
Indemnitees shall be entitled to be indemnified against and compensated and
reimbursed for the entire amount of such Damages (subject to the other
limitations herein), and not merely the portion of such Damages exceeding the
Basket Amount. 

CONFIDENTIAL



(ii)Subject to Section 10.3(b), a Parent Indemnitee may not recover pursuant
to Section 10.2(a) for any individual claim for which the Damages relating
thereto are less than $25,000 (the "De Minimis Amount"); provided, however,
that the foregoing shall not prohibit a Parent Indemnitee from recovering for
any series of claims, arising out of the same facts, with respect to which the
aggregate underlying Damages exceed the De Minimis Amount.



(b)Applicability of Certain Limitations. The limitations set forth in Section
10.3(a)(i) shall not apply (and shall not limit the indemnification or other
obligations of any Effective Time Holder): (i) in the event of fraud or
intentional misrepresentation or (ii) to inaccuracies in or breaches of any of
the Fundamental Representations. The limitations in Section 10.3(a)(ii) shall
not apply (and shall not limit the indemnification or other obligations of any
Effective Time Holder): (i) to inaccuracies in or breaches of any of the
representations and warranties made by the Company set forth in Section 2.14
(Taxes), or (ii) to Pre-Closing Taxes.



(c)Recourse to Escrow Fund. Subject to Section 10.3(d), recourse by the Parent
Indemnitees to the Escrow Fund shall be the Parent Indemnitees' sole and
exclusive remedy under this Agreement for Damages resulting from the matters
referred to in Section 10.2(a)(i) and Section 10.2(a)(ix) (to the extent
pertaining to a matter set forth in Section 10.2(a)(i)). The Escrow Fund shall
be first recourse for Damages for all other matters referred to in Section
10.2(a) to the extent that the Escrow Fund is then available;



(d)Indemnification Cap. Subject to Section 11.3, the total amount of
indemnification payments that each Effective Time Holder can be required to
make to the Parent Indemnitees pursuant to Section 10.2 (including the amount,
if any, that was withheld from such Effective Time Holder as a contribution to
the Escrow Fund pursuant to the terms of Section 1.5(c), and paid to Parent or
any other Parent Indemnitee out of the Escrow Fund) shall (a) be limited to
such Effective Time Holder's Aggregate Pro Rata Share of such Damages and (b)
not exceed the portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration actually received
by such Effective Time Holder pursuant to Sections 1.5(a), 1.6(a) and 1.6(d)
(without regard to any Taxes deducted or to be deducted); provided, however,
that for the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall not limit or otherwise
restrict the right of any Parent Indemnitee to pursue remedies under any other
agreement entered into in connection with the Merger or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement against the parties thereto.



(e)Exclusion of Materiality Qualifiers. For purposes of determining (i)
whether there has been an inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or
warranty (provided, that, for purposes of this subsection (i), references to
"Material Adverse Effect" shall not be disregarded in Section 2.6(a)) and (ii)
the amount of any Damages resulting from the breach or inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty, the parties agree that all references to
"material," "materially," "in all material respects" or "materiality," or to
whether a breach would have a Material Adverse Effect, will be disregarded, in
all cases, except for references to "Material Contract". 

CONFIDENTIAL

(f)Pre-Closing Taxes and Tax Attributes. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, (i) indemnification hereunder for Damages with
respect to breaches of a representation or warranty contained in Section 2.14
(other than with respect to a breach of any representation or warranty set
forth in Sections 2.14(d), (e), (f), (g), (h), (i) (solely in respect of
clauses (i) and (ii) of the second sentence therein), (k), (l), (n), (o), (p),
(s), (t), and (v)) shall be limited to Taxes attributable to Pre-Closing Tax
Periods, and (ii) no Acquired Entity makes any representations or warranties
regarding the ability of Parent or any of its Affiliates (including the
Surviving Corporation) to utilize any Tax asset or attribute of the Acquired
Entities (e.g., net operating losses) in a Tax period (or portion thereof)
beginning after the Closing Date.



(g)No Double Recovery. No Parent indemnitee shall be entitled to double
recovery for any indemnifiable Damages even though such Damages may (i) be
recoverable under more than one provision of Section 10.2 or under Section
1.10 or (ii) have resulted from the breach of more than one of the
representations, warranties, agreements and covenants in this Agreement;
provided, however, that the foregoing limitation shall not prevent a Parent
Indemnitee from recovering all Damages to which it is entitled hereunder
directly arising out of the same set of facts and circumstances
notwithstanding the fact that an indemnification claim for such Damage is
based upon more than one representation, warranty, agreement or covenant.



(h)Mitigation. The Parent Indemnitees shall mitigate Damages to the extent
required by applicable Legal Requirements, it being understood that any out-
of-pocket costs incurred by a Parent Indemnitee in connection with any
mitigation undertaken pursuant to this Section 10.3(h) shall constitute
Damages to the extent that the underlying Damages are indemnifiable hereunder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 10.3(h) shall not apply to
indemnifiable Damages relating to Taxes, and the Parent Indemnitees shall have
no obligations under this Section 10.3(h) with respect thereto.



(i)Insurance Proceeds. For purposes of calculating or determining the amount
of Damages, there shall be deducted from any Damages an amount equal to the
amount of any proceeds actually received by any Parent Indemnitee from any
third-party insurer or from any other third parties in connection with such
Damages (net of any costs and reasonable, out-of-pocket expenses of recovery
or collection thereof and any deductible or premium associated therewith to
the extent paid or payable); provided, however, that none of the Parent
Indemnitee shall have any obligation to (i) seek recovery against any
insurance policies (other than the DandO Tail Policy), or (ii) obtain insurance
coverage or other third party protection with respect to any particular
matter.



10.4No Contribution. Each Effective Time Holder waives, and acknowledges and
agrees that such Effective Time Holder shall not have and shall not exercise
or assert (or attempt to exercise or assert), any right of contribution, right
of indemnity or advancement of expenses or other right or remedy against the
Surviving Corporation or any Acquired Entity in connection with any
indemnification obligation of such Effective Time Holder pursuant to Section
10.

10.5Claim Procedures. Any claim for indemnification, compensation or
reimbursement pursuant to Section 10 (and, at the option of any Parent
Indemnitee, any claim based upon fraud or intentional misrepresentation
committed by an Effective Time Holder) shall be brought and resolved
exclusively as follows: 

CONFIDENTIAL

(a)If any Parent Indemnitee has or claims in good faith to have incurred or
suffered, or reasonably believes in good faith that it may incur or suffer,
Damages for which it is or may be entitled to indemnification, compensation or
reimbursement under this Section 10, such Parent Indemnitee may deliver a
written claim notice (a "Claim Notice") to the Securityholders' Agent (subject
at all times to the applicable survival periods and indemnification
limitations under this Section 10). Each Claim Notice shall: (i) contain a
brief description in reasonable detail of the facts and circumstances
supporting the Parent Indemnitee's claim; and (ii) contain a non-binding,
preliminary, good faith estimate of the amount to which the Parent Indemnitee
might be entitled (the aggregate amount of such estimate, as it may be
modified by the Parent Indemnitee in good faith from time to time, being
referred to as the "Claimed Amount").



(b)During the 30-day period commencing upon receipt by the Securityholders'
Agent of a Claim Notice from a Parent Indemnitee (the "Dispute Period"), the
Securityholders' Agent may deliver to the Parent Indemnitee a written response
(the "Response Notice") in which the Securityholders' Agent: (i) agrees that
the full Claimed Amount is owed to the Parent Indemnitee; (ii) agrees that
part, but not all, of the Claimed Amount is owed to the Parent Indemnitee; or
(iii) indicates that no part of the Claimed Amount is owed to the Parent
Indemnitee. If the Response Notice is delivered in accordance with clause
"(ii)" or clause "(iii)" of the preceding sentence, the Response Notice shall
also contain a brief description of the facts and circumstances supporting the
Securityholders' Agent's claim that only a portion or no part of the Claimed
Amount is owed to the Parent Indemnitee, as the case may be. After delivery of
a Claim Notice, the Securityholder's Agent shall have reasonable and timely
access to all records and materials of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any Parent Indemnitee reasonably requested by Securityholder's Agent in
writing in order to review and assess such Claim Notice. Any part of the
Claimed Amount that is not agreed to be owed to the Parent Indemnitee pursuant
to the Response Notice (or the entire Claimed Amount, if the Securityholders'
Agent asserts in the Response Notice that no part of the Claimed Amount is
owed to the Parent Indemnitee) is referred to herein as the "Contested Amount"
(it being understood that the Contested Amount shall be modified from time to
time to reflect any good faith modifications by the Parent Indemnitee to the
Claimed Amount to the extent based on facts and circumstances underlying the
original Claim Notice).



(c)If the Securityholders' Agent in its Response Notice agrees that the full
Claimed Amount is owed to the Parent Indemnitee, or if no Response Notice is
received by the Parent Indemnitee from the Securityholders' Agent prior to the
expiration of the Dispute Period, then: (i) Parent and Securityholders' Agent
shall, within three (3) Business Days following the earlier of the delivery of
such Response Notice or the expiration of the Dispute Period, jointly execute
and deliver to the Escrow Agent a written notice instructing the Escrow Agent
to pay the Claimed Amount to the Parent Indemnitee from the Escrow Fund; and
(ii) if the amount held in the Escrow Fund is insufficient to cover the full
Claimed Amount, then, subject to the limitations contained in Section 10.3,
each Effective Time Holder shall pay within ten (10) Business Days following
the earlier of the delivery of such Response Notice or the expiration of the
Dispute Period, such Effective Time Holder's Aggregate Pro Rata Share of the
amount of such deficiency to the Parent Indemnitee. 

CONFIDENTIAL

(d)If the Securityholders' Agent delivers a Response Notice to the Parent
Indemnitee during the Dispute Period agreeing that part, but not all, of the
Claimed Amount is owed to the Parent Indemnitee (the "Agreed Amount"), then:
(i) Parent and Securityholders' Agent shall, within three Business Days
following the delivery of such Response Notice, jointly execute and deliver to
the Escrow Agent a written notice instructing the Escrow Agent to pay the
Agreed Amount to such Parent Indemnitee from the Escrow Fund; and (ii) if the
amount held in the Escrow Fund is insufficient to cover the full Agreed
Amount, then, subject to the limitations contained in Section 10.3, each
Effective Time Holder shall pay within ten (10) Business Days following the
delivery of such Response Notice, such Effective Time Holder's Aggregate Pro
Rata Share of the amount of such deficiency to the Parent Indemnitee.



(e)If the Securityholders' Agent delivers a Response Notice to the Parent
Indemnitee during the Dispute Period expressly stating that there is a
Contested Amount, then, during the 30-day period following delivery of such
Response Notices (the "Resolution Period"), the Securityholders' Agent and the
Parent Indemnitee shall attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute related
to the Contested Amount. If the Securityholders' Agent and the Parent
Indemnitee resolve such dispute, such resolution shall be binding on the
Securityholders' Agent, the Effective Time Holders and such Parent Indemnitee,
and a settlement agreement stipulating the amount owed to such Parent
Indemnitee (the "Stipulated Amount") shall be signed by such Parent Indemnitee
and the Securityholders' Agent. Within three Business Days following the
execution of such settlement agreement, or such shorter period of time as may
be set forth in the settlement agreement, Parent and the Securityholders'
Agent shall execute and deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent
instructing the Escrow Agent to release the Stipulated Amount to the Parent
Indemnitee from the Escrow Fund (to the extent of the Escrow Fund). If the
amount held in the Escrow Fund is insufficient to cover the full Stipulated
Amount, then, subject to the limitations contained in Section 10.3, each
Effective Time Holder shall pay within ten (10) Business Days following the
execution of such settlement agreement, or such shorter period of time as may
be set forth in the settlement agreement, such Effective Time Holder's
Aggregate Pro Rata Share of the amount of such deficiency to the Parent
Indemnitee.



(f)Following the Resolution Period, in the event that there is a dispute
relating to any Claim Notice or Contested Amount (whether it is a matter
between the Parent Indemnitee, on the one hand, and the Securityholders' Agent
(on behalf of the Effective Time Holders), on the other hand, or it is a
matter that is subject to a claim or Legal Proceeding asserted or commenced by
a third party brought against the Parent Indemnitee or either Acquired
Entity), such dispute (a "Claim Dispute") shall be settled pursuant to Section
11.9. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, nothing in this Section 10.5(f)
shall prevent the Parent Indemnitee from seeking preliminary injunctive relief
from a court of competent jurisdiction at any time whether pending settlement
of a Claim Dispute or otherwise. The judgment or decree of a court of a Claim
Dispute shall be deemed final when the time for appeal, if any, shall have
expired and no appeal shall have been taken or when all appeals taken shall
have been finally determined unless otherwise agreed in writing by the
parties.



(g)Subject to the Holdback Agreements, promptly after the Expiration Date,
Parent will notify the Securityholders' Agent in writing of the amount that
Parent determines in good faith to be reasonably necessary to satisfy all
claims for indemnification, compensation or reimbursement that have been
properly asserted pursuant to this Section 10.5, but not resolved, 

CONFIDENTIAL

on or prior to 11:59 p.m. (Pacific time) on the Expiration Date (each such
claim a "Continuing Claim" and such amount, the "Retained Escrow Amount"),
provided, that, the Retained Escrow Amount shall not exceed the aggregate
Contested Amounts for all such Continuing Claims. Subject to Section 10.5(i),
within ten (10) Business Days following the Expiration Date, Parent and the
Securityholders' Agent shall execute and deliver joint written instructions to
the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to release from the Escrow Fund
to the Payment Agent for prompt distribution to the Effective Time Holders (or
to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, for prompt distribution
through payroll to the Effective Time Holders in respect of Employee Options),
an amount in the aggregate equal to: (i) the amount held in the Escrow Fund as
of the Expiration Date (as reduced from time to time pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement); minus (ii) the Retained Escrow Amount, with each Effective
Time Holder to receive a portion thereof equal to the product obtained by
multiplying: (A) the amount to be so released; by (B) such Effective Time
Holder's Aggregate Pro Rata Share.



(h)Following the Expiration Date, after resolution and payment of a Continuing
Claim, Parent and the Securityholders' Agent shall, subject to Section
10.5(i), execute and deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent
instructing the Escrow Agent to release from the Escrow Fund to the Payment
Agent for distribution to the Effective Time Holders (or to Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, for prompt distribution through payroll
to the Effective Time Holders in respect of Employee Options), an amount in
the aggregate equal to: (i) the amount held in the Escrow Fund as of the date
of such resolution and payment; minus (ii) the amounts that Parent determines
in good faith to be reasonably necessary to satisfy other Continuing Claims
(which amounts shall not exceed the aggregate Contested Amounts for all such
Continuing Claims and will continue to be held in the Escrow Fund), with each
Effective Time Holder to receive a portion thereof equal to the product
obtained by multiplying: (A) the amount to be so released; by (B) such
Effective Time Holder's Aggregate Pro Rata Share.



(i)With respect to any amount to be released from the Escrow Fund to the
Effective Time Holders pursuant to this Section 10.5 or the Escrow Agreement:



(i)if (A) any former holder of the Outstanding Capital Stock has not executed
and delivered a properly completed Letter of Transmittal and surrendered such
former holder's Company Stock Certificate, if any, or electronic transfer of
Company Book Entry Shares, to the Payment Agent in accordance with Section
1.8(b), to the extent applicable, (B) any former holder of the Outstanding
Warrants has not executed and delivered a properly completed Letter of
Transmittal to the Payment Agent and the Warrant Surrender Agreement to
Parent, and (C) any former holder of the Outstanding In-the-Money Vested
Options has not executed and delivered to Parent a properly completed Option
Conversion Agreement, ((A), (B) and (C), collectively, the "Payment
Conditions") prior to the delivery to the Escrow Agent of the applicable joint
written instructions, then any amount that would otherwise be released to such
Effective Time Holder shall be held by the Payment Agent or Parent, as
applicable, with interest that may have accrued, until such holder satisfies
all of such Effective Time Holder's applicable Payment Conditions; 

CONFIDENTIAL

(ii)for purposes of Sections 1.5(a)(ii), 1.6(a) and 1.6(d) only, amounts to be
released from the Escrow Fund to be distributed to each Effective Time Holder
shall be deemed to be the product of: (A) the aggregate amount to be released
from the Escrow Fund to the Effective Time Holders; multiplied by (B) each
Effective Time Holder's Aggregate Pro Rata Share (it being understood that the
amounts referred to in this clause "(ii)" have been taken into account in
determining each Effective Time Holder's Aggregate Pro Rata Share and that no
Effective Time Holder shall receive more than such Effective Time Holder's
Aggregate Pro Rata Share of any amount released from the Escrow Fund);



(iii)each distribution to be made from the Escrow Fund to a particular
Effective Time Holder shall be effected (A) in accordance with the payment
delivery instructions set forth in such Effective Time Holder's Letter of
Transmittal, with respect to amounts to be distributed in respect of such
Effective Time Holder's Outstanding Capital Stock or Company Warrants, if any
or (B) through the payroll services of the applicable Acquired Entity or
Parent, with respect to amounts to be distributed in respect of such Effective
Time Holder's Employee Options, if any.



(iv)all written instructions to be delivered to the Escrow Agent with respect
to any distribution from the Escrow Fund shall be consistent with this Section
10.5(i).



10.6Defense of Third Party Claims. In the event of the assertion or
commencement by any Person of any claim or Legal Proceeding (whether against
the Surviving Corporation, any Acquired Entity, Parent or any other Person)
with respect to which Parent in good faith believes that any Effective Time
Holder may become obligated to hold harmless, indemnify, compensate or
reimburse any Parent Indemnitee pursuant to Section 10.2(a), Parent shall have
the right, at its election, to proceed with the defense of such claim or Legal
Proceeding on its own with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Securityholders' Agent. If Parent so proceeds with the defense of any such
claim or Legal Proceeding:



(a)subject to the other provisions of Section 10, all reasonable expenses
relating to the defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding (and all amounts due
pursuant to any settlement, adjustment or compromise of such claim or Legal
Proceeding) shall be borne and paid exclusively by the Effective Time Holders
to the extent such expenses or Damages are indemnifiable pursuant to Section
10.2(a)(ix);



(b)each Effective Time Holder shall make available to Parent any documents and
materials in such Effective Time Holder's possession or control that may be
necessary to the defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding; and



(c)Parent shall have the right to settle, adjust or compromise such claim or
Legal Proceeding without the consent of the Securityholders' Agent; provided,
however, that if Parent settles, adjusts or compromises any such claim or
Legal Proceeding without the consent of the Securityholders' Agent, then such
settlement, adjustment or compromise shall not be conclusive evidence of the
amount of Damages incurred by the Parent Indemnitee in connection 

CONFIDENTIAL

with such claim or Legal Proceeding. The Securityholders' Agent shall have the
right to receive copies of all pleadings, notices and communications with
respect to the Legal Proceeding to the extent that receipt of such documents
does not affect any privilege relating to Parent or any Parent Indemnitee and
subject to execution by the Securityholders' Agent of Parent's standard non-
disclosure agreement to the extent that such materials contain confidential or
proprietary information, which such non-disclosure agreement shall not
prohibit the Securityholders' Agent from communicating any such information
solely with the members of the advisory board who have been designated to act
on behalf of the Effective Time Holders pursuant to an engagement letter with
the Securityholders' Agent and who have a need to know such information,
provided that any such recipients are subject to confidentiality obligations
with respect thereto. The Securityholders' Agent, at the Effective Time
Holders' cost and expense, shall be entitled to participate in the defense of
any such Legal Proceedings that relates to Taxes of the Acquired Companies for
Pre-Closing Tax Periods if the resolution of such Legal Proceeding would
reasonably be expected to materially increase the Effective Time Holders'
liability for Pre-Closing Taxes under Section 10.2(a).



If Parent does not elect to proceed with the defense of any such claim or
Legal Proceeding, the Securityholders' Agent may proceed with the defense of
such claim or Legal Proceeding with counsel reasonably satisfactory to Parent;
provided, however, that the Securityholders' Agent may not settle, adjust or
compromise any such claim or Legal Proceeding without the prior written
consent of Parent (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).
Parent shall give the Securityholders' Agent prompt notice of the commencement
of any such Legal Proceeding against Parent, Merger Sub or the Company;
provided, however, that any failure on the part of Parent to so notify the
Securityholders' Agent shall not limit any of the obligations of the Effective
Time Holders under this Section 10 (except to the extent such failure
materially prejudices the defense of such Legal Proceeding).



10.7Exclusive Remedy. Except: (a) in the event of a claim for fraud or
intentional misrepresentation against any Person (other than any Acquired
Entity) who committed such fraud or intentional misrepresentation; and (b) for
equitable remedies, from and after the Effective Time, the rights to
indemnification, compensation and reimbursement set forth in this Section 10
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parent Indemnitees with respect
to any breach of this Agreement.



10.8Exercise of Remedies Other Than by Parent. No Parent Indemnitee (other
than Parent or any successor thereto or assign thereof) shall be permitted to
assert any indemnification claim or exercise any other remedy under this
Agreement unless Parent (or any successor thereto or assign thereof) shall
have consented to the assertion of such indemnification claim or the exercise
of such other remedy.



10.9Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments. The parties agree to report each
indemnification payment made in respect of any Damages as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price for Tax purposes unless otherwise required by applicable Legal
Requirements.







CONFIDENTIAL

11. Miscellaneous Provisions



11.1Securityholders' Agent.



(a)Appointment. By virtue of the adoption and approval of this Agreement, the
Joinder and Support Agreements, the Letters of Transmittal and the Warrant
Surrender Agreements, the Effective Time Holders irrevocably nominate,
constitute and appoint Shareholder Representative Services LLC as the agent
and true and lawful attorney-in-fact of the Effective Time Holders (the
"Securityholders' Agent"), with full power of substitution, to act in the
name, place and stead of such Persons for purposes of executing any documents
and taking any actions that the Securityholders' Agent may, in the
Securityholders' Agent's sole discretion, determine to be necessary, desirable
or appropriate in connection with this Agreement and any other agreement,
document or instrument referred to in or contemplated by this Agreement and
any transaction contemplated under this Agreement or any such other agreement,
document or instrument, including with respect to, any claim for
indemnification, compensation or reimbursement under Section 10, the Escrow
Agreement. Securityholders' Agent hereby accepts its appointment as
Securityholders' Agent.



(b)Authority. The Effective Time Holders grant to the Securityholders' Agent
full authority to execute, deliver, acknowledge, certify and file on behalf of
such Persons (in the name of any or all of such Persons or otherwise) any and
all documents that the Securityholders' Agent may, in its sole discretion,
determine to be necessary, desirable or appropriate, in such forms and
containing such provisions as the Securityholders' Agent may, in its sole
discretion, determine to be appropriate, in performing its duties as
contemplated by Section 11.1(a). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement or in any other agreement executed in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby: (i) each Parent Indemnitee shall be
entitled to deal exclusively with the Securityholders' Agent on all matters
relating to any claim for indemnification, compensation or reimbursement under
Section 10 and under the Escrow Agreement; and (ii) each Parent Indemnitee
shall be entitled to rely conclusively (without further evidence of any kind
whatsoever) on any document executed or purported to be executed on behalf of
any Effective Time Holder by the Securityholders' Agent, and on any other
action taken or purported to be taken on behalf of any such Person by the
Securityholders' Agent, as fully binding upon such Person.



(c)Power of Attorney. The Effective Time Holders recognize and intend that the
power of attorney granted in Section 11.1(a): (i) is coupled with an interest
and is irrevocable; (ii) may be delegated by the Securityholders' Agent; and
(iii) shall survive the death, incapacity, dissolution, liquidation or winding
up of each of the Effective Time Holders.



(d)Replacement. The Securityholders' Agent may resign upon twenty (20) days'
prior written notice delivered to the Effective Time Holders. If the
Securityholders' Agent shall die, resign, become disabled or otherwise be
unable to fulfill its responsibilities hereunder, the Effective Time Holders
shall (by consent of those Persons who contributed at least 50% of the Escrow
Amount to the Escrow Fund), within 10 days after such death, disability or
inability, appoint a successor to the Securityholders' Agent (who shall be an
Effective Time Holder and shall be reasonably satisfactory to Parent) and
immediately thereafter notify Parent of the identity of such successor. Any
such successor shall succeed the Securityholders' Agent as 

CONFIDENTIAL

Securityholders' Agent hereunder. If for any reason there is no
Securityholders' Agent at any time, all references herein to the
Securityholders' Agent shall be deemed to refer to the Effective Time Holders.



(e)Securityholders' Agent Expense Fund. Each Effective Time Holder hereby
authorizes the Parent to withhold, or cause to be withheld, an aggregate
amount of $250,000 (the "Securityholders' Agent Expense Fund Amount") from the
amounts otherwise payable by or on behalf of Parent to the Effective Time
Holder pursuant to Sections 1.5(a), 1.6(a) and 1.6(d) and distribute, or cause
to be distributed, to the Securityholders' Agent an amount equal to each
Effective Time Holder's Aggregate Pro Rata Share of the Securityholders' Agent
Expense Fund Amount (the "Securityholders' Agent Expense Fund"). The
Securityholders' Agent Expense Fund shall be held by the Securityholders'
Agent in a segregated client account and shall be used for the purposes of
paying directly or reimbursing the Securityholders' Agent for any expenses of
the Securityholders' Agent incurred pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement or any agreements ancillary to the foregoing or any engagement
letter between certain of the Effective Time Holders and the Securityholders'
Agent. The Securityholders' Agent is not providing any investment supervision,
recommendations or advice and shall have no responsibility or liability to the
Effective Time Holders for any loss of principal of the Securityholders' Agent
Expense Fund Amount other than as a result of its gross negligence or willful
misconduct. The Securityholders' Agent is not acting as a withholding agent or
in any similar capacity in connection with the Securityholders' Agent Expense
Fund, and has no tax reporting or income distribution obligations to the
Effective Time Holders. The Effective Time Holders will not receive any
interest or earnings on the amounts held in the Securityholders' Agent Expense
Fund and irrevocably transfer and assign to the Securityholders' Agent any
ownership right that they may otherwise have had in such interest or earnings.
As soon as reasonably determined by the Securityholders' Agent that the
amounts held in the Securityholders' Agent Expense Fund are no longer required
to be withheld, the Securityholders' Agent shall distribute any amounts
remaining in the Securityholders' Agent Expense Fund (the "Securityholders'
Agent Expense Fund Balance") to the Payment Agent for further distribution to
each Effective Time Holder an amount in cash equal to the Securityholders'
Agent Expense Fund Balance multiplied by such Effective Time Holder's
Aggregate Pro Rata Share. For tax purposes, the Securityholders' Agent Expense
Fund will be treated as having been received and voluntarily set aside by the
Effective Time Holders at the time of Closing.



(f)Exculpation/Indemnification of Securityholders' Agent. The Securityholders'
Agent will incur no liability of any kind with respect to any action or
omission by the Securityholders' Agent in connection with the Securityholders'
Agent's services pursuant to this Agreement and any agreements ancillary
hereto, except in the event of liability directly resulting from the
Securityholders' Agent's fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct. The
Securityholders' Agent shall not be liable for any action or omission pursuant
to the advice of counsel. The Effective Time Holders will, severally and not
jointly, in accordance with the Aggregate Pro Rata Share of each Effective
Time Holder, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Securityholders' Agent
from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, claims, penalties,
fines, forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and expenses (including the fees and
expenses of counsel and experts and their staffs and all expense of document
location, duplication and shipment) (collectively, "Representative Losses")
arising out of or in connection with the Securityholders' Agent's execution
and performance of this Agreement and any agreements 

CONFIDENTIAL

ancillary hereto, in each case as such Representative Loss is suffered or
incurred; provided, that, in the event that any such Representative Loss is
finally adjudicated to have been directly caused by fraud, gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the Securityholders' Agent, the Securityholders' Agent
will reimburse the Effective Time Holders the amount of such indemnified
Representative Loss to the extent attributable to such gross negligence or
willful misconduct. If not paid directly to the Securityholders' Agent by the
Effective Time Holders, any such Representative Losses may be recovered by the
Securityholders' Agent from (i) the funds in the Securityholders' Agent
Expense Fund and (ii) any other funds that become payable to the Effective
Time Holders under this Agreement at such time as such amounts would otherwise
be distributable to the Effective Time Holders; provided, that, while this
Section 11.1(f) allows the Securityholders' Agent to be paid from the
aforementioned sources of funds, this does not relieve the Effective Time
Holders from their obligation to promptly pay such Representative Losses as
they are suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent the Securityholders' Agent
from seeking any remedies available to it at law or otherwise. In no event
will the Securityholders' Agent be required to advance its own funds on behalf
of the Effective Time Holders or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything in this

or other Legal Proceeding based upon fraud or intentional misrepresentation)

court located in the County of San Francisco, State of California. Each party
to this Agreement: (i) expressly and irrevocably consents and submits to the

Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or
remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege
or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other
power, right, privilege or remedy. No Person shall be deemed to have waived

remedy under this Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim, power, right,
privilege or remedy is expressly set forth in a written instrument duly
executed and delivered on behalf of such Person; and any such waiver shall not

invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable, shall not be impaired or otherwise
affected and shall continue to be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent
permitted by law.



11.16Confidential Nature of Information. Each party agrees that all documents,
materials, data and other information which it shall have obtained regarding
the other parties hereto during the course of the negotiations leading to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (whether obtained before
or after the date of this Agreement), the investigation provided for herein
and the preparation of this Agreement and other related documents shall be
deemed "Confidential Information" under the Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement
dated July 20, 2020 between the Company and Parent (the "Confidentiality
Agreement") and subject to the terms thereof; provided, however, that after
the Effective Time, Parent and the Company may use or disclose any
confidential information related to any Acquired Entity or its assets or
business. The Securityholders' Agent shall keep all Confidential Information
confidential; provided, that, notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in
this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement to the contrary, following
Closing, the Securityholders' Agent shall be permitted to disclose information
as required by applicable Legal Requirements or to employees, advisors, agents
or consultants of the Securityholders' Agent and 

CONFIDENTIAL

to the members of the advisory board who have been designated to act on behalf
of the Effective Time Holders pursuant to an engagement letter with the

obligations with respect thereto.

Merger Sub, Securityholders' Agent, or any Acquired Entity (and none of their
respective Affiliates) shall, without the approval of Parent and the Company,
make any press release or other public announcement concerning the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except as and to the extent that
any party shall be so obligated by Legal Requirements or the laws of any stock
exchange upon which the securities of such Person are listed, in which case
such party shall first advise each other party thereof and the parties shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause a mutually agreeable release or
announcement to be issued; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not
preclude communications or disclosures necessary to implement the provisions
of this Agreement. Following the Effective Time, neither the Securityholders'
Agent nor any of its Affiliates shall make any press release or other public
announcement concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
except as and to the extent that such party shall be so obligated by Legal
Requirements, in which case such party shall advise Parent thereof (to the
extent legally permissible) and the parties shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause a mutually agreeable release or announcement to be issued.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement to
the contrary, following Closing and after the public announcement of the
Merger, each external Representative of the Company and Parent, including the
Securityholders' Agent, shall be permitted to publicly announce that it has
been engaged in connection herewith as long as such announcement does not
disclose any of the other terms hereof that have not been made public through
a press release issued by Parent. Notwithstanding anything else to the
contrary contained herein, nothing shall prevent an Effective Time Holder that
is a venture capital fund (or its representatives), from communicating to its
current or potential investors the existence and terms of this Agreement,
including the amount of the Merger Consideration, the Escrow Fund or the
Securityholders' Agent Expense Fund, but only to the extent (a) such
communications are to current or potential investors and (i) relate to the
economic returns on investment, (ii) are permitted under the terms of such
Effective Time Holder's governing fund documents in effect as of the date of
this Agreement and (iii) are made in connection with such Effective Time
Holder's or its Representative's fundraising and reporting activities (on such
Effective Time Holder's behalf) required as part of its ordinary course of
business and consistent with past practices and (b) such current or potential
investors are subject to obligations of confidentiality.



11.18Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the other agreements referred to
herein set forth the entire understanding of the parties hereto relating to
the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings among or between any of the parties relating to the subject
matter hereof and thereof. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that,
effective as of the Effective Time, the Confidentiality Agreement is hereby
terminated and shall be null and void and of no force or effect. 

CONFIDENTIAL

11.19Disclosure Schedule. The Disclosure Schedule shall be arranged in
separate parts corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections and
subsections contained in this Agreement, and the information disclosed in any
numbered or lettered part shall be deemed to relate to and to qualify only the
particular representation or warranty of the Company set forth in the
corresponding numbered or lettered section or subsection of this Agreement,
except to the extent that (a) such information is explicitly cross-referenced
in another part of the Disclosure Schedule or (b) it is reasonably apparent on
the face of the disclosure that such information qualifies another
representation and warranty of the Company in this Agreement.

the singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa; the masculine
gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine gender
shall include the masculine and neuter genders; and the neuter gender shall

(b)Ambiguities. The parties hereto agree that any rule of construction to the
effect that ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party shall
not be applied in the construction or interpretation of this Agreement.



(c)Interpretation. As used in this Agreement: (i) the words "include" and
"including," and variations thereof, shall not be deemed to be terms of
limitation, but rather shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation"; and (ii) the use of the word "or" shall not be exclusive.



(d)References. Except as otherwise indicated, all references in this Agreement
to "Sections," "Parts," "Schedules" and "Exhibits" are intended to refer to
Sections of this Agreement and Schedules and Exhibits to this Agreement. All
references to an Acquired Entity in this Agreement shall include references to
any Person that merged with and into or liquidated into such Acquired Entity,
or for whose Liabilities (including Taxes) such Acquired Entity is or could be
held liable, as applicable.



11.21Waiver of Conflicts; Privilege.



(a)Each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that Goodwin has acted as counsel
to the Acquired Entities and the Securityholders' Agent in connection with the
negotiation of this Agreement and consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.



(b)Parent hereby consents and agrees to, and agrees to cause the Acquired
Entities to consent and agree to, Goodwin representing the Securityholders'
Agent and/or any of the Effective Time Holders (collectively, the "Seller
Parties") after the Closing in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including with respect to disputes in which the interests
of the Seller Parties may be directly adverse to Parent and its Affiliates
(including Parent and the Acquired Entities), and even though Goodwin may have
represented the Acquired Entities in a matter substantially related to any
such dispute, or may be handling ongoing matters for the Acquired Entities.
Parent further consents and agrees to, and agrees to cause the Acquired
Entities to consent and agree to, the communication by Goodwin to the Seller 

CONFIDENTIAL

Parties in connection with any such representation of any fact known to
Goodwin arising by reason of Goodwin's prior representation of the Acquired
Entities.



(c)In connection with the foregoing, Parent hereby irrevocably waives and
agrees not to assert, and agrees to cause the Acquired Entities to irrevocably
waive and not to assert, any conflict of interest arising from or in
connection with (i) Goodwin's prior representation of the Acquired Entities
and (ii) Goodwin's representation of the Seller Parties prior to and after the
Closing.



(d)Parent further agrees, on behalf of itself and, after the Closing, on
behalf of the Acquired Entities, that all communications in any form or format
whatsoever between or among any of Goodwin, the Acquired Entities, any of the
Seller Parties, or any of their respective directors, officers employees or
other Representatives that relate in any way to the negotiation, documentation
and consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
dispute arising under this Agreement (collectively, the "Deal Communications")
shall be deemed to be retained and owned collectively by the Effective Time
Holder, shall be controlled by the Securityholders' Agent on behalf of the
Effective Time Holder and shall not pass to or be claimed by Parent, the
Acquired Entities. All Deal Communications that are attorney-client privileged
(the "Privileged Deal Communications") shall remain privileged after the
Closing and the privilege and the expectation of client confidence relating
thereto shall belong solely to the Securityholders' Agent and the Effective
Time Holders, shall be controlled by the Securityholders' Agent on behalf of
the Effective Time Holders and shall not pass to or be claimed by Parent or
the Acquired Entities.



(e)Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between
Parent or the Acquired Entities, on the one hand, and a third party other than
the Securityholders' Agent or an Effective Time Holder, on the other hand,
Parent and the Acquired Entities may assert the attorney-client privilege to
prevent the disclosure of the Privileged Deal Communications to such third
party. In the event that Parent or the Acquired Entities is legally required
by governmental order or otherwise to access or obtain a copy of all or a
portion of the Deal Communications, Parent shall immediately (and, in any
event, within two (2) Business Days) notify the Securityholders' Agent in
writing (including by making specific reference to this Section 11.21(e)) so
that the Securityholders' Agent can seek a protective order and Parent agrees
to use commercially reasonable efforts, at the Securityholders' Agent's sole
cost and expense, to assist therewith.



(f)To the extent that files or other materials maintained by Goodwin
constitute property of its clients, only the Securityholders' Agent and the
Effective Time Holders shall hold such property rights and Goodwin shall have
no duty to reveal or disclose any such files or other materials or any Deal
Communications by reason of any attorney-client relationship between Goodwin,
on the one hand, and the Acquired Entities, on the other hand, so long as such
Deal Communications would be subject to a privilege or protection if they were
being requested in a claim by an unrelated third party; provided, that, in no
event shall such Deal Communications (whether or not subject to a privilege or
protection) be used against any of the Seller Parties in the context of an
indemnification claim brought against such Seller Parties). 

CONFIDENTIAL

(g)Parent agrees that it will not, and that it will cause the Acquired
Entities not to, (i) access or use the Deal Communications, including by way
of review of any electronic data, communications or other information, or by
seeking to have the Securityholders' Agent or any Effective Time Holder waive
the attorney-client or other privilege, or by otherwise asserting that Parent
or the Acquired Entities has the right to waive the attorney-client or other
privilege, or (ii) seek to obtain the Deal Communications from Goodwin, so
long as such Deal Communications would be subject to a privilege or protection
if they were being requested in a claim by an unrelated third party; provided,
that, in no event shall such Deal Communications (whether or not subject to a
privilege or protection) be used against any of the Seller Parties in the
context of an indemnification claim brought against such Seller Parties).



11.22Independent Investigation; Non-Reliance.



(a)Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that (i) they are exclusively
relying on the representations of the Company set forth in Section 2 and in
the Company Closing Certificate, (ii) they have conducted their own
examination and investigation of the Company and (iii) that they are not
relying on any other statements or documents.



(b)Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that (i) none of the Company or
any other Person shall have or be subject to any Liability to Parent or any
other Person resulting from the distribution to Parent, or Parent's use of any
information, documents, materials, projections, estimates, or budgets
delivered to or made available to Parent and/or Merger Sub of future revenues,
future results of operations (or any component thereof), future cash flows, or
future financial condition (or any component thereof) of the Surviving
Corporation or the future business and operations of the Surviving
Corporation.



(c)Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing in this Section
11.22 is intended to preclude a claim based on fraud or intentional
misrepresentation.
