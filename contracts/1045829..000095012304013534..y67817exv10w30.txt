Purchase Price. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
aggregate purchase price to be paid by Purchaser to Seller for the purchase
of the Assets shall be One Hundred Million Three Hundred Thousand Dollars
($100,300,000) (the "Purchase Price"), plus or minus (a) the amount of Net
Working Capital (as defined below) on the Closing Date, minus (b) the
amount of Seller\'s capital lease obligations with respect to the Hospitals
on the Closing Date, if any, that are assumed by Purchaser pursuant to
Section 1.11 of this Agreement (the "Assumed Capital Lease Obligations"),
minus (c) the product of the Usage Percentage and the Sick Pay Amount on the
Closing Date (the sum of (a), (b) and (c) being referred to for purposes of
this Agreement as the "Cash Purchase Price"). The payment of the Cash
Purchase Price at Closing shall be governed by Section 1.7.   For purposes
of this Agreement, "Net Working Capital," as of any date, shall be defined as
an amount equal to the difference between the (i) current assets of Seller
with respect to the operation of the Hospitals, which for purposes of this
calculation shall include only (A) the value of the Prepaids, (B) the value
of the Inventory and (C) other current assets associated with the Hospitals
to the extent they have value and are reflected on the Financial Statements,
and (ii) the current liabilities of Seller which are payable to third parties
with respect to the operation of the Hospitals, which for purposes of this
calculation shall only include (A) Accounts Payable (excluding
credit balances of patient accounts receivable to the extent included
therein), but only to the extent it is anticipated that Purchaser will be
required to fund the payment of such Accounts Payable after the Effective
Time (for example, if Seller has keyed in, or expects to key in as of the
Closing, certain portions of the Accounts Payable for payment by Seller after
the Closing, such portion of the Accounts Payable would not be included in
the calculation of Net Working Capital), (B) Accrued Expenses, (C) Accrued
Payroll, (D) Accrued Paid Time Off and   5   (E) Other Current
Liabilities (as such terms are utilized on the Interim Balance Sheets and the
Final Balance Sheets). For purposes of this Agreement, "Usage Percentage"
shall be defined as the percentage set forth on Schedule 1.2-a. For purposes
of this Agreement, "Sick Pay Amount" shall be defined as the amount
of extended sick pay (Reserve Sick) obligations of Seller and/or its
affiliates to the Hired Employees.   At least seven (7) calendar days but
no more than fifteen (15) calendar days prior to the Closing Date, Seller
shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser the latest available unaudited balance
sheets of Seller (as of the end of a calendar month) with respect to the
operation of the Hospitals (the "Interim Balance Sheets"). The Interim
Balance Sheets shall (I) be prepared in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles consistently applied ("GAAP") to the extent described
in, and qualified by, Section 2.10, (II) include a calculation of Net Working
Capital, the Assumed Capital Lease Obligations and the Sick Pay Amount and
(III) be attached hereto as Schedule 1.2-b. The amounts set forth in the
Interim Balance Sheets shall be subject to adjustment as provided in Sections
1.3 and 1.4 below.   1.3 Inventory. Seller shall cause an inventory to be
taken of the Inventory by employees or representatives of Seller or its
affiliates, with said inventory to be taken in accordance with Seller\'s
policies and procedures and the policies and procedures used in connection
with determining inventory for purposes of preparing the Unaudited
Financials, as near in time as possible (but in no event more than ten days
prior) to the Closing Date and with the results extended and adjusted through
the Closing Date. Seller shall permit representatives or employees of
Purchaser to observe such inventory process. During the course of the
inventory process, Purchaser shall be permitted to designate which specific
items of inventory are, using Purchaser\'s reasonable discretion, not useable
by Purchaser in the operation of the Hospitals after the Effective Time (the
"Non-Useable Inventory"). The cost of conducting the inventory shall be borne
by Seller. All inventory items that are not obsolete and that are not among
the Non-Useable Inventory shall be valued at the lesser of cost or current
market value. The parties acknowledge that the inventory to be taken pursuant
to this Section 1.3 will not be conducted until immediately prior to the
Closing Date and, as such, the results of such inventory will not be
available until some time after the Closing Date. Accordingly, the
parties agree that for purposes of the Interim Balance Sheets, Net Working
Capital shall include the book value of the Inventory with respect to the
operation of the Hospitals as reflected by the latest available unaudited
balance sheets of Seller. For purposes of the Final Balance Sheets, the
portion of Net Working Capital attributable to the Inventory shall be the
value of the Inventory as determined pursuant to this Section 1.3.   1.4
Post-Closing Adjustment to Purchase Price. Within one hundred twenty (120)
calendar days after the Closing Date, the final unaudited balance sheets of
the Hospitals as of the Closing Date (the "Final Balance Sheets"),
which shall include a calculation of Net Working Capital as of the Closing
Date, the Assumed Capital Lease Obligations and the Sick Pay Amount, shall be
prepared by Seller and delivered to Purchaser. Purchaser, in connection with
its review of the Final Balance Sheets, shall be permitted to review work
papers of Seller or its accountants with respect to the preparation of the
Final Balance Sheets and the books and records of Seller reasonably related
thereto. The Interim Balance Sheets and the Final Balance Sheets shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with the terms of Section 2.10. If Purchaser
disputes any entry on the Final Balance Sheets that affects the calculation
of Net Working   6   Capital, the Assumed Capital Lease Obligations or
the Sick Pay Amount, Purchaser shall notify Seller in writing (which writing
shall contain Purchaser\'s determination of the amount of the disputed entry)
within forty-five (45) calendar days after Purchaser\'s receipt of the Final
Balance Sheets from Seller. If Purchaser and Seller cannot resolve such
dispute within thirty (30) business days after Purchaser notifies Seller in
writing of such dispute, then PricewaterhouseCoopers, independent certified
public accountants (the "Independent Auditor"), shall review the matter in
dispute and, solely as to disputes relating to accounting issues and acting
as an expert and not as an arbitrator, shall promptly decide the proper
amounts of such disputed entries (which decision shall also include a final
recalculation of the Cash Purchase Price). In the event that all or a portion
of the dispute at issue involves a legal issue or an interpretation of this
Agreement, such legal or interpretative dispute shall first be subject to
adjudication by a court or similar tribunal, with any necessary review by the
Independent Auditor under this Section 1.4 occurring following the resolution
of such legal dispute. Such decision of the Independent Auditor shall be
conclusive and binding as between Purchaser and Seller, and the costs of such
review shall be borne by both Seller and Purchaser in proportion to the
relevant amount each party\'s determination has been modified.   Within
fifty (50) calendar days after Purchaser\'s receipt of the Final Balance
Sheets from Seller or, if disputed by Purchaser, within five (5) business
days after the earlier of (a) the date Purchaser and Seller finally resolve
such dispute and recalculate the Cash Purchase Price accordingly, or (b) the
date of receipt of a decision from the Independent Auditor (the "Post-Closing
Adjustment Date"), either (i) Seller shall pay Purchaser in cash or in other
immediately available funds the amount of any decrease in the Cash Purchase
Price, or (ii) Purchaser shall pay Seller in cash or in other immediately
available funds the amount of any increase in the Cash Purchase Price.  
1.5 Closing Date. The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place at 9:00 a.m. on December 31, 2004,
at the offices of McDermott Will and Emery LLP, 2049 Century Park East, Suite
3400, Los Angeles, California 90067 or such other date, time and place as the

FAULTS AND NONCOMPLIANCE WITH LAWS" WITH NO WARRANTY OF HABITABILITY OR
FITNESS FOR HABITATION, with respect to the Real Property, land, buildings
and improvements, and WITH NO WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, with
respect to the physical condition of the Personal Property and Inventory, any
and all of which warranties (both express and implied) Seller hereby
disclaims. All of the foregoing real and personal property shall be further
subject to normal wear and tear on the land, buildings, improvements
and equipment and normal and customary use of the inventory and supplies in
the ordinary course of business up to the Effective Time.   1.14 Risk of

covering the Assets, Personal Property, Owned Real Property, the Hospitals
and all other property through the Effective Time.   (a) With respect to the
Hospitals (including the Real Property and other Assets related thereto), if
prior to the Closing, all or any part of one or more Hospital is destroyed or
damaged by fire or the elements or by any other cause where the cost to
repair, restore and/or replace such damage or destruction is in the aggregate
(the "Aggregate Damage") less than or equal to twenty percent (20%) of the
Purchase Price, the parties\' duties and obligations under this Agreement
shall not be affected and, subject to the conditions precedent to Closing set
forth in Articles 6 and 7, the Closing shall proceed as scheduled; provided,
however, Seller shall assign, transfer and set over to Purchaser all of
Seller\'s right, title and interest in and to any insurance proceeds on
account of such damage or destruction and, if such insurance policy proceeds
are insufficient to repair, restore and/or replace the Hospital(s) or other
affected Assets, the difference between the cost to repair, restore
and/or replace and the amount of such proceeds shall be deducted from the
Cash Purchase Price. If prior to the Closing, all or any part of one or more
Hospital is destroyed or damaged by fire or the elements or by any other
cause where the Aggregate Damage exceeds twenty percent (20%) of the Purchase
Price, Seller shall promptly notify Purchaser in writing of the occurrence of
such damage or destruction and Purchaser may elect to (i) purchase such
Hospitals, or take assignment of such Leased Real Property, and, subject to
the conditions precedent to Closing set forth in Articles 6 and 7, the
Closing shall proceed as scheduled (provided, however, at the Closing Seller
shall assign, transfer and set over to Purchaser all of Seller\'s right,
title and interest in and to any insurance proceeds on account of such damage
or destruction loss and, if such insurance policy proceeds are insufficient
to repair, restore and/or replace the Hospital(s) or other affected Assets,
the difference between the cost to repair, restore and/or replace and the
amount of such proceeds shall be deducted from the Cash Purchase Price) or
(ii) terminate this Agreement by written notice to Seller no later than the
date which is seven (7) calendar days after the date (A) Seller notifies
Purchaser in writing of the occurrence of such damage or destruction and (B)
Seller and Purchaser agree in writing upon the amount of the Aggregate Damage
(the "Casualty Termination Notice"); provided, however, that in no event
shall the Casualty Termination Notice be provided after the
Closing, provided, however, further (but subject to the last sentence of this
Section 1.14(a)) that the Closing shall be delayed until Purchaser is given
the opportunity to give the Casualty Termination Notice. In no event shall
any such delay in the Closing affect or otherwise change the Termination Date
set forth in Section 8.1(g). If Purchaser and Seller are unable to agree upon
the amount of the Aggregate Damage, the amount of the Aggregate Damage shall
be determined by Centex Rodgers (the "Independent Consultant") pursuant to
Section 1.14(c) and Purchaser\'s right to provide a Casualty Termination
Notice, if any, shall be pursuant to Section 1.14(c) (and not this Section
1.14(a)).   (b) If prior to the Closing, all or any part of a parcel of the
Real Property is made subject to an eminent domain proceeding which would
in Purchaser\'s reasonable judgment materially adversely impair access to the
Real Property or be materially adverse to the operation of the Hospitals,
Purchaser may elect to (i) purchase such affected Owned Real Property, or
take assignment of such Leased Real Property, and the Closing shall proceed
as scheduled (provided, however, at the Closing Seller shall assign, transfer
and set over to Purchaser all of Seller\'s right, title and interest in and
to any award in such eminent domain proceeding) or (ii) not purchase the
affected Owned Real Property, or not take assignment of such Leased Real
Property, and, in such   19   event, an appropriate adjustment to the
Cash Purchase Price shall be made by Purchaser and Seller. If Purchaser and
Seller are unable to agree upon the amount of the adjustment described in
subsection (ii) of the preceding sentence, the adjustment shall be resolved
by the Independent Consultant pursuant to Section 1.14(c).   (c) If on and
after the date which is fifteen (15) calendar days after the initial
occurrence described in either Section 1.14(a) or Section 1.14(b), Purchaser
and Seller are unable to agree to a resolution of the applicable matter (as
described in the last sentence of Section 1.14(a) or the last sentence of
Section 1.14(b)), either Seller or Purchaser shall have the right, by
providing written notice to the other, to invoke the following
process described in this Section 1.14(c) in order to resolve the applicable
dispute (the "Independent Consultant Process Notice"): Within fifteen (15)
calendar days after Seller\'s or Purchaser\'s receipt of the Independent
Consultant Process Notice (the "Submittal Date"), each party shall submit to
the other party and to the Independent Consultant its proposed Aggregate
Damage (and any applicable Cash Purchase Price adjustment) as a result of the
event(s) contemplated by either Section 1.14(a) or 1.14(b), along with a
detailed description of the basis for such amount and any applicable
adjustment. Within ten (10) calendar days after the Submittal Date (the
"Decision Date"), the Independent Consultant, acting as an expert and not as
an arbitrator, shall select either the Aggregate Damage (and any applicable
Cash Purchase Price adjustment) proposal of Seller or the Aggregate Damage
(and any applicable Cash Purchase Price adjustment) proposal of Purchaser as
the definitive amount of the Aggregate Damage (and any applicable adjustment
to the Cash Purchase Price). If the Aggregate Damage as determined by the
Independent Consultant exceeds twenty percent (20%) of the Purchase Price,
Purchaser shall have the right to terminate this Agreement by delivery of a
Casualty Termination Notice to Seller (provided that such
Casualty Termination Notice is provided no later than seven (7) calendar days
after the Decision Date). If either Purchaser or Seller fails to timely
provide its proposed Aggregate Damage (and any applicable Cash Purchase Price
adjustment) to the Independent Consultant, the Aggregate Damage (and any
applicable Cash Purchase Price adjustment) shall be the amount proposed by
the submitting party provided that the Aggregate Damage exceeds twenty
percent (20%) of the Purchase Price, Purchaser shall within seven (7)
calendar days after the Submittal Date have the right to provide a Casualty
Termination Notice and terminate this Agreement. If neither party submits its
proposed Aggregate Damage (and any applicable Cash Purchase Price adjustment)
to the Independent Consultant, no adjustment to the Cash Purchase Price shall
be made and Purchaser shall not have the right to provide a Casualty
Termination Notice. The decision of the Independent Consultant shall be
conclusive and binding as between Purchaser and Seller, and the costs of such
review shall be borne by the party whose proposed Aggregate Damage (and any
applicable Cash Purchase Price adjustment) is not selected by the Independent
Consultant. Upon any such determination of the adjustment to the Cash
Purchase Price in accordance with this Section 1.14, the parties shall,
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement at a mutually agreeable time
and place, in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. If pursuant
to either Section 1.14(a) or 1.14(b), the amount of the Aggregate Damage (and
any applicable Cash Purchase Price adjustment) is to be determined by
the Independent Consultant and either the Submittal Date or the Decision Date
falls on a day which is on or after the Termination Date, the parties
acknowledge and agree that any such event shall not affect the Termination
Date set forth in Section 8.1(g).   20    ARTICLE 2   REPRESENTATIONS

Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
each Seller jointly and severally hereby represents, warrants and covenants

and is the valid and binding obligation of Seller and, to the knowledge of
Seller, of each other party thereto, except where a failure of the Material

material, individually or in the aggregate, to the operation of the
Hospitals. No provision of this Section 2.4(c) shall apply to any failure to

of trust, Material Lease, Material Contract, or any material order, judgment
or decree which (a) requires the consent of another to the execution of
this Agreement or (b) requires the consent of another to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The consummation of the

Agreement, or would result in the creation of any Lien or liability on any

on Schedule 3.7, there are no claims, proceedings or investigations pending
or, to the best knowledge of Purchaser, threatened relating to or affecting
Purchaser or any affiliate of Purchaser before any court or governmental body

the transactions contemplated hereby. Neither Purchaser nor any affiliate of
Purchaser is subject to any judgment, order, decree or other governmental

Purchaser\'s ability to disclose the tax treatment or tax structure of, and
such advisor\'s tax strategies with respect to, the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.   3.9 Ability to Perform. Purchaser has the ability to
obtain funds in cash in amounts equal to the Cash Purchase Price by means of

consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   3.10

result of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For
purposes hereof, the term "solvency" means that: (a) the fair salable
value of Purchaser\'s tangible assets is in excess of the total amount of
its liabilities (including for purposes of this definition all liabilities,
whether or not reflected on a balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP,
and whether direct or indirect, fixed or contingent, secured or unsecured,
and disputed or undisputed); (b) Purchaser is able to pay its debts or
obligations in the ordinary course as they mature; and (c) Purchaser has

Person or for any other reason.   ARTICLE 4   COVENANTS OF SELLER   4.1
Access and Information; Inspections. From the Effective Date through the
Effective Time, Seller shall afford to the officers and agents of
Purchaser (which shall include accountants, attorneys, bankers and other
consultants and agents of Purchaser) full and complete access during normal
business hours to and the right to inspect the plants, properties, books,
accounts, records and all other relevant documents and information with
respect to the assets, liabilities and business of the Hospitals. From the
Effective Date through the Effective Time, Seller shall furnish Purchaser
with such additional financial and operating data and other information in
Seller\'s possession as to businesses and properties of the Hospitals as
Purchaser or its representatives may from time to time reasonably request,
without regard to where such information may be located. Purchaser\'s right
of access and inspection shall be exercised in such a manner as not to
interfere unreasonably with the operations of the Hospitals. Such access may
include consultations with the personnel of Seller and consultations and/or
contact with physicians on the medical staff at any of the Hospitals;
provided, however, that before Purchaser consults with and/or meets any of
the physicians on the medical staff at any of the Hospitals (other than Dr.
Baltej S. Maini, the chief executive officer of the Fallon Clinic),
(a) Purchaser shall provide Seller with written notice thereof at least two
(2) business days prior to any such meeting (which notice shall include the
identity of such physicians and the date and time of the meeting(s); provided
(i) Purchaser\'s notice pursuant to this clause (a) may be an electronic mail
to Paul O\'Neill at his electronic mail address of
paul.o\'neill@tenethealth.com, with a concurrent copy by electronic mail to
J. Brent McDonald at his electronic mail address of
brent.mcdonald@tenethealth.com and (ii) that Purchaser shall not be in breach
of this Section 4.1 if during such meeting(s) Purchaser meets with additional
physicians not originally specified in a notice to Seller as long
as Purchaser promptly thereafter provides Seller with a written notice which
sets forth the identity of such additional physicians) and (b) Seller shall
have the opportunity to be present at any such meetings. Further, Purchaser
may, at its sole cost and expense (except as otherwise provided in Section
12.12), undertake environmental, mechanical and structural surveys of the
Hospitals. Purchaser shall coordinate its access and inspection activities
contemplated by this Section 4.1 through Paul O\'Neill or his designee.  
4.2 Conduct of Business. On and after the Effective Date and prior to the
Effective Time, and except as otherwise consented to or approved by
an authorized officer of Purchaser in writing or as specifically required by
this Agreement, Seller shall, with respect to the operation of the
Hospitals:   (a) carry on its respective businesses with respect to the
operation of the Hospitals in substantially the same manner as presently
conducted and not make any material change in personnel, operations, finance,
accounting policies (unless Seller is required to adopt such  
33   changes under GAAP or Seller\'s affiliates adopt such changes on a
company-wide basis, in which event Seller shall give Purchaser prompt written
notice thereof), or real or personal property;   (b) maintain each Hospital
and all parts thereof and all other Assets in operating condition in a manner
consistent with past practices, ordinary wear and tear excepted;   (c)
perform all of its material obligations under agreements relating to or
affecting each Hospital, its respective operations or the Assets;   (d) keep
in full force and effect present insurance policies or other comparable self-

relationships with each Hospital and take such actions as are necessary and
use its reasonable efforts to cause the smooth, efficient and successful
transition of business operations and employee relations to the Purchaser as
of the Effective Time.   4.3 Negative Covenants. From the Effective Date
until the Effective Time, with respect to the operation of the Hospitals,
Seller shall not, without the prior written consent of Purchaser or except as
may be required by law:   (a) amend or terminate any of the Contracts, enter
into any new contract or commitment, or incur or agree to incur any
liability, except in the ordinary course of business (which ordinary course
of business shall include renewals of any Contract), and in no event with
respect to any such contract, commitment or liability as to which the total
to be paid in the future under the contract, commitment or liability exceeds
Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000);   (b) increase compensation payable
or to become payable or make any bonus payment to or otherwise enter into one
or more bonus agreements with any employee, except in the ordinary course of
business in accordance with Seller\'s customary personnel policies; provided,
however, this Section 4.3(b) shall not apply to (i) agreements or
arrangements with any of the CEOs, CFOs, COOs or CNOs (collectively, the
"Leadership Team") which are consistent with the practices of the affiliates
of Seller on a regional or nationwide basis, provided that Seller gives
Purchaser prompt written notice thereof, (ii) any non-recurring payments or
proposed non-recurring payments by Seller or any affiliate of Seller to
any of the Hospitals\' Employees (including any member of the Leadership
Team) to provide an incentive to such Hospitals\' Employees (or to any member

Effective Time, provided that Seller gives Purchaser prompt written notice
thereof, or (iii) any wage increases and/or other changes in the terms and
conditions of union-represented employees pursuant to the terms of any

provided by Seller to Purchaser, purchase capital assets or incur costs in
respect of construction in progress;   (f) take any action outside the
ordinary course of business;   (g) reduce Inventory except in the ordinary
course of business; or   (h) incur or record trade accounts payable with
respect to the Hospitals other than in the ordinary course of
business.  For purposes of this Section 4.3, Seller shall be deemed to have
obtained Purchaser\'s prior written consent to undertake the actions
otherwise prohibited by this Section 4.3 if Seller gives Purchaser written
notice of a proposed action and Seller does not receive from Purchaser a
written notice of objection to such action within five (5) business days
after Purchaser receives Seller\'s written notice. Notwithstanding any
provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Seller shall not be
prohibited from engaging in any act which would otherwise violate any of
Sections 4.3(a) (but not with respect to amendments or terminations of
Contracts under Section 4.3(a)), 4.3(c), 4.3(d) (but only with respect to
acquisitions of any property, plant or equipment under Section 4.3(d)), or
4.3(h) if Seller reasonably believes such action is required on an emergency
basis, or the absence of which would have a material adverse effect on the
ability of the Hospitals to operate in accordance with their
historical manner of operations. If Seller is unable to give Purchaser prior
notice that it intends to take any such act described in the immediately
preceding sentence (which notice may be telephonic notice to Keith B. Pitts
or his designee) or obtain Purchaser\'s consent to such act, Seller shall
give Purchaser prompt written notice subsequent to taking any act described
in the immediately preceding sentence and Purchaser may elect prior to
Closing, in its sole discretion, to not (i) assume the applicable arrangement
or trade accounts payable at Closing or (ii) acquire any property, plant or
equipment acquired under the preceding sentence of this Section 4.3.   4.4
Required Approvals. Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date,
Seller will: (a) use its reasonable commercial efforts to obtain, as promptly
as practicable, all material Governmental Authorizations required of Seller
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including, without limitation, those of governmental and regulatory
authorities) or which Purchaser reasonably deems necessary or appropriate,
(b) reasonably cooperate with Purchaser and its representatives and attorneys
in the preparation of any document or other material which may be required by
any governmental agency as a predicate to or result of the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement, (c) provide such other information and
communications to Governmental Entities as such Governmental Entities may
reasonably request; and (d) cooperate with Purchaser in Purchaser\'s
obtaining, as soon as practicable, all material Governmental Authorizations
required of Purchaser to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby;
provided, however, that it shall be Purchaser\'s responsibility to obtain all
Governmental Authorizations required to carry out the transactions
contemplated by   35   this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement,
(i) "Governmental Entities" shall mean any local, state or federal
government, including each of their respective branches, departments,
agencies, commissions, boards, bureaus, courts, instrumentalities or other
subdivisions, including the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, the
Medicare and Medicaid programs, TRICARE and fiscal intermediaries, and (ii)
"Governmental Authorizations" shall mean all licenses, permits, certificates,

Closing, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser complete copies of the unaudited
balance sheets and related unaudited statements of income relating to Seller
with respect to the operation of the Hospitals for each month then ended,
together with corresponding year-to-date amounts, which presentation shall be
consistent with the provisions of Section 2.10 which are applicable to the
Financial Statements.   (b) In the event Purchaser reasonably determines
that in order to comply with applicable laws, including, without limitation,
Purchaser\'s reporting obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the "Exchange Act") (pursuant to contractual obligations or
otherwise), Purchaser must obtain audited or unaudited financial statements
of Seller with respect to the operations of the Hospitals for additional
periods not covered by the Financial Statements (the "Other Financial
Statements"), Seller shall use its good faith efforts to cooperate with
Purchaser in the preparation of such Other Financial Statements, the cost of
which shall be borne by Purchaser. If Purchaser determines that audited
financial statements are required, such audited financial statements shall be
accompanied by an opinion of KPMG and will fairly present the financial
position and results of operations of Seller with respect to the operation of
the Hospitals as of and for the periods then ended. The audited financial
statements delivered pursuant to this Section 4.5(b) shall be prepared in
conformity with GAAP and shall meet the requirements of Regulation S-X
promulgated under the Exchange Act. Purchaser shall bear all costs and
expenses related to the preparation and delivery of any audited financial
statements requested by Purchaser pursuant to this Section 4.5(b).   4.6 No-
Shop.   (a) From and after the Effective Date until the earlier of
the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement, Seller shall not, and
shall cause its respective affiliates, officers, directors, employees,
investment bankers or agents to not, without the prior written consent of

the capital stock of any Seller, whether by merger, consolidation, tender
offer or otherwise; (iii) hold discussions with any party (other than
Purchaser) looking toward such an offer or solicitation; or (iv) enter
into   36   any agreement with any party (other than Purchaser) with
respect to the sale or other disposition of any of the Hospitals, the Assets
or any portion of the capital stock of any Seller, whether by merger,
consolidation, tender offer or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this
Section 4.6 shall not be construed to prohibit Seller or its affiliates from
engaging in corporate transactions involving Seller\'s or Seller\'s
affiliates\' stock or securities, including macro-level mergers,
reorganizations or other transactions, so long as the terms thereof do not
contemplate the sale or lease or other disposition of the Hospitals or the
Assets.   (b) Any reference in this Agreement to an "affiliate" shall mean
any Person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by or under common
control with a second Person; provided, however, an "affiliate" shall not
include the stockholders of THC, the stockholders of Vanguard Health Systems,
Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Vanguard"), or any officer or director of any
Person. The term "control" (including the terms "controlled by" and "under
common control with") means the possession, direct or indirect, of the power
to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a Person,
whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.

title commitment(s) (the "Title Commitment") sufficient for the issuance of
an ALTA Extended Coverage Owner\'s Title Insurance Policy with respect to the
Owned Real Property (the "Owner\'s Title Policy") and an ALTA Extended
Coverage Leasehold Title Policy with respect to any ground lease specified on
Schedule 4.8 (the "Leasehold Title Policy") (the Owner\'s Title Policy and
the Leasehold Title Policy are collectively referred to in this Agreement as
the "Title Policy"), issued by Chicago Title Insurance Company (the "Title
Company"), together with true, correct and legible copies of all instruments
referred to therein as conditions or exceptions to title (the "Title
Instruments") and (b) ALTA surveys of the Owned Real Property and real
property subject to any ground lease specified on Schedule 4.8 complying with
the Minimum Standard Detail Requirements for ALTA/ASCM Land Title Surveys for

Section 12.12 shall govern which party or parties hereto shall bear the costs
and expenses of the Title Commitment, the Title Policy and the Surveys.  
4.9 Termination of Hospitals\' Employees. Upon the Effective Time,
the Hospitals\' Employees (other than the Retained Management Employees)
shall cease to be employees of Seller and Seller\'s affiliates, and shall be
removed from such entities\' respective payrolls. Seller shall terminate
effective as of the Effective Time the active participation of all of the
Hospitals\' Employees (other than the Retained Management Employees) in all
of the Seller Plans, and shall cause each Seller Plan to comply with all
applicable laws. After the Effective Time, Seller shall timely make or cause
to be made by Seller\'s affiliates appropriate distributions to, or for the
benefit of, all of the Hospitals\' Employees (other than the Retained
Management Employees) in   37   respect of the Seller Plans which are in
force and effect with respect to the Hospitals\' Employees (other than the
Retained Management Employees) at the Hospitals immediately prior to the
Effective Time in accordance with ERISA, the Code and the terms and
conditions of the Seller Plans and subject to the collective bargaining
agreements of each Seller and/or each of Seller\'s obligations under the
National Labor Relations Act; provided, however, no such distribution shall
be required to the extent it is among the Assumed Obligations. Seller shall
provide Purchaser promptly following the Closing with a schedule of the names
and positions of all full-time employees of Seller with respect to the
operation of the Hospitals that have been terminated without cause during the
ninety (90) days immediately preceding the Effective Time.   4.10
Termination Cost Reports. Seller shall file on or before the date due (but
subject to any applicable extensions of time to file) all Medicare, Medicaid,
TRICARE, Blue Cross and any other termination cost reports required to be
filed as a result of the consummation of (a) the transfer of the Assets
to Purchaser and (b) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. All
such termination cost reports shall be filed by Seller in a manner that is
consistent with current laws, rules and regulations. Seller will be solely
responsible, financially and otherwise, for the contents of all such
termination cost reports (and related claims and documentation). Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Seller will be solely obligated for
all cost report deficiencies related to periods prior to the Effective
Time.   4.11 Hart-Scott-Rodino Act Filings. Seller will (a) take promptly

Purchaser\'s filings under the HSR Act and in connection with resolving any

under the HSR Act shall be borne by Seller.   4.12 Environmental Survey.
Seller has obtained from an environmental consulting firm (the "Consultant")
and delivered to Purchaser a written environmental survey of the Owned Real
Property (the "Environmental Survey"), which survey is identified on Exhibit
4.12 hereto. Prior to Closing, the Environmental Survey shall be accompanied
by a reliance letter from the Consultant which permits Purchaser and
Purchaser\'s designees (which designees are reasonable under the
circumstances of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement) to rely on
the Environmental Survey. Section 12.12 shall govern which party or parties
hereto shall bear the costs and expenses of the Environmental Survey.  
4.13 Noncompetition. As an inducement to Purchaser to enter into
this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,
neither Seller nor any of Seller\'s affiliates, shall, for a period of four
(4) years following the Closing Date, without the prior written consent of
Purchaser, directly or indirectly, invest in, own, manage, operate, control
or participate in the ownership, management, operation or control of, any
Competing Business within the Seller Business Service Area. For purposes of
this Agreement, the term "Competing Business" means   38   the business
of providing healthcare goods or services, including hospitals and outpatient
surgical and diagnostic facilities; provided, however, the term "Competing
Business" shall exclude the activities of Broadlane, Inc., and the term
"Seller Business Service Area" means the area within a fifteen (15)
mile radius of any of the Acute Care Hospitals. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the following shall be excluded from the foregoing provisions of
this Section 4.13: (a) the general acute care hospital activities of Seller
and Seller\'s affiliates as of the Closing Date (other than the activities of
the Hospitals) and (b) Seller\'s or any affiliate of Seller\'s acquisition
and operation of a general acute care hospital within the Seller Business
Service Area after the Closing Date so long as such hospital was acquired in
a transaction in which the amount of consideration allocated to such hospital
is less than twenty percent (20%) of the total consideration necessary to
consummate such transaction. During the period commencing on the Effective
Date and ending on the first anniversary of the Closing Date, Seller shall
not actively solicit any of the Hospitals\' Employees (other than the
Retained Management Employees) to remain or become an employee of Seller;
provided, however, that at any time Seller may make a general solicitation
not directed specifically at Hospitals\' Employees to recruit employees
through any means and shall have the right to hire Hospitals\' Employees who
respond to such permitted solicitation efforts or seek such employment
unsolicited by Seller. After the Effective Time, Seller shall not, and shall
use its reasonable commercial efforts to cause its directors, officers,
employees and agents to not, use for any purpose any confidential information
which specifically relates to the Hospitals, other than (i) as required for
financial reporting purposes and (ii) as reasonably necessary in connection
with Seller\'s transition of the ownership and operation of the Hospitals to
Purchaser. Seller shall cause each of its affiliates to comply with the
obligations imposed by this Section 4.13. In the event that the
provisions contained in this Section 4.13 shall ever be deemed to exceed the
time or geographic limits or any other limitations permitted by applicable
law in any jurisdiction, then such provisions shall be deemed reformed in
such jurisdiction to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.   4.14
Enforceability. Seller hereby acknowledges that the restrictions contained in
Section 4.13 are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests
of Purchaser following the Closing Date. The parties also hereby acknowledge
and agree that any breach of Section 4.13 would result in irreparable injury
to Purchaser and that any remedy at law for any breach of Section 4.13 would
be inadequate. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, the parties therefore agree, and Seller hereby specifically
consents that, without necessity of proof of actual damage, Purchaser may be
granted temporary or permanent injunctive relief, that Purchaser shall be
entitled to an equitable accounting of all earnings, profits and other
benefits arising from such breach, and that Purchaser shall be entitled to
recover its reasonable fees and expenses, including attorneys\'
fees, incurred by Purchaser in enforcing the restrictions contained in
Section 4.13.   4.15 Estoppels and Contract Consents. Seller will use
reasonable commercial good faith efforts to obtain, prior to the Closing
Date, (a) estoppel letters, in a form reasonably acceptable to Purchaser,
under those Leases set forth on Schedule 4.15 and (b) consents from third
parties under all Material Contracts and Material Leases which, by the terms
of such Material Contract or Material Lease, requires such consent. To the
extent any of the consents described in Section 4.15(b) are not obtained as
of the Closing, Seller and Purchaser shall use their reasonable commercial
good faith efforts to mitigate any costs, losses or damages associated with
the failure to obtain such consents prior to Closing. Notwithstanding the  
39   foregoing, Seller\'s obtaining the estoppel letters described in
Section 4.15(a) and/or the consents described in Section 4.15(b) shall not be
a condition precedent to either party\'s obligation to close the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement.   4.16 Misdirected Payments. To the extent
there are any misdirected funds forwarded to Seller (or any of its
subsidiaries) by any third parties, which misdirected funds are paid in
respect of the performance of services by or on behalf of the Hospitals from
and after the Effective Time, Seller shall remit such misdirected funds to
Purchaser within ten (10) business days after receipt thereof, to the
account(s) designated by Purchaser. Each of Seller and Purchaser further
agree that, to the extent that Purchaser has not obtained a provider number
with respect to a Hospital prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser (or
a subsidiary of Purchaser) shall be entitled to, subject to applicable law
and the terms of the applicable third party payor provider agreement, use the
provider number obtained by Seller prior to the Effective Time with respect
to such Hospital. Furthermore, Seller and Purchaser understand and agree that
all payments by third party payors in respect of such licensed provider
numbers for goods and services provided on and after the Effective Time
("Post-Closing Payments") shall be solely for the account of Purchaser.
Seller (on its behalf and on behalf of its subsidiaries) hereby irrevocably
assigns to Purchaser, subject to applicable law, all right, title and
interest it may have in respect of such Post-Closing Payments and hereby
agrees to remit to Purchaser such Post-Closing Payments within ten (10)
business days after its receipt thereof.   4.17 Supplements to Disclosure
Schedule. From the Effective Date through the Closing Date, Seller will
promptly notify Purchaser if Seller becomes aware of any fact or condition
that causes or constitutes a breach of any of Seller\'s representations and
warranties as of the Effective Date. Should any such fact or condition
require any change in the Disclosure Schedule, Seller will promptly deliver
to Purchaser a supplement to the Disclosure Schedule specifying
such change.   4.18 Fallon Clinic Interest Repurchase. Seller will use
reasonable commercial good faith efforts to cause the Fallon Clinic, Inc. to,
as of or prior to the Closing Date, no longer own any equity interest in
SVH. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Fallon Clinic, Inc. no longer owning
any equity interest in SVH as of or prior to the Closing Date shall not be
a condition precedent to either party\'s obligation to close the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement.   ARTICLE 5   COVENANTS OF
PURCHASER   5.1 Purchaser\'s Efforts to Close. Purchaser shall use its
reasonable commercial efforts to satisfy all of the conditions precedent set
forth in Articles 6 and 7 to its or Seller\'s obligations under this
Agreement to the extent that Purchaser\'s action or inaction can control or
influence the satisfaction of such conditions.   5.2 Required Governmental
Approvals. Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, Purchaser
will: (a) use its reasonable commercial efforts to obtain, as promptly as
practicable, all material Governmental Authorizations required of Purchaser
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby; (b) provide such other
information and communications to   40   Governmental Entities as such
Governmental Entities may reasonably request; and (c) cooperate with Seller
in Seller\'s obtaining, as soon as practicable, all material Governmental
Authorizations required of Seller to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby.   5.3 Certain Employee Matters.   (a) Purchaser covenants and
agrees that, effective as of the Effective Time, it shall make offers of
employment (in substantially equivalent positions) on an "at will" basis
(subject to the terms of Sections 5.3(f) through 5.3(l) to substantially all
of the persons who are employees of (i) Seller with respect to the operation
of the Hospitals or (ii) any affiliate of Seller which employs individuals at
any of the Hospitals, (whether such employees are full time employees, part-
time employees, on short-term or long-term disability or on leave of absence
pursuant to Seller\'s policies, the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 or
other similar local law (such laws being collectively referred to herein as
the "FMLA")) as of the Effective Time (the "Hospitals\' Employees");
provided, however, that no Hospitals\' Employee who is on any disability or
leave of absence at the Effective Time, other than leave of absence pursuant
to the FMLA or any other form of protected leave under local, state or
federal law including without limitation, workers\' compensation leave and
leaves pursuant to or under the Uniform Services Employment and
Reemployment Rights Act, Americans with Disabilities Act, Massachusetts\'
Maternity Leave Act and/or Massachusetts\' Fair Employment Practices Act
("Employee on Disability"), shall become a Hired Employee unless and until
such Employee on Disability reports back to work at the applicable Hospital
on an active basis within ninety (90) days after the Effective Time and,
Purchaser shall have no liability or obligation with respect to any Employee
on Disability after the Effective Time until such time as such Employee on
Disability becomes a Hired Employee; and provided, however, further,
Purchaser shall not be required to make offers of employment to the CEO, COO,
CFO or CNO of any Hospital. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser
acknowledges that Seller has the right, but is not required, to retain any
management-level Hospitals\' Employee who does not accept Purchaser\'s
employment offer made under this Section 5.3(a), which individuals will
remain employed by Seller or its applicable affiliate as of the
Effective Time (the "Retained Management Employees"). Any of the Hospitals\'
Employees who accept an offer of employment with Purchaser as of or after the
Effective Time shall be referred to in this Agreement as the "Hired
Employees". Purchaser covenants and agrees that it shall continue to employ
in comparable positions the Hired Employees for a period of no less than
ninety (90) calendar days following the Effective Time, unless Purchaser
sooner terminates the employment of any Hired Employee for cause or any Hired
Employee voluntarily resigns or retires. Purchaser shall ensure that the
terms and conditions of employment (including initial position, cash
compensation, shifts, benefits, including without limitation health, dental,
disability, life insurance and retirement plans) of each of the Hired
Employees on and after the Effective Time are substantially equivalent to the
benefits provided to Purchaser\'s employees at similar hospital facilities in
comparable positions or performing comparable functions. Notwithstanding
anything in this Section 5.3 or this Agreement to the contrary, all offers of
employment to employees (i) covered by any collective bargaining agreement
which is among the Assumed Obligations shall be subject to the terms of and
conditions of such assumed collective bargaining agreement and (ii) shall be
subject to the obligations of Purchaser set forth in Sections 5.3(f) through
5.3(l) inclusive.   41    (b) Purchaser shall give all Hired Employees
full credit for extended sick pay (Reserve Sick) as reflected by the Sick Pay
Amount as of the Closing Date, and all other paid time off pay to the extent
included in Net Working Capital, either by (i) crediting such employees the
time off reflected in the employment records of Seller and/or any of its

of this Section 5.6 shall apply (a) between the Effective Date and the
Effective Time with respect to Confidential Information which is among the

Purchaser hereby acknowledges that the restrictions contained in Section 5.6
above are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of
Seller. The parties also hereby acknowledge and agree that any breach of
Section 5.6 would result in irreparable injury to Seller and that any remedy
at law for any breach of Section 5.6 would be inadequate. Notwithstanding any
provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the parties therefore
agree, and Purchaser hereby specifically consents that, without necessity of
proof of actual damage, Seller may be granted temporary or permanent
injunctive relief, that Seller shall be entitled to an equitable accounting
of all earnings, profits and other benefits arising from such breach, and
that Seller shall be entitled to recover its reasonable fees and

Seller may effect one or more tax-deferred exchanges under Internal Revenue
Code Section 1031 in respect of the Real Property (or a portion thereof).
Purchaser agrees to accommodate Seller in effecting any such tax-deferred
exchange. Seller shall have the right to elect such tax-deferred exchange at
any time before the Closing Date. Seller and Purchaser agree, however, that
consummation of the purchase and sale of the Real Property under this
Agreement is not conditioned on such exchange. If Seller elects to make a
tax-deferred exchange, Purchaser agrees to timely execute such additional
escrow instructions, deeds, documents, agreements, or instruments to effect
such exchange, and Purchaser acknowledges that time is of the essence
in respect of Purchaser\'s cooperation hereunder, provided that Purchaser
shall incur no additional costs, expenses, or liabilities in this transaction
as a result of or in connection with such exchange.   5.11 Indigent and Low
Income Care. From and after the Effective Time, with respect to the operation
of the Hospitals, Purchaser shall adhere to and comply with its then existing
policies (as in effect with respect to Purchaser\'s other hospitals)
regarding indigent and charity care, as such policies may be amended or
supplemented from time to time.   5.12 Medical Staff. To ensure continuity

the board of directors of Purchaser comprised of medical staff members,
community leaders and each Hospital\'s Chief Executive Officer. The local
governing board shall be subject to the authority of Purchaser\'s board of
directors and the terms of Purchaser\'s Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws and
other organizational documents.   5.14 Community Benefit and Prior Owner
Obligations. On and after the Effective Time, Purchaser shall assume the
obligations to operate the applicable Hospitals in accordance with the terms
set forth in Schedule 5.14, which Schedule shall include, without limitation,
commitments which Seller made to prior owners of the Hospitals and other
commitments which benefit the community.   5.15 Subsequent Sale. At any time
after the Effective Time, if Purchaser decides to sell, merge, or otherwise
transfer or consolidate any of the Hospitals during a period when Purchaser
is performing any operating covenants pursuant to Section 5.14, Purchaser
shall ensure that (a) such subsequent owner of the applicable Hospital agrees
to fulfill Purchaser\'s obligations under Section 5.14 and (b) all succeeding
subsequent owners agree to fulfill such obligations under Section 5.14 (but
only for so long as such obligations continue in effect).   46

(i) seasonal changes or (ii) the announcement of Purchaser as the
proposed acquirer of the Hospitals (the definition of the term, "material
adverse effect", as set forth in this Section 8.1(i), shall be used solely
for determining Purchaser\'s termination right under this Section 8.1(i) and
not for interpreting the phrase "material adverse effect" for any other usage
in this Agreement).   8.2 Termination Consequences. If this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, all further obligations of the parties

and the requirements of relevant insurance carriers. After the expiration of
the Document Retention Period, if Purchaser intends to destroy or otherwise
dispose of any of the documents described in this Section 9.2(a), Purchaser
shall provide written notice to Seller of Purchaser\'s intention no later
than forty-five (45) calendar days prior to the date of such
intended destruction or disposal. Seller shall have the right, at its sole
cost, to take possession of such documents during such forty-five (45)
calendar day period. If Seller does not take possession of such documents
during such forty-five (45) calendar day period, Purchaser shall be free to
destroy or otherwise dispose of such documentation upon the expiration of
such forty-five (45) calendar day period.   (b) Purchaser shall give
reasonable cooperation to Seller, Seller\'s affiliates and their insurance
carriers in respect of the defense of claims by third parties against Seller
or any affiliate of Seller, in respect of events occurring prior to the
Effective Time with respect to the operation of the Hospitals. Such
cooperation shall include, without limitation, making the Hired Employees
reasonably available for interviews, depositions, hearings and trials. Such
cooperation shall also include making all of its employees available
to assist in the securing and giving of evidence and in obtaining the
presence and cooperation of witnesses (all of which shall be done without
payment of any fees or expenses to Purchaser or to such employees other than
out-of-pocket expenses). In addition, with reasonable prior notice, Seller
and Seller\'s affiliates shall be entitled to remove from the Hospitals
originals of any such records, but only for purposes of pending litigation
involving the Persons to whom such records refer, as certified in writing
prior to removal by counsel retained by Seller or any of Seller\'s affiliates
in connection with such litigation. Such records shall be, at Purchaser\'s
option either (i) copied by Purchaser for Seller at Seller\'s expense or (ii)
removed from the premises by Seller, copied by Seller and promptly returned
to Purchaser unless the originals of such records must be introduced into
evidence in which case Seller shall return them as soon as practicable.  
(c) In connection with (i) the transition of the Hospitals pursuant to the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) Seller\'s rights to
the Excluded Assets, (iii) Seller\'s obligations under the Excluded
Liabilities and (iv) Seller\'s preparation of the Final Balance Sheets
pursuant to Section 1.4, Purchaser shall after the Effective Time give
Seller, Seller\'s affiliates and their respective representatives reasonable
access during normal business hours to Purchaser\'s books, accounts and
records and all other relevant documents and information with respect to the
assets, liabilities and business of the Hospitals as representatives of
Seller and Seller\'s affiliates may from time to time reasonably request, all
in such manner as   52   not to unreasonably interfere with the
operations of the Hospitals. Seller acknowledges that it shall coordinate its
activities contemplated by this Section 9.2(c) through the Chief Executive
Officer of the applicable Hospital, or his designee.   (d) Purchaser and
its representatives shall be given access by Seller during normal business
hours to the extent reasonably needed by Purchaser for business purposes to
all documents, records, correspondence, work papers and other documents
retained by Seller pertaining to any of the Assets or with respect to the
operation of the Hospitals prior to the Effective Time, all in such manner as
to not interfere unreasonably with Seller\'s business. Such documents and
other materials shall be, at Seller\'s option, either (i) copied by Seller
for Purchaser at Purchaser\'s expense, or (ii) removed by Purchaser from the
premises, copied by Purchaser and promptly returned to Seller.   (e)
Purchaser shall cooperate with Seller, on a timely basis and as reasonably
requested by Seller, in connection with the provision of all data of the
Hospitals and other information required by Seller for reporting to the JCAHO
for the remainder of the quarterly period in which the Closing
has occurred.   (f) For five (5) years after the Closing Date, Seller will
provide Purchaser, within thirty (30) days of any request, with an updated
claims history of professional liability, general liability and workers\'
compensation claims made against Seller with respect to the operation of the
Hospitals prior to the Effective Time.   (g) To the maximum extent
permitted by law, if any Person requests or demands, by subpoena or
otherwise, any documents relating to the Excluded Liabilities, including
without limitation, documents relating to the operations of any of the
Hospitals or any of the Hospitals\' committees prior to the Effective Time,
prior to any disclosure of such documents, Purchaser shall notify Seller and
shall provide Seller with the opportunity to object to, and otherwise
coordinate with respect to, such request or demand.   9.3 Provision of
Benefits of Certain Contracts. If, as of the Effective Time, Purchaser or
Seller is unable to obtain any consent to the assignment of Seller\'s
interest in a Material Contract or a Material Lease, or if Purchaser
is unable to enter into a new contract with respect to an Excluded Multi-
Facility Contract, until such consent or new contract is obtained, Seller
shall use reasonable commercial efforts to provide Purchaser the benefits of
any such Material Contract or Material Lease and the applicable Hospital\'s
portion of any Excluded Multi-Facility Contract, cooperate in any reasonable
and lawful arrangement designed to provide such benefits to Purchaser, and
allow Purchaser to directly enforce such Material Contract or Material Lease
against the applicable third parties thereto. Purchaser shall use reasonable
commercial efforts to perform, on behalf of Seller, the obligations of Seller
thereunder or in connection therewith arising on and after the Effective
Time, but only to the extent that such action would not result in a material
default thereunder or in connection therewith and such obligation would have
been, in the case of an Excluded Multi-Facility Contract, an obligation of
Purchaser had it entered into a new contract on substantially similar
terms.   9.4 Closing of Financials. With respect to any Hospital in which
the CFO (to the extent such position was filled by an employee of Seller or
an affiliate of Seller immediately   53   prior to the Closing Date) is
among the Hired Employees, Purchaser shall cause each such CFO to complete
the standardized closing of Seller\'s financial records through the Closing
Date including, without limitation, the closing of general ledger account
reconciliations (collectively, the "Closing of Financials"). Purchaser shall
cause each such CFO to use his or her good faith efforts to complete the
Closing of Financials by no later than the date which is thirty (30) days
after the Closing Date. Seller shall reimburse Purchaser for all payroll
charges and other out-of-pocket expenses of Purchaser associated with the
time which each such CFO devotes to the Closing of Financials.
Such reimbursement shall occur no later than the date which is thirty (30)
days after Purchaser provides a written statement to Seller which details
such charges and expenses. Seller shall hold Purchaser harmless for any
errors which are made by each such CFO during the course of the Closing of
Financials, provided that such errors are not the result of gross negligence,
fraud or intentional misconduct.   9.5 Accounts Receivable Contact Person.
After the Closing Date, Seller shall provide Purchaser with the name and
contact information of a representative of Seller who shall be available
during regular business hours to, with respect to the Accounts Receivable,
(a) answer questions of payors or patients and (b) work with such payors or
patients in the resolution of disputes. Purchaser shall be permitted to
provide such contact information to payors or patients who have any such
questions or have disputes related to the Accounts Receivable.   9.6
Audited Statements and Other Financial Statements Cooperation. Seller shall
cooperate with Purchaser in Purchaser\'s efforts to obtain KPMG\'s
consent, as may be required, in order for Purchaser to include the Audited
Statements and/or the Other Financial Statements, if any, in any registration
statement or filing under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended.   9.7 UCC Termination Statements. If, at Closing, Seller is unable
to deliver to Purchaser any UCC termination statements for any and all
financing statements (which do not correspond to a Permitted Exception or an
agreement which is among the Assumed Obligations) filed with respect to the
Assets, Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts (which reasonable best
efforts shall include Seller\'s obligation to pay the face amount of any
applicable outstanding lien or encumbrance) to deliver such UCC termination
statements to Purchaser as soon as practicable after the Closing.   9.8
Employee Transition. Purchaser acknowledges that Seller will, on the Closing
Date, provide each of the Hospitals\' Employees a payroll check (with respect
to ordinary wages and salaries) covering all pay periods through the Closing
Date, which check will include an amount based upon an estimate of
time worked through the Closing Date (the "Estimated Payment Amount"). Within
ten (10) days after the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser a
statement setting forth, in reasonable detail, (a) the Estimated Payment
Amount, if any, for each of the Hospitals\' Employees and (b) for each of the
Hospitals\' Employees who are among the Hired Employees the amount of pay, if
any, which is due to such Hired Employees based on the actual time worked by
each such employee during the applicable payroll cycle ending on the Closing
Date, less the Estimated Payment Amount which Seller made to each such
employee on the Closing Date (the "Employee Settle-Up Payments). Within
twenty (20) days after the Closing Date, Seller shall reimburse Purchaser the
amount of the Employee Settle-Up Payments. As soon as practicable after the
Closing Date (but in no event later than the date   54   which is thirty
(30) days after the Closing Date), Purchaser shall include the Employee
Settle-Up Payments in the payroll check for each of the applicable Hired
Employees.   ARTICLE 10   SURVIVAL AND INDEMNIFICATION   10.1 Survival.
Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement to the contrary, all
representations and warranties of Purchaser and Seller, respectively,
contained in Articles 2 and 3 of this Agreement or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto shall be deemed to be material and to have been relied upon
by Purchaser and Seller, respectively, and shall continue to be
fully effective and enforceable following the Closing Date for two years and
shall thereafter be of no further force and effect. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 2.6 and
2.16 shall continue to be fully effective and enforceable following the
Closing Date for the applicable statute of limitations periods, plus 30 days,
and the indemnification provisions contained in Sections 10.2.1(b) through
10.2.1(j) and Sections 10.3.1(b) through 10.3.1(i) shall continue to be fully
effective and enforceable following the Closing Date until the expiration of
any applicable statute of limitations period, or, if none, without any time
limitation; provided, however, that if there is an outstanding notice of a
claim at the end of any such applicable period in compliance with the terms
of Section 10.4, such applicable period shall not end in respect of such
claim until such claim is resolved. All covenants of Purchaser and Seller
herein shall survive Closing in accordance with their terms.   10.2
Indemnification of Purchaser by Seller.   10.2.1 Indemnification. Each
Seller, for itself and its successors, shall jointly and severally keep and
save Purchaser, and its affiliates and their respective directors, officers,
employees, agents and other representatives (the "Purchaser Group"), forever
harmless from and shall indemnify and defend the Purchaser Group against any
and all obligations, judgments, liabilities, interest, penalties, violations,
actions, suits, proceedings, fees, fines, claims, losses, costs, demands,
damages, liens, encumbrances and expenses including reasonable attorneys\'
fees and court costs (collectively, "Damages"), to the extent connected with
or arising or resulting from (a) any breach of any representation or warranty
of Seller under this Agreement, without giving effect to any Disapproved
Schedules, (b) any breach or default by Seller of any covenant or agreement
of Seller under this Agreement, (c) the Excluded Liabilities, (d) the
Excluded Assets, (e) all Taxes for any period ending on or prior to the
Effective Time relating to Seller or the Assets, other than any Taxes which
(i) are among the Assumed Obligations or (ii) which have been prorated
pursuant to Section 1.8 ("Seller Tax Claims"), (f) any professional liability
claim arising out of the business operations of the Hospitals prior to the
Effective Time, (g) any act, conduct or omission of Seller that has accrued,
arisen, occurred or come into existence at any time prior to the Effective
Time, (h) any of those certain pending governmental investigations which are
described on Schedule 10.2.1, (i) Purchaser\'s participation in any tax-
deferred exchange pursuant to Section 5.10 and (j) cost reports (and all
claims with respect thereto) relating to Seller with respect to the Medicare,
Medicaid, TRICARE or Blue Cross programs or any other third-party payor for
all periods prior to the Effective Time. Seller\'s obligations under this
Section 10.2.1 shall remain subject to, and shall be limited by,
the provisions contained in Section 1.13. No provision in this Agreement
shall prevent Seller from pursuing any of its legal   55   rights or
remedies that may be granted to Seller by law against any Person other than
any other member of the Purchaser Group.   10.2.2 Indemnification
Limitations. (a) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, Seller shall be under no liability to indemnify the Purchaser
Group under Section 10.2.1 and no claim under Section 10.2.1 of this
Agreement shall:   (i) be made unless notice thereof shall have been given
by  or on behalf of Purchaser to Seller in the manner  provided in Section
10.4, unless failure to provide such  notice in a timely manner does not
materially impair  Seller\'s ability to defend its rights, mitigate
damages,  seek indemnification from a third party or otherwise  protect its
interests;   (ii) be made to the extent that any loss may be recovered 
under a policy of insurance in force on the date of loss  (other than a
policy of insurance with an affiliate of  Purchaser); provided, however, that
this Section  10.2.2(a)(ii) shall not apply to the extent that  coverage
under the applicable policy of insurance is  denied by the applicable
insurance carrier;   (iii) be made to the extent that such claim relates to
a  liability arising out of or relating to any act,  omission, event or
occurrence connected with:   (A) the use, ownership or operation of any of
the  Hospitals, or   (B) the use, ownership or operation of any of the 
Assets,   on and after the Effective Time (without regard to  whether such
use, ownership or operation is consistent  with Seller\'s policies,
procedures and/or practices  prior to the Effective Time); other than as
specifically  included in the Excluded Liabilities;   (iv) be made to the
extent that such claim (or the basis  therefor) is set forth in the
Disclosure Schedule, any  Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement (without
giving  effect to any Disapproved Schedules), unless Seller\'s 
indemnification of the Purchaser Group is based on a  provision hereof other
than Section 10.2.1(a);   (v) be made if and to the extent that proper
provision or  reserve was made for the matter giving rise to the claim  in
Net Working Capital;   (vi) be made to the extent such claim relates to an 
obligation or liability for which Purchaser has agreed  to indemnify Seller
pursuant to Section 10.3;   56    (vii) be made to the extent such claim
relates to Seller\'s  failure to comply with or the Assets\' failure to be
in  compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act;  provided, however,
this Section 10.2.2(a)(vii) shall not  apply to the extent that such claim
arises as a result  of a claim brought by an individual (which shall 
specifically exclude, without limitation, governmental  third parties) who
alleges that he or she has suffered  damages prior to the Effective Time,
including, without  limitation, damages arising from personal injury;  
(viii) be made to the extent such claim seeks Damages which  are
consequential in nature (as opposed to direct),  including, without
limitation, loss of future revenue or  income or loss of business reputation
or opportunity  (collectively, "Consequential Damages"); provided,  however,
the limitation contained in this Section  10.2.2(a)(viii) shall not apply to
the extent of any  payments which Purchaser or any member of the Purchaser 
Group is required to make to a third party (other than  any third party which
is a member of the Purchaser  Group) which are in the nature of Consequential
Damages;  and   (ix) accrue to Purchaser or any member of the Purchaser
Group  under Section 10.2.1(a) unless and only to the extent  that (A) the
actual liability of Seller in respect of  any single claim under Section
10.2.1(a) exceeds Five  Thousand Dollars ($5,000) (a "Relevant Claim") and
(B)  the total actual liability of Seller under Section  10.2.1(a) in
respect of all Relevant Claims in the  aggregate exceeds One Million Dollars
($1,000,000) (the  "Aggregate Amount"), in which event Purchaser or any 
member of the Purchaser Group shall be entitled to seek  indemnification
under Section 10.2.1(a) for all Relevant  Claims only in an amount of Damages
which exceed the  Aggregate Amount.   (b) Notwithstanding any provision to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, the maximum aggregate liability of
Seller to the Purchaser Group under this Agreement shall not exceed the Cash
Purchase Price (as adjusted pursuant to Section 1.4).   (c) If Purchaser or
any member of the Purchaser Group is entitled to recover any sum (whether by
payment, discount, credit or otherwise) from any third party (other than an
insurance carrier or an affiliate of Purchaser) in respect of any matter for
which a claim of indemnity could be made against Seller hereunder, Purchaser
shall, at its option, either use its reasonable endeavors to recover such sum
from such third party and any sum recovered will reduce the amount of the
claim, or assign to Seller the right of Purchaser or the applicable member of
the Purchaser Group to pursue such third party. If Seller pays to any member
of the Purchaser Group an amount in respect of a claim, and such member of
the Purchaser Group subsequently recovers from a third party (other than an
insurance carrier or an affiliate of Purchaser) a sum which is referable to
that claim, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the applicable   57   member
of the Purchaser Group to, forthwith repay to Seller so much of the amount
paid by Purchaser or the applicable member of the Purchaser Group as does not
exceed the sum recovered from the third party less all reasonable
costs, charges and expenses incurred by Purchaser or the applicable member of
the Purchaser Group in obtaining payment in respect of that claim and in
recovering that sum from the third party.   (d) Upon notice to Seller
specifying in reasonable detail the basis therefore, Purchaser shall, during
the term of the Indemnity Escrow Agreement, give notice of any claim for
indemnity hereunder to Seller and the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Indemnity
Escrow Agreement. In accordance with, and subject to, the terms of the
Indemnity Escrow Agreement, Purchaser shall, during the term of the Indemnity
Escrow Agreement, unless and until all amounts in the escrow have been
exhausted, satisfy its indemnity claims under Section 10.2 from any
amounts held in escrow pursuant to the Indemnity Escrow Agreement. The Escrow
Amount shall not be deemed to be a limit on Seller\'s obligations under this
Section 10.2.   10.3 Indemnification of Seller by Purchaser.   10.3.1
Indemnification. Purchaser shall keep and save Seller, its affiliates and
their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and
other representatives (the "Seller Group"), forever harmless from and shall
indemnify and defend the Seller Group against any and all Damages, to the
extent connected with or arising or resulting from (a) any breach of any
representation or warranty of Purchaser under this Agreement, (b) any breach
or default by Purchaser under any covenant or agreement of Purchaser under
this Agreement, (c) cost reports (and all claims with respect thereto)
relating to Purchaser\'s operation of the Hospitals with respect to Medicare,
Medicaid, TRICARE or Blue Cross programs or any other third-party payor for
all periods beginning on and after the Effective Time, (d) the Assumed
Obligations, (e) any professional liability claim arising out of the business
operations of the Hospitals on and after the Effective Time, (f) liabilities
to the Hired Employees arising out of actions of Purchaser based wholly or in
part upon the contents of the personnel records of such employees, (g)
involuntary termination of the Hired Employees on and after the Effective
Time, which termination would constitute a "mass layoff" or a "plant closing"
within the meaning of WARN, (h) any act, conduct or omission of Purchaser
that has accrued, arisen, occurred or come into existence with respect to the
Hospitals or the Assets for time periods on and after the Effective Date and
(i) any securities litigation involving (i) Purchaser (but only to the extent
such litigation relates to the Hospitals) and/or (ii) any financing obtained
by Purchaser which is utilized to fund, in whole or in part, the Cash
Purchase Price, other than to the extent arising out of any
willful misconduct of Seller or its employees prior to the Effective Time,
or intentionally false or intentionally misleading statements of Seller or
its employees prior to the Effective Time. No provision in this Agreement
shall prevent Purchaser from pursuing any of its legal rights or remedies
that may be granted to Purchaser by law against any Person other than any
other member of the Seller Group.   10.3.2 Indemnification Limitations. (a)
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Purchaser shall be under no liability to indemnify the Seller Group under
10.3.1 and no claim under Section 10.3.1 of this Agreement shall:  
58    (i) be made unless notice thereof shall have been given by  or on
behalf of Seller to Purchaser in the manner  provided in Section 10.4, unless
failure to provide such  notice in a timely manner does not materially
impair  Purchaser\'s ability to defend its rights, mitigate  damages, seek
indemnification from a third party or  otherwise protect its interests;  
(ii) be made to the extent that any loss may be recovered  under a policy of
insurance in force on the date of loss  (other than a policy of insurance
with an affiliate of  Seller); provided, however, that this Section 
10.3.2(a)(ii) shall not apply to the extent that  coverage under the
applicable policy of insurance is  denied by the applicable insurance
carrier;   (iii) be made to the extent that such claim relates to a 
liability of Seller arising out of or relating to any  act, omission, event
or occurrence connected with:   (A) the use, ownership or operation of any
of the  Hospitals, or   (B) the use, operation or ownership of any of the 
Assets,   prior to the Effective Time, other than as specifically  included
in the Assumed Obligations;   (iv) be made to the extent such claim relates
to an  obligation or liability for which Seller has agreed to  indemnify
Purchaser pursuant to Section 10.2;   (v) be made to the extent such claim
seeks Consequential  Damages; provided, however, the limitation contained
in  this Section 10.3.2.(a)(v) shall not apply to the extent  of any
payments which Seller or any member of the Seller  Group is required to make
to a third party (other than  any third party which is a member of the Seller
Group)  which are in the nature of Consequential Damages; and   (vi) accrue
to Seller or any member of the Seller Group under  Section 10.3.1(a) unless
and only to the extent that (A)  the actual liability of Purchaser in respect
of any  single claim under Section 10.3.1(a) exceeds Five  Thousand Dollars
($5,000) (a "Seller Relevant Claim")  and (B) the total actual liability of
Purchaser under  Section 10.3.1(a) in respect of all Seller Relevant  Claims
in the aggregate exceeds One Million Dollars  ($1,000,000) (the "Seller
Aggregate Amount"), in which  event Seller or any member of the Seller Group
shall be  entitled to seek indemnification under Section 10.3.1(a)  for all
Seller Relevant Claims only in an amount of  Damages which exceed the Seller
Aggregate Amount.   59    (b) Notwithstanding any provision to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the maximum aggregate liability of
Purchaser to the Seller Group under this Agreement, subsequent to Purchaser
paying the Cash Purchase Price at Closing (as adjusted pursuant to Section
1.4), shall not exceed an additional amount equal to the Cash Purchase
Price.   (c) If Seller or any member of the Seller Group is entitled
to recover any sum (whether by payment, discount, credit or otherwise) from
any third party (other than an insurance carrier or an affiliate of Seller)
in respect of any matter for which a claim of indemnity could be made
against Purchaser hereunder, Seller shall, at its option, either use its
reasonable endeavors to recover such sum from such third party and any sum
recovered will reduce the amount of the claim, or assign to Purchaser the
right of Seller or the applicable member of the Seller Group to pursue such
third party. If Purchaser pays to any member of the Seller Group an amount in
respect of a claim, and such member of the Seller Group subsequently recovers
from a third party (other than an insurance carrier or an affiliate of
Seller) a sum which is referable to that claim, Seller shall, and shall cause
the applicable member of the Seller Group to, forthwith repay to Purchaser so
much of the amount paid by Seller or the applicable member of the Seller
Group as does not exceed the sum recovered from the third party less all
reasonable costs, charges and expenses incurred by Seller or the applicable
member of the Seller Group in obtaining payment in respect of that claim and
in recovering that sum from the third party.   10.4 Method of Asserting
Claims. All claims for indemnification by any Person entitled to
indemnification (the "Indemnified Party") under this Article 10 will be
asserted and resolved as follows:   (a) In the event any claim or demand,
for which a party hereto (an "Indemnifying Party") would be liable for the
Damages to an Indemnified Party, is asserted against or sought to be
collected from such Indemnified Party by a Person other than Seller,
Purchaser or their affiliates (a "Third Party Claim"), the Indemnified Party
shall deliver a notice of its claim (a "Claim Notice") to the Indemnifying
Party within thirty (30) calendar days after the Indemnified Party receives
written notice of such Third Party Claim; provided, however, that notice
shall be provided to the Indemnifying Party within fifteen (15) calendar days
after receipt of a complaint, petition or institution of other formal
legal action by the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party fails to
provide the Claim Notice within such applicable time period after the
Indemnified Party receives written notice of such Third Party Claim and
thereby materially impairs the Indemnifying Party\'s ability to protect its
interests, the Indemnifying Party will not be obligated to indemnify the
Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying
Party will notify the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) calendar days
after receipt of the Claim Notice (the "Notice Period") whether the
Indemnifying Party desires, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying
Party, to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claim.  
(i) If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party within the
Notice Period that the Indemnifying Party desires to defend the Indemnified
Party with respect to the Third Party Claim pursuant to this Section 10.4(a),
then, subject to the immediately succeeding sentence, the Indemnifying Party
will have the right to defend, at its sole cost and expense, such Third Party
Claim by all appropriate proceedings, which proceedings will be prosecuted by
the Indemnifying Party to a final conclusion or will be settled at
the discretion of the Indemnifying Party. To the extent the Third Party Claim
is solely for money damages, the   60   Indemnifying Party will have
full control of such defense and proceedings, including any compromise or
settlement thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party may,
at its sole cost and expense, file during the Notice Period any motion,
answer or other pleadings that the Indemnified Party may deem necessary or
appropriate to protect its interests or those of the Indemnifying Party and
which is not prejudicial, in the reasonable judgment of the Indemnifying
Party, to the Indemnifying Party. Except as provided in Section 10.4(a)(ii)
hereof, if an Indemnified Party takes any such action that is prejudicial and
causes a final adjudication that is adverse to the Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnifying Party will be relieved of its obligations hereunder with respect
to the portion of such Third Party Claim prejudiced by the
Indemnified Party\'s action. If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnified Party agrees, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying
Party, to cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in contesting
any Third Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party elects to contest, or, if
appropriate and related to the Third Party Claim in question, in making any
counterclaim against the Person asserting the Third Party Claim, or any
cross-complaint against any Person (other than the Indemnified Party or any
of its affiliates). The Indemnified Party may participate in, but not
control, any defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim controlled by the
Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Section 10.4(a)(i), and except as
specifically provided in this Section 10.4(a)(i), the Indemnified Party will
bear its own costs and expenses with respect to such participation.   (ii)
If the Indemnifying Party fails to notify the Indemnified Party within the
Notice Period that the Indemnifying Party desires to defend the Indemnified
Party pursuant to this Section 10.4(a), or if the Indemnifying Party gives
such notice but fails to prosecute diligently or settle the Third
Party Claim, or if the Indemnifying Party fails to give any notice whatsoever
within the Notice Period, then the Indemnified Party will have the right to
defend, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, the Third
Party Claim by all appropriate proceedings, which proceedings will be
promptly and reasonably prosecuted by the Indemnified Party to a final
conclusion or will be settled at the discretion of the Indemnified Party. The
Indemnified Party will have full control of such defense and proceedings,
including any compromise or settlement thereof; provided, however, that if
requested by the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party agrees, at the
sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, to cooperate with the
Indemnified Party and its counsel in contesting any Third Party Claim which
the Indemnified Party is contesting, or, if appropriate and related to the
Third Party Claim in question, in making any counterclaim against the Person
asserting the Third Party Claim, or any cross-complaint against any Person
(other than the Indemnifying Party or any of its affiliates). Notwithstanding
the foregoing provisions of this Section 10.4(a)(ii), if the Indemnifying
Party has notified the Indemnified Party with reasonable promptness that the
Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the Indemnified Party
with respect to such Third Party Claim and if such dispute is resolved in
favor of the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party will not be required
to bear the costs and expenses of the Indemnified Party\'s defense pursuant
to this Section 10.4(a)(ii) or of the Indemnifying Party\'s participation
therein at the Indemnified Party\'s request, and the Indemnified Party will
reimburse the Indemnifying Party in full for all reasonable costs and
expenses incurred by the Indemnifying Party in connection with such
litigation. Subject to the above terms of this Section 10.4(a)(ii), the
Indemnifying Party may participate in, but not control, any defense or
settlement controlled by the Indemnified Party pursuant to this Section
10.4(a)(ii), and the Indemnifying Party will bear its own costs and expenses
with respect to such participation. The Indemnified Party shall give
sufficient prior   61   notice to the Indemnifying Party of the
initiation of any discussions relating to the settlement of a Third Party
Claim to allow the Indemnifying Party to participate therein.   (b) In the
event any Indemnified Party should have a claim against any Indemnifying
Party hereunder that either (i) does not involve a Third Party Claim being
asserted against or sought to be collected from the Indemnified Party or (ii)
is a Seller Tax Claim, the Indemnified Party shall deliver an Indemnity
Notice (as hereinafter defined) to the Indemnifying Party. (The
term "Indemnity Notice" shall mean written notification of a claim for
indemnity under Article 10 hereof (which claim does not involve a Third Party
Claim or is a Seller Tax Claim) by an Indemnified Party to an Indemnifying
Party pursuant to this Section 10.4, specifying the nature of and specific
basis for such claim and the amount or the estimated amount of such claim.)
The failure by any Indemnified Party to give the Indemnity Notice shall not
impair such party\'s rights hereunder except to the extent that an
Indemnifying Party demonstrates that it has been prejudiced thereby.   (c)
If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within thirty
(30) calendar days following its receipt of a Claim Notice or an Indemnity
Notice that the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the Indemnified
Party hereunder, such claim specified by the Indemnified Party will be
conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party hereunder and
the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of such liability to the
Indemnified Party on demand, or on such later date (i) in the case of a Third
Party Claim, as the Indemnified Party suffers the Damages in respect of such
Third Party Claim, (ii) in the case of an Indemnity Notice in which the
amount of the claim is estimated, when the amount of such claim becomes
finally determined or (iii) in the case of a Seller Tax Claim, within fifteen
(15) calendar days following final determination of the item giving rise to
the claim for indemnity. If the Indemnifying Party has timely disputed its
liability with respect to such claim, as provided above, the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party agree to proceed in good faith to negotiate a
resolution of such dispute, and if not resolved through negotiations, such
dispute will be resolved by adjudication by a court or similar tribunal.  
(d) The Indemnified Party agrees to give the Indemnifying Party reasonable
access to the books and records and employees of the Indemnified Party in
connection with the matters for which indemnification is sought hereunder, to
the extent the Indemnifying Party reasonably deems necessary in connection
with its rights and obligations hereunder.   (e) The Indemnified Party shall
assist and cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in the conduct of
litigation, the making of settlements and the enforcement of any right of
contribution to which the Indemnified Party may be entitled from any Person
in connection with the subject matter of any litigation subject to
indemnification hereunder. In addition, the Indemnified Party shall, upon
request by the Indemnifying Party or counsel selected by the Indemnifying
Party (without payment of any fees or expenses to the Indemnified Party or an
employee thereof), attend hearings and trials, assist in the securing and
giving of evidence, assist in obtaining the presence or cooperation of
witnesses, and make available its own personnel; and shall do whatever
else is necessary and appropriate in connection with such litigation. The
Indemnified Party shall not make any demand upon the Indemnifying Party or
counsel for the Indemnifying Party in connection with any litigation subject
to indemnification hereunder, except a general demand for indemnification as
provided hereunder. If the Indemnified Party   62   shall fail to
perform such obligations as Indemnified Party hereunder or to cooperate fully
with the Indemnifying Party in Indemnifying Party\'s defense of any suit or
proceeding, such cooperation to include, without limitation, attendance at
all relevant depositions and the provision of all documents (subject to
appropriate privileges) relevant to the defense of any claim, then, except
where such failure does not materially impair the Indemnifying
Party\'s defense of such claims after notice to the Indemnified Party and ten
(10) days to cure, the Indemnifying Party shall be released from all of its
obligations under this Agreement with respect to that suit or proceeding and
any other claims which had been raised in such suit or proceeding.   (f)
Following indemnification as provided for hereunder, the Indemnifying Party
shall be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnified Party with respect to
all Persons relating to the matter for which indemnification has been made;
provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall have no subrogation
rights to seek reimbursement through or from the Indemnified
Party\'s insurance policies, program, coverage, carriers or
beneficiaries.   10.5 Exclusive. Other than claims for fraud or equitable
relief (which equitable relief claims are nevertheless subject to Section
10.1), any claim arising under this Agreement or in connection with or as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Damages or
injury alleged to be suffered by any party as a result of the actions or
failure to act by any other party shall, unless otherwise specifically stated
in this Agreement, be governed solely and exclusively by the provisions of
this Article 10 and the Indemnity Escrow Agreement. If Seller and Purchaser
cannot resolve such claim by mutual agreement, such claim shall be determined
by adjudication by a court or similar tribunal subject to the provisions of
this Article 10.   ARTICLE 11   TAX AND COST REPORT MATTERS   11.1 Tax
Matters; Allocation of Purchase Price.   (a) After the Closing Date, the
parties shall cooperate fully with each other and shall make available to
each other, as reasonably requested, all information, records or documents
relating to tax liabilities or potential tax liabilities attributable to
Seller with respect to the operation of the Hospitals for all periods prior
to the Effective Time and shall preserve all such information, records and
documents at least until the expiration of any applicable statute of
limitations or extensions thereof. The parties shall also make available to
each other as reasonably required, and at the reasonable cost of the
requesting party (for out-of-pocket costs and expenses only),
personnel responsible for preparing or maintaining information, records and
documents in connection with tax matters.   (b) The Purchase Price shall be
allocated among each of the Hospitals in accordance with Schedule 11.1(b).
Seller and Purchaser acknowledge and agree that the portion of the Purchase
Price which is allocated on Schedule 11.1(b) to Saint Vincent Hospital is the
value of the property, plant and equipment of SVH only and does not reflect
any value attributable to the working capital of SVH, and that the value of
the property, plant and   63   equipment of SVH and all net working
capital of SVH (commonly referred to as the "enterprise value") would be
Seventy One Million Six Hundred Eighty Thousand Dollars ($71,680,000). Seller
and Purchaser hereby agree to allocate the Purchase Price in accordance with
Schedule 11.1(b), to be bound by such allocations, to account for and report
the purchase and sale of the Hospitals contemplated hereby for federal and
state tax purposes in accordance with such allocations, and not to take any
position (whether in tax returns, tax audits, or other tax proceedings),
which is inconsistent with such allocations without the prior written consent
of the other parties. Within one hundred twenty (120) calendar days following
the Closing Date, Purchaser shall provide Seller a proposed detailed
allocation of the Purchase Price among each category of Assets for each of
the Hospitals. Such allocation shall be in accordance with Section 1060 of
the Internal Revenue Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder. Purchaser\'s proposed allocation shall become final
and binding on the parties thirty (30) calendar days after Purchaser provides
the proposal to Seller, unless Seller objects in writing (in which case,
Seller shall propose an allocation). If the parties cannot agree on the
allocation, the parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve
any disputes, but if a final resolution is not reached within thirty (30)
calendar days after Seller has submitted its objection in writing, each of
Purchaser and Seller shall make their own independent allocation of the total
consideration among each category of the Assets. To the extent Seller and
Purchaser reach agreement upon the allocation (or Seller does not otherwise
object in writing to Purchaser\'s proposed allocation as described above),
Seller and Purchaser hereby agree to be bound by such allocation, to account
for and report the purchase and sale of the Assets contemplated hereby for
federal and state tax purposes in accordance with such allocation, and not to
take any position (whether in tax returns, tax audits, or other tax
proceedings), which is inconsistent with such allocation without the prior
written consent of the other parties.   11.2 Cost Report Matters.   (a)
Seller shall prepare and timely file all cost reports relating to the periods
ending prior to the Effective Time or required as a result of
the consummation of the transactions described in this Agreement, including,
without limitation, those relating to Medicare, Medicaid, Blue Cross and
other third party payors which settle on a cost report basis (the "Seller
Cost Reports"). Purchaser shall forward to Seller any and all correspondence
relating to the Accounts Receivable, the Seller Cost Reports or rights to
settlements and retroactive adjustments on the Seller Cost Reports ("Agency
Settlements") within fifteen (15) business days after receipt by Purchaser.
Purchaser shall not reply to any such correspondence without Seller\'s
written approval. Purchaser shall remit any receipts relating to the Accounts
Receivable, the Seller Cost Reports or the Agency Settlements within fifteen
(15) business days after receipt by Purchaser (except those receipts to be
retained by Purchaser pursuant to Section 11.3) and will forward any demand
for payments within fifteen (15) business days. Purchaser (and its respective
successors-in-interest, assigns and affiliates) shall have neither the right
to offset amounts payable to Seller under this Section 11.2 against, nor the
right to contest its obligation to transfer, assign and convey to Seller
because of, outstanding claims, liabilities or obligations asserted by
Purchaser against Seller including but not limited to pursuant to the post-
closing Cash Purchase Price adjustment of Section 1.4 and the indemnification
provisions of Section 10.2. Seller shall retain all rights to the Seller Cost
Reports and to the Accounts Receivable including, without limitation, any
payables resulting therefrom or receivables relating thereto and the right to
appeal any Medicare determinations relating to the Agency Settlements and the
Seller Cost Reports. Seller   64   will furnish copies of the business
records relating to Accounts Receivable to Purchaser upon request and allow
Purchaser and its representatives reasonable access to such documents.  
(b) Upon reasonable notice and during normal business office hours, Purchaser
will cooperate with Seller, at Seller\'s expense (but only with respect to
out-of-pocket costs), in regard to the preparation, filing, handling,
and appeals of the Seller Cost Reports. Upon reasonable notice and during
normal business office hours, Purchaser will cooperate with Seller, at
Seller\'s expense (but only with respect to out-of-pocket costs), in
connection with any cost report disputes and/or other claim adjudication
matters relative to governmental program reimbursement. Such cooperation
shall include obtaining files at the Hospitals and Purchaser\'s provision to
Seller of data and statistics, including, without limitation, the items set
forth on Schedule 11.2(b), and the coordination with Seller pursuant to
reasonable notice of Medicare and Medicaid exit conferences or meetings.
Purchaser shall provide to Seller such data, statistics and items requested
by Seller no later than twenty (20) days after the date upon which Purchaser
has received such request.   (c) The parties acknowledge that
disproportionate share payments are determined by Medicaid for a particular
fiscal year based on Hospital data taken from a previous fiscal year. If a
party receives after Closing one or more Medicaid disproportionate share
payments in respect of a Medicaid fiscal year that straddles the Effective
Time, then, regardless of the particular Medicaid fiscal year from which the
data used to determine the payment was taken, the payment shall be
apportioned between Seller and Purchaser based on the number of months prior
to the Effective Time (in the case of Seller) and after the Effective Time
(in the case of Purchaser) Seller and Purchaser each owned the Hospital.  
(d) To the extent that Medicare, Medicaid, Blue Cross and other third party
payors offset any amounts owing to Purchaser for periods from and after the
Effective Time, or require Purchaser to pay any amounts to such third parties
for periods from and after the Effective Time, in each case, as a result of
any amounts owing (or allegedly owing) to such third parties by Seller
in respect of periods prior to the Effective Time (the "Offset Amounts"),
Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller of the same and, within fifteen (15)
business days of receipt of such notice, Seller shall reimburse Purchaser the
amount that has been offset or the amount that Purchaser is required to pay,
as applicable. Without limiting Seller\'s obligations contained in this
Section 11.2(d), (i) Seller shall have the right to dispute with the
applicable payor any such offsets or amounts alleged to be owed to such
payor, (ii) Seller and Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate with each other
in connection with Seller\'s pursuit of such dispute and (iii) if Purchaser
subsequently receives any refund from the applicable payor of any amount
which Seller has paid to Purchaser pursuant to this Section 11.2(d),
Purchaser shall, within fifteen (15) business days after receipt thereof, pay
such amount to Seller. Neither Seller nor Purchaser (and its respective
successors-in-interest, assigns and affiliates), as the case may be, shall
have the right to offset amounts payable to the other under this Section
11.2(d) against, nor the right to contest its obligation to transfer, assign
and convey to the other because of, outstanding claims, liabilities
or obligations asserted by that party against the other party, including but
not limited to, pursuant to the indemnification provisions of Article 10.  
11.3 Transition Patients. To compensate each of Seller and Purchaser
for inpatient hospital services rendered and medicine, drugs, and supplies
provided at the Hospitals (the   65   "Transition Services") with
respect to patients who are admitted to the Hospitals prior to the Effective
Time but who are not discharged until on or after the Effective Time
("Transition Patients"), the parties shall take the following actions:  
(a) It is the intent of the parties that Medicare and Medicaid not pay more
for Transition Services provided by Seller and Purchaser to
Transition Patients whose medical care is paid for, in whole or in part, by
Medicare or Medicaid on a fee-for-service basis ("Government Program
Transition Patients") than Medicare or Medicaid, as applicable, would
otherwise have paid to Seller with respect to the DRG payment for such
patients if the transactions contemplated in this Agreement had not occurred.
Therefore, Purchaser shall provide Transition Services to each Government
Program Transition Patient on behalf of Seller from the Effective Time until
the earlier of: (i) the discharge of the patient; or (ii) 11:59 p.m. on the
date which is thirty (30) days after the Closing Date. In the event that any
Government Program Transition Patient is still admitted at any of the
Hospitals at 12:00 a.m. on the date which is thirty-one (31) days after the
Closing Date, the parties shall document the transfer of such patient from
Seller to Purchaser in accordance with applicable Medicare or Medicaid
procedures. Seller shall bill Medicare or Medicaid, as applicable, in its
name and in accordance with applicable Medicare or Medicaid procedures for
Transition Services furnished to each Government Program Transition Patient
prior to the earlier of (i) the discharge of the patient or (ii) 11:59 p.m.
on the date which is thirty (30) days after the Closing Date. Purchaser shall
not bill for any Transition Services provided to Government Program
Transition Patients after the Effective Time; provided, however, that if a
Government Program Transition Patient is transferred to Purchaser pursuant
to this Section 11.3(a), Purchaser shall bill Medicare or Medicaid, as
applicable, in its name and in accordance with applicable Medicare or
Medicaid procedures only for services provided to such patient following such
transfer. Purchaser shall provide to Seller copies of all medical records and
other information reasonably required in order for Seller to bill Medicare
and Medicaid for Transition Services and shall cooperate with Seller to
facilitate such billing activities. Without limiting the foregoing, Seller
and Purchaser shall achieve consensus regarding the coding of all Transition
Services to be billed by Seller pursuant to this Section 11.3(a).   (b) The
aggregate reimbursement received by Seller with respect to Transition
Services provided to each Government Program Transition Patient shall be
apportioned between Seller and Purchaser based upon the ratio of the
total charges for the Transition Services provided to such Government
Program Transition Patient by Seller, or Purchaser, as the case may be, to
the sum of the total charges for the Transition Services provided to such
Government Program Transition Patient by Seller and Purchaser. All such
payments shall be reconciled within thirty (30) days following receipt by
Seller of reimbursement with respect to Transition Services provided to the
applicable Government Program Transition Patient. In the event that (i)
Seller receives additional amounts following a successful Medicare or
Medicaid appeal (which appeal will or will not be undertaken in the
discretion of the party who is entitled to the greater share of the claimed
reimbursement under the apportionment methodology described above, with the
cost of such appeal apportioned between the parties in a like manner) or (ii)
Medicare or Medicaid reopens and adjusts such reimbursement determination,
the parties shall re-apportion the aggregate reimbursement received by Seller
in the manner described in this Section 11.3(b).   (c) The parties shall
document the transfer of all other Transition Patients ("Transferred
Transition Patients") from Seller to Purchaser as of the Effective Time.
Seller and   66   Purchaser shall each bill the applicable payor in
accordance with applicable payor procedures for Transition Services provided
by such party to each Transferred Transition Patient. In the event that
either Seller or Purchaser is denied reimbursement in whole or in part as a
result of any such transfer (including transfers of Government Program
Transition Patients pursuant to Section 11.3(a)), the parties shall apportion
the aggregate reimbursement received by both Seller and Purchaser with
respect to Transition Services provided to such patient in the manner
described in Section 11.3(b).   (d) In the event that Seller and Purchaser
are unable to agree on the amounts to be paid by one party to the other, or
whether any payment is due under this Section 11.3, then such amounts shall
be determined by the Independent Auditor at their joint expense.   (e)
Neither party (nor their respective successors-in-interest, assigns and
affiliates) shall have the right to offset amounts payable under this Section
11.3 against, or to contest its obligation to make any payment pursuant to
this Section 11.3 to the other party because of, outstanding
claims, liabilities or obligations asserted by such party against the other
party including but not limited to pursuant to the post-closing Cash Purchase
Price adjustment of Section 1.4 and the indemnification provisions of Article
10.   (f) If the Hospitals\' fiscal intermediary requires or requests
that Seller and Purchaser use a billing method for services rendered to
Transition Patients that differs from the method described in this Section
11.3, Seller and Purchaser shall comply with the fiscal intermediary\'s
requirement or request and shall equitably adjust the aggregate reimbursement
received by Seller and Purchaser for such services to ensure that each party
receives the same proportion of the aggregate reimbursement as such party
would have received had the parties followed the method described above in
this Section 11.3.   ARTICLE 12   MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS   12.1
Further Assurances and Cooperation. Seller shall execute, acknowledge and
deliver to Purchaser any and all other assignments, consents,
approvals, conveyances, assurances, documents and instruments reasonably
requested by Purchaser at any time and shall take any and all other actions
reasonably requested by Purchaser at any time for the purpose of more
effectively assigning, transferring, granting, conveying and confirming to
Purchaser, the Assets. After consummation of the transaction contemplated in
this Agreement, the parties agree to cooperate with each other and take such
further actions as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate, carry out
and comply with all of the terms of this Agreement, the documents referred to
in this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.   12.2
Successors and Assigns. All of the terms and provisions of this Agreement

the respective successors and assigns of the parties hereto; provided,
however, that no party hereto may assign any of its rights or delegate any of
its duties under this Agreement without the prior written consent of
the other parties, except that Purchaser may assign any of its rights or
delegate any of its duties under this Agreement to any one or more wholly-
owned subsidiaries of Purchaser or of   67   Vanguard upon Seller\'s
receipt of Purchaser\'s guaranty of such wholly-owned subsidiary\'s
obligations, in a form reasonably acceptable to Seller. If Purchaser consents
to any assignment of any of Seller\'s rights under this Agreement, such
Seller shall remain bound by all of the obligations hereunder, including
those set forth under Article 10 hereof.   12.3 Governing Law; Venue. This
Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with
the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as applied to contracts made
and performed within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The parties hereby
waive their right to assert in any proceeding involving this Agreement that

shall apply to such dispute; and the parties hereby covenant that they shall
assert no such claim in any dispute arising under this Agreement. Any
proceeding which arises out of or relates in any way to the subject matter of
this Agreement shall be brought in the Superior Court of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, Suffolk County or the United States District Court for the

connection with the execution of this Agreement and the activities of
Purchaser prior to the termination hereof which activities are reasonably

originals for all purposes hereof and that a party may produce such copies,
without the need to produce original signatures, to prove the existence of
this Agreement in any proceeding brought hereunder.   12.14 Entire

understanding between the parties with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby and supersede all prior or contemporaneous

may be waived at any time by the party which is entitled to the benefit
thereof but only by a written notice signed by the party expressly waiving

a party shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding breach by any
other party of any term, covenant or condition of this Agreement, other than
the failure of such other party to perform the particular duties so accepted,
regardless of the accepting party\'s knowledge of such preceding breach at
the time of acceptance of such performance. The waiver of any term, covenant
or condition shall not be construed as a waiver of any other term, covenant
or condition of this Agreement.   12.16 Severability. If any term,
provision, condition or covenant of this Agreement or the application thereof
to any party or circumstance shall be held to be invalid or unenforceable to
any extent in any jurisdiction, then the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such term, provision, condition or covenant in any other
jurisdiction or to Persons or circumstances other than those as to whom or
which it is held to be invalid or unenforceable, shall not be affected
thereby, and each term, provision, condition and covenant of this Agreement
shall be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.  
71    12.17 Late Payments. If Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be,
shall fail to make any payment to the other on the date due, then the party
failing to receive such amount to which it is entitled shall have the right
to receive interest on the unpaid amount at a per annum rate equal to the
prime rate reported by the Wall Street Journal under "Money Rates" on the
