and shall grant such consent if the specific action, omission, waiver or modification, considered
separately or together with all such other actions, omissions, waivers or modifications consented
to by Seller, would not reasonably be expected to adversely impact the Contingent Consideration
that otherwise would be achievable in the absence of such action(s), omission(s), waiver(s) and/or
modification(s). For the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained in this <U>Section&nbsp;1.05(f)</U> is
intended to restrict Buyer&#146;s right to control the Purchased Subsidiaries and their Subsidiaries in

of expenses and requiring compliance with Buyer&#146;s and its Affiliates&#146; internal controls, corporate
governance policies and procedures, legal and regulatory compliance standards and other similar
matters. Accordingly, Seller acknowledges and agrees that, in the event that any of the provisions
of this <U>Section&nbsp;1.05(f)</U> shall be breached in a manner that, individually or in the
aggregate, materially and adversely affects the Contingent Consideration payable, Seller&#146;s sole and
exclusive remedy shall be a claim or action to recalculate and/or appropriately adjust the
Contingent Consideration payable by Buyer and/or, only in the event that any of the provisions of
<U>Sections&nbsp;1.05(f)(i)</U>, <U>1.05(f)(ii)</U>, <U>1.05(f)(iii)</U> or <U>1.05(f)(v)</U> are

<U>Section&nbsp;1.05(f)</U>. Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer acknowledges that its actions or
omissions in respect of control of the Purchased Subsidiaries and their Subsidiaries may impact the
calculation of or give rise to an adjustment of the amount of the Contingent Consideration, and may
also result in an Acceleration Event. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,

addition, the Parties acknowledge and agree that Seller&#146;s rights and Buyer&#146;s obligation to pay

of the membership interests of Sub I and Sub II provided for herein as a purchase and sale of all
of the assets of Sub I and Sub II and an assumption of all of the liabilities of Sub I and Sub II.
Accordingly, the Purchase Price (plus such assumed liabilities, to the extent properly taken into
account under the Code) and any other consideration payable to Seller pursuant to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the &#147;<U>Allocation Amount</U>&#148;) shall be allocated among the
acquired capital stock of KUED and the Indian Company (the &#147;<U>Allocation</U>&#148;). Prior to the
Closing, Buyer and Seller shall cooperate to obtain an appropriate certificate from an
international firm of chartered accountants in India mutually agreeable to Buyer and Seller,
certifying the value of the Indian Company (the &#147;<U>Allocation Value</U>&#148;) and the amount of
withholding Tax to be imposed on the sale of Seller&#146;s capital stock in the Indian Company (the
&#147;<U>Indian Withholding Tax</U>&#148;). Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, shall
each pay one half of the fees and expense of such accountant. For purposes of the Allocation, the
acquired capital stock of the Indian Company shall be allocated the Allocation Value. The excess
of the Allocation Amount over the Allocation Value shall be allocated to the acquired capital stock
of KUED.

Allocation for all applicable Tax purposes (including filing IRS Form&nbsp;8594 with their U.S. federal
income Tax Return for the taxable year that includes the Closing Date and in the course of any
audit, review or litigation), and (iii)&nbsp;take no position and cause their Affiliates to take no
position inconsistent with the Allocation for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by applicable
Law or unless the other Party consents thereto, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration payable to any Person pursuant to
this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement any amounts that Buyer or the Escrow Agent may be required
to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision
of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Buyer or the
Escrow Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to such Person. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall be permitted to deduct and
withhold from the consideration payable to Seller an amount equal to the Indian Withholding Tax;
<U>provided</U>, that Buyer shall provide Seller with evidence reasonably satisfactory to Seller
that such Indian Withholding Tax has been timely paid by Buyer, on behalf of Seller and in Seller&#146;s
name, to the proper Indian Tax authorities.

hereafter be contained in the Rules. There shall be a single arbitrator who shall be mutually
agreed upon by the Parties. In the event the Parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator within
20&nbsp;days following the commencement of the arbitration (in accordance with the Rules), on the
request of any Party JAMS will select an arbitrator in accordance with the procedures set forth in
the Rules. No arbitrator shall have any past or present family, business or other relationship
with either Party or its Affiliates, unless, following full disclosure of all such relationships,
the Parties agree in writing in their respective sole discretions to waive such requirement with
respect to an individual in connection with any dispute. The arbitrator shall have the authority to
grant any and all equitable and legal remedies that would be available if a judicial proceeding had
been instituted to resolve the dispute. The arbitrator will furnish a written decision and award
to each of the Parties, which decision and award will be final and binding on the Parties and may
be entered an enforced in any court having jurisdiction. The Parties shall keep confidential any
arbitration conducted in accordance with this <U>Section&nbsp;11.11</U>; <U>except</U> as may be
required by law or legal process and provided that such parties may discuss the arbitration with
their respective advisors and attorneys who shall be bound to protect such confidentiality; and
<U>provided</U>, <U>further</U> that either Party may take such steps as may be necessary to
confirm and enforce the award in a public judicial proceeding. Unless otherwise ordered by the
arbitrator, no discovery other than an exchange of documents directly relevant to the issues in
dispute may occur in any arbitration other than upon a showing of unusual and substantial need.
The Parties shall in good faith promptly exchange relevant, non-privileged documents created prior
to the commencement of the arbitration and not likely to be in the possession of the other Party.
The arbitrator shall be instructed to hold a hearing regarding the dispute within ninety (90)&nbsp;days
of his or her appointment and to render a decision no later than 30&nbsp;days after the conclusion of
such hearing, in each case unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing by the Parties. The Parties
agree, however, that in the event that these time periods are not strictly adhered to, this shall
not be used a basis for setting aside an award. Any issue concerning the extent to which any
dispute is subject to arbitration, or concerning the applicability, interpretation, or
enforceability of any of the Rules or the provisions of this agreement to arbitrate shall be
resolved by the arbitrator. An arbitrator chosen in accordance with these provisions will not have
the power to alter, amend or otherwise affect the terms of these arbitration provisions or any
other provisions contained in this Section or this Agreement.

arbitration, between the Parties in the manner the arbitrator determines to be the most equitable,

the equities dictate otherwise.
