 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, representations and warranties and mutual covenants contained herein and of other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

   

ARTICLE I 

   

 _PURCHASE AND SALE_  

  

 1.01 _Purchase and Sale of Securities_. At the Closing, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, Seller shall sell, assign, transfer and convey, free and clear of all Liens, to Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase and acquire from each Seller, all of the Securities held by Seller as of immediately prior to the Closing, in exchange for a payment by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Seller of an amount 

   ##### 

  

 

equal to (i) the Closing Date Purchase Price, _minus_ (ii) the Indemnification

 1.02 _Delivery of Estimates; Calculation of Consideration_. 

  

 (a) On or prior to the third Business Day prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a certificate (the " _Closing Payment Certificate_ "), setting forth (i) Sellers good faith estimate of the Net Working Capital Amount (the " _Estimated Net Working Capital Amount_ "), (ii) the aggregate amount, if any, of Transaction Expenses that will be unpaid at the Closing (the " _Unpaid Transaction Expenses_ ") and (iii) the aggregate amount, if any, of Indebtedness for Borrowed Money that will be unpaid at the Closing (the " _Unpaid Indebtedness_ "). Seller shall consult with Buyer in connection with and with respect to the preparation of the Closing Payment Certificate and the parties will cooperate in good faith to resolve any dispute with respects to the items set forth on the Closing Payment Certificate prior to Closing. 

   

 (b) For purposes hereof, the " _Closing Date Purchase Price_ " means an amount equal to the sum of (i) $140,000,000 (the " _Base Consideration_ "), _minus_ (ii) the Expected Base Transaction Incentive Plan Amount, _plus_ (iii) the amount, if any, by which the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount exceeds the Target Net Working Capital Amount, _minus_  (iv) the amount, if any, by which the Target Net Working Capital Amount exceeds the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount, _minus_ (v) without duplication, the aggregate amount, if any, of Unpaid Transaction Expenses, and _minus_ (vi) without duplication, the aggregate amount, if any, of Unpaid Indebtedness. 

   

 (c) The Closing Date Purchase Price will be adjusted in accordance with _Section 1.04_ below, and such adjusted amount, together with any Contingent Purchase Price payable pursuant to  _Section 1.05_ below, is referred to herein as the " _Purchase Price_." The Purchase Price, together with the Transaction Incentive Plan Amount, is referred to herein as the " _Aggregate Consideration_." 

   

 1.03 _The Closing; Payment for Securities, Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses_. 

  

 (a) The closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP located at Four Times Square, New York, New York at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time on the second Business Day following satisfaction or waiver of all of the closing conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (other than those to be satisfied at the Closing) or on such other date as is mutually agreeable to Buyer and Seller. The date on which the Closing shall occur is referred to herein as the " _Closing Date_." 

   

 (b) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, the parties hereto shall consummate the following transactions as of the Closing: 

    

 (i) Buyer shall deliver to Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated by Seller, the consideration specified in _Section 1.01_; 

   ##### 

  

   

 (ii) Pursuant to _Section 1.01_, Seller shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Buyer, (x) the certificates representing the portion of the Securities constituting the shares of capital stock of KUED to be transferred to Buyer, duly endorsed for transfer, which Securities so transferred to Buyer by Seller in the aggregate shall represent all of the outstanding equity interests of KUED, or accompanied by appropriate transfer documents and (y) the amendments to the operating agreements of Sub I and Sub II documenting the transfer of the portion of the Securities constituting all of the membership interests of Sub I and Sub II to Buyer; 

   

 (iii) Buyer shall deliver the Indemnification Escrow Amount to the Escrow Agent in accordance with _Section 1.06_; 

   

 (iv) Buyer shall deliver the Expected Base Transaction Incentive Plan Amount as follows: (a) Buyer shall deliver the Transaction Incentive Plan Indemnity Amount to the Escrow Agent in accordance with _Section 1.06_ and (b) Buyer shall deliver the remainder of the Expected Base Transaction Incentive Plan Amount to the Purchased Subsidiaries and their Subsidiaries in proportion to the Expected Base Transaction Incentive Plan Amount allocable to the Participants (as defined in the Transaction Incentive Plan) of each such entity under the Transaction Incentive Plan as of the Closing; 

   

 (v) Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, on behalf of Seller and/or its Subsidiaries, the Unpaid Transaction Expenses by wire transfer of immediately available funds to accounts specified by Seller prior to the Closing in the Closing Payment Certificate; and 

   

 (vi) Buyer and Seller shall make such other deliveries as are required by and in accordance with _Article VII_ hereof. 

  

 (c) Prior to or at Closing, Seller shall pay or cause the Purchased Subsidiaries and their Subsidiaries to pay any and all Indebtedness for Borrowed Money of the Purchased Subsidiaries and their Subsidiaries so that none of such entities will have any Indebtedness for Borrowed Money as of the Closing. All Indebtedness for Borrowed Money of the Purchased Subsidiaries and their Subsidiaries required to be discharged pursuant to this _Section 1.03(c)_ is set forth on  _Schedule 1.03(c)_, describing the borrower, lender and any collateral securing such Indebtedness for Borrowed Money. 

   

 1.04 _Net Working Capital and Base Transaction Incentive Plan_. 

  

 (a) _Determination_. As promptly as practicable, but in any event within 75 days after the Closing Date, Buyer will deliver to Seller a consolidated balance sheet of the Purchased Subsidiaries as of 11:59 p.m. Pacific Time on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, which shall be prepared in accordance with the Accounting Practices and Procedures, and a reasonably detailed statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") setting forth Buyers calculations of the Net Working Capital Amount. After delivery of the Closing Statement and until any dispute with respect thereto is finally resolved, Seller and its accountants shall be permitted reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, to review 

      ##### 

  

    

the Purchased Subsidiaries books and records (including the work papers of
the Purchased Subsidiaries accountants) related to the preparation of the
Closing Statement or the calculation of any amount thereon; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such access does not (i) unreasonably disrupt the normal
operations of the Business, (ii) result in the waiver of any attorney-client
privilege or the disclosure of any trade secrets or (iii) violate any Law or
the terms of any applicable Contract. Seller and its accountants may make
inquiries of Buyer, the Purchased Subsidiaries and their accountants
regarding questions concerning or disagreements with the Closing Statement
arising in the course of their review thereof, and each of Buyer and
the Purchased Subsidiaries shall, and shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to cause such accountants to, cooperate with and respond to such
inquiries and, subject to the foregoing, to provide all information in their
(or their accountants) possession that is related to such review or the
resolution of such disagreements. If Seller has any objections to the Closing
Statement, it shall deliver to Buyer a statement setting forth its objections
thereto (a " _Purchase Price Adjustment Objections Statement_ "); _provided_
, _however_ , that the Purchase Price Adjustment Objections Statement shall
include only objections based on whether (i) the amounts set forth on the
Closing Statement were prepared in a manner consistent with the Accounting
Practices and Procedures and (ii) there were mathematical errors in the
computation of the Net Working Capital Amount. Any Purchase Price Adjustment
Objections Statement shall specify those items or amounts with which Seller
disagrees, together with a detailed written explanation of the reasons for
disagreement with each such item or amount, and shall set forth Sellers
calculation of Closing Net Working Capital based on such objections. To the
extent not set forth in the Purchase Price Adjustment Objections Statement,
Seller shall be deemed to have agreed with Buyers calculation of all other
items and amounts contained in the Closing Statement. If a Purchase Price
Adjustment Objections Statement is not delivered to Buyer within 30 days
after delivery of the Closing Statement, the Closing Statement shall be
final, binding and non-appealable on the Parties hereto. Seller and Buyer
shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any objections set forth in the
Purchase Price Adjustment Objections Statement (and all such discussions
related thereto shall be governed by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of
Evidence and any applicable similar state rule and evidence of such
discussions shall not be admissible in any future proceedings between the
Parties). If, for any reason, the Parties do not reach a final resolution
within 15 days after the delivery of the Purchase Price Adjustment Objections
Statement, they shall mutually engage and submit such dispute to KPMG LLP
(the " _Accounting Referee_ ") for final and binding resolution. If any
dispute is submitted to the Accounting Referee, each Party will furnish to
the Accounting Referee and the other Party such work papers and other
documents and information relating to the disputed issues as the Accounting
Referee may reasonably request and are available to that Party or its
independent accountants, and each Party shall be afforded the opportunity to
present the Accounting Referee material relating to the determination and to
discuss the determination with the Accounting Referee. The Accounting Referee
shall resolve only the matters in dispute and adjust and establish any
disputed adjustment of the Closing Date Purchase Price to reflect such
resolution. In the engagement letter or agreement pursuant to which Seller
and Buyer mutually engage the Accounting Referee, the Accounting Referee
shall be required, in reaching its final and binding determination as to
each item in dispute, (i) not to assign a value to any item in dispute greater
than the greatest value assigned to such item, or less than the smallest
value assigned to such item, in each case, by Buyer in the Closing Statement
or by Seller in the Purchase Price Adjustment Objections Statement and (ii)
to base such determination upon, and 

      ##### 

  

    

ensure that such determination is consistent with the Accounting Practices and
Procedures and the definitions set forth in this Agreement. Seller and Buyer
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting
Referee to reach its written determination as soon as practicable and no
later than 45 days after such dispute was submitted to the Accounting
Referee, or as soon as practicable thereafter. The determination of the
dispute by the Accounting Referee shall be final, binding and non-appealable
on the Parties and such determination may be entered and enforced in any
court having jurisdiction (the date of such determination, the "
_Final Determination Date_ "). The Closing Statement shall be modified if
necessary to reflect such determination (the Closing Statement, as modified
if necessary, the " _Final Closing Statement_ "). The fees and expenses of
the Accounting Referee shall be allocated to be paid by Buyer and/or Seller
based upon the percentage which the portion of the contested amount not
awarded to each Party bears to the amount actually contested by such Party,
as determined by the Accounting Referee. 

   

 (b) _Adjustments_. 

    

 (i) _Net Working Capital Adjustment_. If the Net Working Capital Amount as finally determined pursuant to _Section 1.04(a)_ above is greater than the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount, Buyer shall pay such excess to Seller in accordance with  _Section 1.04(c)_. If the Net Working Capital Amount as finally determined pursuant to _Section 1.04(a)_ above is less than the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount, Seller shall pay or cause to be paid such shortfall to Buyer in accordance with _Section 1.04(c)_. 

   

 (ii) _Base Transaction Incentive Plan Amount Adjustment_. If the Expected Base Transaction Incentive Plan Amount is greater than the Actual Base Transaction Incentive Plan Amount to which employees of the Purchased Subsidiaries and their Subsidiaries become entitled and are paid in accordance with Section 4(a) of the Transaction Incentive Plan, Buyer shall pay the full amount of such excess to Seller in accordance with _Section 1.04(c)_. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Actual Base Transaction Incentive Plan Amount_ " means the aggregate amount actually paid by the Purchased Subsidiaries and their Subsidiaries to Participants as Initial Bonuses under (and within the meaning of) the Transaction Incentive Plan. 

  

 (c) _Adjustment Amount_. Without duplication, all amounts owed pursuant to _Sections 1.04(b)(i)_ and _(ii)_ shall be aggregated, and the net amount (if any) owed by Buyer to Seller, on the one hand, or by Seller to Buyer, on the other hand, is referred to as the " _Adjustment Amount_ "; it being understood and agreed that if the net effect pursuant to this  _Section 1.04(c)_ is an increase in the Closing Date Purchase Price, then Buyer shall make a cash payment to Seller of the Adjustment Amount, and if the net effect pursuant to this _Section 1.04(c)_ is a decrease in the Closing Date Purchase Price, then Seller and Buyer shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to pay to Buyer from the Indemnification Escrow Amount and the Transaction Incentive Plan Indemnity Amount in the Escrow Fund (in accordance with the Escrow Agreement) an aggregate amount equal to the Adjustment Amount; _provided_ , _however_  that to the extent the Indemnification Escrow Amount and the Transaction Incentive Plan Indemnity Amount are together insufficient to pay the full Adjustment Amount, then an amount equal to the 

      ##### 

  

    

excess of the Adjustment Amount over the amount paid to Buyer from the
Indemnification Escrow Amount and the Transaction Incentive Plan Indemnity
Amount shall be paid by Seller by wire transfer of immediately available
funds. The Adjustment Amount shall be calculated as an adjustment to
the Aggregate Consideration. Payment of the Adjustment Amount shall be
effected by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by the recipient Party within five Business Days after the Final
Determination Date. 

   

 (d) In the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the earliest date of final resolution of the Net Working Capital Amount, Actual Base Transaction Incentive Plan Amount and Adjustment Amount pursuant to this _Section 1.04_, no changes made by Buyer to the accounting methodology of the Business on which the Net Working Capital Amount or Adjustment Amount is to be based, shall have an impact upon the calculation of the Net Working Capital Amount, Actual Base Transaction Incentive Plan Amount or Adjustment Amount contemplated by this _Section 1.04_. 

   

 1.05 _Contingent Consideration_. 

  

 (a) In addition to the Closing Date Purchase Price and the Base Transaction Incentive Plan Amount, Buyer shall pay the Contingent Consideration, if any, determined and payable in accordance with this _Section 1.05_. As used herein, the " _Contingent Consideration_ " shall be an amount determined by reference to the "Billed Revenue" actually achieved for the calendar year ended December 31, 2011 (" _CY2011_ ") and calculated as set forth in this _Section 1.05_ , as follows: 

    

 (i) If CY2011 Billed Revenues are less than $36.5 million, there shall be no Contingent Consideration; 

   

 (ii) If CY2011 Billed Revenues are $49.0 million or greater, the Contingent Consideration shall be $20.0 million; and 

   

 (iii) If CY2011 Billed Revenues are greater than $36.5 million but less than $49.0 million, then the Contingent Consideration shall be an amount equal to the product of (A) $20.0 million, _multiplied by_ (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is (1) (x) 2011 Billed Revenues, _minus_ (y) $36.5 million, and the denominator of which is (2) $12.5 million. 

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event an Acceleration Event occurs, the
Contingent Consideration shall be $20,000,000. 

   

 (b) For purposes of this _Section 1.05_: 

    

 (i) " _Billed Revenue_ " means the aggregate amounts billed to customers and clients by the Purchased Subsidiaries and their Subsidiaries or by any Affiliate of the Buyer to the extent such billings arise out of the Business, in all cases, as set forth on invoices issued in CY2011 by or on behalf of the Purchased Subsidiaries, their Subsidiaries and/or such other Persons (or any successor(s) to any of them), _provided_ , that to the extent the Purchased Subsidiaries or their Subsidiaries products and services 

   ##### 

  

    

arising out of the Business are bundled with other products and services of
Buyer or its Affiliates and sold with any bulk or similar discount, rebate or
other similar reduction in pricing (each, a " _Discount_ "), and any portion
of such Discount is allocated to products and services attributable to the
Business, then for purposes of determining Contingent Consideration, such
portion of any such Discount will be added back to Billed Revenue (but only
to the extent such Discount is in excess of Discounts generally provided by
the Business in the ordinary course of business prior to the Closing); 
_provided_ , _further_ , that no amounts set forth on _Schedule 1.05(b)(i)_
shall be taken into account for purposes of "Billed Revenue." 

   

 (ii) " _Related Party Transaction_ " means any transaction relating to the revenue generating activities of the Business between Buyer, M and F Worldwide Corp. or any of their Subsidiaries (other than the Purchased Subsidiaries and their Subsidiaries), on the one hand, and the Purchased Subsidiaries and their Subsidiaries, on the other hand;  _provided_ , that "Related Party Transaction" shall not include: (x) transactions in the ordinary course of business, including bundling products and services of the Business with products and services of Buyer or its Affiliates; and (y) transactions related to any Intellectual Property of the Purchased Subsidiaries and their Subsidiaries that is made available to Buyer or any of its Affiliates for a particular use if Buyer and/or any of its Affiliates pays to the Purchased Subsidiaries or their Subsidiaries, as applicable, a license fee or other payment consistent with then-current market terms or terms consistent with terms provided by the Purchased Subsidiaries and the Subsidiaries to unaffiliated parties for such use (and, for the avoidance of doubt, such license fee or other payment will be included in Billed Revenue for purposes of determining the Contingent Consideration). 

  

 (c) As promptly as practicable, but in any event within 75 days following the last day of CY2011, unless an Acceleration Event has occurred, Buyer will deliver to Seller a statement (the " _Contingent Consideration Statement_ ") setting forth Buyers calculation of Billed Revenue and the resulting Contingent Consideration. If Buyer or its Affiliates elect to bundle the products and services of the Purchased Subsidiaries or their Subsidiaries with the products and services of Buyer or its other Affiliates, then the Contingent Consideration Statement shall also include (x) a reasonably detailed accounting of the recalculation of Billed Revenue in accordance with _Section 1.05(f)(i)_ below and (y) if applicable, information regarding prices charged for the products and services of the Purchased Subsidiaries or their Subsidiaries when sold without such bundling. After delivery of the Contingent Consideration Statement and until any dispute with respect thereto is finally resolved, Seller and its accountants shall be permitted reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, to review the Purchased Subsidiaries books and records (including the work papers of the Purchased Subsidiaries accountants) related to the preparation of the Contingent Consideration Statement or the calculation of any amount thereon; _provided_ , _however_ , that such access does not (i) unreasonably disrupt the normal operations of the Business, (ii) result in the waiver of any attorney-client privilege or the disclosure of any trade secrets or (iii) violate any Law or the terms of any applicable Contract. Seller and its accountants may make inquiries of Buyer, the Purchased Subsidiaries and their accountants regarding questions concerning or disagreements with the Contingent Consideration Statement arising in the course of their review thereof, and each of Buyer and the Purchased Subsidiaries shall, and shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause such accountants 

      ##### 

  

    

to, cooperate with and respond to such inquiries and, subject to the
foregoing, to provide all information in their (or their accountants)
possession that is related to such review or the resolution of such
disagreements. If Seller has any objections to the Contingent
Consideration Statement, it shall deliver to Buyer a statement setting forth
its objections thereto (a " _Contingent Consideration Objections Statement_
"). If a Contingent Consideration Objections Statement is not delivered to
Buyer within 45 days after delivery of the Contingent
Consideration Statement, the Contingent Consideration Statement shall be
final and binding on the Parties hereto. If a Contingent Consideration
Objections Statement is timely delivered to Buyer, Seller and Buyer shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve any objections set forth in the Contingent
Consideration Objections Statement (and all such discussions related thereto
shall be governed by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and any
applicable similar state rule and evidence of such discussions shall not be
admissible in any future proceedings between the Parties). If, for any reason,
Seller and Buyer do not reach a final resolution within 15 days after the
delivery of the Contingent Consideration Objections Statement then (i) to the
extent that such dispute relates to the determination of accounting matters,
Seller and Buyer shall mutually engage and submit such dispute to the
Accounting Referee for final and binding resolution or (ii) to the extent that
such dispute relates to any other matters (e.g., compliance with the
provisions of _Section 1.05(f)_ below) or if the Parties disagree as to
whether the dispute relates solely to the determination of accounting
matters, they shall resolve such dispute in accordance with the provisions of
_Section 11.11_ below. If any dispute is submitted to the Accounting
Referee, each Party will furnish to the Accounting Referee and the other
Party such work papers and other documents and information relating to the
disputed issues as the Accounting Referee may reasonably request and are
available to that Party or its independent accountants, and each Party shall
be afforded the opportunity to present the Accounting Referee material
relating to the determination and to discuss the determination with the
Accounting Referee. The Accounting Referee shall resolve matters in dispute
and adjust and establish the Contingent Consideration to reflect
such resolution. In the engagement letter or agreement pursuant to which
Seller and Buyer mutually engage the Accounting Referee, the Accounting
Referee shall be required, in reaching its final and binding determination as
to each item in dispute, (i) not to assign a value to any item in
dispute greater than the greatest value assigned to such item, or less than
the smallest value assigned to such item, in each case, by Buyer in the
Contingent Consideration Statement or by Seller in the Contingent
Consideration Objections Statement and (ii) to base such determination upon,
and ensure that such determination is consistent with, the Accounting
Practices and Procedures and the definitions set forth in this Agreement.
Seller and Buyer shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Accounting Referee to reach its written determination as soon as
practicable and no later than 45 days after such dispute was submitted to the
Accounting Referee, or as soon as practicable thereafter. The determination
by the Accounting Referee of the disputed accounting matters submitted to the
Accounting Referee shall be final, binding and non-appealable on the Parties
hereto and may be entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction. The
Contingent Consideration Statement shall be modified if necessary to reflect
such determination. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Referee shall be
allocated to be paid by Buyer and/or Seller based upon the percentage which
the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each Party bears to
the amount actually contested by such Party, as determined by the Accounting
Referee. 

        ##### 

  

     

 (d) Contingent Consideration shall be paid as follows: (i) if the Contingent Consideration Statement delivered by Buyer to Seller reflects Billed Revenues resulting in the obligation to pay any Contingent Consideration, then Buyer shall pay such amount concurrently with the delivery of the Contingent Consideration Statement, (ii) without limiting _clause (i)_ , if Seller delivers a Contingent Consideration Objections Statement to Buyer and Buyer becomes obligated to pay any Contingent Consideration or an amount of Contingent Consideration that exceeds any prior payments of Contingent Consideration, then within five Business Days of each such resolution (negotiated or otherwise), Buyer shall pay such amount, or additional amount(s) and/or (iii) as soon as practicable after, but in no event later than five Business Days following, an Acceleration Event. All payments of Contingent Consideration shall be effected as follows: (i) the portion of the Contingent Consideration that represents the Contingent Transaction Incentive Plan Amount shall be delivered to the Purchased Subsidiaries, their Subsidiaries or such other Affiliates who are (or were most recently) employing or, if a different entity, responsible for administering payroll, in either case, for the Contingent Consideration Participants (in proportion to the Contingent Consideration payable to the Contingent Consideration Participants at each such entity) by wire transfer of immediately available funds, and Buyer shall cause such entities to pay all such amounts to such Contingent Consideration Participants in accordance with the terms of the Transaction Incentive Plan, promptly upon receipt by such entities, but in any event, within fifteen (15) days thereafter, and (ii) the remaining portion of the Contingent Consideration (referred to herein as the " _Contingent Purchase Price_ ") shall be delivered to Seller by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Seller. For purposes of this Agreement, (A) the term " _Contingent Transaction Incentive Plan Amount_ " means the portion of the Contingent Consideration determined by multiplying the Contingent Consideration by a fraction, (x) the numerator of which equals the aggregate amount of the Initial Bonuses actually paid to all Contingent Consideration Participants, and (y) the denominator of which equals (1) the Closing Date Purchase Price, _plus_ (2) the Actual Base Transaction Incentive Plan Amount,  _minus_ (3) the Indemnification Escrow Amount, and _minus_ (4) the Transaction Incentive Plan Indemnity Amount and (B) the term " _Contingent Consideration Participant_ " means each Participant who remains eligible to receive a Contingent Consideration Bonus on the applicable Contingent Consideration Bonus Date (each as defined in the Transaction Incentive Plan). 

   

 (e) In the event that at any time prior to December 31, 2011, (i) there occurs a liquidation or dissolution of the Purchased Subsidiaries other than into an Affiliate of Buyer, (ii) there occurs a sale, license or other transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Purchased Subsidiaries to a Person that is not an Affiliate of Buyer in one or a series of transactions, (iii) there occurs a merger, reorganization, consolidation or share exchange in which the outstanding equity securities of the Purchased Subsidiaries are cancelled, converted into or exchanged for a different kind of securities of the successor entity and the successor entity is not an Affiliate of Buyer, (iv) there occurs an acquisition of all or substantially all of the outstanding equity securities of the Purchased Subsidiaries by a Person that is not an Affiliate of Buyer, or (v) Buyer or any of its Affiliates breaches the terms of _Sections 1.05(f)(i)_,  _1.05(f)(ii)_ , _1.05(f)(iii)_ or _1.05(f)(v)_ in a manner that, individually or in the aggregate, materially and adversely affects the Contingent Consideration payable (each of the events described in _clauses (i)-(v)_ of this _Section 1.05(e)_ is referred to herein as an " _Acceleration Event_ "), then the maximum Contingent Consideration as specified under _Section 1.05(a)_ shall become due and payable immediately. 

    ##### 

  

  

 (f) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or required by Law, from the Closing through the earlier of (i) December 31, 2011 and (ii) the occurrence of an Acceleration Event upon which Buyer pays the maximum Contingent Consideration, without the consent of Seller: 

    

 (i) Buyer shall operate the Business with distinct books and records so as to allow the determination of Billed Revenue, and to the extent the Purchased Subsidiaries or their Subsidiaries products and services are bundled with other products and services of Buyer or its other Affiliates, Buyer will maintain mechanisms to accurately track in all material respects the Billed Revenue from such bundled products and services attributable to the Business; 

   

 (ii) Buyer shall cause the Business to be operated in a manner that complies in all material respects with applicable Law, consistent with the Purchased Subsidiaries and their Subsidiaries obligations under Contracts and in a manner that is not reasonably likely to materially and adversely affect the Business, the Purchased Subsidiaries and their Subsidiaries or their relationships with employees, suppliers or customers;  _provided_ , _however_ , that no Acceleration Event shall be deemed to occur with respect to any such non-compliance with applicable Law if, prior to the Closing, the Business, the Purchased Subsidiaries or their Subsidiaries, was not in compliance with such applicable Law; 

   

 (iii) None of Buyer, the Purchased Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates shall, directly or indirectly, (A) sell, transfer or license a material portion of the assets of the Purchased Subsidiaries and their Subsidiaries in one or a series of transactions outside of the ordinary course of business, (B) liquidate, merge or consolidate the Purchased Subsidiaries or any of their Subsidiaries with or into another Person, dissolve the Purchased Subsidiaries or any of their Subsidiaries into another Person, or sell or issue any securities of the Purchased Subsidiaries or any of their Subsidiaries to any Person, except in the case of _each of clauses (A) and (B)_, other than to or into an Affiliate of Buyer (and only for so long as such purchaser, transferee, licensee or Person remains an Affiliate of Buyer and is thereafter bound by the terms of this _Section 1.05(f)_ to the same extent as Buyer would be) or (C) cease to operate any material portion of the Business of the Purchased Subsidiaries or their Subsidiaries; 

   

 (iv) Neither the Purchased Subsidiaries nor any of their Subsidiaries shall, and Buyer shall not authorize the Purchased Subsidiaries or any of their Subsidiaries to, enter into any Related Party Transaction unless it is made upon fair and reasonable terms no less favorable to the Purchased Subsidiaries and their Subsidiaries than would be obtained in a comparable arms length transaction with an unaffiliated third party, or in the case of a license for Intellectual Property, on terms that are less advantageous to the Purchased Subsidiaries or any of their Subsidiaries than any license with respect to the same or substantially similar Intellectual Property between Buyer and any of its Affiliates; and 

   ##### 

  

   

 (v) None of Buyer, the Purchased Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates shall take any action with the primary intent of artificially preventing or decreasing the earning of any Contingent Consideration. 

 

Without limiting the foregoing, if Buyer requests that Seller consent to any
action, omission, waiver or modification of the foregoing, Seller shall
consider the requested consent in good faith and shall grant such consent if
the specific action, omission, waiver or modification, considered separately
or together with all such other actions, omissions, waivers or modifications
consented to by Seller, would not reasonably be expected to adversely impact
the Contingent Consideration that otherwise would be achievable in the
absence of such action(s), omission(s), waiver(s) and/or modification(s). For
the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained in this _Section 1.05(f)_
is intended to restrict Buyers right to control the Purchased Subsidiaries
and their Subsidiaries in any respect, including, without limitation, the
hiring or termination of employees, the incurrence of expenses and requiring
compliance with Buyers and its Affiliates internal controls,
corporate governance policies and procedures, legal and regulatory compliance
standards and other similar matters. Accordingly, Seller acknowledges and
agrees that, in the event that any of the provisions of this _Section
1.05(f)_ shall be breached in a manner that, individually or in
the aggregate, materially and adversely affects the Contingent Consideration
payable, Sellers sole and exclusive remedy shall be a claim or action to
recalculate and/or appropriately adjust the Contingent Consideration payable
by Buyer and/or, only in the event that any of the provisions of  _Sections
1.05(f)(i)_, _1.05(f)(ii)_ , _1.05(f)(iii)_ or _1.05(f)(v)_ are breached in a
manner that, individually or in the aggregate, materially and adversely
affects the Contingent Consideration payable, to establish that such breach
constitutes an Acceleration Event, and Seller shall have no right to
specifically enforce compliance with the provisions of this  _Section
1.05(f)_. Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer acknowledges that its actions
or omissions in respect of control of the Purchased Subsidiaries and their
Subsidiaries may impact the calculation of or give rise to an adjustment of
the amount of the Contingent Consideration, and may also result in an
Acceleration Event. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, any breach of this _Section 1.05(f)_ shall survive until finally
resolved in accordance with  _Section 11.11_ below. 

   

 (g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, none of Buyer, the Purchased Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates (i) will owe Seller any fiduciary duty in respect of this _Section 1.05_ or the earning of any Contingent Consideration or (ii) will have any obligation in respect of this _Section 1.05_ other than an obligation to comply with (x) the covenants and agreements expressly set forth in this _Section 1.05_ and (y) the covenant of good faith and fair dealing implied in all contracts governed by Delaware Law, it being the Parties intention that any other covenants, agreements and/or obligations in respect of this _Section 1.05_ and the earning or payment of Contingent Consideration are expressly waived and disclaimed. In addition, the Parties acknowledge and agree that Sellers rights and Buyers obligation to pay Contingent Consideration, if any, does not represent an ownership interest in Buyer or the Purchased Subsidiaries and shall not entitle Seller to any rights common to any holder of equity securities of Buyer or the Purchased Subsidiaries. 

   

 1.06 _Escrow Amounts_. The " _Indemnification Escrow Amount_ " shall be an amount equal to $6,586,790. The " _Transaction Incentive Plan Indemnity Amount_ " shall be an amount equal to $413,210. Seller hereby authorizes and instructs Buyer, at the Closing, to deduct the 

   ##### 

  

 

Indemnification Escrow Amount from the Base Consideration and the Transaction
Incentive Plan Indemnity Amount from the Expected Base Transaction Incentive
Plan Amount, and to deliver such funds to the Escrow Agent to be held in an
escrow account (the " _Escrow Account_ "), in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Escrow Agreement. 

   

 1.07 _Purchase Price Allocation; Tax Withholding_. 

  

 (a) For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Parties shall treat the purchase and sale of all of the membership interests of Sub I and Sub II provided for herein as a purchase and sale of all of the assets of Sub I and Sub II and an assumption of all of the liabilities of Sub I and Sub II. Accordingly, the Purchase Price (plus such assumed liabilities, to the extent properly taken into account under the Code) and any other consideration payable to Seller pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Allocation Amount_ ") shall be allocated among the acquired capital stock of KUED and the Indian Company (the " _Allocation_ "). Prior to the Closing, Buyer and Seller shall cooperate to obtain an appropriate certificate from an international firm of chartered accountants in India mutually agreeable to Buyer and Seller, certifying the value of the Indian Company (the " _Allocation Value_ ") and the amount of withholding Tax to be imposed on the sale of Sellers capital stock in the Indian Company (the " _Indian Withholding Tax_ "). Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, shall each pay one half of the fees and expense of such accountant. For purposes of the Allocation, the acquired capital stock of the Indian Company shall be allocated the Allocation Value. The excess of the Allocation Amount over the Allocation Value shall be allocated to the acquired capital stock of KUED. 

   

 (b) If the Purchase Price is adjusted pursuant to _Section 6.02(l)_, the amount of such adjustment shall be allocated to the acquired capital stock of KUED. 

   

 (c) The Parties agree to (i) be bound by the Allocation, (ii) act in accordance with the Allocation for all applicable Tax purposes (including filing IRS Form 8594 with their U.S. federal income Tax Return for the taxable year that includes the Closing Date and in the course of any audit, review or litigation), and (iii) take no position and cause their Affiliates to take no position inconsistent with the Allocation for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by applicable Law or unless the other Party consents thereto, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement any amounts that Buyer or the Escrow Agent may be required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Buyer or the Escrow Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such Person. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall be permitted to deduct and withhold from the consideration payable to Seller an amount equal to the Indian Withholding Tax;  _provided_ , that Buyer shall provide Seller with evidence reasonably satisfactory to Seller that such Indian Withholding Tax has been timely paid by Buyer, on behalf of Seller and in Sellers name, to the proper Indian Tax authorities.

  _RELATING TO THE PURCHASED SUBSIDIARIES_  

  

 Except as disclosed in the corresponding section of the Disclosure Schedules (it being understood that any section of the Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed to incorporate by reference all other information disclosed in any other section of the Disclosure Schedules, to the

    ##### 

  

    

sections 280G and 4999 of the Code (in the absence of shareholder approval of
such payments/acceleration/increases in accordance with Code Section

Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall take all actions necessary to obtain, and shall obtain the requisite approval, as described in Section 280G(b)(5) of the Code and regulations thereunder, with respect to payment which may be made to any person who, with respect to Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, is a "disqualified individual" (as such term is defined for purposes of Section 280G of the Code) if such payments could reasonably be expected to result in the imposition of any excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code.

Further, Seller shall provide to Buyer at the Closing evidence of such approval or that such payments or benefits as would result in the imposition of any excise taxes under Section 4999 of the Code will not be paid or provided.

distributions to which former holders of UARs are so entitled and, at the
time of such remittance, Seller shall instruct KUED as to the former holders
to whom such distributions shall be paid and the amounts in which
such distributions shall be paid. Within fifteen Business Days following such
remittance by Seller to KUED, KUED shall pay such amounts to such former
holders of UARs in accordance with Sellers instructions as to recipient and
amount, net of applicable withholding taxes. For the avoidance of doubt, any
applicable taxes that are withheld by KUED and remitted to the appropriate

the former UAR holder with respect to whom such taxes are withheld.

 8.04 _Indemnification Procedures_. 

  

 (a) In order for a Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") to be entitled to any indemnification provided for under this _Article VIII_ as a result of a Loss, or as a result of a claim or demand made by any Person against the Indemnified Party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), such Indemnified Party shall deliver written notice (an " _Indemnification Notice_ ") of such Third Party Claim or other Loss not involving a Third Party Claim to the Escrow Agent and to Seller or to Buyer, as applicable (the " _Indemnifying Party_ "), promptly after receipt by such Indemnified Party of written notice of the Third Party Claim or incurrence of such other Loss, describing in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to any claim for indemnification hereunder, the amount or method of computation of the amount of such claim (in the case of a Third Party Claim, if known), the basis for indemnification under this Agreement and the nature of the breach of representation or warranty, covenant or agreement to which such claim is related (the " _Indemnification Claim_ "). The failure to provide such notice, however, shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this  _Article VIII_ except to the extent (and only to the extent) that (x) the Indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced by such failure or (y) such Indemnification Claim is not delivered prior to the applicable Survival Date. Any Indemnification Notice in respect of a Third Party Claim shall enclose therewith a copy of all relevant papers served with respect to such Third Party Claim, if any, and any other documents evidencing such Third Party Claim. 

   

 (b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon written notice to the Indemnified Party within 30 days of receipt of an Indemnification Notice in respect of a Third Party Claim, to assume the defense thereof at the expense of the Indemnifying Party with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of such Third Party Claim: 

    

 (i) the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified Party;  _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) if outside counsel to the Indemnified Party advises that there may be one or more legal defenses available to the Indemnified Party that are different from or additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party and, in the reasonable judgment of such counsel, it is advisable for the Indemnified Party to employ separate counsel in order to effectively assert such defense or defenses, then the fees of and costs incurred by such separate counsel (but in no event more than one separate counsel in respect of any Third Party Claim or series of related Third Party Claims) in respect of such different or additional defenses may be deemed Losses and indemnifiable (x) if and to the extent that Losses arising from the underlying Third Party Claim are determined to be indemnifiable under this Agreement and (y) pursuant to, and subject to the limitations in, this Agreement, (B) notwithstanding such participation, the Indemnifying Party and its counsel shall control the investigation, defense and settlement of such Third Party Claim subject to the terms of this _Section 8.04_ and (C) under no 

   ##### 

  

    

circumstances shall the Indemnified Party file any papers or admit any
liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, or offer to
settle, compromise or discharge, such Third Party Claim (it being agreed that
if the Indemnified Party breaches this _clause (C)_ , the Indemnifying Party
will have no liability with respect to any Losses arising from the subject
Third Party Claim(s)); 

   

 (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall not agree to any settlement, compromise or discharge of such Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which in any event shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (A) includes a complete release by the claimant or plaintiff of the Indemnified Party from all liability in respect of such Third Party Claim, (B) does not impose equitable remedies or material obligations on the Indemnified Party other than financial obligations for which such Indemnified Party will be indemnified hereunder, and (C) will not result in an admission of criminal liability or culpability on the part of the Indemnified Party or give rise to criminal liability with respect to the Indemnified Party, it being understood that the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to settle, compromise or discharge any Third Party Claim, and the Indemnified Party shall be required to agree in writing to such settlement, compromise or discharge, if the same shall by its terms satisfy each of _clauses (A)_ , _(B)_ and _(C)_ above; and 

   

 (iii) the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any amount that exceeds, where the Indemnified Party has unreasonably withheld or delayed consent in connection with the proposed settlement, compromise or discharge of a Third Party Claim, the amount for which that Third Party Claim could have been settled, compromised or discharged but for such unreasonable withholding or delay of consent (it being understood that the Indemnifying Party shall have the burden of proving that the Indemnified Party unreasonably withheld or delayed such consent). 

  

 (c) If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of such Third Party Claim within 30 days of receipt of the Indemnification Notice, the Indemnified Party will be entitled to assume such defense upon delivery of notice to such effect to the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnified Party assumes the defense of such Third Party Claim: 

    

 (i) the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim at its sole cost and expense, but notwithstanding such participation, the Indemnified Party and its counsel shall control the investigation, defense and settlement of such Third Party Claim subject to the terms of this _Section 8.04_; 

   

 (ii) the Indemnified Party shall not agree to any settlement, compromise or discharge of such Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which in any event shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless (A) the Indemnified Party expressly waives in writing any right to seek or obtain indemnification hereunder or any other remedy against the Indemnifying Party with respect to such Third Party Claim or the facts or events giving rise thereto, and (B) such settlement, compromise or discharge will not result in an admission of criminal liability or culpability on the part of the Indemnifying Party or give rise to criminal 

   ##### 

  

    

liability with respect to the Indemnifying Party, it being understood and
agreed that (x) the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to settle, compromise
or discharge any Third Party Claim, and the Indemnifying Party shall
be required to agree in writing to such settlement, compromise or discharge,
if the same shall by its terms satisfy each of clauses (A) and (B) above and
(y) the Indemnifying Party will have no liability with respect to any Losses
arising from any Third Party Claim(s) settled in contravention of this clause
(ii); and 

   

 (iii) the fees of and costs incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the investigation, defense and settlement of such Third Party Claim may be deemed Losses and indemnifiable (x) if and to the extent that Losses arising from the underlying Third Party Claim are determined to be indemnifiable under this Agreement and (y) pursuant to, and subject to the limitations in, this Agreement. 

  

 (d) In the case of a purported Loss not involving a Third Party Claim, upon receipt of an Indemnification Notice with respect thereto that complies with the provisions of _Section 8.04(a)_ above, the Indemnifying Party will have 30 days to notify the Indemnified Party that it disputes one or more of the Indemnification Claims made therein. If the Indemnifying Party does not dispute an Indemnification Claim within such 30-day period, it will be deemed to have admitted liability with respect to such Indemnification Claim and shall be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to such undisputed Indemnification Claim pursuant to, and subject to the limitations in, this Agreement. From and after delivery of the Indemnification Notice until the final resolution of the Indemnification Claims made therein, the Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate with and assist the Indemnifying Party in determining the validity of the Indemnification Claim made therein and in otherwise resolving such matters. Such assistance and cooperation shall include providing commercially reasonable access to and copies of information, records and documents relating to such matters, furnishing employees to assist in the investigation, defense and resolution of such matters and providing legal and business assistance with respect to such matters. 

   

 8.05 _Determination of Loss Amount_. 

  

 (a) The amount of any Loss subject to indemnification under this _Article VIII_ shall be calculated net of (i) any Tax Benefit realized by the Indemnified Party on account of such Loss in the taxable year in which the Loss is incurred or the indemnification payment therefor is made or in the two succeeding taxable years (or any preceding taxable year, to the extent any deductions or losses are carried back), and (ii) any insurance proceeds or other amounts under indemnification agreements received by the Indemnified Party on account of such Loss (net of any deductible or co-payment or out-of-pocket costs of collection and the Indemnified Partys reasonable estimate of any increase in insurance premiums attributable to such recovery). 

   

 (b) For purposes of _Section 8.05(a)_, " _Tax Benefit_ " shall mean the Indemnified Partys reasonable estimate of the present value of any refund of Taxes to be paid or reduction in the amount of Taxes which otherwise would have been paid as a result of such indemnified Loss (with the timing and receipt or realization of such refund or reduction to be estimated in the reasonable discretion of the Indemnified Party), net of any increase in Taxes payable by the 

    ##### 

  

 

Indemnified Party on account of receipt of the indemnification payment,
provided, that in calculating the present value of any such amount, Buyer
shall use as the discount rate the short-term applicable federal rate in
effect at the time it calculates such Tax Benefit. At the time of the
calculation of such Tax Benefit, the Indemnified Party shall (A) use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause its independent auditor, which shall
be a "Big Four" accounting firm, to certify in writing to the Indemnifying
Party that such calculation is based on reasonable assumptions, which
certification shall be final and conclusive evidence of the fact and amount
of such Tax Benefit (which cannot be challenged by the Indemnifying Party in
any manner) and (B) deliver to the Indemnifying Party a certificate executed
by an authorized officer certifying that the Indemnified Party has not
taken any action which was primarily intended to frustrate the purpose of
_Section 8.05(a)(i)_; provided that, except with respect to the
certification in _clause (B)_ , nothing in this  _Section 8.05_ shall affect
the absolute discretion of the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates to
arrange its Tax affairs in whatever way they consider fit (including any
decision as to whether to seek recovery of any relevant Tax credit or Tax
refund). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in no event shall the
Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates be required to disclose any of
their Tax Returns or other documents or information relating to its Tax
returns or other tax affairs in connection with the procedures set forth in

   ##### 

  

    

affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such

transactions contemplated by this Agreement are fulfilled to the greatest
extent possible. 

  

 11.05 _References_. The table of contents and the section and other headings and subheadings contained in this Agreement and the exhibits hereto are solely for the purpose of reference, are not part of the agreement of the Parties hereto, and shall not in any way affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement or any exhibit hereto. All references to days or months shall be deemed references to calendar days or months. All references to "$" or "dollars" shall be deemed references to United States dollars. Unless the context otherwise requires, any reference to an "Article," "Section," "Exhibit," or "Schedule" shall be deemed to refer to an Article of this Agreement, a section of this Agreement, exhibit to this Agreement or a schedule to this Agreement, as applicable. Any reference to any federal, state, county, local or foreign statute or Law shall be deemed also to refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise. For all purposes of and under this Agreement, (i) the word "including" shall be deemed to be immediately followed by the words "without limitation"; (ii) words (including defined terms) in the singular shall be deemed to include the plural and vice versa; (iii) words of one gender shall be deemed to include the other gender as the context requires; (iv) "or" is not exclusive; and (v) the terms "hereof," "herein," "hereto," "herewith" and any other words of similar import shall, unless otherwise stated, be construed to refer to this Agreement as a whole (including the exhibits hereto and the Disclosure Schedules) and not to any particular term or provision of this Agreement, unless otherwise specified. 

  

 11.06 _Mutual Drafting_. The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement. 

  

 11.07 _Amendment and Waiver_. 

  

 (a) This Agreement may not be amended except in a written instrument executed by the Parties. No amendment, supplement, modification or waiver of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by the Party to be bound thereby. 

   

 (b) Except where a specific period for action or inaction is provided herein, neither the failure nor any delay on the part of any Party in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver on the part of any Party of any such right, power or privilege, nor any single or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other such right, power or privilege. The failure of a Party to exercise any right conferred herein within the time required shall cause such right to terminate with respect to the transaction or circumstances giving rise to such right, but not to any such right arising as a result of any other transactions or circumstances. 

    ##### 

  

     

 11.08 _Complete Agreement_. This Agreement (including the exhibits hereto and the Disclosure Schedules) and the documents referred to herein (including the Escrow Agreement) contain the complete agreement between the Parties hereto and supersede any prior understandings, agreements or representations by or between the Parties, written or oral, which may have related to the subject matter hereof in any way. 

  

 11.09 _Counterparts; Facsimile, Electronic Signatures_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts, any one of which need not contain the signatures of more than one Party, but all such counterparts taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement or any counterpart may be executed and delivered by facsimile copies or delivered by electronic communications by portable document format (.pdf), each of which shall be deemed an original. 

  

 11.10 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction_. All matters relating to this Agreement or the breach, interpretation, construction, validity, termination and enforcement of this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the domestic laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. Subject to _Sections 1.04_ , _1.05_ , _6.02_ and _11.11_ herein, and the alternative dispute resolution provisions contained therein, each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its assets and properties, to the exclusive jurisdiction of any Delaware State court in New Castle County, or Federal court of the United States of America, sitting within New Castle County in the State of Delaware, and any respective appellate court, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the agreements delivered in connection with this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence any such action or proceeding except in such courts; (ii) agrees that any claim in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such Delaware State court or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, in such Federal court; (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in any such Delaware State or Federal court; and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction or an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such Delaware State or Federal court. Each of the Parties hereby agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in _Section 11.02_. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the right of any Party to serve process in any other manner permitted by applicable Law. 

  

 11.11 _Arbitration Procedures for Certain Disputes_. 

  

 (a) The Parties agree that, from and after the Closing, the arbitration procedure set forth below shall be the sole and exclusive method of the Parties for finally 

    ##### 

  

 

resolving and remedying disputes under _Section 1.05(c)_ herein that are not
by the terms thereof to be submitted for resolution by the Accounting
Referee. 

   

 (b) The arbitration shall be held in Dallas, Texas in accordance with JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the " _Rules_ ") then in effect, however in all events, the provisions contained in this Section shall govern over any conflicting rule that may now or hereafter be contained in the Rules. There shall be a single arbitrator who shall be mutually agreed upon by the Parties. In the event the Parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator within 20 days following the commencement of the arbitration (in accordance with the Rules), on the request of any Party JAMS will select an arbitrator in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Rules. No arbitrator shall have any past or present family, business or other relationship with either Party or its Affiliates, unless, following full disclosure of all such relationships, the Parties agree in writing in their respective sole discretions to waive such requirement with respect to an individual in connection with any dispute. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant any and all equitable and legal remedies that would be available if a judicial proceeding had been instituted to resolve the dispute. The arbitrator will furnish a written decision and award to each of the Parties, which decision and award will be final and binding on the Parties and may be entered an enforced in any court having jurisdiction. The Parties shall keep confidential any arbitration conducted in accordance with this _Section 11.11_; _except_ as may be required by law or legal process and provided that such parties may discuss the arbitration with their respective advisors and attorneys who shall be bound to protect such confidentiality; and  _provided_ , _further_ that either Party may take such steps as may be necessary to confirm and enforce the award in a public judicial proceeding. Unless otherwise ordered by the arbitrator, no discovery other than an exchange of documents directly relevant to the issues in dispute may occur in any arbitration other than upon a showing of unusual and substantial need. The Parties shall in good faith promptly exchange relevant, non-privileged documents created prior to the commencement of the arbitration and not likely to be in the possession of the other Party. The arbitrator shall be instructed to hold a hearing regarding the dispute within ninety (90) days of his or her appointment and to render a decision no later than 30 days after the conclusion of such hearing, in each case unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing by the Parties. The Parties agree, however, that in the event that these time periods are not strictly adhered to, this shall not be used a basis for setting aside an award. Any issue concerning the extent to which any dispute is subject to arbitration, or concerning the applicability, interpretation, or enforceability of any of the Rules or the provisions of this agreement to arbitrate shall be resolved by the arbitrator. An arbitrator chosen in accordance with these provisions will not have the power to alter, amend or otherwise affect the terms of these arbitration provisions or any other provisions contained in this Section or this Agreement. 

   

 (c) The Parties will equally share the initial costs of the arbitration, and the award of the arbitrator shall allocate attorneys fees, expenses and costs, as well as the costs of the arbitration, between the Parties in the manner the arbitrator determines to be the most equitable, with the presumption that the American Rule (with each party bearing its own costs) applies unless the equities dictate otherwise. 

   

 11.12 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns and 

   ##### 

  

    

nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any
other Person any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any
nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement; _provided_ , that any
Person that is not a Party but, by the terms of _Sections 6.02_, _6.04_ or
_Article VIII_, is entitled to indemnification, shall be considered a third
party beneficiary of this Agreement, with full rights of enforcement as
though such Person was a signatory to this Agreement. 

  

 11.13 _Representation by Counsel_. Each Party represents and agrees with each other that it has been represented by or had the opportunity to be represented by, independent counsel of its own choosing, and that it has had the full right and opportunity to consult with its respective attorney(s), that to the extent, if any, that it desired, it availed itself of this right and opportunity, that it or its authorized officers (as the case may be) have carefully read and fully understand this Agreement in its entirety and have had it fully explained to them by such Partys respective counsel, that each is fully aware of the contents thereof and its meaning, intent and legal effect, and that it or its authorized officer (as the case may be) is competent to execute this Agreement and has executed this Agreement free from coercion, duress or undue influence.
