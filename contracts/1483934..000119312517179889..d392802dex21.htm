and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock shall
have changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason
of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split
or stock combination then, the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be

shall not apply to the issuance of new shares of Parent Common Stock in the
Public Offering contemplated by this Agreement.

terminate and be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive the Option
Merger Consideration, less any applicable withholding Taxes. If the exercise
price applicable to shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Stock Option is equal to or greater than the Transaction Value per Share, such
Company Stock Option shall terminate and be canceled in exchange for no
consideration. As of the Effective Time, each holder of a Company Stock Option

Option pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3_.

deposited, with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the Company
Common Shareholders, the Company Preferred Shareholders and the holders of any
outstanding Company Stock Options or Company RSUs, (i) the Aggregate Merger
Consideration, (ii) the Per Share Redemption Consideration payable pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 3.1_ in exchange for the outstanding shares of Company
Series A Preferred Stock, and (iii) cash to be paid in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock. Any Parent Common Stock and cash deposited

(b) _Company Common Stock_.

 

(i) Prior to the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail or otherwise
deliver to each Company Common Shareholder: (A) a letter of transmittal (the
" _Letter of Transmittal_ "), which shall specify that in respect of any
Certificate, risk of loss and title shall pass only upon receipt thereof by
the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other customary
provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably specify, (B) any notice
required pursuant to the MIBCA, and (C) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates or transfer of the Book-Entry Shares, as
applicable, held by such Company Common Shareholder. In the event a Company
Common Shareholder does not deliver to the Exchange Agent a duly executed and
completed Letter of Transmittal and does not deliver the Certificate(s) or
surrender the Book-Entry Shares, held by such Company Common Shareholder,
such Person shall not be entitled to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration relating to such Certificate or Book-Entry Share unless and
until such Person delivers a duly executed and completed Letter of
Transmittal and Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Shares (or an affidavit in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.5_), as applicable, to the Exchange Agent.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this  _Section_ __ _ 3.3(b)_, each
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 3.1(a)_.

(ii) Upon the later of the Closing and the Exchange Agents receipt of a
duly executed and completed Letter of Transmittal and the surrender of the
Certificates or transfer of the Book-Entry Shares held by any Company Common
Shareholder, the Exchange Agent shall issue, in accordance with  _Section_ __
_ 3.1(a)_, to such Company Common Shareholder an aggregate number of such
shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the sum of such Company Common
Shareholders Per Share Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common
Stock held by such Company Common Shareholder.

 



-19- (iii) The Per Share Merger Consideration paid or payable and issued
or issuable upon the surrender of Company Common Stock in accordance with the
terms of this _Article_ __ _ III_ shall be paid or payable and issued or
issuable in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of
Company Common Stock.

(c) _Company Series A Preferred Stock_. At the Closing, the Exchange Agent
shall issue, in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.1(a)_, to each Company
Preferred Shareholder an aggregate amount of cash equal to the sum of such
Company Preferred Shareholders Per Share Redemption Consideration for each
share of Company Series A Preferred Stock held by such Company Preferred
Shareholder. The Per Share Redemption Consideration paid or payable and issued
or issuable at the Closing in accordance with the terms of this _Article_ __ _
III_ shall be paid or payable and issued or issuable in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Series A Preferred Stock.

 

(d) From and after the Effective Time, the transfer books of the Company
shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers on
the transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Company Common Stock or
Company Series A Preferred Stock that was outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

 

(e) In the case of Company Stock Options, the holder of any such Company
Stock Options shall receive in exchange therefor the applicable Option Merger
Consideration (if any) into which such Company Stock Options have been
converted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.2(a)_, to be paid through the payroll
of the Company or its Affiliates on or as soon as practicable after the
Effective Time. The Option Merger Consideration paid or payable in accordance
with the terms of this _Article_ __ _ III_ shall be deemed to have been paid
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Stock Options.
From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the
Company Stock Options that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

(f) In the case of Company RSUs, the holder of any such Company RSUs shall
receive in exchange therefor the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration
into which such Company RSUs have been converted pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.2(b)_, to be paid on or as soon as practicable after the Effective Time. The
Per Share Merger Consideration paid or payable in accordance with the terms
of this _Article_ __ _ III_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company RSUs. From and after the
Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Company RSUs that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(g) No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock will be issued in
connection with the Merger, but in lieu thereof, any Person who would
otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after
aggregating for each particular Certificate or Book-Entry Share all fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock to be received by such Person) shall
receive from Parent an amount in cash (without interest) equal to the product
of (i) such fraction and (ii) the Parent VWAP. The parties acknowledge that
payment of the cash consideration in lieu of delivering fractional shares was
not separately bargained for consideration, but merely represents a
mechanical rounding off for purposes of simplifying the corporate and
accounting complexities that would otherwise be caused by the delivery of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock.

 



-20- (h) Any portion of the Exchange Fund made available to the Exchange
Agent in respect of any Dissenting Shares will be returned to Parent, upon
demand. Any other portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to
the Company Common Shareholders, the Company Preferred Shareholders or the
holders of any outstanding Company Stock Options or Company RSUs, for six (6)
months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, and any such
Person, to the extent such Person has not theretofore complied with this
_Section_ __ _ 3.3_ shall thereafter look only to Parent for, and Parent
shall remain liable for, the Per Share Merger Consideration, the Per Share
Redemption Consideration or the Option Merger Consideration, as the case may
be, to which such Person is entitled pursuant to this Agreement. Any such
portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by the Company Common
Shareholders, the Company Preferred Shareholders or the holders of any
outstanding Company Stock Options or Company RSUs for five (5) years
after the Effective Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to such time
as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Authority) shall, to the extent permitted by Law, become the
property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

(i) None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation,
the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any Person in
respect of any cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

(j) The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash in the Exchange Fund as
directed by Parent. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be paid to Parent.

(k) Prior to the Closing Date, any disputes regarding this _Section_ __ _
3.3_ shall be addressed and resolved jointly by the Company and Parent, and
any amendments to or waivers of any provision of this _Section_ __ _ 3.3_
shall be made jointly by the Company and Parent. After the Closing, any such
disputes shall be addressed and resolved by the Parent Board, and any
amendments to or waivers of this _Section_ __ _ 3.3_ shall be made in the
sole discretion of the Parent Board.

 

SECTION 3.4. _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding any provision contained
herein to the contrary, each of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation
and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration
otherwise payable under this Agreement to any Person such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any provision of applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law
and shall timely pay such withholding amount to the appropriate Governmental
Authority. If the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the
case may be, so withholds amounts, to the extent timely remitted to the
appropriate Governmental Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such Person in respect of
which the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case
may be, made such deduction and withholding.

 

SECTION 3.5. _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Company Common Shareholder claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed (in form and substance reasonably

 



-21-  satisfactory to Parent) and, if required by Parent, the posting by such
Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it or the Exchange Agent, as the
case may be, with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay,
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Per Share
Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common
Stock, as the case may be, represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by
this _Article_ __ _ III_.

 

SECTION 3.6. _Dissenters Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, shares (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
that are held by any holder who is (a) entitled to object to the Merger
pursuant to Section 100 of the MIBCA and (b) properly objects to the proposed
corporate action and makes a proper demand for payment of such shares in
accordance with Sections 100 and 101 of the MIBCA shall not be converted into
the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration provided in _Section_
__ _ 3.1(a)_, but instead such holder shall be entitled to such rights as are
granted by the MIBCA to a holder of Dissenting Shares. At the Effective Time,
all Dissenting Shares, if any, shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of
Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
such rights as are granted by the MIBCA to a holder of Dissenting
Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to
perfect or otherwise shall effectively waive, withdraw or lose the right to
payment as a holder of Dissenting Shares under the MIBCA with respect to such
shares or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder
is not entitled to the relief provided by the MIBCA, then the right of such
holder to be paid under the MIBCA shall cease and each such Dissenting Share
shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into, and shall
have become, the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration provided
in _Section_ __ _ 3.1(a)_. The Company shall deliver prompt notice to Parent
of any demands for payment or appraisal of any shares of Company Common
Stock, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice or
instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to
the MIBCA that relate to such demand and Parent shall have the right
to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior
written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or
offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

qualify, withdraw, or modify or amend in a manner adverse to Parent, the

with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or efforts to obtain an Acquisition
Proposal, and shall also request such Third Party to promptly return or
destroy all confidential information concerning the Company and its
Subsidiaries prior to the date hereof.

 

(b) _Exceptions_.

 

(i) Prior to (but not at any time from or after) obtaining the Company
Stockholders Approval, if the Company receives a bona fide, written
Acquisition Proposal from a Third Party after the date hereof (that has not
been withdrawn) that did not result from an intentional breach or violation of
_Section 6.4(a)_ and, prior to taking any action described in clauses (A) and
(B) below, (x) the Transaction Committee determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel that based on the information then
available and after consultation with its financial advisors of nationally
recognized reputation, such Acquisition

 



-51-  Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior
Proposal and (y) the Company shall have complied with _Section_ __ _ 6.4(c)_,
then the Company may, in response to such Acquisition Proposal, directly or
indirectly through its Representatives, (A) engage in negotiations or
discussions with such Third Party and its Representatives or financing sources
with respect to such Acquisition Proposal and (B) thereafter furnish to such
Third Party or its Representatives or financing sources non-public information
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to a
confidentiality agreement (a copy of which shall be promptly (and in any
event within twenty-four (24) hours) provided for informational purposes only
to Parent) with such Third Party with terms no less favorable to the Company
than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement and containing
additional provisions that expressly permit the Company to comply with the
terms of this _Section_ __ _ 6.4_; _provided_ that all such information
provided or made available to such Third Party (to the extent that such
information has not been previously provided or made available to Parent) is
provided or made available to Parent promptly (and in any event within twenty-
four (24) hours) after the time it is provided or made available to such
Third Party.

(ii) Prior to (but not at any time from or after) obtaining the
Company Stockholders Approval, the Transaction Committee may, following
receipt of or on account of a Superior Proposal, make an Adverse
Recommendation Change in connection with such Superior Proposal, if such
Superior Proposal did not result from an intentional breach or violation of
_Section 6.4(a)_ and the Transaction Committee determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors of nationally
recognized reputation that, in light of such Superior Proposal, the failure
of the Transaction Committee to take such action is reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , the Transaction Committee shall not
be entitled to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change in connection with a
Superior Proposal unless (A) the Transaction Committee promptly notifies
Parent, in writing at least three (3) Business Days before making an Adverse
Recommendation Change (the " _Notice Period_ "), of its intention to take such
action with respect to such Superior Proposal, which notice shall state
expressly that the Company has received an Acquisition Proposal that
the Transaction Committee has determined to be a Superior Proposal and that
the Transaction Committee intends to make an Adverse Recommendation Change;
(B) the Transaction Committee attaches to such notice the proposed transaction
agreements and the identity of the Third Party making such Superior Proposal;
(C) during the Notice Period, if requested (orally or in writing) by Parent,
the Transaction Committee has engaged, and has directed its Representatives to
engage, in negotiations with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent
desires to negotiate) to amend this Agreement in such a manner that such
Superior Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal; and (D) following
the Notice Period, the Transaction Committee shall have considered in good
faith any proposed amendments to this Agreement and determined in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors of
nationally recognized reputation, taking into account any changes to this
Agreement made or proposed in writing by Parent, that such Superior Proposal
continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and the failure of the Transaction
Committee to make an Adverse Recommendation Change in connection with such
Superior Proposal is reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ that with respect to any applicable Superior Proposal, any amendment
to the financial terms or any other material amendment to a term of such
Superior Proposal shall require a new written notice by the

 



-52-  Transaction Committee and a new Notice Period (except that the Notice Period
shall be reduced to forty-eight (48) hours, or if there are less than forty-
eight (48) hours prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting, as much notice as
is reasonably practicable), and no such Adverse Recommendation Change in
connection with such Superior Proposal may be made during any Notice Period.

 

(iii) Prior to (but not at any time from or after) obtaining the Company
Stockholders Approval, the Transaction Committee or the Company Board may, if
there has been an Intervening Event, make an Adverse Recommendation Change in
connection with such Intervening Event if the Transaction Committee or the
Company Board, as applicable, determines in good faith, after consultation
with outside legal counsel and financial advisors of nationally recognized
reputation that, in light of such Intervening Event, the failure of the
Transaction Committee or the Company Board, as applicable, to take such action
is reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
Companys stockholders under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , the
Transaction Committee and the Company Board shall not be entitled to effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change in connection with an Intervening Event unless
(A) the Company promptly notifies Parent, in writing at least three (3)
Business Days before making an Adverse Recommendation Change, of the intention
of the Transaction Committee or Company Board, as applicable, to take such
action with respect to such Intervening Event, which notice shall include the
facts underlying the Transaction Committees or the Company Boards
determination that an Intervening Event has occurred, and state the reasons
that the Transaction Committee or the Company Board, as applicable, intends to
make an Adverse Recommendation Change, in reasonable detail, (B) during
such 3-Business Day period, if requested (orally or in writing) by Parent,
the Company has engaged, and has directed its Representatives to engage, in
negotiations with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to
negotiate) to amend this Agreement in such a manner that an Adverse
Recommendation Change is no longer warranted as a result of the Intervening
Event, and (C) following such 3-Business Day period, the Transaction
Committee or the Company Board, as applicable, shall have considered in good
faith any proposed amendments to this Agreement and determined in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors of
nationally recognized reputation, taking into account any changes to this
Agreement made or proposed in writing by Parent, that the failure of the
Transaction Committee or the Company Board, as applicable, to make an
Adverse Recommendation Change in connection with such Intervening Event is
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
Companys stockholders under applicable Law; _provided_ , that the Company
shall not be required to negotiate with Parent in connection with an Adverse
Recommendation Change that the Company Board intends to effect in response to
an Intervening Event if the Company has already negotiated with Parent in
accordance with this _Section 6.4(b)(iii)_ in connection with an Adverse
Recommendation Change by the Transaction Committee in response to the same
Intervening Event.

 

(iv) In addition, nothing contained herein shall prevent the Transaction
Committee or the Company Board from complying with Rule 14e-2(a) under the
1934 Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal or from making legally
required disclosure so long as any action taken or statement made to so comply
is consistent with this  _Section_ __ _ 6.4_.

 



-53- (c) _Required Notices_. The Company and the Company Board shall not take
any of the actions referred to in _Section_ __ _ 6.4(b)_ unless the Company
shall have first complied with the applicable requirements of this _Section_
__ _ 6.4(c)_. The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event
later than 24 hours) after receipt by the Company (or, if received by any of
the Companys Representatives, after the Company is informed by such
Representative) of any Acquisition Proposal or of any inquiries or
other communication regarding the making of an Acquisition Proposal,
including the material terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal
and providing a copy, if applicable, of any written requests, proposals or
offers, including proposed agreements, and the identity of the Person making
(or inquiry or communications about) such Acquisition Proposal and its
proposed financing sources, if any, and shall keep Parent reasonably informed
on a prompt basis (but in any event no later than 24 hours) as to the status
(including changes or proposed changes to the material terms) of such
Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall also notify Parent promptly (but in no
event later than 24 hours) after receipt by the Company of any request for
non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
for access to the business, properties, assets, personnel, books or records of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any Third Party that has informed
the Company that it is considering making, or has made, an Acquisition
Proposal. The Company shall also notify Parent promptly of the Companys
intention to take the actions set forth in clauses (A) or (B) of _Section_ __
_ 6.4(b)(i)_. The Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries will not enter
into any confidentiality agreement with any Third Party pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.4_ subsequent to the date hereof which prohibits the
Company from providing any information to Parent in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 6.4_.

 

(d) _Definition of Superior Proposal_. For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide, unsolicited written Acquisition
Proposal ( _provided_ that, for the purposes of this definition, references to
"15%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed replaced with
references to "50%") that the Transaction Committee has determined in good
faith, after considering the advice of its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors of nationally recognized reputation and taking into consideration all
of the applicable terms, conditions, impacts and all legal, financial,
regulatory, fiduciary and other aspects of such Acquisition Proposal the
Transaction Committee deems in good faith to be relevant, including, to the
extent the Transaction Committee deems relevant, the identity of the Person
making the Acquisition Proposal, financing and the status of any required
financing relative to the Public Offering, regulatory approvals, stockholder
litigation, termination fees, expense reimbursement provisions and
the expected timing and risk and likelihood of consummation, (i) would result
in a transaction more favorable, from a financial point of view, to the
Companys stockholders than the Merger provided hereunder (after taking into
account and giving effect to any adjustments or amendment to this Agreement
proposed by Parent) and (ii) is reasonably likely to be consummated in
accordance with its terms (including, if there is any contingency relating to
financing, that the contingency is reasonably likely to be satisfied).

(e) The Company acknowledges and agrees that any violation of
the restrictions set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.4_ by any Subsidiary or
Representative of the Company shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section_
__ _ 6.4_ by the Company.

such actions as are necessary so that the Transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated herein and otherwise act to

advancement of expenses in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time or in any agreement, a complete copy of which agreement has been
provided by the Company to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement, to

for the persons who are covered by the Companys existing DandO Insurance, with
terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage at least as favorable to
the insured individuals as the Companys existing DandO Insurance with respect
to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, in which
event Parent shall cease to have any obligations under the first sentence of
this  _Section_ __ _ 7.2(c)_; _provided_ , that the aggregate premium for
such policies shall not exceed the Premium Cap. In the event the Company
elects to purchase such a "tail policy," the Surviving Corporation shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such "tail policy"
in full force and effect and continue to honor its obligations thereunder.

 

(d) If either Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors
or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties, rights and other assets to any Person, then, and in each such
case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may
be, succeed to or assume the applicable obligations of such party set forth in
this  _Section_ __ _ 7.2_.

 



-57- (e) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this  _Section_ __ _ 7.2_
shall be in addition to any rights such Person may have under the Company
Group Charter Documents, under the MIBCA or any other applicable Law or under
any agreement of any Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. These rights shall survive consummation of the Merger and are
intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person.

 

SECTION 7.3. _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to take all actions, and do all things, reasonably necessary,
proper or advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules and policies
of the NYSE to ensure that the shares of Parent Common Stock comprising the
Aggregate Merger Consideration are listed on the NYSE prior to or as of the
Effective Time, and the Company shall cooperate with Parent with respect to
such approval.

 

SECTION 7.4. _Parent Public Offering_. The Company acknowledges that
Parent is in the process of registering an underwritten public offering of
shares of Parent Common Stock under the Securities Act on terms reasonably
acceptable to Parent, subject to market conditions and the sole discretion of
the Parent Board or committee thereof, pursuant to which the aggregate gross
proceeds to be received by Parent shall not be greater than $200 million
(excluding any exercise of customary over-allotment options granted to
underwriters in connection therewith; _provided_ , that the aggregate
gross proceeds to be received by Parent pursuant to any such over-allotment
options shall not be greater than $30 million) (such offering, on the terms
described in this sentence, the " _Public Offering_ "). The Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to furnish to Parent all information concerning
the Company and its Affiliates to be included in the Public Offering marketing
materials and other Parent Disclosure Documents relating to such Public
Offering unless such information has been provided on or prior to the date
hereof, and shall provide such other assistance, in each case as may be
reasonably requested by Parent or the relevant underwriters in connection with
such Public Offering. Parent shall provide PJT Partners LP, as the Companys
financial advisor, with periodic communications regarding the status and
timing of such Public Offering. If any event occurs with respect to the
Company, or any change occurs with respect to information supplied by the
Company for inclusion in the Parent Disclosure Documents relating to such
Public Offering, in each case which is required by applicable Law to be
described in an amendment of, or a supplement to, such Parent Disclosure
Documents so that such documents would not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the Company shall promptly notify
Parent of such event or information, and Parent and the Company shall
cooperate in the prompt (as the context may require) preparation and
furnishing of any necessary amendment or supplement for inclusion in such
Parent Disclosure Documents and, as required by applicable Law, in
disseminating the information contained in such Parent Disclosure Documents to
the applicable recipients thereof (if necessary). Parent shall not be
responsible for any delay in the Public Offering or in furnishing any such
amendment or supplement to such Parent Disclosure Documents to the applicable
recipients thereof to the extent such delay arises from the Companys review,
after the date of this Agreement, of such amendment or supplement or Parents
prompt and good faith consideration and incorporation of any comments to such
amendment or supplement proposed by the Company or the Companys auditors
after the date of this Agreement.

COVENANTS OF PARENT AND THE COMPANY

 

SECTION 8.1. _Proxy Statement; Registration Statement; Company
Stockholders Meeting_.

 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable but no later than five (5) Business
Days following the date of this Agreement, Parent and the Company shall
jointly prepare, and Parent shall file with the SEC a registration statement
on Form F-4 to register, under the 1933 Act, the shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable in the Merger (together with all amendments supplements and exhibits
thereto, the " _Registration Statement_ "), which shall include a prospectus
with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in the Merger and a
proxy statement to be sent to the stockholders of the Company (and, to the
extent applicable, the holders of any outstanding Company Stock Options or
Company RSUs) relating to the Company Stockholders Meeting (together with any
amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Proxy Statement_ "); _provided_ ,
that the filing of the Registration Statement and Proxy Statement more than
five (5) Business Days following the date of this Agreement shall not be
deemed a breach of this  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(a)_ to the extent such delay
resulted from the Companys review of the Registration Statement or Parents
prompt and good faith consideration and incorporation of any comments thereto
proposed by the Company. Parent and the Company shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement to be declared
effective under the 1933 Act as soon as reasonably practicable after such
filing. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts furnish to Parent
all information concerning the Company and its Affiliates to be included in
the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement and requested by Parent no
later than two (2) Business Days following the date of such request, and
shall provide such other assistance, in each case as may be reasonably
requested by Parent in connection with the preparation, filing and
distribution of the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement, and
the Registration Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing
the Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or mailing
the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to
any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company and Parent shall
(i) provide the other an opportunity to review and comment on such document or
response (including the proposed final version of such document or response),
and (ii) consider in good faith all comments reasonably proposed by the other
within a reasonable time after having been provided such document or response
for its review. Parent shall advise the Company, promptly after receiving
notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has become
effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, of the issuance of
any stop order, or of any request by the SEC for amendment of the Registration
Statement or Proxy Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or
requests by the SEC for additional information.

(b) If prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, any event occurs with
respect to Parent, or any change occurs with respect to other information
supplied by Parent for inclusion in the Proxy Statement or Registration
Statement, in each case which is required by applicable Law to be described
in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy Statement or

 



-59-  Registration Statement so that such document would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, Parent shall
promptly notify the Company of such event or information, and the Company and
Parent shall cooperate in the prompt, and in any event within the earlier of
(i) three (3) Business Days following the receipt of such notice and (ii) the
date of the Company Stockholders Meeting, preparation and furnishing to the
SEC of any necessary amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or
Registration Statement and, as required by applicable Law, in disseminating
the information contained in such amendment or supplement to the Companys
stockholders (and, to the extent applicable, the holders of any
outstanding Company Stock Options or Company RSUs); _provided_ , that any
delay in furnishing any such amendment or supplement to the SEC following the
receipt of any such notice shall not be deemed a breach of this _Section_ __ _
8.1(b)_ by either party to the extent such delay resulted from the other
partys review of the amendment or supplement or the prompt and good faith
consideration and incorporation of any comments thereto proposed by such other
party. Nothing in this  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(b)_ shall limit the obligations
of any party under _Section_ __ _ 8.1(a)_.

 

(c) If prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, any event occurs with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any Acquisition Proposal
is received by the Company or any Adverse Recommendation Change is made in
connection with an Acquisition Proposal or Intervening Event as permitted by
_Section 6.4(b)_ , or any change occurs with respect to other information
supplied by the Company for inclusion in the Proxy Statement or Registration
Statement, in each case which is required by applicable Law to be described in
an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy Statement or
Registration Statement, so that such document would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Company shall
promptly notify Parent of such event, and the Company and Parent shall
reasonably cooperate in the prompt, and in any event within the earlier of (i)
three (3) Business Days following the happening of such event requiring an
amendment or supplement and (ii) the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting,
preparation and furnishing to the SEC of any necessary amendment or supplement
to the Proxy Statement or Registration Statement and, as required by
applicable Law, in disseminating the information contained in such amendment
or supplement to the Companys stockholders (and, to the extent applicable,
the holders of any outstanding Company Stock Options or Company RSUs); 
_provided_ that any delay in furnishing any such amendment or supplement to
the SEC following such event shall not be deemed a breach of this _Section_ __
_ 8.1(c)_ by either party to the extent such delay resulted from the other
partys review of the amendment or supplement or the prompt and good faith
consideration and incorporation of any comments thereto proposed by such other
party. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 8.1(c)_ shall limit the obligations of
any party under _Section_ __ _ 8.1(a)_.

(d) No amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Proxy
Statement will be made by Parent or the Company without the approval of the
other party hereto, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed; _provided_ , that the Company, in connection with an
Adverse Recommendation Change made in compliance with the terms hereof may
amend or supplement the Proxy Statement (including by incorporation by
reference) pursuant to an amendment or supplement (including by incorporation
by reference) to

 



-60-  the extent it contains (i) an Adverse Recommendation Change, (ii) a
statement of the reason of the Transaction Committee for making such an
Adverse Recommendation Change, and (iii) additional information reasonably
related to the foregoing.

(e) The Company shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following the
date of this Agreement, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting
of the stockholders (the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_ ") for the sole
purpose of seeking the Company Stockholders Approval, and shall not submit
any other proposals in connection with such Company Stockholders Meeting
without the prior written consent of Parent; _provided_ that the Company (i)
shall cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys stockholders
(and, to the extent applicable, the holders of any outstanding Company Stock
Options or Company RSUs) no later than two (2) Business Days after the
Registration Statement is declared effective under the 1933 Act, and (ii)
shall use its reasonable best efforts to hold the Company Stockholders Meeting
on the fifteenth (15) calendar day following the first mailing of the Proxy
Statement to the Companys stockholders (or if such day is not a
Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day). Subject to _Section_ __ _
6.4(b)_, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit the
Company Stockholders Approval. The Transaction Committee and the Company Board
shall recommend to the Company Common Shareholders that they give the Company
Stockholders Approval and shall include such recommendation in the Proxy
Statement, except to the extent that the Transaction Committee or the Company
Board shall have made an Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by
_Section_ __ _ 6.4(b)_. The Company agrees that its obligations to hold the
Company Stockholders Meeting pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ shall not
be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or
communication to the Company of any Acquisition Proposal, the occurrence of
any Intervening Event or by the making of any Adverse Recommendation Change.
The Company shall not adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting
without the prior written consent of Parent; _provided_ , that the Company
shall have the right to adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting
if: (i) after consultation with Parent, for a single period not to exceed ten
(10) Business Days from the date on which the Company Stockholders Meeting is
originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement), the Company has
not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Company
Common Stock to obtain the Company Stockholders Approval; (ii) on the date on
which the Company Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth
in the Proxy Statement), there are insufficient shares of Company Common
Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholders Meeting; or
(iii) after consultation with Parent, the failure to adjourn or postpone the
Company Stockholders Meeting would reasonably be expected to be a violation
of applicable Law for the distribution of any required amendment or supplement
to the Proxy Statement to be timely provided to the holders of Company Common
Stock (the period that the Company Stockholders Meeting is adjourned or
postponed, the " _Adjournment Period_ ") .

 

SECTION 8.2. _Regulatory and Other Undertakings_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the parties

Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent or Merger Sub, or any of their

the Company and its Affiliates) or the Company (in the case of Parent and its
Affiliates), which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) the parties hereto each hereby

to comment on such public statement or press release in advance of its

Agreement, or (ii) if any representation or warranty of Parent and Merger Sub
shall have become untrue, in each case of clauses (i) and (ii), which breach

or

its covenants and obligations under _Section_ __ _ 6.4_), or (ii) if any
representation or warranty of the Company shall have become untrue, in each
case of clauses (i) and (ii), which breach or failure to perform or to be
true, individually or in the aggregate has resulted or would reasonably be
expected to result in a failure of a condition set forth in  _Section_ __ _
9.3(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 9.3(c)_ (such circumstance, a " _Material Company
Breach_ "), and such Material Company Breach cannot be or, to the extent
curable by the Company, has not been cured by the earlier of (1) the End Date
and (2) twenty (20) days after the giving of written notice to Parent of such

SECTION 11.4. _Expenses_.

 

(a) _General_. Except as expressly otherwise provided herein, all costs
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions
shall be paid by the party incurring such costs or expenses.

_ 10.1(c)_, (B) is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 10.1(b)(i)_ and at such time Parent could have terminated this Agreement
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.1(c)_, (C) is terminated by the Company
or Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.1(b)(ii)_, or (D) is terminated by
the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.1(b)(i)_ and at such time
Parent could have terminated this Agreement pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
10.1(b)(ii)_, then the Company shall pay to Parent in immediately available
funds the Termination Fee, in the case of a termination by Parent, within two
Business Days after such termination and, in the case of a termination by the
Company, at the time of such termination. " _Termination Fee_ " means, (1)
with respect to a termination pursuant to the foregoing clauses (A) or (B),
$10,000,000 in cash, and (2) with respect to a termination pursuant to the
foregoing clauses (C) or (D), $2,500,000 in cash.

(ii) If (A) this Agreement is terminated (x) by Parent pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 10.1(f)(i)_, (y) by the Company or Parent pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 10.1(b)(ii)_ or (z) by the Company or Parent pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 10.1(b)(i)_ and at such time Parent could have terminated this

applicable breach an Acquisition Proposal (with 50% being substituted for
references to 15% in the definition thereof for the purposes of this _Section_
__ _ 11.4(b)(ii)_) shall have been made and shall not have been withdrawn,
or (II) in the case of a termination pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.1(b)(ii)_,
or pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.1(b)(i)_ when at such time Parent
could have terminated this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
10.1(b)(ii)_, prior to the taking of a vote to adopt this Agreement at the
Company Stockholders Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof, an
Acquisition Proposal shall have been made and shall

 



-71-  not have been withdrawn (with 50% being substituted for references to 15% in
the definition thereof for the purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 11.4(b)(ii)_)
and (C) prior to the first anniversary of the date of such termination, the
Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal or any Acquisition Proposal shall have been consummated, then the
Company shall pay to Parent a fee in the amount of $10,000,000 (the " _Tail
Fee_ ") (less any payment made by the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _
11.4(b)(i)_) in immediately available funds within two Business Days after the
occurrence of the last of the events described in clauses (A), (B) and (C) of
this _Section_ __ _ 11.4(b)(ii)_.

 

(c) _Other Costs and Expenses_. The Company acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 11.4_ are an integral part of
the Transactions and that, without these agreements, Parent and Merger Sub
would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay
any amount due to Parent on or prior to the date such amounts are due
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 11.4_, and, in order to obtain such payment,
Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the
amount due pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 11.4_, the Company shall also
pay any costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses)
incurred by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with a legal action or
proceeding to enforce the obligations to pay the Termination Fee or Tail Fee
that results in a judgment against the Company for such amount, together with
interest on the amount of any unpaid fee, cost or expense at the publicly
announced prime rate of Citibank, N.A., in effect on the date such amounts
were originally due hereunder, from the date such fee, cost or expense was
required to be paid to (but excluding) the payment date.

 

(d) Parent and Merger Sub agree that, upon any valid termination of this
Agreement in accordance with the terms herein under circumstances where the
Tail Fee (or Termination Fee if that is the amount payable and no payment
could be payable under _Section_ __ _ 11.4(b)(ii)_) is payable by the Company
pursuant to this Section and such Tail Fee (or Termination Fee) is received
in full, Parent and Merger Sub shall be precluded from any other remedy
against the Company, at law or in equity or otherwise, and neither Parent nor
Merger Sub shall seek to obtain any recovery, judgment, or damages of any
kind, including consequential, indirect, or punitive damages, against the
Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries or any of their respective
directors, officers, employees, partners, managers, members, shareholders or
Affiliates or their respective Representatives in connection with this
Agreement or the Transactions. In no event will the Company be required to (i)
pay the Termination Fee to the other Party on more than one occasion or (ii)
pay the Tail Fee to the other Party on more than one occasion.

SECTION 11.5. _Exhibits; Disclosure Letters_. All Exhibits annexed hereto
are hereby incorporated in and made a part of this Agreement as if set forth
in full herein. References to this Agreement shall include the Company
Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter. The parties hereto agree
that any reference in a particular Section of the Company Disclosure Letter
or Parent Disclosure Letter, as applicable, shall be deemed to be an exception
to (or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) the applicable
representations and warranties (or applicable covenants) that are contained
in the corresponding Section of this Agreement and any other representations
and warranties that are contained in this Agreement to which the relevance of
such item thereto is reasonably apparent on its face. The mere inclusion of
an item in the Company Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter, as
applicable, as an exception to (or, as

 



-72-  applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) a representation or warranty shall
not be deemed an admission that such item represents a material exception or
material fact, event or circumstance or that such item would have a Company
Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect, as applicable or
establish any standard of materiality to define further the meaning of such
terms for purposes of this Agreement.

 

SECTION 11.6. _Waiver_. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 11.3_ hereof, at any
time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after the Company
Stockholders Meeting, Parent (on behalf of itself and Merger Sub) may (a)
extend the time for the performance of any of the covenants, obligations or
other acts of the Company, or (b) waive any inaccuracy of any representations
or warranties or compliance with any of the agreements or covenants of the
Company or with any conditions to its own obligations. Any agreement on the
part of Parent (on behalf of itself and Merger Sub) to any such extension or
waiver will be valid only if such waiver is set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of Parent by its duly authorized officer. Subject to
_Section_ __ _ 11.3_ hereof, at any time prior to the Effective Time,
whether before or after the Company Stockholders Meeting, the Company may (a)
extend the time for the performance of any of the covenants, obligations or
other acts of Parent or Merger Sub, or (b) waive any inaccuracy of any
representations or warranties or compliance with any of the agreements or
covenants of Parent or Merger Sub or with any conditions to its own
obligations. Any agreement on the part of the Company to any such extension or
waiver will be valid only if such waiver is set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of the Company by its duly authorized officer. The
failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement or otherwise will not constitute a waiver of such rights. The
waiver of any such right with respect to particular facts and other
circumstances will not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and
circumstances, and each such right will be deemed an ongoing right that may
be asserted at any time and from time to time.

SECTION 11.7. _Governing Law_. This Agreement will be deemed to be made
in and in all respects will be interpreted, construed and governed by and in
accordance with the Laws of the State of New York without giving effect to any
choice of Law or conflict of Law provision or rule that would cause the
application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York,
except (a) to the extent that the law of the Republic of the Marshall Islands
is mandatorily applicable to the Merger and (b) all matters relating to the
fiduciary duties of the Company Board and the Transaction Committee shall be
subject to the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands.

MAIL, POSTAGE PREPAID, TO SUCH PARTY AT THE ADDRESS SPECIFIED IN
THIS AGREEMENT, SUCH SERVICE TO BECOME EFFECTIVE 15 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER SUCH
MAILING. NOTHING HEREIN WILL IN ANY WAY BE DEEMED TO LIMIT THE ABILITY OF ANY
PARTY HERETO TO SERVE ANY SUCH LEGAL PROCESS, SUMMONS, NOTICES AND DOCUMENTS
IN ANY OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR TO OBTAIN JURISDICTION
OVER OR TO BRING ACTIONS, SUITS OR PROCEEDINGS AGAINST ANY OTHER PARTY HERETO
IN SUCH OTHER JURISDICTIONS, AND IN SUCH MANNER, AS MAY BE PERMITTED BY ANY
APPLICABLE LAW.

 

SECTION 11.9. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY

SECTION 11.11. _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way
be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse
to any party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in a reasonably acceptable manner in order that
the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated
to the fullest extent possible.

 

SECTION 11.12. _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not

such obligation (other than in connection with any action for temporary

Agreement are included for convenience of reference only and will not affect
