gross sales actually invoiced by the Buyer or any of its Affiliates or

any and all sales of such Transferred Theken Company Product to
third parties/unaffiliated Persons, as determined in accordance with

said deductions relate to the sales referenced in item (x) of this paragraph,

For Transfer Events which occur during the First Earn-Out Period, the
calculation of Transferred Trade Sales with respect to the First Earn-Out
Period shall include the estimated sales for the month of such Transfer Event
and for each month through the end of the First Earn-Out Period, and the
calculation of Transferred Trade Sales with respect to the Second Earn-Out
Period shall include the estimated sales for all twelve (12) months of the
Second Earn-Out Period. For Transfer Events which occur during the Second
Earn-Out Period, the calculation of Transferred Trade Sales with respect to
the Second Earn-Out Period shall include the estimated sales for the month of
such Transfer Event and for each month through the end of the Second Earn-Out
Period. 

 

    #####

month of the First Earn-Out Period and is with respect to a Transferred
Theken Company Product that achieved sales of $1,200,000 over the twelve (12)
full calendar month period prior to the Transfer Event, then the Transferred
Trade Sales of such product for each of the remaining six (6) months of the
First Earn-Out Period would be $720,000 (equal to $1,200,000 multiplied by
0.10 multiplied by 6). Transferred Trade Sales during the Second Earn-Out
Period would be $1,584,000 (equal to the sum of (i) $1,200,000 multiplied by
0.10 multiplied by 6, plus (ii) $1,200,000 multiplied by 0.12 multiplied by
6).

Working Capital Amount and the Preliminary Closing Cash Amount. Upon
reasonable advance written request by the Member Representative, the
Member Representative, and/or his representatives, shall be given reasonable
access to the Buyers books and records to the extent necessary to enable the
Member Representative to verify, within the Review Period, the information
and computations in the Closing Date Balance Sheet and related computations
of the Preliminary Working Capital Amount and the Preliminary Closing Cash
Amount. If the Member Representative accepts such Closing Date Balance Sheet
and related computations of the Preliminary Working Capital Amount and
Preliminary Closing Cash Amount by the delivery of a written acceptance of
the same to the Buyer prior to the expiration of the Review Period,
or alternatively, if the Member Representative does not give written notice
to the Buyer setting forth in reasonable detail each of the objections of the
Member Representative to such Closing Date Balance Sheet and related
computations of the Preliminary Working Capital Amount and
Preliminary Closing Cash Amount (a " _Statement of Objections_ ") prior to
the expiration of the Review Period, then in either case such Closing Date
Balance Sheet shall be final and binding upon the Parties, and the
Preliminary Working Capital Amount shall be deemed the final, definitive
Working Capital amount and the Preliminary Closing Cash Amount shall be
deemed the final, definitive Closing Cash Amount. In the event that the
Member Representative delivers a Statement of Objections to the Buyer during
the Review Period, the Member Representative and the Buyer shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any disputed items, and thereby
attempt to agree in writing on the final, definitive Working Capital amount
and/or final, definitive Closing Cash Amount, within thirty (30) days
following the receipt by the Buyer of the Statement of Objections. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(b) If the Parties are unable to reach an agreement in writing as to the
final, definitive Working Capital amount and/or final, definitive Closing
Cash Amount within such thirty (30) day period as set forth in _Section
2.4.3(a)_, then the matter shall be submitted to an independent accounting
firm or valuation specialist as shall be mutually agreed in writing between
the Buyer and the Member Representative (the " _Settlement Accountant_ ").
The Settlement Accountant shall determine the matters still in dispute
as identified in the Statement of Objections (as the same may be modified in
writing by the Parties as a result of their commercially reasonable efforts
to resolve any disputed items) and establish the final, definitive Working
Capital amount and/or final, definitive Closing Cash Amount. The Settlement
Accountant shall make its determination of the final, definitive Working
Capital amount and/or final, definitive Closing Cash Amount (which in no
event shall be more favorable to the Buyer than the Preliminary Working
Capital Amount, and/or Preliminary Closing Cash Amount, derived from the
Closing Date Balance Sheet, nor more favorable to the Sellers than the Working
Capital amount, and/or Closing Cash Amount, shown on the Statement of
Objections) within thirty (30) days (or as soon as practicable thereafter if
the Settlement Accountant notifies the Parties that it requires additional
time to make such determination) following the submission of the matter to
the Settlement Accountant for resolution. The Parties shall deliver to the
Settlement Accountant a copy of this Agreement, a copy of the Closing Date
Balance Sheet together with all documents delivered to the Member
Representative by the Buyer under _Section 2.4.2_ and a copy of
the Statement of Objections together with all documents delivered by the
Member Representative under  _Section 2.4.3(a)_. In addition, in connection
with the written agreement naming the Settlement Accountant the Parties may
also agree to any additional procedures and/or process issues with respect to
the Settlement Accountants determination hereunder ( _e.g._ , prohibition of
_ex parte_  discussions with the Settlement Accountant). The fees and
expenses of the Settlement Accountant shall be allocated ratably among the
Sellers, on one hand, and the Buyer, on the other hand, in the same
proportion that the aggregate dollar amount of items unsuccessfully disputed
by each such Party (as finally determined by the Settlement Accountant) bears
to the aggregate dollar amount of all disputed items submitted to the
Settlement Accountant. With respect to other costs, the Sellers, on one hand,
and the Buyer and the Company, on the other hand, shall pay their own
costs in connection with the determination made pursuant to this _Section
2.4.3_, including the fees and expenses of their respective attorneys and
accountants, if any. 

  

(c) The sum of the Working Capital amount _plus_ the Closing Cash Amount, in
each case as finally agreed or determined in accordance with this _Section
2.4.3_ shall be referred to herein as the " _Final Working Capital
Amount_."

Section 2.4.4 _Adjustment Payments_. 

  

(a) In the event that the Final Working Capital Amount is _greater_ than the
Target Working Capital Amount, such excess is referred to herein as the "
_Excess Working Capital Amount_." 

  

(b) In the event that the Final Working Capital Amount is _less_ than the
Target Working Capital Amount, the amount equal to the Target Working Capital
Amount _minus_ the Final Working Capital Amount is referred to herein as the
" _Working Capital Deficiency_." 

  

(c) If there is a Working Capital Deficiency and it is _less_ than the Closing
Payment Holdback Amount, the Buyer shall, on or prior to the Working Capital
Adjustment Payment Date, pay an amount equal: (i) to the Closing Payment
Holdback Amount _minus_ the Working Capital Deficiency,  _plus_ (ii) an
amount equal to interest thereon at the rate published in _The Wall
Street Journal_ from time to time as the "prime rate" for the period from the
Closing Date through the Working Capital Adjustment Payment Date, which
amount shall be paid, in accordance with both the Allocation Schedule and
_Section 2.5.6_, (x) to the Member Representative for the benefit of all
Sellers, and (y) to the Appreciation Rights Holders. 

  

(d) If there is a Working Capital Deficiency and it is _greater_ than the
Closing Payment Holdback Amount, the Buyer shall retain the full amount of
the Closing Payment Holdback Amount and shall be entitled to deduct from the
amount otherwise payable as the First Earn-Out Amount an amount equal to: (i)
the Working Capital Deficiency _minus_ the Closing Payment Holdback Amount,
_plus_ (ii) an amount equal to the interest thereon for the period from the
Closing Date through to date of the First Earn-Out Payment at the rate
published in _The Wall Street Journal_  from time to time as the "prime rate"
for the period from the Closing Date through the date such payment is made
(such sum, the " _Working Capital Deficiency Payment_ ") (it being agreed
that in the event that the Working Capital Deficiency Payment is greater than
the amount otherwise payable as the First Earn-Out Payment, the Buyer shall
be entitled to deduct such remaining amount from the amount otherwise payable
as the Second Earn-Out Payment). 

  

(e) If there is an Excess Working Capital Amount, the Buyer shall, on or prior
to the Working Capital Adjustment Payment Date, pay an amount equal to: (i)
the Excess Working Capital Amount,  _plus_ (ii) the Closing Payment Holdback
Amount, _plus_ (iii) an amount equivalent to interest thereon ( _i.e._ ,
interest on the sum of (i) and (ii) above) at the rate published in _The Wall
Street Journal_ from time to time as the "prime rate" for the period from the
Closing Date through the Working Capital Adjustment Payment Date, which
amount shall be paid, in accordance with both the Allocation Schedule and
_Section 2.5.6_, (x) to the Member Representative for the benefit of all
Sellers, and (y) to the Appreciation Rights Holders.

the Parties) indicating the Buyers good faith calculation of the Trade Sales

Representative a statement (the " _First Earn-Out Statement_ "), setting
forth the Buyers calculation of: (i) the First Earn-Out Amount, _less_ (ii)

terms of this Agreement, and _less_ (iii) the amount of any Earn-
Out Acceleration Payment previously paid and credited in accordance with
_Section 2.5.4(b)_, if any (such net amount, the " _First Earn-Out Payment_
"). The Buyer shall deliver with the First Earn-Out Statement the supporting
financial information used in making the computations of the First Earn-Out
Payment. The First Earn-Out Payment shall be payable on the First Earn-
Out Payment Date, in accordance with both the Allocation Schedule and
_Section 2.5.6_, (x) to the Member Representative for the benefit of all

(b) Upon receipt of the First Earn-Out Statement, the Member Representative
shall have sixty (60) days (the " _First Earn-Out Review Period_ ") following

Member Representative, the Member Representative, along with
his representatives, shall be given reasonable access to the Buyers books
and records to the extent reasonably necessary to verify the information and
computations contained in the First Earn-Out Statement. If the Member
Representative accepts the First Earn-Out Statement by delivery of a written
acceptance of the same to the Buyer prior to the expiration of the First Earn-
Out Review Period, or alternatively, if the Member Representative does not
give the Buyer written notice setting forth in reasonable detail each of the
objections of the Member Representative to the First Earn-Out Statement (the
" _First Earn-Out Dispute Notice_ ") prior to the expiration of the First
Earn-Out Review Period, then in either case the First Earn-Out Payment as set
forth therein shall be final and binding upon the Parties. In the event that
the Member Representative does not accept such First Earn-Out Statement as
provided above, then the Member Representative shall deliver to the Buyer the
First Earn-Out Dispute Notice during the First Earn-Out Review Period
and such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for each of
the Member Representatives objections including a schedule setting forth the
computations of the First Earn-Out Amount (and the Earn-Out Acceleration Net
Amount, if applicable) by the Member Representative together with supporting
financial information used in making its computations thereof. In the event
the Member Representative delivers a First Earn-Out Dispute Notice to the
Buyer during the First Earn-Out Review Period, the Member Representative and
the Buyer shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any
disputed items as soon as practicable following the Buyers receipt of
the First Earn-Out Dispute Notice and for a period of sixty (60) days
thereafter. If the Parties are unable to reach an agreement in writing
regarding the First Earn-Out Statement during such sixty (60) day period,
then during such sixty (60) day period they shall also discuss in good faith
the appropriate third party dispute resolution procedure; _provided, however_
, that, in all cases, the Parties agree (and shall agree as part of any such
third party dispute resolution procedure) that the fees, costs and expenses
of the Person (including, as applicable, any accountant, court or arbitrator)
resolving such dispute shall be allocated ratably among the Sellers, on one
hand, and the Buyer, on the other hand, in the same proportion that the
aggregate dollar amount of items unsuccessfully disputed by each such
Party(ies) (as finally determined by third party dispute resolution
procedure) bears to the aggregate dollar amount of all disputed items
submitted in connection therewith. Upon the final determination of the
matters in dispute set forth in the First Earn-Out Dispute Notice, and in the
event that as part of such final determination it is determined that the
Buyer shall be required to pay any amounts in excess of the First Earn-
Out Payment, then the Buyer shall pay, on the First Earn-Out Adjustment
Payment Date, (i) any such excess amount, _plus_ (ii) an amount equal to
interest on such excess amount at Adjusted LIBOR for the period from the date
of the First Earn-Out Payment Date through the First Earn-Out Adjustment
Payment Date (such amount, the " _First Earn-Out Adjustment Payment_ "), in
accordance with both the Allocation Schedule and _Section 2.5.6_, (x) to the
Member Representative for the benefit of all Sellers, and (y) to the
Appreciation Rights Holders. With respect to other fees, costs and expenses,
the Sellers, on one hand, and the Buyer and the Company, on the other hand,
shall pay their own fees, costs and expenses in connection with the
determination made pursuant to this _Section 2.5.1_, including the fees,
costs and expenses of their respective attorneys and accountants, if any.

Section 2.5.2 _Second Earn-Out Statement_. 

  

(a) Within forty-five (45) days following the expiration of each fiscal
quarter during the Second Earn-Out Period (other than the last fiscal quarter
of the Second Earn-Out Period), the Buyer shall deliver to the Member
Representative a report (in a format to be reasonably agreed to by the
Parties) indicating the Buyers good faith calculation of the Trade Sales for
the previous quarter (it being agreed that such quarterly reports shall be
non-binding on the Parties and are intended for general informational
purposes only). Within sixty (60) days following the expiration of the Second
Earn-Out Period, the Buyer shall prepare and deliver to the Member
Representative a statement (the " _Second Earn-Out Statement_ "), setting
forth the Buyers calculation of: (i) the Second Earn-Out Amount, _less_ (ii)
as applicable, the amount of any Earn-Out Deductions to be deducted from,
offset against or held back from the Second Earn-Out Amount pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement, and _less_ (iii) the amount of any Earn-Out
Acceleration Payment previously paid and credited in accordance with _Section
2.5.4(b)_, if any (such net amount, the " _Second Earn-Out Payment_ "). The
Buyer shall deliver with the Second Earn-Out Statement the supporting
financial information used in making the computations of the Second Earn-
Out Payment. The Second Earn-Out Payment shall be payable on the Second Earn-
Out Payment Date, in accordance with both the Allocation Schedule and

Sellers, and (y) to the Appreciation Rights Holders. 

  

(b) Upon receipt of the Second Earn-Out Statement, the Member Representative
shall have sixty (60) days (the " _Second Earn-Out Review Period_ ")
following the Member Representatives receipt of the Second Earn-Out
Statement to review the Second Earn-Out Statement. Upon reasonable advance
written request by the Member Representative, the Member Representative, along
with his representatives, shall be given reasonable access to the Buyers
books and records to the extent reasonably necessary to verify the

does not give the Buyer written notice setting forth in reasonable detail
each of the objections of the Member Representative to the Second Earn-Out
Statement (the " _Second Earn-Out Dispute Notice_ ") prior to the expiration
of the Second Earn-Out Review Period, then in either case the Second Earn-Out
Payment as set forth therein shall be final and binding upon the Parties. 

  

    ##### 

  

   

In the event that the Member Representative does not accept such Second Earn-
Out Statement as provided above, then the Member Representative shall deliver
to the Buyer the Second Earn-Out Dispute Notice during the Second Earn-Out
Review Period and such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis
for each of the Member Representatives objections, including a schedule
setting forth the computations of the Second Earn-Out Amount (and the Earn-
Out Acceleration Net Amount, if applicable) by the Member Representative
together with supporting financial information used in making its
computations thereof. In the event the Member Representative delivers a
Second Earn-Out Dispute Notice to the Buyer during the Second Earn-Out Review
Period, the Member Representative and the Buyer shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any disputed items as soon as
practicable following the Buyers receipt of the Second Earn-Out Dispute
Notice and for a period of sixty (60) days thereafter. If the Parties are
unable to reach an agreement in writing regarding the Second Earn-Out
Statement during such sixty (60) day period, then during such sixty (60) day
period they shall also discuss in good faith the appropriate third party
dispute resolution procedure; _provided, however_ , that, in all cases, the
Parties agree (and shall agree as part of any such third party dispute
resolution procedure) that the fees, costs and expenses of the Person

such dispute shall be allocated ratably among the Sellers, on one hand, and

in dispute set forth in the Second Earn-Out Dispute Notice, and in the event

shall be required to pay any amounts in excess of the Second Earn-Out
Payment, then the Buyer shall pay, on the Second Earn-Out Adjustment Payment
Date, (i) any such excess amount, _plus_ (ii) an amount equal to interest on

Proposal. The Company and the Sellers will immediately notify the Buyer in

the Closing Date, to the extent permitted by the terms and conditions of such
plans, the Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Continuing
Employees to receive service credit for service with the Company to the same
extent such service was credited under similar employee benefit plans of the

heirs, successors and assigns (each, a " _Seller Indemnified Party_ ")
against, and hold each Seller Indemnified Party harmless from, any Damages
incurred by such Seller Indemnified Party that arise out of or relate to,
whether directly or indirectly: 

  

(a) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by the
Buyer contained in this Agreement (including under _Article VI_) or in any
agreement, certificate or other instrument delivered by Buyer pursuant to
this Agreement (without regard to any qualification contained therein as to
materiality); and 

  

(b) any breach or non-performance by the Buyer of any of its covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement or in any agreement, certificate or

Section 11.3 _Indemnification Process_. 

  

Section 11.3.1 Except with respect to Taxes and matters relating to Taxes
(which are covered under _Section 11.5_), any claim by a Buyer Indemnified
Party or a Seller Indemnified Party (referred to herein as the " _Indemnified
Party_ ") asserted against any other Party to this Agreement (referred to
herein as the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") shall be asserted, within
the relevant survival period provided for in _Section 11.1_ above, and
resolved in accordance with this _Section 11.3_. In the event that any
Seller is an Indemnifying Party, all notices and other communications shall
be delivered to or made by the Member Representative on behalf of such
Seller(s); _provided however_ , that notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, in the event that any Seller is an Indemnifying Party with
respect to claims under  _Section 11.2.1_, then the Member Representative
and the Seller Indemnifying Party may instruct the Buyer Indemnified Party to
deliver and accept notices or other communications to and from the applicable
Seller Indemnifying Party. 

  

Section 11.3.2 Any Indemnified Party seeking indemnification hereunder shall,
within the relevant survival period provided for in _Section 11.1_ above,
deliver, or cause to be delivered, a written notice (each a " _Claim Notice_
") to the Indemnifying Party as follows: (i) in the case of a claim for
indemnification brought by a Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to  _Sections
11.2.1,_ _11.2.2_ , _11.2.3_ and/or _11.5_ , the Buyer Indemnified Party
shall deliver a Claim Notice to the Member Representative; and (ii) in the
case of a claim for indemnification brought by any Seller Indemnified Party
pursuant to _Section 11.2.4_, the Member Representative shall deliver a
Claim Notice to the Buyer (it being agreed that the Buyer shall only be
obligated to accept Claim Notices from the Member Representative). Each Claim
Notice shall describe in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to any
claims for indemnification hereunder and shall include in such Claim Notice
(if then known) the amount or the method of computation of the amount of such
claim, and a reference to the provision of this Agreement or any agreement,
certificate or instrument executed pursuant hereto or in connection herewith
upon which such claim is based; _provided, however_ , that a Claim Notice in
respect of any Proceeding, including any action at law or suit in equity,
brought by or against a third Person (a " _Third-Party Claim_ ") as to which
indemnification will be sought shall be given promptly after the Indemnified
Party first becomes aware of the commencement of the Proceeding; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that failure to deliver any such Claim Notice shall not affect
such Indemnified Partys right to indemnification hereunder, except to the
extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced as a result of
such failure; _provided, further_ , any Indemnified Party
seeking indemnification shall use good faith efforts to deliver any such
Claim Notice within a reasonable period after discovery of the same. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

Section 11.3.3 Within fifteen (15) days after delivery of a Claim Notice
related to a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right,
but not the obligation, upon written notice to the Indemnified Party
acknowledging in writing its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party
hereunder against any Damages that may result from such Third Party Claim,
to investigate, contest, assume the defense of or settle any such Third Party
Claim through counsel of the Indemnifying Partys choice (such counsel to be
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party); _provided_ that the
Indemnifying Party may not assume control of the defense of a Third
Party Claim (w) involving alleged criminal liability against the Company,
Buyer or any of their Affiliates, directors, officers or employees, (x) in
which equitable relief is sought against the Indemnified Party (but only with
respect to the part of any Third Party Claim seeking equitable relief), (y)
in which the maximum amount of the Third Party Claim, together with all other
pending claims (whether a Third Party Claim or otherwise), is less than the
Deductible, or (z) in which the maximum amount of the Third Party Claim is
more than the Cap (it being agreed that this provision (z) shall be applied
on an aggregate, not claim-by-claim basis) (items (w)  (z) referred
to collectively as the " _Non-Assumable Third Party Claims_ "); _provided
further_ that the Indemnified Party may, at its option and at its own
expense, participate in (but not control) the investigation, contesting,
defense or settlement of any such Third Party Claim through representatives
and counsel of its own choosing, cost and expense;  _provided further_ , that
the Indemnifying Party shall not settle any Third Party Claim unless (i) such
settlement is on exclusively monetary terms (other than standard provisions
related to confidentiality and similar matters) and includes a complete
release of the Indemnified Party from liability or (ii) the Indemnified Party
shall have consented to the terms of such settlement, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If requested by
the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party will reasonably cooperate with
the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in contesting any Third Party Claim
being defended by the Indemnifying Party or, if appropriate and related to
such Third Party Claim, in making, at the sole cost and expense of
the Indemnifying Party, any counterclaim against the claimant in such Third
Party Claim, or any cross-complaint against any Person. The Indemnifying
Partys indemnification obligations shall include payment for the reasonable
fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party: (a) in
connection with a Third Party Claim for any period during which the
Indemnifying Party has failed or refused (or is not permitted) to assume the
defense thereof but only to the extent that it is finally determined in
accordance with _Section 11.7_ that the Indemnifying Party was obligated to
indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim under
this Agreement, and (b) if the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense
thereof, if Indemnified Party reasonably and in good faith concludes, upon
the advice of counsel, that it and the Indemnifying Party have a conflict of
interest that would make it inappropriate for the same counsel to represent
both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party or different defenses
available with respect to such Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party
shall be entitled to participate in (but not to control) the defense of any
Third Party Claim which it has not elected to assume the defense of, or any
Non-Assumable Third Party Claim, with its own counsel and at its own
expense. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

Section 11.3.4 From and after the delivery of a Claim Notice under this
Agreement, at the reasonable request of the Indemnifying Party and subject to
the appropriate confidential undertakings, each Indemnified Party shall grant
the Indemnifying Party and its representatives all reasonable access to the
books, records and properties of such Indemnified Party to the
extent reasonably related to the matters to which the Claim Notice relates.
All such access shall be granted during normal business hours and shall be
granted under conditions which will not unreasonably interfere with the
business and operations of such Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party
will not, and shall require that its representatives do not, use (except
in connection with such Claim Notice) or disclose to any third Person other
than the Indemnifying Partys representatives (except as may be required by
applicable Law) any information obtained pursuant to this _Section 11.3_
which is designated as confidential by an Indemnified Party. 

   

Section 11.4 _Limitation on Indemnity_. 

  

Section 11.4.1 Subject to the provisions of _Section 11.4.2_, with respect to
any claims for indemnification (i) by any Buyer Indemnified Party under

Purchase Agreement, respectively), or (ii) by any Seller Indemnified
Party under _Section 11.2.4(a)_ (other than claims under _Section
11.2.4(a)_ related to any of the Extended Duration Representations defined
under _Section 11.1.1(a)_), the Parties agree that the following limitations
shall apply: 

  

(a) no such Indemnified Party shall be entitled to make any such claim unless
and until the aggregate amount of all Damages suffered by such Indemnified
Party exceeds Four Hundred Thousand Dollars ($400,000) (the " _Threshold
Amount_ "), whereupon, such Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover
any Damages in excess of Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($200,000) (the "
_Deductible_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if an Indemnified Partys claim
for recovery of Damages relates to the Companys Intellectual Property Rights
which are the subject matter of a Delivered Opinion, the Deductible shall be
increased by the amount of legal fees actually paid by the Company to obtain
the Delivered Opinions, which amount shall not exceed One Hundred
Fifty Thousand Dollars ($150,000) ( _i.e._ , a maximum Deductible of Three
Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($350,000)); 

  

(b) the aggregate cumulative liability of the Sellers with respect to any such
claims brought by any Buyer Indemnified Party shall not exceed the amount
equal to thirty percent (30%) of the sum of (i) the Purchase Price, _plus_
(ii) the Theken Disc Adjusted Purchase Price, _plus_  (iii) the Therics
Adjusted Purchase Price; _provided, however_ , that notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement, the Theken Disc Purchase Agreement or the Therics Purchase
Agreement to the contrary, such amount shall not exceed an aggregate of Sixty
Million Dollars ($60,000,000) (the amount calculated in this _Section
11.4.1(b)_, the " _Cap_ "); _provided, further_ , that the aggregate
cumulative liability of each Seller (other than RRT) under the Cap shall not
exceed thirty percent (30.00%) of the product of the Purchase Price
multiplied by such Sellers "Percentage" as set forth on the 

  

    ##### 

  

   

Allocation Schedule, attached as _Exhibit A_ to this Agreement hereto;
_provided, further,_ that the aggregate cumulative liability of RRT under the

of the Purchase Price multiplied by 90.85% ( _i.e._ , RRTs and the
Appreciation Rights Holders aggregate "Percentage" as set forth on the
Allocation Schedule, attached as _Exhibit A_ to this Agreement hereto),
_plus_ (ii) Five Million Seven Hundred Twenty Thousand Three Hundred
Sixteen Dollars ($5,720,316); _provided, further_ , that the aggregate
cumulative liability with respect to such indemnification claims pursuant to 
_Sections 11.2.3(a)_ (other than claims under _Section 11.2.3(a)_ related to
any of the "Extended Duration Representations" defined under Section
11.1.1(a) or (b) of the Theken Disc Purchase Agreement) shall not exceed Six
Million Dollars ($6,000,000); _provided, further_ , that the aggregate
cumulative liability with respect to such indemnification claims pursuant to

Million Four Hundred Thousand Dollars ($2,400,000); and 

  

(c) the aggregate cumulative liability of the Buyer with respect to any such
claims brought by any Seller Indemnified Party shall not exceed an amount

Section 11.4.2 Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary and
for the avoidance of doubt, the limitations under _Section 11.4.1_,
including the Threshold Amount, the Deductible and the Cap, shall not apply
to (a) any payments (whether Purchase Price, adjustments to the Purchase
Price based upon the Final Working Capital Amount or Earn-Out Payments
(including any credits to Earn-Out Payments as a result of any Earn-
Out Acceleration Payments or otherwise)) owed by the Buyer to the Sellers
pursuant to _Article II_ of this Agreement and _Section 11.6.2_, or (b) any
other claims for indemnification by any Indemnified Party not specifically
limited pursuant to _Section 11.4.1_, or (c) any claims for indemnification
by any Indemnified Party that arise out of or relate to, whether directly or
indirectly, fraud or intentional misrepresentation by the Party against whom
such claims for indemnification are made (including any claims for
indemnification related to any Extended Duration Representations of such
Party defined under _Section 11.1.1(e)_). 

  

Section 11.4.3 Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary and
for the avoidance of doubt, no Buyer Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
indemnification hereunder for any claims which such Buyer Indemnified Party
has already been fully indemnified pursuant to the terms of the Theken Disc
Purchase Agreement or Therics Purchase Agreement.

Indemnified Party under _Sections 11.2.2_ or _11.5,_ the aggregate
cumulative liability of each Seller (other than RRT) under this Agreement
shall not exceed the amount of Purchase Price actually received by such
Seller; _provided, however_ , that the limitations under this _Section
11.4.4_ shall not apply to any claims for indemnification by any Buyer
Indemnified Party under  _Sections 11.2.2(b)_ or _11.5_ against any Seller
relating to any breach or non-performance by such Seller of its covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement or in any agreement, certificate or
other instrument delivered by such Seller pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 11.5 _Tax Indemnification_. 

  

Section 11.5.1 Subsequent to the Closing, each Seller, jointly and severally,
shall indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties against, and hold each of the
Buyer Indemnified Parties harmless from: (i) all Liability for Taxes of the
Company for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods, except to the extent such Taxes are
included as current liabilities in the determination of the Final
Working Capital Amount, (ii) any Damages incurred by such Buyer Indemnified
Party that arise out of or relate to, whether directly or indirectly, any
breach by the Sellers, the Member Representative or their Affiliates of any
covenant contained in this _Section 11.5_ or _Article VIII_, and (iii) any
Damages incurred by such Buyer Indemnified Party that arise out of or relate
to, whether directly or indirectly, any breach of any representation or
warranty contained in  _Section 5.10_ (without regard to any qualification
contained therein as to materiality), except to the extent that any such
Damages are otherwise indemnified pursuant to the foregoing clauses (i) or
(ii) or are Taxes included as current liabilities in the determination of the
Final Working Capital Amount. For purposes of this _Section 11.5_, "Taxes"
shall include the amount of Taxes that would have been paid but for (A)
income Tax deductions related to payments to the Appreciation Rights Holders
at Closing pursuant to the Appreciation Rights Closure Agreements pursuant to
_Section 2.2_ and (B) the application of any credit or net operating loss
or capital loss deduction attributable to Post-Closing Tax Periods. 

  

Section 11.5.2 In the case of any Straddle Period: (i) real, personal and
intangible property Taxes or other Taxes levied on a per diem basis
(collectively, " _Per Diem Taxes_ ") of the Company for a Pre-Closing Tax
Period shall be equal to the amount of such Per Diem Taxes for the entire
Straddle Period _multiplied_ by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of days during the Straddle Period that are in the Pre-Closing Tax
Period and the denominator of which is the total number of days in the
Straddle Period; and (ii) all other Taxes of the Company, including income,
sale, use and payroll Taxes, for any Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be computed
as if such Tax Period ended as of the end of the day on the Closing Date. 

  

Section 11.5.3 The Sellers indemnification obligation for Taxes for a Pre-
Closing Tax Period shall initially be effected by the payment to the Buyer of
the excess of (i) the amount of Taxes due for such Pre-Closing Tax Period as
evidenced by a Tax Return prepared in accordance with  _Section 8.1_ or
other appropriate documentation relating to the resolution of a Tax
Claim over (ii) the amount of such Taxes paid by the Sellers at any time
_plus_ the amount of such Taxes paid by the Company on or prior to the
Closing Date, _plus_ the amount of such Taxes included as a current Liability
in the determination of the Final Working Capital Amount. In the case of any
contested Tax, payment of the Tax to the appropriate Governmental Authority
shall not be considered to be due earlier than the date a final determination
with respect to such Tax Liability is made by the appropriate Governmental
Authority or court. 

  

Section 11.5.4 If a Governmental Authority shall make any claim relating to
Taxes that, if successful, might result in an indemnification payment and/or
offset pursuant to this  _Section 11.5_ (a " _Tax Claim_ "), the Buyer shall
promptly and in any event no more than fifteen (15) days following receipt of
such Tax Claim, give written notice of such Tax Claim to the Member
Representative, together with copies of all notices and communications
relating to such Tax Claim; _provided, however_ , the failure of the Buyer to
give such notice shall only relieve the Sellers from their indemnification
obligations hereunder to the extent they are actually prejudiced by such
failure. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

Section 11.5.5 The Member Representative may elect to control all Proceedings
at his own expense and may make all decisions with respect to any Tax Claim
relating to a Tax Period (or portion thereof) ending on or prior to the
Closing Date. Unless the Member Representative so elects, the Buyer shall
control all Proceedings and may make all decisions with respect to any
Tax Claim relating to a Tax Period (or portion thereof) ending on or prior to
the Closing Date. The controlling party shall not settle any such Tax Claim
without the other partys (the Buyer or the Member Representative, as the
case may be) consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed. 

   

Section 11.6 _Set-Off Right Against Earn-Out Payments; Unresolved Claims_. 

  

Section 11.6.1 Subject to any applicable limitations set forth in _Section
11.4_, the Buyer shall have the right to deduct from and offset against the
First Earn-Out Amount and/or the Second Earn-Out Amount, as the case may be,
the amount of any Damages in respect of which it is agreed by the Parties in
writing, or otherwise finally determined pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement, that any Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification hereunder and for which such Buyer Indemnified Party has not
already been indemnified (the " _Resolved Claim Amount_ "). For the avoidance
of doubt, the Parties agree and acknowledge that the Buyers right to deduct
any Resolved Claim Amounts from, and offset any Resolved Claim Amounts
against, any Earn-Out Payment shall apply to the entirety of the applicable
Earn-Out Payment(s) and shall not be allocable to that portion of such Earn-
Out Payment(s) payable to any particular Seller(s) or Appreciation Rights
Holder(s), regardless of the nature of the indemnification claim that gave
rise to such Resolved Claim Amount. 

  

Section 11.6.2 Notwithstanding anything expressed or implied in this _Article
XI_ to the contrary, in the event that a Buyer Indemnified Party has (i)
delivered to the Member Representative a Claim Notice pursuant to _Section
11.3.2_, or a notice in respect of any Tax Claim pursuant to _Section
11.5.4_; and (ii) such indemnification claim has not been fully and finally
agreed to or resolved pursuant to this Agreement, including, as applicable,
payment in full of any amounts in respect thereof to the Buyer Indemnified
Party (each, an " _Unresolved Claim_ "), then with respect to the aggregate
amount of any Damages claimed by any Buyer Indemnified Party under an
Unresolved Claim (the " _Unresolved Claim Amount_ "), the Parties agree that,
with respect to any Unresolved Claim Amount that exists as of the First Earn
Earn-Out Payment Date, the Buyer shall be entitled to holdback from the
amount of the First Earn-Out Amount otherwise payable hereunder the full
amount such Unresolved Claim Amount (it being agreed that in the event that
the Unresolved Claim Amount is greater than the amount otherwise payable as
the First Earn-Out Payment, the Buyer shall be entitled to holdback (i) the
entirety of the amount of the First Earn-Out Amount otherwise payable
hereunder and (ii) any excess Unresolved Claim Amounts from the amount of the
Second Earn-Out Amount otherwise payable hereunder); and, with respect to any
Unresolved Claim Amount that exists as of the Second Earn Earn-Out Payment
Date, the Buyer shall be entitled to holdback from the amount of the Second
Earn-Out Amount otherwise payable hereunder the full amount of such
Unresolved Claim Amount. Upon final agreement by the Parties or other final
determination hereunder of any Unresolved Claim, (a) the Buyer shall be
entitled to retain for its own account, and deduct from and offset against
the applicable Earn-Out Payment(s), any amount of such Unresolved Claim that
is finally agreed or determined to be payable to a Buyer Indemnified Party,
and/or (b) the Buyer shall, within five (5) Business Days of such
final agreement or determination, pay (i) any amount of such Unresolved Claim
that is agreed or determined to be payable, _plus_ (ii) an amount equal to
interest thereon at Adjusted LIBOR for the period from the date of the
holdback through the date of such payment (collectively, an " _Excess
Holdback Payment_ "), in accordance with both the Allocation Schedule and
_Section 2.5.6_ , (x) to the Member Representative for the benefit of all
Sellers, and (y) to the Appreciation Rights Holders.

Section 11.7 _Remedies_. The indemnification provisions in this _Article
XI_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Parties with respect to
any breach of the respective representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise arising out of this
Agreement, regardless of the theory or cause of action pled, except for the
remedies of specific performance, injunction and other equitable relief;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no Party hereto shall be deemed to have waived
any rights, claims, causes of action or remedies if and to the extent gross
negligence, fraud or intentional misrepresentation is proven on the part of a
Party by another Party hereto and such rights, claims, causes of action or
remedies may not be waived under applicable Law; _provided, further_ , that
no Party shall be deemed to have waived its right to enforce this Agreement
via litigation in a court of law, or alternatively, any other
dispute resolution mechanism agreed upon by the Parties in writing ( _e.g._ ,
arbitration).

Section 12.2 _Authority of Representative; Reliance_. 

  

Section 12.2.1 The appointment of the Member Representative in this _Article
XII_ shall be deemed coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable, and

do hereby jointly and severally agree to indemnify and hold the Member
Representative harmless from and against any and all liability, loss, cost,

organization, or any provision of Ohio Law, including but not limited to the
Ohio LLC Act, which any Releasing Party now has or ever might claim to have
against any or all of the Released Parties, whether or not currently
asserted or known, arising from or relating to any event, dispute or
occurrence which arose on or prior to the date hereof, including, without
limitation, any Releasing Partys ownership of any Units of the Company
and/or the purchase thereof (collectively, the " _Released Claims_ "). 

 

    ##### 

  

  

Section 13.2 _Releasor Waiver_. Each Releasor, on behalf of himself or itself
and the other Releasing Parties, and only as concerns the Released Claims,
specifically waives the benefits of any statutory or common law of any state,
which in effect provides that a general release does not extend to claims
which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor. It
is expressly understood and agreed that the releases contained herein are
intended to cover and do cover all known facts and/or claims, as well as any
further facts and/or claims within the scope of such Released Claims not
known or anticipated, but which may later develop or be discovered, including
all the effects and consequences thereof. Each Releasor, on behalf of himself
or itself and the other Releasing Parties, acknowledges that they may
hereafter discover facts in addition to, or different from, those which they
now believe to be true with respect to the subject matter of the Released
Claims released herein, but agree that they have taken that possibility
into account in reaching this Agreement, and that the Released Claims given
herein shall be and remain in effect notwithstanding the discovery or
existence of any such additional or different facts, as to which the
Releasing Parties expressly assume the risk. In connection with such waiver
and relinquishment of Released Claims, each Releasor, on behalf of himself or
itself and the other Releasing Parties, hereby acknowledges that they are
aware that their attorneys may hereafter discover claims or facts in addition
to, or different from, those which they now know or believe to exist with
respect to the subject matter of the Released Claims, or any part of this
Agreement, but that it is nonetheless their intention to fully, finally and
forever settle and release all disputes and differences, known or unknown,
suspected or unsuspected, as to the Released Claims. 

  

Section 13.3 _Releasor Covenants_. Each Releasor covenants, and shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause the other Releasing Parties, never to
institute any Released Claim whether at law or in equity, against any or all
of the Released Parties, in any court or administrative agency or before any
other public or private tribunal. 

  

Section 13.4 _Releasor Indemnification_. Each Releasor severally agrees that
if he or it hereafter commences, joins in, or in any manner seeks relief
through any action (including, without limitation, any complaint, cross-
claim, counterclaim, third-party complaint or interpleader complaint in any
jurisdiction or any action before an administrative or regulatory agency,
whether against a Party to this Agreement or any third party) arising out of,
based upon, or relating to any of the Released Claims released by him or it
hereunder, or in any manner asserts against any Released Party any of the
Released Claims released hereunder, then such Releasor will indemnify
and hold harmless the Released Parties from any settlements, judgments, costs
and expenses (including attorneys fees and costs) incurred by such person or
entity as a result of or in connection with such action. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

Section 13.5 _Excluded Claims_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, in no event shall this general release of Released Claims
apply to any Released Claims that (i) may arise from any breach by any of the
Released Parties of this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, or
the failure of the Released Parties to properly perform any obligation or
duty arising on the part of any of the Released Parties on or after the date
hereof under this Agreement, or (ii) arise from fraud, intentional
misrepresentation or gross negligence of the Released Parties. 

  

Section 13.6 _Acknowledgment of Understanding by Releasor_. Each Releasor
acknowledges that such Releasor (i) has received the advice of legal counsel
in connection with this _Article XIII_ , (ii) has read and understands that
this is a general release of Released Claims and (iii) intends to be legally
bound by the same.

Section 14.1 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Company
Disclosure Schedule, any other exhibits, schedules, certificates, lists and

hereto, except as provided herein, and supersedes all prior agreements and

Section 14.2 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is
invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or

this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be
interpreted to be only as broadly as is enforceable.

fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement or the
other Transactions contemplated hereby, shall be paid by the Party incurring

Section 14.5 _Binding Effect; Persons Benefiting; Assignment_. This Agreement
shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Parties hereto and
their respective successors and permitted assigns. No provision of this
Agreement is intended or shall be construed to confer upon any entity or
Person other than the Parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns any right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this
Agreement or any part hereof. This Agreement may not be assigned by any of
the Parties hereto; _provided, however_ , that, the Buyer may assign all or
part of its rights under this Agreement and delegate all or part of its
obligations under this Agreement to (i) a wholly-owned Subsidiary of the
Buyer, in which event all of the rights and powers of the Buyer and remedies
available to the Buyer under this Agreement shall extend to and be
enforceable by such Subsidiary and provided that Buyer provides the
Member Representative with written notice of such assignment within five (5)
Business Days of the same, or (ii) subject to _Section 2.5.4_ of this
Agreement, any Person who acquires the Buyer, whether by way of merger or the
purchase of all of the Buyers outstanding capital stock or substantially all
of the Buyers assets. In the event of any such assignment and delegation,
the term "Buyer" as used in this Agreement shall be deemed to refer to such
Subsidiary or successor of the Buyer, as the case may be, where reference is
made with respect to actions to be taken with respect to the Transactions,
and shall be deemed to include both the Buyer and such Subsidiary or
successor of the Buyer, as the case may be, where appropriate.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, irrespective of any
assignment under  _Section 14.5(i)_ above the original Buyer and assignor
under _Section 14.5(i)_ ( _i.e._ , Integra LifeSciences Holdings
Corporation) shall remain primarily liable for the performance of all of its
obligations under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, and as such,
the Sellers may seek to enforce this Agreement against Integra LifeSciences
Holdings Corporation without first having to seek enforcement against any
assignee under _Section 14.5(i)_ above, and furthermore, nothing in this
_Section 14.5_ shall be deemed a waiver of any claim which Sellers might
have against Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation.   

  

    ##### 

  

    

Section 14.6 _Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures_. This Agreement may be
executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an
original, but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
agreement, it being understood that all of the Parties need not sign the same
counterpart. This Agreement may be executed and delivered by facsimile
or email transmission of a file in ".pdf" or similar format and upon such
delivery, each signature shall be deemed to have the same effect as if the
original signature had been delivered to the other Party. 

  

Section 14.7 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT, ANY OF THE ANCILLARY AGREEMENTS OR OTHER AGREEMENTS ENTERED INTO
IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY.
EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT
SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS
OF SUCH WAIVERS, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS  _SECTION 14.7_. 

   

Section 14.8 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_. 

  

Section 14.8.1 Except as required by the mandatory provisions of the Ohio LLC
Act, this Agreement (including any claim or controversy arising out of or
relating to this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements) shall be governed
by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware,
without giving effect to conflicts of laws principles that would result in
the application of the law of any other state. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

Section 14.8.2 Each of the Parties hereto hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive
jurisdiction of any Delaware State court, or, if no such state court has
proper jurisdiction, the Federal court of the United States of America,
sitting in Wilmington, Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof, in
any actions or Proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the
Ancillary Agreements and any Transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or
for recognition or enforcement of any Judgment relating thereto, and each of
the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence
any such action or Proceeding except in such courts, (ii) agrees that any
claim in respect of any such action or Proceeding may be heard and determined
in such Delaware State court or, if no such state court has proper
jurisdiction, the such Federal court, (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it
may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of venue of any action or Proceeding in the
state or federal courts located in any such Delaware State or Federal court,
and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of
an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or Proceeding in the
state or federal courts located in any such Delaware State or Federal court.
Each of the Parties hereto agrees that a final Judgment in any such action or
Proceeding may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the Judgment or
in any other manner provided by Law. Each Party to this Agreement
irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices
in _Section 14.4_. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any
Party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by
Law. 

  

Section 14.9 _Specific Enforcement_. The Parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any United
States District Court located in Delaware State or in any Delaware State
court, in addition to any other remedy to which any Party is entitled at law
or in equity. 

  

Section 14.10 _Headings_. Headings of the Articles and Sections of this
Agreement are for the convenience of the Parties only, and shall be given no
substantive or interpretive effect whatsoever. 

  

Section 14.11 _Waivers_. The Member Representative or the Buyer may, by
written notice to the other Party hereto: (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other actions of the other Party
under this Agreement; (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations or
warranties of the other Party contained in this Agreement or in any
document delivered pursuant to this Agreement; (iii) waive compliance with
any of the conditions or covenants of the other Party contained in this
Agreement; or (iv) waive performance of any of the obligations of the other
Party under this Agreement. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, no
action taken pursuant to this Agreement, including without limitation any
investigation by or on behalf of any Party, shall be deemed to constitute a
waiver by the Party taking such action of compliance with any
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement. The waiver by any Party hereto of a breach of any provision
hereunder shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any prior or
subsequent breach of the same or any other provision hereunder.
