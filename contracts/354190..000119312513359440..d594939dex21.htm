   3.9. | If at any time prior to Completion there occurs a Material
Adverse Change or a Breach of the Conduct Undertakings which is incapable of
remedy or, if capable of remedy is not fully remedied at no cost to the Group,
such that the circumstances giving rise to the Material Adverse Change or
Breach of the Conduct Undertakings no longer give rise to a Material Adverse
Change or Breach of the Conduct Undertakings, to the satisfaction of the
Purchaser (acting reasonably) at least two Business Days before the
Completion Date, the Purchaser shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement
before Completion, by notice in writing to the Seller.

Group Company, provided that the Seller notifies the Purchaser in advance of
the situation, the reasonably anticipated effects (including the reasonably

and operation and the proposed action to be taken (it being acknowledged by
the Purchaser that it may not be practicable for the Seller to provide
detailed information in all circumstances if the time or actions required to
do so could prejudice the Groups ability to minimise, prevent or remedy the
emergency or other extraordinary situation); 
---|---|--- 



     | 4.2.2. | in order to comply with a requirement of applicable law

---|---|---

Agreement provided that such contract or arrangement was entered into in the
ordinary course or with the prior written consent of the Purchaser in
accordance with clause 4.1; 
---|---|--- 



     | 4.2.5. | undertaken or omitted at the written request of the
Purchaser (although neither the Seller nor any Group Company shall be obliged
to comply with any such request). 
---|---|--- 
 



   4.3. | The Seller shall forthwith upon the execution of this Agreement
by the parties formally direct (and a copy of the direction shall be forthwith
provided to the Purchaser) (such direction being in the Agreed Form) the
CEO and the CFO of the Group to meet with the Purchaser and the Purchaser
shall meet with the CEO and the CFO of the Group on a weekly basis (or more
frequently as is reasonably requested by the Purchaser) to discuss any actions
which might require the consent of the Purchaser pursuant to clause 4.1 and
the Purchaser agrees to discuss in good faith and in a collaborative manner
any such matters with the CEO and the CFO.

the Purchaser on demand an amount in cash equal to the amount or value of

available to the Purchaser arising (directly or indirectly) from a breach of
clause 6.1. 
---|--- 



   6.3. | The Seller shall not be liable for any claim under clause 6.2
unless written notice has been given by the Purchaser to the Seller stating in
reasonable detail the nature of the breach and, if practicable, the
amount claimed on or before the date which is three months following the
Completion Date. 
---|--- 



   6.4. | Save in the case of fraud by the Seller, the liability of the

---|---|--- 
 



6 other party.

administrator, or any other person by reason of performance by it of its
obligations under this Schedule 6 and any security taken by the Guarantor from
the Purchaser in consideration for this guarantee and any money received by
the Guarantor by proving in the bankruptcy, insolvency or liquidation of the
Purchaser, shall be held in trust absolutely for the Seller or any member of
the Retained Group, in respect of the obligations of the Guarantor in this
Schedule 6. 
---|--- 



   9. | The Seller or any member of the Retained Group may make any number
of demands of the Guarantor and the obligations of the Guarantor under this
Schedule 6 shall be in addition to and independent of any other rights
under any other agreement or security which the Seller or any member of the
Retained Group may at any time hold in respect of any of the obligations of
the Purchaser under this Agreement. The Seller and any member of the Retained
Group may enforce its rights against the Guarantor without first having
recourse to any other such agreement or security or exercising any rights or
remedies against the Purchaser.

and until the amount demanded has been paid in full, the Seller or any member
of the Retained Group may undertake such actions as it thinks fit against the
