"Exchanged Option") equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole
number) of (x) the number of shares of the applicable class of Company Common

applicable to the corresponding former Company Warrant immediately prior to
the Effective Time. At or prior to the Effective Time, the parties and their
boards, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions that
are necessary to effectuate the treatment of the Company Warrants pursuant to
this subsection.

 

(b)For purposes of calculating the aggregate amount of shares of New
Kensington Class A Common Stock or New Kensington Class B Common Stock, as the
case may be, issuable to each holder of shares of Company Capital Stock

SECTION 3.02. Exchange of Certificates.

 

(a)Exchange Agent. On the Closing Date, Kensington shall deposit, or shall
cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company that shall be designated
by Kensington and is reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the "Exchange
Agent"), (i) for the benefit of the holders of Company Class A Common Stock
and Company Class A Preferred Stock, for exchange in accordance with this
Article III, the number of shares of New Kensington Class A Common Stock
sufficient to deliver the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration payable
with respect thereto pursuant to Section 3.01(b)(i) of this Agreement and (ii)
for the benefit of the holders of Company Class B Common Stock and Company
Class B Preferred Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Article III, the
number of shares of New Kensington Class B Common Stock sufficient to deliver
the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration payable with respect thereto
pursuant to Section 3.01(b)(ii) of this Agreement (such shares of New
Kensington Class A Common Stock and New Kensington Class B Common Stock, in
each case referred to in the preceding clauses (i) and (ii), together with any
dividends or distributions with respect thereto (pursuant to Section 3.02(c),
being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). Kensington shall cause
the Exchange Agent pursuant to irrevocable instructions, to pay the Per Share
Merger Consideration out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this
Agreement. Except as contemplated by Section 3.02(c) hereof, the Exchange
Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. All shares deposited hereunder
shall not be certificated.

 

(b)Exchange Procedures. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time,
Kensington shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Exchange Agent
to mail to each holder of Company Capital Stock entitled to receive the Per
Share Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.01: a letter of transmittal,
which shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to Kensington and the Company
(the "Letter of Transmittal") and shall specify (i) that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates evidencing such
shares of Company Capital Stock (the "Certificates") shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent or confirmation of
cancellation of such Certificates from the Company's transfer agent, Solium
Capital ULC and its affiliates, d/b/a Shareworks (each, a "Transfer Agent
Cancellation"); and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates pursuant to the Letter of Transmittal. Within two (2)
Business Days (but in no event prior to the Effective Time) after the
surrender to the Exchange Agent of all Certificates held by such holder for
cancellation (or a Transfer Agent Cancellation), together with a Letter of
Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto and such other documents as may be required pursuant to
such instructions, the holder of such Certificates shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefore, and Kensington shall cause the Exchange Agent
to deliver, the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance with
the provisions of Section 3.01, and the Certificate(s) so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
3.02, each Certificate entitled to receive the applicable Per Share Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section 3.01 shall be deemed at all times
after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration that such holder is
entitled to receive in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.01.

 

19  



 

(c)Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of Kensington Common
Stock. No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the
Effective Time with respect to the New Kensington Common Stock with a record
date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to the shares of New Kensington Common Stock
represented thereby until the holder of such Certificate shall surrender such
Certificate in accordance with Section 3.02(b). Subject to the effect of
escheat, tax or other applicable Laws, following surrender of any such
Certificate, Kensington shall pay or cause to be paid to the holder of shares
of New Kensington Common Stock issued in exchange therefore, without interest,
(i) promptly, but in any event within five (5) Business Days of such
surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time and theretofore paid with respect to such shares of
New Kensington Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the
amount of dividends or other distributions, with a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date occurring after
surrender, payable with respect to such shares of New Kensington Common Stock.

 

(d)No Further Rights in Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock. The
Per Share Merger Consideration payable upon conversion of the Company Capital
Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid
and issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company
Capital Stock.

 

(e)Adjustments to Per Share Merger Consideration. The Per Share Merger
Consideration shall be adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of any
stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to Kensington Capital Stock occurring on or after the
date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time (but, for the avoidance
of doubt, shall not be adjusted to reflect any change in the capitalization of
the Company, except to the extent expressly set forth in the definition of
"Exchange Ratio" and its components as determined in accordance with Section
3.06).

 

(f)Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Capital Stock for one year
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Kensington, upon demand, and
any holders of Company Capital Stock who have not theretofore complied with
this Section 3.02 shall thereafter look only to Kensington for the Per Share
Merger Consideration. Any portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by
holders of Company Capital Stock as of a date which is immediately prior to
such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
government entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the
property of Kensington free and clear of any claims or interest of any person
previously entitled thereto.

 

(g)No Liability. None of the Exchange Agent, Kensington or the Surviving
Corporation shall be liable to any holder of Company Capital Stock for any
such Company Capital Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect
thereto) or cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law in accordance with Section 3.02.

 

(h)Withholding Rights. Each of the Surviving Corporation and Kensington shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Capital Stock such amounts
as it is required to deduct and

 

20  



 

withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the United States
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any provision of
state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
by the Surviving Corporation or Kensington, as the case may be, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of the Company Capital Stock (or intended recipients of
compensatory payments) in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by the Surviving Corporation or Kensington, as the case may be.

 

(i)Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact and related indemnity
by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed (such
affidavit and indemnity to be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Kensington and the Surviving Corporation but in any case to not require the
delivery of a bond), the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration
that such holder is otherwise entitled to receive pursuant to, and in
accordance with, the provisions of Section 3.01.

 

SECTION 3.03. Stock Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of Company Capital Stock thereafter on the records
of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates representing Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
Company Capital Stock, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by
Law. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the
Exchange Agent or Kensington for any reason shall be converted into the
applicable Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance with the applicable
provisions of Section 3.01.

 

SECTION 3.04. Payment of Expenses.

 

(a)No sooner than five (5) or later than two (2) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall provide to Kensington a written report setting
forth a list of all of the following fees and expenses incurred by or on
behalf of the Company in connection with the preparation, negotiation and
execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby (together with written invoices and wire transfer
instructions for the payment thereof), solely to the extent such fees and
expenses are incurred and expected to remain unpaid as of the close of
business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing Date: (i) the
fees and disbursements of outside counsel to the Company incurred in
connection with the Transactions and (ii) the fees and expenses of any other
agents, advisors, consultants, experts, financial advisors and other service
providers engaged by the Company in connection with the Transactions
(collectively, the "Outstanding Company Transaction Expenses"). On the
Closing Date following the Closing, Kensington shall pay or cause to be paid
by wire transfer of immediately available funds all such Outstanding Company
Transaction Expenses. For the avoidance of doubt, the Outstanding Company
Transaction Expenses shall not include any fees and expenses of the Company's
stockholders.

 

(b)No sooner than five (5) or later than two (2) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, Kensington shall provide to the Company a written report setting
forth a list of all fees, expenses and disbursements incurred by or on behalf
of Kensington or Merger Sub for outside

 

21  



 

counsel, agents, advisors, consultants, experts, financial advisors and other
service providers engaged by or on behalf of Kensington or Merger Sub in
connection with the Transactions or otherwise in connection with Kensington's
operations (together with written invoices and wire transfer instructions for
the payment thereof) (collectively, the "Outstanding Kensington Transaction
Expenses"). On the Closing Date following the Closing, Kensington shall pay
or cause to be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds all such
Outstanding Kensington Transaction Expenses.

 

(c)Kensington shall not pay or cause to be paid any Outstanding Kensington
Transaction Expenses or Outstanding Company Transaction Expenses other than in
accordance with this Section 3.04.

 

SECTION 3.05. Appraisal Rights.

 

(a)Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary and to the
extent available under the DGCL, shares of Company Common Stock and Company
Preferred Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
and that are held by stockholders of the Company who shall have neither voted
in favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who shall have
demanded properly in writing appraisal for such Company Common Stock or
Company Preferred Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and
otherwise complied with all of the provisions of the DGCL relevant to the
exercise and perfection of dissenters' rights shall not be converted into, and
such stockholders shall have no right to receive, the applicable Per Share
Merger Consideration unless and until such stockholder fails to perfect or
withdraws or otherwise loses his, her or its right to appraisal and payment
under the DGCL. Any stockholder of the Company who fails to perfect or who
effectively withdraws or otherwise loses his, her or its rights to appraisal
of such shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock under
Section 262 of the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into,
and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to
receive the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration, without any interest
thereon, upon surrender, in the manner provided in this Article III, of the
Certificate or Certificates that formerly evidenced such shares of Company
Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock (as the case may be).

 

(b)Prior to the Closing, the Company shall give Kensington (i) prompt notice
of any demands for appraisal received by the Company and any withdrawals of
such demands, and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Kensington (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld), make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

 

SECTION 3.06. Calculation of Exchange Ratio.

 

(a)For purposes of this Agreement, the "Determination Date" shall be the date
that is ten (10) Business Days prior to the anticipated date for Closing, as
agreed upon by Kensington and the Company at least ten (10) Business Days
prior to the date of the Kensington Stockholders' Meeting (the "Anticipated
Closing Date"). No later than the Determination Date, the Company shall
deliver to Kensington a calculation (the "Exchange Ratio Calculation") setting
forth the Company's good faith, estimated calculation of Exchange Ratio as of
the

 

22  



 

Anticipated Closing Date (using an estimate of each component thereof as of
such date, prepared and certified by the Company's chief financial officer or
principal accounting officer. The Company shall make relevant back-up
materials used or useful in preparing the Exchange Ratio Calculation, as
reasonably requested in writing by Kensington, available to Kensington and, if
requested in writing by Kensington, its accountants and counsel at reasonable
times and upon reasonable notice.

 

(b)Within three (3) Business Days after the Company delivers the Exchange
Ratio Calculation (the "Response Date"), Kensington shall have the right to
dispute any part of such Exchange Ratio Calculation by delivering a written
notice to that effect to the Company (a "Dispute Notice"). Any Dispute Notice
shall identify in reasonable detail the nature of any proposed revisions to
the Exchange Ratio Calculation.

 

(c)If on or prior to the Response Date, (i) Kensington notifies the Company in
writing that it has no objections to the Exchange Ratio Calculation or (ii)
Kensington fails to deliver a Dispute Notice as provided in Section 3.06(b),
then the Exchange Ratio as set forth in the Exchange Ratio Calculation
delivered to Kensington shall be deemed, subject to the terms of Section
3.06(f), to have been finally determined for purposes of this Agreement and to
represent the Exchange Ratio at the Anticipated Closing Date for purposes of
this Agreement.

 

(d)If Kensington delivers a Dispute Notice on or prior to the Response Date,
then Representatives of Kensington and the Company shall promptly meet and
attempt in good faith to resolve the disputed item(s) and negotiate an agreed-
upon determination of the Exchange Ratio, which agreed upon Exchange Ratio
amount shall be deemed to have been finally determined for purposes of this
Agreement and to represent the Exchange Ratio at the Anticipated Closing Date
for purposes of this Agreement.

 

(e)If Representatives of Kensington and the Company are unable to negotiate an
agreed-upon determination of the Exchange Ratio at the Anticipated Closing
Date pursuant to Section 3.06(d) within three (3) Business Days after delivery
of the Dispute Notice (or such other period as Kensington and the Company may
mutually agree upon), then Kensington and the Company shall jointly select an
independent auditor of recognized national standing (the "Accounting Firm") to
resolve any remaining disagreements as to the Exchange Ratio Calculation. The
Company shall promptly deliver to the Accounting Firm the relevant back-up
materials used in preparing the Exchange Ratio Calculation, and Kensington and
the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting
Firm to make its determination within five (5) Business Days of accepting its
selection. Kensington and the Company shall be afforded the opportunity to
present to the Accounting Firm any material related to the unresolved disputes
and to discuss the issues with the Accounting Firm; provided, however, that no
such presentation or discussion shall occur without the presence of a
Representative of each of Kensington and the Company. The determination of the
Accounting Firm shall be limited to the disagreements submitted to the
Accounting Firm. The determination of the amount of the Exchange Ratio made by
the Accounting Firm shall be deemed to have been finally determined for
purposes of this Agreement and to represent the Exchange Ratio at the
Anticipated Closing Date for purposes of this Agreement, and the parties shall
delay the Closing until the resolution of the matters described in this
Section 3.06(e). The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be
allocated between Kensington and the Company in the same proportion that the
disputed

 

23  



 

amount of the Exchange Ratio that was unsuccessfully disputed by such party
(as finally determined by the Accounting Firm) bears to the total disputed
amount of the Exchange Ratio.

 

(f)Following the final determination of Exchange Ratio as of the Anticipated
Closing Date in accordance with this Section 3.06 (either as a result of the
mutual agreement of the parties or the determination of the Accounting Firm),
the parties shall not be required to determine the Exchange Ratio again even
though the Closing Date may occur later than the Anticipated Closing Date,
except that either party may request a redetermination of the Exchange Ratio
if the Closing Date is more than fifteen (15) Business Days after the
Anticipated Closing Date (including as a result of the engagement of the
Accounting Firm), in which event the procedures set forth in this Section 3.06
shall once again apply and the parties shall select a new Anticipated Closing
Date.

authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification to, any

Exchange Act, Blue Sky Laws and state takeover laws, the pre-merger
notification requirements of the HSR Act, and filing and recordation of
appropriate merger documents as required by the DGCL and (ii) where the

46  



 

consummation of any of the Transactions or otherwise prevent Kensington or
Merger Sub from performing its material obligations under this Agreement.

 

SECTION 5.06. Compliance. Neither Kensington nor Merger Sub is or has been
in conflict with, or in default, breach or violation of, (a) any Law
applicable to Kensington or Merger Sub or by which any property or asset of
Kensington or Merger Sub is bound or affected, or (b) any note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or
other instrument or obligation to which Kensington or Merger Sub is a party or

Effect. Each of Kensington and Merger Sub is in possession of all material
franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances,
exceptions, consents, certificates, approvals and orders of any Governmental

SECTION 5.07. SEC Filings; Financial Statements; Sarbanes-Oxley.

 

(a)Kensington has filed all forms, reports, schedules, statements and other
documents, including any exhibits thereto, required to be filed by it with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") since June 25, 2020, together
with any amendments, restatements or supplements thereto (collectively, the
"Kensington SEC Reports"). Kensington has prior to the date of this Agreement
furnished to the Company (with respect to amendments or modifications made on
or prior to the date of this Agreement) and shall have promptly furnished to
the Company (with respect to amendments or modifications after the date of
this Agreement) true, complete and correct copies of all amendments and
modifications that have not been filed by Kensington with the SEC to all
agreements, documents and other instruments that previously had been filed by
Kensington with the SEC and are then in effect. As of their respective dates,
the Kensington SEC Reports (i) complied in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Securities Act"), the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder, and (ii) did not, at the time they
were filed, or, if amended, as of the date of such amendment, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. Each director and executive officer of Kensington has filed with
the SEC on a timely basis all documents required with respect to Kensington by
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.

 

(b)Each of the financial statements (including, in each case, any notes
thereto) contained in the Kensington SEC Reports was prepared in accordance
with GAAP (applied on a consistent basis) and Regulation S-X and Regulation
S-K, as applicable, throughout the periods indicated (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited financial
statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) and each fairly presents, in
all material respects, the financial position, results of operations, changes
in stockholders equity and cash flows of Kensington as at the respective dates
thereof and for the respective periods indicated therein, (subject, in the
case of unaudited statements, to normal and recurring year-end adjustments
which have not had, and would not reasonably be expected to individually or in
the aggregate be material). Kensington has no off-balance sheet arrangements
that are not disclosed in the

 

47  



 

Kensington SEC Reports. No financial statements other than those of
Kensington are required by GAAP to be included in the consolidated financial
statements of Kensington.

 

(c)Except as and to the extent set forth in the Kensington SEC Reports,
neither Kensington nor Merger Sub has any liability or obligation of a nature
(whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) required to be reflected
on a balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP, except for liabilities
and obligations arising in the ordinary course of Kensington's and Merger
Sub's business.

 

(d)Kensington is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable
listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of The New York Stock
Exchange.

 

(e)Kensington has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act). Such disclosure controls
and procedures are designed to ensure that material information relating to
Kensington and other material information required to be disclosed by
Kensington in the reports and other documents that it files or furnishes under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
material information is accumulated and communicated to Kensington's principal
executive officer and its principal financial officer as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Such
disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting
Kensington's principal executive officer and principal financial officer to
material information required to be included in Kensington's periodic reports
required under the Exchange Act.

 

(f)Kensington maintains systems of internal control over financial reporting
that are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with GAAP, including policies and procedures
sufficient to provide reasonable assurance: (i) that Kensington maintains
records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect, in all
material respects, its transactions and dispositions of assets; (ii) that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP; (iii) that receipts and expenditures are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and its board
of directors; and (iv) regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of its assets that could have a
material effect on its financial statements. Kensington has prior to the date
of this Agreement delivered to the Company (with respect to disclosure made on
or prior to the date of this Agreement) and shall have promptly furnished to
the Company (with respect to disclosure made after the date of this Agreement)
a true, complete and correct copy of any disclosure (or, if unwritten, a
summary thereof) by any representative of Kensington to Kensington's
independent auditors relating to any material weaknesses in internal controls
and any significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal
controls that would adversely affect the ability of Kensington to record,
process, summarize and report financial data. Kensington has no knowledge of
any fraud or whistle-blower allegations, whether or not material, that involve
management or other employees or consultants who have or had a significant
role in the internal control over financial reporting of Kensington. Since
June 25, 2020, there have been no material changes in Kensington's internal
control over financial reporting.

 

48  



 

(g)There are no outstanding loans or other extensions of credit made by
Kensington to any executive officer (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the
Exchange Act) or director of Kensington. Kensington has not taken any action
prohibited by Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

 

(h)Neither Kensington (including any employee thereof) nor Kensington's
independent auditors has identified or been made aware of (i) any significant
deficiency or material weakness in the system of internal accounting controls
utilized by Kensington, (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
Kensington's management or other employees who have a role in the preparation
of financial statements or the internal accounting controls utilized by
Kensington or (iii) any claim or allegation regarding any of the foregoing.

 

(i)As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding SEC comments
from the SEC with respect to the Kensington SEC Reports. To the knowledge of
Kensington, none of the Kensington SEC Reports filed on or prior to the date
of this Agreement is subject to ongoing SEC review or investigation as of the
date of this Agreement.

 

SECTION 5.08. Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Since June 25, 2020,
except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement, (a) Kensington has
conducted its business in the ordinary course and in a manner consistent with
past practice, and (b) there has not been any Kensington Material Adverse
Effect.

 

SECTION 5.09. Absence of Litigation. There is no Action pending or, to the
knowledge of Kensington, threatened against Kensington, or any property or
asset of Kensington, before any Governmental Authority. Neither Kensington
nor any material property or asset of Kensington is subject to any continuing
order of, consent decree, settlement agreement or other similar written
agreement with, or, to the knowledge of Kensington, continuing investigation
by, any Governmental Authority.

 

SECTION 5.10. Board Approval; Vote Required.

 

(a)The Kensington Board, by resolutions duly adopted by majority vote of those
voting at a meeting duly called and held and not subsequently rescinded or
modified in any way, has duly (i) approved this Agreement and declared its
advisability and approved the payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration
pursuant to this Agreement and the other Transactions and (iii) recommended
the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Transactions by the
stockholders of Kensington;

 

(b)The only vote of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of
Kensington necessary to approve the Transactions is the affirmative vote of a
majority of the outstanding shares of Kensington Common Stock voted by the
stockholders at a duly held stockholders meeting (the "Kensington Stockholder
Approval").

 

(c)The Merger Sub Board, by resolutions duly adopted by written consent and
not subsequently rescinded or modified in any way, has duly (i) determined
that this Agreement and the Merger are fair to and in the best interests of
Merger Sub and its sole stockholder, (ii) approved and adopted this Agreement
and the Merger and declared their advisability, (iii) approved the Merger and
the other Transactions, (iv) recommended the approval and adoption of

 

49  



 

this Agreement and the Merger by the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, and (v)

submitted for consideration by the sole stockholder of Merger Sub.

 

(d)The only vote of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of
Merger Sub is necessary to approve this Agreement, the Merger and the other
Transactions is the affirmative vote of the sole stockholder of Merger Sub.

 

SECTION 5.11. No Prior Operations of Merger Sub. Merger Sub was formed
solely for the purpose of engaging in the Transactions and has not engaged in
any business activities or conducted any operations or incurred any obligation
or liability, other than those incident to its existence or as contemplated by
this Agreement.

 

SECTION 5.12. Brokers. Except for UBS Securities LLC, Goldman Sachs and Co.
LLC, Stifel, Nicolaus and Company, Incorporated and Robert W. Baird and Co.
Incorporated, no broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to any
brokerage, finder's or other fee or commission in connection with the
Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Kensington or
Merger Sub.

 

SECTION 5.13. Kensington Trust Fund. As of the date of this Agreement,
Kensington has no less than $230,000,000.00 in the trust fund established by
Kensington for the benefit of its public stockholders (the "Trust Fund")
maintained in a trust account at JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the "Trust
Account"). The monies of such Trust Account are invested in United States
Government securities or money market funds meeting certain conditions under
Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended,
and held in trust by Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company (the
"Trustee") pursuant to the Investment Management Trust Agreement, dated as of
June 30, 2020, between Kensington and the Trustee (the "Trust Agreement").
The Trust Agreement has not been amended or modified and is valid and in full
force and effect and is enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to
the Remedies Exceptions. Kensington has complied in all material respects
with the terms of the Trust Agreement and is not in breach thereof or default
thereunder and there does not exist under the Trust Agreement any event which,
with the giving of notice or the lapse of time, would constitute such a breach
or default by Kensington or the Trustee. There are no separate contracts,
agreements, side letters or other understandings (whether written or
unwritten, express or implied): (i) between Kensington and the Trustee that
would cause the description of the Trust Agreement in the Kensington SEC
Reports to be inaccurate in any material respect; or (ii) to the knowledge of
Kensington, that would entitle any person (other than stockholders of
Kensington who shall have elected to redeem their shares of Kensington Class A
Common Stock pursuant to the Kensington Organizational Documents) to any
portion of the proceeds in the Trust Account. Prior to the Closing, none of
the funds held in the Trust Account may be released except: (A) to pay income
and franchise Taxes from any interest income earned in the Trust Account; and
(B) upon the exercise of Redemption Rights in accordance with the provisions
of the Kensington Organizational Documents. As of the date of this Agreement,
there are no Actions pending or, to the knowledge of Kensington, threatened in
writing with respect to the Trust Account. Upon consummation of the Merger
and notice thereof to the Trustee pursuant to the Trust Agreement, Kensington
shall cause the Trustee to, and the Trustee shall thereupon be obligated to,
release to Kensington as promptly as practicable, the Trust Funds in
accordance with the Trust Agreement at which point

 

50  



 

the Trust Account shall terminate; provided, however, that the liabilities and
obligations of Kensington due and owing or incurred at or prior to the
Effective Time shall be paid as and when due, including all amounts payable
(a) to stockholders of Kensington who shall have exercised their Redemption
Rights, (b) with respect to filings, applications and/or other actions taken
pursuant to this Agreement required under Law, (c) to the Trustee for fees and
costs incurred in accordance with the Trust Agreement; and (d) to third
parties (e.g., professionals, printers, etc.) who have rendered services to
Kensington in connection with its efforts to effect the Merger. As of the
date of this Agreement, assuming the accuracy of the representations and
warranties of the Company herein and the compliance by the Company with its
respective obligations hereunder, Kensington has no reason to believe that any
of the conditions to the use of funds in the Trust Account will not be
satisfied or funds available in the Trust Account will not be available to
Kensington at the Effective Time.

 

SECTION 5.14. Employees. Other than any officers as described in the
Kensington SEC Reports, Kensington and Merger Sub have never employed any
employees or retained any contractors. Other than amounts due as set forth in
the Kensington SEC Reports or for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by Kensington's officers and directors in connection with activities
on Kensington's behalf in an aggregate amount not in excess of the amount of
cash held by Kensington outside of the Trust Account, Kensington has no
unsatisfied material liability with respect to any employee, officer or
director. Kensington and Merger Sub have never and do not currently maintain,
sponsor, contribute to or have any direct liability under any employee benefit
plan (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA), nonqualified deferred compensation
plan subject to Section 409A of the Code, bonus, stock option, stock purchase,
restricted stock, incentive, deferred compensation, retiree medical or life
insurance, supplemental retirement, severance, change in control, fringe
benefit, sick pay and vacation plans or arrangements or other employee benefit
plans, programs or arrangements. Neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement nor the other Ancillary Agreements nor the consummation of the
Transactions will (i) result in any payment (including severance, unemployment
compensation, golden parachute, bonus or otherwise) becoming due to any
director, officer or employee of Kensington, or (ii) result in the
acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such benefits. The
Transactions shall not be the direct or indirect cause of any amount paid or
payable by the Kensington, Merger Sub or any affiliate being classified as an
"excess parachute payment" under Section 280G of the Code or the imposition of
any additional Tax under Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code. There is no
contract, agreement, plan or arrangement to which Kensington or Merger Sub is
a party which requires payment by any party of a Tax gross-up or Tax
reimbursement payment to any person.

 

SECTION 5.15. Taxes.

 

(a)Kensington and Merger Sub (i) have duly and timely filed (taking into
account any extension of time within which to file) all material Tax Returns
required to be filed by any of them as of the date of this Agreement and all
such filed Tax Returns are complete and accurate in all material respects;
(ii) have timely paid all Taxes that are shown as due on such filed Tax
Returns and any other material Taxes that Kensington or Merger Sub are
otherwise obligated to pay, except with respect to current Taxes not yet due

obligation under any Tax sharing agreement, Tax indemnification agreement, Tax

agreement, contract or arrangement providing for the sharing or ceding of
credits or losses, but excluding agreements, contracts, arrangements or
commitments the primary purpose of which do not relate to Taxes) or has a
potential liability or obligation to any person as a result of or pursuant to
any such agreement, contract, arrangement or commitment other than an
agreement, contract, arrangement or commitment the primary purpose of which
does not relate to Taxes.

 

(c)None of Kensington or Merger Sub will be required to include any material
item of income in, or exclude any material item of deduction from, taxable
income for any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending after the Closing
Date as a result of any: (i) change in method of accounting for a taxable
period ending on or prior to the Closing Date under Section 481(c) of the Code
(or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or foreign income
Tax law); (ii) "closing agreement" as described in Section 7121 of the Code

Tax law) executed on or prior to the Closing Date; (iii) any prepaid amount

provision of state, local or foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by
contract (but excluding contracts, the primary purpose of which do not relate
to taxes), or otherwise.

 

(f)Neither Kensington nor Merger Sub has any request for a material ruling in
respect of Taxes pending between Kensington and/or Merger Sub, on the one
hand, and any Tax authority, on the other hand.

 

(g)Neither Kensington nor Merger Sub has in any year for which the applicable
statute of limitations remains open distributed stock of another person, or
has had its stock distributed by another person, in a transaction that was
purported or intended to be governed in whole or in part by Section 355 or
Section 361 of the Code.

 

(h)Neither Kensington nor Merger Sub has engaged in or entered into a "listed
transaction" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4(b)(2).

 

SECTION 5.16. Listing. The issued and outstanding Kensington Units are
registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and are listed for
trading on The New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "KCAC.U." The issued
and outstanding shares of Kensington Class

 

52  



 

A Common Stock are registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act

threatened in writing against Kensington by The New York Stock Exchange or the
SEC with respect to any intention by such entity to deregister the Kensington
Units, the shares of Kensington Class A Common Stock, or Kensington Warrants
or terminate the listing of Kensington on The New York Stock Exchange. None
of Kensington or any of its affiliates has taken any action in an attempt to
terminate the registration of the Kensington Units, the shares of Kensington
Class A Common Stock, or the Kensington Warrants under the Exchange Act.

 

SECTION 5.17. Kensington and Merger Sub's Investigation and Reliance. Each
of Kensington and Merger Sub is a sophisticated purchaser and has made its own
independent investigation, review and analysis regarding the Company and the
Transactions, which investigation, review and analysis were conducted by
Kensington and Merger Sub together with expert advisors, including legal
counsel, that they have engaged for such purpose. Kensington, Merger Sub and
their Representatives have been provided with full and complete access to the
Representatives, properties, offices, plants and other facilities, books and
records of the Company and other information that they have requested in
connection with their investigation of the Company and the Transactions.
Neither Kensington nor Merger Sub is relying on any statement, representation
or warranty, oral or written, express or implied, made by the Company or any
of its Representatives, except as expressly set forth in Article IV (as
modified by the Company Disclosure Schedule). Neither the Company nor any of
its respective stockholders, affiliates or Representatives shall have any
liability to Kensington, Merger Sub or any of their respective stockholders,
affiliates or Representatives resulting from the use of any information,
documents or materials made available to Kensington or Merger Sub or any of
their Representatives, whether orally or in writing, in any confidential
information memoranda, "data rooms," management presentations, due diligence
discussions or in any other form in expectation of the Transactions. Neither
the Company nor any of its stockholders, affiliates or Representatives is
making, directly or indirectly, any representation or warranty with respect to
any estimates, projections or forecasts involving the Company.

SECTION 6.03. Claims Against Trust Account. The Company agrees that,
notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, the Company
does not now have, and shall not at any time prior to the Effective Time have,
any claim to, or make any claim against, the Trust Fund, regardless of whether
such claim arises as a result of, in connection with or relating in any way
to, the business relationship between the Company on the one hand, and
Kensington on the other hand, this Agreement, or any other agreement or any
other matter, and regardless of whether such claim arises based on contract,
tort, equity or any other theory of legal liability (any and all such claims
are collectively referred to in this Section 6.03 as the "Claims").
Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, the Company
hereby irrevocably waives any Claim it may have, now or in the future and will
not seek recourse against the Trust Fund for any reason whatsoever in respect
thereof; provided, however, that the foregoing waiver will not limit or
prohibit the Company from pursuing a claim against Kensington, Merger Sub or
any other person (a) for legal relief against monies or other assets of
Kensington or Merger Sub held outside of the Trust Account or for specific
performance or other equitable relief in connection with the Transactions or
(b) for damages for breach of this Agreement against Kensington (or any
successor entity) or Merger Sub in the event this Agreement is terminated for
any reason and Kensington consummates a business combination transaction with
another party. In the event that the Company commences any action or
proceeding against or involving the Trust Fund in violation of the foregoing,
Kensington shall be entitled to recover from the Company the

 

57  



 

associated reasonable legal fees and costs in connection with any such action,
in the event Kensington prevails in such action or proceeding.

respect to the Registration Statement and any amendment to the Registration
Statement filed in response thereto.

time prior to the Effective Time, any event or circumstance relating to
Kensington or Merger Sub, or their respective officers or directors, should be
discovered by Kensington which should be set forth in an amendment or a
supplement to the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement, Kensington
shall promptly inform the Company. All documents that Kensington is
responsible for filing with the SEC in connection with the Transactions will
comply as to form and substance in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder
and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.

declared effective (in the case of the Registration Statement or the Proxy
Statement) or at the time filed (in the case of a current report on Form 8-K),
(ii) the time the Proxy Statement (or any amendment thereof or supplement
thereto) is first mailed to the stockholders of Kensington (in the case of the
Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement), (iii) the time of the

the Proxy Statement), and (iv) the Effective Time (in the case of the

of a material fact or fail to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. If, at any time

in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and the Exchange Act and the

(e)Following the final determination of the Exchange Ratio at the Anticipated
Closing Date in accordance with Section 3.06 (either as a result of the mutual
agreement of the

 

59  



 

parties or the determination of the Accounting Firm), Kensington and the
Company shall mutually agree on the form and substance of a press release
setting forth the anticipated Exchange Ratio as of the Anticipated Closing
Date (the "Exchange Ratio Announcement"), which the parties shall cause to be
publicly disclosed (and which Kensington shall file on Form 8-K) no later than
four (4) Business Days prior to the Kensington Stockholders' Meeting.

 

SECTION 7.02. Kensington Stockholders' Meetings; and Merger Sub Stockholder's
Approval.

 

(a)Kensington shall call and hold the Kensington Stockholders' Meeting as
promptly as practicable after the date on which the Registration Statement
becomes effective for the purpose of voting solely upon the Kensington
Proposals, and Kensington shall use its reasonable best efforts to hold the
Kensington Stockholders' Meeting as soon as practicable after the date on
which the Registration Statement becomes effective (but in any event no later
than 30 days after the date on which the Proxy Statement is mailed to
stockholders of Kensington). In the event the Kensington Stockholders'
Meeting is scheduled to occur less than four (4) Business Days after the
publication of the Exchange Ratio Announcement, Kensington may, or the Company
may direct Kensington to, recess or adjourn the Kensington Stockholders'
Meeting until the date such that the meeting would be held on the date that is
four (4) Business Days following the publication of the Exchange Ratio
Announcement (in each case to the extent the Kensington or the Company
believes in good faith that such recess or adjournment is required by
applicable Law or the rules of The New York Stock Exchange). Kensington will
ensure that all proxies solicited in connection with the Kensington
Stockholders' Meeting are solicited in compliance with all applicable Laws and
the rules of The New York Stock Exchange. Kensington shall use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain the approval of the Kensington Proposals at the
Kensington Stockholders' Meeting, including by soliciting from its
stockholders proxies as promptly as possible in favor of the Kensington
Proposals, and shall take all other action necessary or advisable to secure
the required vote or consent of its stockholders. The Kensington Board shall
recommend to its stockholders that they approve the Kensington Proposals and
shall include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement.

 

(b)Promptly following the execution of this Agreement, Kensington shall
approve and adopt this Agreement and approve the Transactions, as the sole
stockholder of Merger Sub.

 

SECTION 7.03. Company Stockholders' Written Consent. Unless this Agreement
has been terminated in accordance with Section 9.01, upon the terms set forth
in this Agreement, the Company shall seek the irrevocable written consent, in
form and substance reasonably acceptable to Kensington, of holders of the
Requisite Approval (including the Key Company Stockholders) in favor of the
approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger and all other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Written Consent") as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Registration Statement becomes effective, and
in any event within twenty-four (24) hours after the Registration Statement
becomes effective. The Company shall not send the Registration Statement to
the stockholders of the Company, other than Key Company Stockholders, until
after delivery of the Written Consent to Kensington (it being agreed that the
Company shall seek the Written Consent even if there shall have been a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change, except if this Agreement shall have been
terminated pursuant to Section 9.01).

 

60  



 

SECTION 7.04. Access to Information; Confidentiality.

 

(a)From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, the Company and
Kensington shall (and shall cause their respective subsidiaries (if any) to):
(i) provide to the other party (and the other party's officers, directors,
employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel, agents and other
representatives, collectively, "Representatives") reasonable access at
reasonable times upon prior notice to the officers, employees, agents,
properties, offices and other facilities of such party and its subsidiaries
(if any) and to the books and records thereof; and (ii) furnish promptly to
the other party such information concerning the business, properties,
contracts, assets, liabilities, personnel and other aspects of such party and
its subsidiaries (if any) as the other party or its Representatives may
reasonably request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor
Kensington shall be required to provide access to or disclose information
where the access or disclosure would (i) jeopardize the protection of
attorney-client privilege or contravene applicable Law (including COVID-19
Measures) or (ii) require providing access that such party reasonably
determines, in light of COVID-19 or COVID-19 Measures, would jeopardize the
health and safety of any employee of such party (it being agreed that the
parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause such
information to be provided in a manner that would not result in such jeopardy
or contravention).

 

(b)All information obtained by the parties pursuant to this Section 7.04 shall
be kept confidential in accordance with the confidentiality agreement, dated
as of July 1, 2020 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), between Kensington and
the Company.

 

(c)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each party (and
its Representatives) may consult any tax advisor regarding the tax treatment
and tax structure of the Transactions and may disclose to any other person,
without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure of the
Transactions and all materials (including opinions or other tax analyses) that
are provided relating to such treatment or structure, in each case in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

SECTION 7.05. Company Solicitation; Change in Recommendation. 

 

(a)From and after the date of this Agreement and ending on the earlier of (a)
the Effective Time and (b) the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with Section 9.01, the Company shall not, and shall cause its Representatives
not to, (i) initiate, solicit, facilitate or encourage (including by way of
furnishing non-public information), whether publicly or otherwise, any
inquiries with respect to, or the making of, any Company Acquisition Proposal,
(ii) engage in any negotiations or discussions concerning, or provide access
to its properties, books and records or any Confidential Information or data
to, any person relating to a Company Acquisition Proposal, (iii) enter into,
engage in and maintain discussions or negotiations with respect to any Company
Acquisition Proposal (or inquiries, proposals or offers or other efforts that

encourage any such inquiries, proposals, offers, efforts, discussions or
negotiations, (iv) amend or grant any waiver or release under any standstill
or similar agreement with respect to any class of equity securities or the
Company, (v) approve, endorse or recommend, or propose publicly to approve,
endorse or recommend, any Company Acquisition Proposal, (vi) approve, endorse,
recommend, execute or enter into any agreement in principle, letter of intent,

memorandum of understanding, term sheet, acquisition agreement, merger
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or
other written arrangement relating to any Company Acquisition Proposal (each,
a "Company Acquisition Agreement") or any proposal or offer that could
reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Acquisition Proposal, or (vii)
resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing or otherwise authorize or permit
any of its Representatives to take any such action. The Company shall, and
shall instruct and cause each of its Representatives, to immediately cease any
solicitations, discussions or negotiations with any person (other than the
parties hereto and their respective Representatives) in connection with a
Company Acquisition Proposal. The Company also agrees that it will promptly
request each person (other than the parties hereto and their respective
Representatives) that has prior to the date of this Agreement executed a
confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of acquiring
the Company to return or destroy all Confidential Information furnished to
such person by or on behalf of it prior to the date of this Agreement. The
Company shall promptly notify Kensington (and in any event within twenty-four
(24) hours) of the receipt of any Company Acquisition Proposal after the date
of this Agreement, which notice shall identify the third party making any
Company Acquisition Proposal and shall include a summary of the material terms
and conditions of any material developments, discussions or negotiations in
connection therewith, and any material modifications to the financial or other
terms and conditions of any such Company Acquisition Proposal.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may inform any person making a
unsolicited proposal regarding a Company Acquisition Proposal of the terms of
this Section 7.05.

 

(b)Notwithstanding Section 7.05(a), prior to the receipt of the Written
Consent, the Company Board, directly or indirectly through any Representative,
may, subject to Section 7.05(c), (i) participate in, negotiations or
discussions with any third party that has made (and not withdrawn) a bona
fide, unsolicited Company Acquisition Proposal in writing that the Company
Board reasonably believes in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in a Company
Superior Proposal, and (ii) thereafter furnish to such third party non-public
information relating to the Company pursuant to an executed Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement (a copy of such confidentiality agreement shall be
promptly (in all events within twenty-four (24) hours) provided to Kensington;
provided that the Company shall promptly provide to Kensington material non-
public information that is provided to any such person which has not
previously been provided to Kensington and Merger Sub.

 

(c)The Company shall notify Kensington promptly (but in no event later than
twenty-four (24) hours) after receipt by the Company Board of any Company
Acquisition Proposal, any inquiry that would reasonably be expected to lead to
an Company Acquisition Proposal or any request for non-public information
relating to the Company or for access to the business, properties, assets,
personnel, books or records of the Company by any third party. In such
notice, the Company shall identify the third party making any such Company
Acquisition Proposal, indication or request and provide the details of the
material terms and conditions of any such Company Acquisition Proposal,
indication or request. The Company shall keep Kensington informed, on a
current and prompt basis, of the status and material terms of any such Company
Acquisition Proposal, indication or request, including the material terms and
conditions thereof any material amendments or proposed amendments. The
Company shall promptly provide Kensington copies of any nonpublic information
concerning the Company's business, present or

 

62  



 

future performance, financial condition or results of operations provided to
any third party to the extent such information has not been previously
provided to Kensington.

 

(d)Except as set forth in this Section 7.05(d), neither the Company Board nor
any committee thereof shall (i)(A) fail to make, change, withdraw, withhold,
amend, modify or qualify, or publicly propose to make, change, withdraw,
withhold, amend, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to Kensington, the
Company Board recommendation, or (B) adopt, approve, endorse or recommend, or
publicly propose to adopt, approve, endorse or recommend to the stockholders
of the Company any Company Acquisition Proposal or Company Superior Proposal,
(ii) make any public statement inconsistent with the Company Board
recommendation, (iii) resolve or agree to take any of the foregoing actions
(any of the foregoing, a "Company Adverse Recommendation Change"), or (iv)
authorize, cause or permit the Company or any of its Representatives to enter
into any Company Acquisition Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any
time prior to the receipt of the Written Consent, but not after, the Company
Board may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or cause the Company to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01(i) to enter into a Company
Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal only if
the Company Board has reasonably determined in good faith, after consultation
with its outside financial advisor and legal counsel, that (i) the failure to
take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the
Company Board's fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and (ii) that such
Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal;
provided, however, that prior to taking such action, (A) the Company promptly
notifies Kensington, in writing, at least three (3) Business Days (the
"Company Notice Period") before making a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
or entering into a Company Acquisition Agreement, of its intention to take
such action with respect to a Company Superior Proposal, which notice shall
(1) state expressly that the Company has received a Company Acquisition
Proposal that the Company Board intends to declare a Company Superior Proposal
and that the Company Board intends to make a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change and/or the Company intends to enter into a Company Acquisition
Agreement and (2) include a copy of the most current version of the proposed
agreement relating to such Company Superior Proposal (which version shall be
updated on a prompt basis), and a description of any financing commitments
relating thereto; (B) the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives
to, during the Company Notice Period, negotiate with Kensington in good faith
in respect of adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement such
that such Company Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a Company
Superior Proposal, if Kensington, in its discretion, proposes to make such
adjustments (it being agreed that in the event that, after commencement of the
Company Notice Period, there is any material revision to the terms of a
Company Superior Proposal, including, any revision in price, then the Company
will provide a new notice to Kensington that complies with the requirements of
this Section 7.05(d) and that the "Notice Period" in respect of such new
notice will be two (2) Business Days); and (C) following the end of such
Company Notice Period the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consulting with outside financial advisor and legal counsel, that such Company
Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Company Superior Proposal after
taking into account any adjustments made by Kensington during the Company
Notice Period in the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and provided,
further, that the Company shall have complied with its obligations under this
Section 7.05(d) and if the Company Board terminates this Agreement pursuant to
Section 9.01(i) to enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement, the Company
pays or causes to be paid to Kensington the Termination Fee due in accordance
with Section 9.03(a).

 

63  



 

(e)Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, at any time prior to obtaining the
Written Consent, the Company Board determines in good faith, in response to an
Intervening Event, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the
failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Company Board may, prior
to obtaining the Written Consent, make a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change; provided, however, that the Company will not be entitled to make, or
agree or resolve to make, a Company Adverse Recommendation Change unless (i)
the Company promptly notifies Kensington in writing, at least three (3)
Business Days (the "Intervening Event Notice Period") advising Kensington that
the Company Board proposes to take such action and containing the material
facts underlying the Company Board's determination that an Intervening Event
has occurred, and (ii) following the end of such Intervening Event Notice
Period (it being agreed that in the event after the commencement of the
Intervening Event Notice Period, there is any material development with
respect to an Intervening Event, the Intervening Event Notice Period shall be
extended, if applicable, to ensure that at least two (2) Business Days remains
in the Intervening Event Notice Period subsequent to the time the company
notifies Kensington of any such material revision (it being understood that
there may be multiple extensions)), the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consulting with outside financial advisors and legal counsel,
that the failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response
to such Intervening Event would be inconsistent with the Company Board's
fiduciary duties under applicable Law. If requested by Kensington, the Company
shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, during the Intervening Event
Notice Period, negotiate with Kensington in good faith to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so as to obviate the
need for a Company Adverse Recommendation Change. For the avoidance of doubt,
none of (A) the determination by the Company Board that an Intervening Event
may or has occurred or (B) the delivery by the Company to Kensington of any
notice contemplated by this Section 7.05 will, in and of itself, constitute a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change or violate this Section 7.05.

 

(f)The parties agree that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this
Section 7.05 by any of the Company's Representatives shall be deemed to be a
breach of this Section 7.05 by the Company.

 

SECTION 7.06. Kensington Exclusivity. From the date of this Agreement and
ending on the earlier of (a) the Closing and (b) the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Section 9.01, but only to the extent not
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Kensington Board, Kensington
shall not, and shall cause its Representatives not to, directly or indirectly,
(i) enter into, knowingly solicit, initiate or continue any discussions or
negotiations with, or knowingly encourage or respond to any inquiries or
proposals by, or participate in any negotiations with, or provide any
information to, or otherwise cooperate in any way with, any person or other
entity or "group" within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act,
concerning any sale of any material assets of such person or any of the
outstanding capital stock or any conversion, consolidation, liquidation,
dissolution or similar transaction involving such person other than with the
Company and its Representatives (an "Alternative Transaction"), (ii) enter
into any agreement regarding, continue or otherwise knowingly participate in
any discussions regarding, or furnish to any person any information with
respect to, or cooperate in any way that would otherwise reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Alternative Transaction or (iii) commence, continue
or renew any due diligence investigation regarding any Alternative
Transaction; provided, however, that the execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement and the

 

64  



 

Transaction Documents and the consummation of the Transactions shall not be
deemed a violation of this Section 7.06. Kensington shall, and shall cause its
affiliates and Representatives to, immediately cease any and all existing
discussions or negotiations with any person conducted heretofore with respect
to any Alternative Transaction. Kensington also agrees that it will promptly
request each person (other than the Company and its Representatives) that has
prior to the date of this Agreement executed a confidentiality agreement in
connection with its consideration of an Alternative Transaction to return or
destroy all Confidential Information furnished to such person by or on behalf
of it prior to the date of this Agreement (to the extent so permitted under,
and in accordance with the terms of, such confidentiality agreement). If
Kensington or any of its affiliates or its or their respective Representatives
receives any inquiry or proposal with respect to an Alternative Transaction at
any time prior to the Closing, then Kensington shall promptly (and in no event
later than one (1) Business Day after Kensington becomes aware of such inquiry
or proposal) notify such person in writing that Kensington is subject to an
exclusivity agreement with respect to the Transaction that prohibits
Kensington or any of its affiliates or its or their respective Representatives
from considering such inquiry or proposal. Without limiting the foregoing,
the parties agree that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this
Section 7.06 by Kensington or any of its affiliates or its or their respective
Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 7.06 by
Kensington.

 

SECTION 7.07. Employee Benefits Matters.

 

(a)The parties shall cooperate to establish an equity incentive award plan and
an employee stock purchase plan (the "Equity Plans" ) for the Surviving
Corporation to be effective at the Closing. Kensington shall have the Equity
Plans approved by Kensington stockholders at the Kensington Stockholders'
Meeting.

 

(b)Kensington shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its
subsidiaries, as applicable, to provide the employees of the Company who
remain employed immediately after the Effective Time (the "Continuing
Employees") credit for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and
determining the level of benefits, as applicable, under any employee benefit
plan, program or arrangement established or maintained by the Surviving
Corporation or any of its subsidiaries (including, without limitation, any
employee benefit plan as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA and any vacation or
other paid time-off program or policy) for service accrued or deemed accrued
prior to the Effective Time with the Company; provided, however, that such
crediting of service shall not operate to duplicate any benefit or the funding
of any such benefit. In addition, Kensington shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) cause to be waived any eligibility waiting periods,
any evidence of insurability requirements and the application of any pre-
existing condition limitations under each of the employee benefit plans
established or maintained by the Surviving Corporation or any of its
subsidiaries that cover the Continuing Employees or their dependents, and (ii)
cause any eligible expenses incurred by any Continuing Employee and his or her
covered dependents, during the portion of the plan year in which the Closing
occurs, under those health and welfare benefit plans in which such Continuing
Employee currently participates to be taken into account under those health
and welfare benefit plans in which such Continuing Employee participates
subsequent to the Closing Date for purposes of satisfying all deductible,
coinsurance, and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan
year. 

 

65  



 

Following the Closing, Surviving Corporation will honor all accrued but unused
vacation and other paid time off of the Continuing Employees that existed
immediately prior to the Closing.

 

(c)The provisions of this Section 7.07 are solely for the benefit of the

relating to the Transactions, including promptly notifying the other parties
of any communication it or any of its affiliates receives from any
Governmental Authority relating to the matters that are the subject of this
Agreement and permitting the other parties to review in advance, and to the
extent practicable consult about, any proposed communication by such party to
any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions. No party to
this Agreement shall agree to participate in any meeting with any Governmental
Authority in respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry unless it

such Governmental Authority, gives the other parties the opportunity to attend
and participate at such meeting. Subject to the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement, the parties will coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in
exchanging such information and providing such assistance as the other parties

of the Confidentiality Agreement, the parties will provide each other with

Kensington and the Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts to
consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making
any public statements with respect to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the
other Transactions, and shall not issue any such press release or make any
such public statement without the prior written consent of the other party.

other reasonable information concerning the Transactions to their investors
and prospective investors.

SECTION 7.12. Tax Matters. Each of Kensington, Merger Sub and the Company
shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Merger

affiliates or subsidiaries to, take any action which to its knowledge could
reasonably be expected to prevent or impede the Merger from qualifying, as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. This
Agreement is intended to constitute, and the parties hereto hereby adopt this

(a)To the extent required under any Laws that are designed to prohibit,
restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or

as reasonably practicable any additional information and documentary material
that may be requested pursuant to Antitrust Laws and to take all other actions
necessary, proper or advisable to cause the expiration or termination of the
applicable waiting periods or obtain required approvals, as applicable under
Antitrust Laws as soon as practicable, including by requesting early

and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including any
proceeding initiated by a private person; (ii) keep the other parties

their respective outside counsel to review any communication given by it to,

is prohibited from participating in or attending any meetings or conferences,

filings, correspondence or other written communications explaining or
defending the Transactions, articulating any regulatory or competitive
argument, and/or responding to requests or objections made by any Governmental
Authority.

 

(c)No party hereto shall take any action that could reasonably be expected to
adversely affect or materially delay the approval of any Governmental
Authority of any required filings or applications under Antitrust Laws. The
parties hereto further covenant and agree, with respect to a threatened or
pending preliminary or permanent injunction or other order, decree or ruling
or statute, rule, regulation or executive order that would adversely affect
the ability of the parties to consummate the Transactions, to use commercially
reasonable efforts to prevent or lift the entry, enactment or promulgation
thereof, as the case may be.

 

SECTION 7.15. PCAOB Audited Financials. The Company shall use reasonable

to terminate.

board of directors of the Surviving Corporation shall consist of (i) Jagdeep
Singh, as Chairman, (ii) one member to be selected by Kensington and (iii)
additional members to be selected by the Company. The parties will make their
respective selections as far in advance of the filing of the Registration
Statement as is reasonably practicable by providing written notice of such
selections to the other parties; provided, however, that, following any such
selection, in the event that any selected individual is unable to serve as a
director of Kensington at the Effective Time, then the Company, with respect
to the individuals identified in clause (i) and (iii) of the immediately
preceding sentence, and Kensington, with respect to the individuals identified
in clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence, shall have the right to

time by the Board. Any dividends paid to the holders of shares of Common Stock
shall be paid pro rata, on an equal priority, pari passu basis, unless
different treatment of the shares of any such class or series is approved by
the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the
outstanding shares of such applicable class or series of Common Stock treated
adversely, voting separately as a class.

 



 

3.2 The Corporation shall not declare or pay any dividend or make any other
distribution to the holders of Common Stock payable in securities of the
Corporation unless the same dividend or distribution with the same record date
and payment date shall be declared and paid on all shares of Common Stock,
unless different treatment of the shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B
Common Stock, as applicable, is approved by the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock and
Class B Common Stock, each voting separately as a class; provided, however,
that (i) dividends or other distributions payable in shares of Class A Common
Stock or rights to acquire shares of Class A Common Stock may be declared and
paid to the holders of Class A Common Stock without the same dividend or
distribution being declared and paid to the holders of the Class B Common
Stock if, and only if, a dividend payable in shares of Class B Common Stock,
or rights to acquire shares of Class B Common Stock, is declared and paid to
the holders of Class B Common Stock at the same rate and with the same record
date and payment date; and (ii) dividends or other distributions payable in
shares of Class B Common Stock or rights to acquire shares of Class B Common
Stock may be declared and paid to the holders of Class B Common Stock without
the same dividend or distribution being declared and paid to the holders of
the Class A Common Stock if, and only if, a dividend payable in shares of
Class A Common Stock, or rights to acquire shares of Class A Common Stock, is
declared and paid to the holders of Class A Common Stock at the same rate and
with the same record date and payment date; and provided, further, that
nothing in the foregoing shall prevent the Corporation from declaring and
paying dividends or other distributions payable in shares of one class of
Common Stock or rights to acquire one class of Common Stock to holders of all
classes of Common Stock.

 

3.3 If the Corporation in any manner subdivides or combines the outstanding
shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock, then the outstanding
shares of all Common Stock will be subdivided or combined in the same
proportion and manner, unless different treatment of the shares of Class A
Common Stock or Class B Common Stock, as applicable, is approved by the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, each voting separately as a
class.

 

4\. Voting Rights.

 

Exh. B-7

   

4.1 Common Stock.

 

(a) Class A Common Stock. Each holder of shares of Class A Common Stock will
be entitled to one vote for each share thereof held at the record date for the
determination of the stockholders entitled to vote on such matters.

 

(b) Class B Common Stock. Each holder of shares of Class B Common Stock will
be entitled to ten votes for each share thereof held at the record date for
the determination of the stockholders entitled to vote on such matters.

 



 

4.2 General. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or as required by
law, the holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock will vote
together as a single class and not as separate series or classes.

 

4.3 Authorized Shares. The number of authorized shares of Common Stock or any
class or series thereof may be increased or decreased (but not below (i) the
number of shares of Common Stock or, in the case of a class or series of
Common Stock, such class or series, then outstanding plus (ii) with respect to
Class A Common Stock, the number of shares reserved for issuance pursuant to
Article V, Section 9) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of
the voting power of the Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, voting
together as a single class, irrespective of the provisions of Section
242(b)(2) of the Delaware General Corporation Law; provided that the number of
authorized shares of Class B Common Stock shall not be increased or decreased
without the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares of Class B Common Stock, voting as a separate class.

 

4.4 Election of Directors. Subject to any rights of the holders of any series
of Preferred Stock to elect directors under circumstances specified in this
Amended and Restated Certificate (as modified by any Preferred Stock
Designation), (i) prior to the Final Conversion Date, the holders of Class A
Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, voting together as a single class,
shall be entitled to elect and remove all directors of the Corporation, and
(ii) from and after the Final Conversion Date, if any, the holders of Common
Stock, voting together as a single class, shall be entitled to elect and
remove all directors of the Company.

 

5\. Liquidation Rights. In the event of a Liquidation Event in connection with
which the Board has determined to effect a distribution of assets of the
Corporation to any holder or holders of Common Stock, then, subject to the
rights of any Preferred Stock that may then be outstanding, the assets of the
Corporation legally available for distribution to stockholders shall be
distributed on an equal priority, pro rata basis (based on the number of
shares of Common Stock held by each) to the holders of Common Stock, unless
different treatment of the shares of each such class or series of Common Stock
is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, each
voting separately as a class; provided, however, that for the avoidance of
doubt, payments to be made or received by a holder of Common Stock in
connection with any such Liquidation Event pursuant to any employment,
consulting, severance or similar services arrangement shall not be deemed to
be a distribution for the purpose of this Article V, Section 5; provided,
further, however, that shares of such classes may receive, or have the right
to elect to receive, different or disproportionate consideration in connection
with such Liquidation Event if the only difference in the per share
consideration to the holders of the Class A Common Stock and Class B Common
Stock is that any securities distributed to the holder of a share of Class B
Common Stock have ten (10) times the voting power of any securities
distributed to the holder of a share of Class A Common Stock.

 



 

6\. Conversion of the Class B Common Stock. The Class B Common Stock will be
convertible into Class A Common Stock as follows:

 

6.1 Each share of Class B Common Stock will automatically convert into one
fully paid and nonassessable share of Class A Common Stock on the Final
Conversion Date.

 

6.2 With respect to any holder of Class B Common Stock, each share of Class B
Common Stock held by such holder will automatically be converted into one
fully paid and nonassessable share of Class A Common Stock, as follows:

 

(a) at the option of the holder thereof at any time upon written notice to the
transfer agent of the Corporation or, if such written notice specifies a later
time, or the happening of a future event for such conversion, upon such time
or the happening of such event;

 

Exh. B-8

   

(b) on the occurrence of a Transfer of such share of Class B Common Stock,
other than a Permitted Transfer;

 

(c) upon the death of such Class B Stockholder, or solely with respect to each
share of Class B Common Stock held of record by an Excluded Party, or by an
Excluded Party's Permitted Entities, upon the death or Disability of such
Excluded Party; provided, however, that, with respect to the shares of Class B
Common Stock held of record by such Excluded Party or such Excluded Party's
Permitted Entities, each share of Class B Common Stock held of record by an
Excluded Party or an Excluded Party's Permitted Entities shall automatically
convert into one (1) fully paid and nonassessable share of Class A Common
Stock upon that date which is the earlier of: (i) nine (9) months after the
date of death or Disability of such Excluded Party, and (ii) the date upon
which such Excluded Party Trustee ceases to hold exclusive Voting Control over
such shares of Class B Common Stock;

 

6.3 Each outstanding share of Class B Common Stock shall automatically be
converted into one fully-paid, nonassessable share of Class A Common Stock as
follows:

 

(a) upon the affirmative vote or written consent of the holders of a majority
of the Class B Common Stock then outstanding, voting as a single class or, if
later, the effective date for such conversion specified by such vote or
written consent; or

 

(b) upon the affirmative vote or written consent of the holders of a majority
of the Class B Common Stock then outstanding and held by the Excluded Parties
and Permitted Entities of the Excluded Parties, or, if later, the effective
date for such conversion specified by such vote or written consent.

 

7\. Procedures. The Corporation may, from time to time, establish such
policies and procedures relating to the conversion of the Class B Common Stock
into Class A Common Stock and the general administration of this dual-class
stock structure, including the issuance of stock certificates with respect
thereto, as it may deem necessary or advisable, and may from time to time
request that holders of shares of Class B Common Stock furnish certifications,
affidavits or other proof to the Corporation as it deems necessary to verify
the ownership of Class B Common Stock and to confirm that a conversion to
Class A Common Stock has not occurred. A determination by the Corporation as
to whether or not a Transfer has occurred and results in a conversion to Class
A Common Stock, or as to whether or not another conversion contemplated in the
foregoing Section 6 of this Article V has occurred, shall be conclusive and
binding.

 

8\. Effect of Conversion. In the event of a conversion of shares of Class B
Common Stock into shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to Article V,
Section 6, such conversion shall be deemed to have been made at the time that
the Corporation's transfer agent receives the written notice required pursuant
to Article V, Section 6.2(a) (or a later date specified by such notice), the
time of the affirmative vote or written consent of the applicable holders of
Class B Common Stock pursuant to Article V, Sections 6.3(a) or 6.3(b) (or a
later date specified by such vote or written consent), the time that the
Transfer of such shares occurred or the death or Disability of the Class B
Stockholder or as otherwise provided in Article V, Section 6.2(c), as
applicable. Upon any conversion of Class B Common Stock to Class A Common
Stock, all rights of the holder of such shares of Class B Common Stock shall
cease and the person or persons in whose name or names the certificate or
certificates representing the shares of Class B Common Stock are to be issued,
if any, shall be treated for all purposes as having become the record holder
or holders of such number of shares of Class A Common Stock into which such
Class B Common Stock were convertible. Shares of Class B Common Stock that
are converted into shares of Class A Common Stock as provided in Article V,
Section 6 shall be retired and shall not be reissued.

 

9\. Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Corporation will at all
times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of
Class A Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of
the shares of the Class B Common Stock such number of its shares of Class A
Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion
of all outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock; and if at any time the
number of authorized but unissued shares of Class A Common Stock will not be
sufficient to effect the conversion of all then-outstanding shares of Class B
Common Stock, the Corporation will take such corporate action as may, in the
opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued
shares of Class A Common Stock into such number of shares as will be
sufficient for such purpose.

 

Exh. B-9

   

10\. Preemptive Rights. No stockholder of the Corporation shall have a right
to purchase shares of capital stock of the Corporation sold or issued by the
Corporation except to the extent that such a right may from time to time be
set forth in a written agreement between the Corporation and a stockholder.

 

ARTICLE VI

 

1\. Rights of Preferred Stock. The Board is authorized, subject to any
limitations prescribed by law or in any Preferred Stock Designation, to
provide for the issuance of shares of Preferred Stock in series, and by filing
a certificate pursuant to the applicable law of the State of Delaware (such
certificate being hereinafter referred to as a "Preferred Stock Designation"),
to establish from time to time the number of shares to be included in each
such series, and to fix the designation, powers, preferences, and rights of
the shares of each such series and any qualifications, limitations or
restrictions thereof.

 



 

2\. Vote to Increase or Decrease Authorized Shares. The number of authorized
shares of Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the
number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the voting power of all of the outstanding shares of
stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon, without a vote of the
holders of the Preferred Stock, or of any series thereof, unless a vote of any
such holders is required pursuant to the terms of any Preferred Stock
Designation, irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the
Delaware General Corporation Law.

 

ARTICLE VII

 

1\. Number of Directors; Election; Term.

 

(a) Subject to the rights of holders of any series of Preferred Stock with
respect to the election of directors, the number of directors that constitutes
the entire Board of the Corporation shall be fixed solely by resolution of the
Board.

 

(b) Each director shall be elected to hold office for a one-year term expiring
at the next annual meeting of stockholders.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article VII, Section 1,
and subject to the rights of holders of any series of Preferred Stock with
respect to the election of directors, each director shall serve until his or
her successor is duly elected and qualified or until his or her earlier death,
resignation, or removal.

 

(d) If the number of directors is increased at or following the 2021 annual
meeting of stockholders, any additional director elected to fill a newly
created directorship shall hold office for a term expiring at the next annual
meeting of stockholders. In no case shall a decrease in the number of
directors remove or shorten the term of any incumbent director.

 

(e) Elections of directors need not be by written ballot unless the Bylaws of
the Corporation shall so provide.

 



 

2\. Vacancies and Newly Created Directorships. Subject to the rights of
holders of any series of Preferred Stock with respect to the election of
directors, and except as may be permitted in the specific case by resolution
of a majority of the Whole Board, vacancies occurring on the Board for any
reason and newly created directorships resulting from an increase in the
authorized number of directors may be filled only by vote of a majority of the
remaining members of the Board, although less than a quorum, or by a sole
remaining director, and not by stockholders. A person so elected by the Board
to fill a vacancy or newly created directorship shall hold office until the
next election of the class for which such director shall have been assigned by
the Board and until his or her successor shall be duly elected and qualified.

 

ARTICLE VIII

 

Exh. B-10

   

The following provisions are inserted for the management of the business and
the conduct of the affairs of the Corporation, and for further definition,
limitation and regulation of the powers of the Corporation and of its
directors and stockholders:

 

1\. Board Power. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed
by or under the direction of the Board. In addition to the powers and
authority expressly conferred by statute or by this Amended and Restated
Certificate or the Bylaws of the Corporation, the Board is hereby empowered to
exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised
or done by the Corporation.

 

2\. Written Ballot. Elections of directors need not be by written ballot
unless otherwise provided in the Bylaws of the Corporation.

 

3\. Amendment of Bylaws. In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers
conferred by the Delaware General Corporation Law, the Board is expressly
authorized to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation. The
Bylaws of the Corporation may also be adopted, amended or repealed by the
stockholders entitled to vote; provided, however, that the affirmative vote of
holders of at least two-thirds of the total voting power of the outstanding
voting securities of the Corporation, voting together as a single class, shall
be required for the stockholders to alter, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the
Corporation.

 

4\. Special Meetings. Special meetings of the stockholders may be called only
by (i) the Board pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the Whole
Board; (ii) the chair of the Board; [or] (iii) the chief executive officer of
the Corporation; or (iv) prior to the Final Conversion Date, the holders of at
least [ ] percent ([ ]%) of the voting power of the Class A Common Stock
and Class B Common Stock, voting together as a single class and acting in
compliance with the Bylaws of the Corporation. A special meeting of
stockholders may not be called by any other person or persons, and except as
set forth above, any power of stockholders to call a special meeting of
stockholders is specifically denied. The Board pursuant to a resolution
adopted by a majority of the Whole Board, or the chair of a meeting of
stockholders, may cancel, postpone or reschedule any previously scheduled
meeting of stockholders called pursuant to clauses (i) through (iii) at any
time, before or after the notice for such meeting has been sent to
stockholders.

 

5\. Stockholder Action by Written Consent. Except for the rights of the
holders of any series of Preferred Stock, from and after the Final Conversion
Date, any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the
Corporation must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of
stockholders of the Corporation and may not be effected by any consent in
writing by such stockholders. Subject to the rights of the holders of any
series of Preferred Stock, before the Final Conversion Date, any action
required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation may
be taken without a meeting only if the action is first recommended or approved
by a majority of the Whole Board.

 



 

6\. No Cumulative Voting. No stockholder will be permitted to cumulate votes
at any election of directors.

 

7\. Advance Notice. Advance notice of stockholder nominations for the election
of directors and of business to be brought by stockholders before any meeting
of the stockholders of the Corporation shall be given in the manner provided
in the Bylaws of the Corporation.

 

ARTICLE IX

 

To the fullest extent permitted by law, no director of the Corporation shall
be personally liable for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a
director. Without limiting the effect of the preceding sentence, if the
Delaware General Corporation Law is hereafter amended to authorize the further
elimination or limitation of the liability of a director, then the liability
of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest
extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as so amended.

 

Neither any amendment, repeal nor elimination of this Article IX, nor the
adoption of any provision of this Amended and Restated Certificate
inconsistent with this Article IX, shall eliminate, reduce or otherwise
adversely

 

Exh. B-11

   

affect any limitation on the personal liability of a director of the
Corporation existing at the time of such amendment, repeal, elimination or
adoption of such an inconsistent provision.

 

ARTICLE X

 

If any provision of this Amended and Restated Certificate becomes or is
declared on any ground by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal,
unenforceable or void, portions of such provision, or such provision in its
entirety, to the extent necessary, shall be severed from this Amended and
Restated Certificate, and the court will replace such illegal, void or
unenforceable provision of this Amended and Restated Certificate with a valid
and enforceable provision that most accurately reflects the Corporation's
intent, in order to achieve, to the maximum extent possible, the same
economic, business and other purposes of the illegal, void or unenforceable
provision. The balance of this Amended and Restated Certificate shall be
enforceable in accordance with its terms.

 

Except as provided in Article IX above, the Corporation reserves the right to
amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Amended and
Restated Certificate, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute,
and all rights conferred upon stockholders herein are granted subject to this
reservation; provided, however, that, notwithstanding any other provision of
this Amended and Restated Certificate or any provision of law that might
otherwise permit a lesser vote, but in addition to any vote of the holders of
any class or series of the stock of this Corporation required by law or by
this Amended and Restated Certificate, from and after the Final Conversion
Date, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the voting
power of the outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote
generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class,
shall be required to amend or repeal, or adopt any provision of this Amended
and Restated Certificate inconsistent with, Article V, Article VI, Article
VII, Article VIII or this Article X.
