Requirements and no portion of the Public Filings (including, without
limitation, any financial statements or schedules therein) contained any

connection with this Transaction, nor will any of the Target Shares be subject
to any liabilities. Equity One is not an investment company within the
meaning of Section 368(a)(2)(F)(iii) or (iv) of the Code. Equity One has no
present plan or intention to (i) reacquire any of the Purchase Price Shares or

Equity One Material Contract.

4.21 _Insurance_. The Equity One Companies and the Equity One Real Property
are insured against loss or damage and such other risks and in such amounts
as are reasonable for prudent owners of comparable assets or businesses, and

of the provisions contained in such insurance policies.

Employee Benefit Plan sponsored or maintained by Equity One or any ERISA

participate. Each Employee Benefit Plan complies in all material respects with
all requirements of ERISA and the Code and with all other applicable law and

all material respects. Each Employee Benefit Plan intended to qualify under
Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from
the Internal Revenue Service as to its qualification under such Section 401(a)
and to the Knowledge of Equity One and its ERISA Affiliates nothing has
occurred which could result in loss of such qualification. Neither Equity One
nor any ERISA Affiliate of Equity One (i) maintains, sponsors or contributes
to, or has maintained, sponsored or contributed in the past six years to, any
"defined benefit plan" (within the meaning of Section 3(35) of ERISA) or any
Multiemployer Plan, or (ii) maintains or contributes, or has ever been
required to maintain or contribute any Employee Welfare Benefit
Plan providing medical, health, life insurance or other welfare-type benefits
to former, retired or terminated employees, their spouses or dependents except

ERISA. Other than claims in the ordinary course for benefits, there are no
actions, suits or claims pending with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan,

circumstances which might give rise to any such action, suit or claim.

purposes of delivering the opinions contemplated by Sections 7.1(o) and
7.2(m).  
  

5.3 _Shareholder Meetings_. Equity One agrees to hold a meeting of its
shareholders to consider and approve the issuance of the Purchase Price

communications relating to this Transaction prior to the mailing thereof, on a
confidential basis, and to provide the other party with a reasonable
opportunity to review and provide comments thereon on a confidential basis.
The proxy statement and form of proxy delivered by each of Equity One and
Centrefund to their respective stockholders shall include the recommendation
by the Equity One special committee of the issuance of the Purchase Price

Equity One Companies to use commercially reasonable efforts to, keep their
businesses, properties, business organizations and goodwill substantially
intact, including their present operations, physical facilities, working
conditions, and relationships with lessors, tenants, licensors, suppliers,
developers, customers, and employees, except to the extent that failing to do
so would not reasonably be expected to result in any Material Adverse Effect
on Equity One. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, except as
specifically contemplated in this Agreement, or otherwise approved in advance
by Centrefund, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld, Equity One
will not, and will not cause or permit any other Equity One Company to, engage

Adverse Effect on the Target. Without the limiting the generality of the
foregoing, except in connection with the Target Restructuring or as otherwise
specifically contemplated in this Agreement or as approved in advance by
Equity One, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld, Centrefund and
the Shareholder will not cause or permit any Target Company to engage in any
practice, take any action, or enter into any transaction to:

being taken with respect to the CDG Windup. Centrefund and Shareholder agree
not to take any actions, or cause the Target Companies to take any actions,
relating to the sale of CGDI, CDGII or Cashmere Developments Inc. or any of
their properties, without the prior written consent of Equity One, which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided, however, that
actions pursuant to and permitted by the Memorandum of Agreement between
Centrefund and North American Development Corporation, dated September 15,
1997, as amended on September 9, 1999, may be taken without the prior written
consent of Equity One.  
  

5.8 _Full Access_. Centrefund and the Shareholder will permit, and will cause
the Target to permit, representatives of Equity One to have full access at
all reasonable times, and in a manner so as not to interfere with the normal
business operations of the Target, to all premises, properties, personnel,
books, records (including Tax records), contracts, and documents of or
pertaining to the Target. Equity One will permit representatives of Centrefund
and the Shareholder to have full access at all reasonable times, and in a
manner so as not to interfere with the normal business operations of Equity
One, to all premises, properties, personnel, books, records (including Tax
records), contracts, and documents pertaining to Equity One.  
  

5.9 _Notice of Developments_. Each Party will give prompt written notice to
the other parties of any breach of any of its own representations, warranties
or covenants under this Agreement. No disclosure by any Party pursuant to this
Section 5.9, however, shall be deemed to amend or supplement the Exhibits or
any Disclosure Schedule or to prevent or cure any misrepresentation, breach
of warranty, or breach of covenant.  
  

5.10 _Exclusivity_. Each of the Shareholder, the Target and Equity One agrees
that it will not (i) solicit, initiate, or encourage the submission of any

any Target Company or Equity One Company (including any acquisition
structured as a merger, consolidation, or share exchange), or (ii) participate
in any discussions or negotiations regarding, furnish any information with
respect to, assist or participate in, or facilitate in any other manner any
effort or attempt by any Person to do or seek any of the foregoing; provided

capital stock or assets of other public companies provided that Equity One
shall not enter into any such transaction without the prior written consent
of Centrefund, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Each Party
will notify the other party immediately if any Person makes any proposal,
offer, inquiry, or contact with respect to any of the foregoing.

5.12 _Undistributed REIT Earnings and Profits_. Thirty days before the
anticipated Closing Date, Centrefund and Shareholder shall deliver to Equity
One a report of its independent public accountants setting forth the
computation of the relevant earnings and profits of the Target Companies. The
Parties shall then agree upon an estimate of the amount of distributions that
Target and the other Target Companies would be required to make on or prior
to the Closing Date such that none of the Target Companies would have any
earnings and profits for U.S. federal income tax purposes as of the Closing
Date (the " _E andP Estimate_"). Prior to the Closing Date, Centrefund and the
Shareholder will cause (i) each of the Target Companies, other than the
Target, that has earnings and profits to distribute an amount such that it
will not have any earnings and profits (including earnings and profits, if
any, that arise as a result of any distributions received pursuant to this
sentence) for U.S. federal income tax purposes as of the Closing Date and (ii)
Target to distribute to Shareholder an amount that is no less than the amount
of the EandP Estimate. All distributions pursuant to Article 9 hereof, to the
extent they result in net reductions of earnings and profits, shall be treated
as distributions made pursuant to this Section 5.12.   
  

5.13 _Press Release_. The Parties also agree to jointly issue a press release
immediately after the execution of this Agreement, in a mutually agreeable
form, announcing the Transaction and the entering into of this Agreement.
Without limiting the foregoing, the Parties agree to consult with each other
in issuing any press releases or making any other public communications or
statements in respect of this Agreement or the Transaction.  
  

6. _Post-Closing Covenants_   
  

The Parties agree as follows with respect to the period following the
Closing.  
  

6.1 _NYSE Listing_. Equity One will use its commercially reasonable efforts to
maintain the listing of the outstanding Common Stock on the NYSE.  
  

6.2 _General_. In case at any time after the Closing any further action is
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or any
Party requires any information in connection with preparing its financial
statements, satisfying its obligations under the applicable Governmental
Requirements (including applicable securities laws), or filing a prospectus or
other offering document with any regulatory authority in connection with an
offering of securities, each of the Parties will provide such information
(including financial statements) and take such further action (including the
execution and delivery of such further instruments and documents) as any other
Party may reasonably request, all at the sole cost and expense of the
requesting Party (subject to Section 11 and unless the requesting Party is
entitled to indemnification therefor under Section 8 below). Centrefund and
the Shareholder acknowledge and agree that from and after the Closing, Equity
One will be entitled to possession of all documents, books, records (including
Tax records), agreements, and financial data of any sort relating to the
Target, and Equity One will provide Centrefund and Shareholder with such
access as Centrefund or the Shareholder may reasonably require from time to
time to such documents, books and records for tax or corporate compliance
purposes or for the purposes of complying with their obligations
hereunder (including their obligations under Section 6.7).  
  

6.3 _Litigation Support_. In the event and for so long as any Party actively
is contesting or defending against any action, suit, proceeding, hearing,
investigation, charge, complaint, claim, or demand in connection with (i) the
Transaction or (ii) any fact, situation, circumstance, status, condition,
activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to
act, or transaction on or prior to the Closing Date involving the Target, each
of the other Parties will cooperate with it and its counsel in the contest or
defense, make available their personnel, and provide such testimony and
access to their books and records as shall be necessary or desirable in
connection with the contest or defense, all at the sole cost and expense of
the contesting or defending Party (unless the contesting or defending Party is
entitled to indemnification therefor under Section 8 below).  
  

6.4 _Transition_. Neither Centrefund nor the Shareholder will take any action
that is designed, intended or likely to have the effect of discouraging any
lessor, tenant, licensor, customer, developer, supplier, or other business
associate of the Target or any of its Subsidiaries from maintaining the same
business relationships with the Target and its Subsidiaries after the Closing
as it maintained with them prior to the Closing. Centrefund and the
Shareholder will promptly refer all customer inquiries relating to the
businesses of the Target Companies to Equity One from and after the Closing.  
  

6.5 _Confidentiality_. Subject to compliance with applicable law, the Parties
and their agents will treat and hold as such all of the Confidential
Information provided or made available by the other Parties, refrain from
using any such Confidential Information except in connection with this
Agreement, and if the Transaction is terminated, deliver promptly to
the other, or destroy, at the request and option of the other Party, all
tangible embodiments (and all copies) of such Confidential Information which
are in their possession or to which any of them has access. In the event that
any Party is requested or required (by oral question or request for
information or documents in any legal proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena,
civil investigative demand, or similar process) to disclose any Confidential
Information, such Party will notify the other Party promptly of the request
or requirement so that such other Party may seek an appropriate protective
order or waive compliance with the provisions of this Section 6.5. If, in the
absence of a protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, either
Party is, on the advice of counsel, compelled to disclose any Confidential
Information to any tribunal or else stand liable for contempt, such Party may
disclose the Confidential Information to the tribunal; provided, however, that
such Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, at the
reasonable request of the other Party, an order or other assurance that
confidential treatment will be accorded to such portion of the Confidential
Information required to be disclosed as the Party shall designate. The
foregoing provisions shall not apply to any Confidential Information which is
generally available to the public immediately prior to the time of
disclosure.  
  

6.6 _Independent Accountants_. After the Closing, each Party shall, at the
request of any other Party (i) authorize the Target\'s past and present
independent auditors and accounting personnel to make available to such other
Party and its representatives, all financial information, including to permit
such other Party\'s representatives to examine all working papers pertaining
to audits or reviews previously or hereafter made by such auditors, and (ii)
provide such reasonable cooperation as such other Party and its
representatives may request in connection with any audit or review of any of
the Target Companies that it may direct its representatives to make. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Shareholder agrees that it will
cooperate with, and direct the Target\'s past and present independent
auditors, accounting personnel and other necessary persons to cooperate with
Equity One in the preparation of any documents filed by Equity One with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, to the extent information about the
Target is required therein.  
  

6.7 _Tax Matters_. Centrefund and the Shareholder covenant and agree not to
take any action, or fail to take any action, if that action or inaction would
have an adverse effect on Equity One on or after the Closing Date with respect
to Corporate Taxes, including, without limitation, (i) amending or otherwise
supplementing any Tax Return or report of any of the Target Companies with
respect to any period prior to the Closing Date without the consent of Equity
One or (ii) causing the Transaction to fail to constitute a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code (including, but not limited
to, causing the Target to distribute assets (whether or not otherwise
permitted pursuant to this Agreement) so that as of the Closing Date the
Target holds less than "substantially all" of its assets, as that term has
been defined by the U.S. Treasury Department). Equity One will make the
election described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.337(d)-5T(b)(3) with
respect to the assets owned by the Target Companies in a timely manner prior
to the Closing.  
  

6.8 _REIT Status_. Equity One covenants and agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts to operate in a manner that will not cause it to be
classified other than as a REIT.   
  

6.9 _Canadian GAAP Financial Statements_. Equity One agrees that for so long
as the Shareholder and/or Centrefund directly or indirectly own at least 20%
of the Common Stock, it will, at the sole cost and expense of Centrefund,
provide to Centrefund (i) consolidated quarterly unaudited financial
statements of Equity One prepared in accordance with Canadian GAAP (subject to
normal year-end adjustments), and (ii) consolidated annual unaudited
financial statements of Equity One prepared in accordance with Canadian GAAP
together with the notes thereto.  
  

6.10 _Equity One Dividends_. Subject to the sole and absolute discretion of
its board of directors to declare and pay dividends as they may deem lawful
and appropriate, Equity One agrees that its present intention is to use
commercially reasonable efforts to continue to pay dividends in respect of its
Common Stock at levels at least equal to those paid in the past.  
  

6.11 _Equity One Dispositions of Assets and Disposition Proceeds_. Equity One
agrees that, for a period of one year after the Closing Date, it will not
dispose of more than two thirds of the assets that the Target Companies own
on the Closing Date and the proceeds of those dispositions, in dispositions
that would not constitute the continuance of the Target\'s historic business
or the use of the Target\'s business assets in a business, in each case
within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(d).  
  

6.12 _Tax Refund_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that to the extent there
is any refund of Taxes paid by any Target Company, such refund shall be paid
to and inure to the benefit of the applicable Target Company, regardless of
the time such refund is made.  
  

6.13 _Tax Treatment_. Equity One covenants and agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts after the Closing not to take any action, or fail to take
any action, if that action or inaction would cause the Transaction to fail to
constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code.

would (A) prevent consummation of the Transaction or impose material
limitations or conditions on the Transaction or the right of the Shareholder

8. _Survival; Remedies for Breaches of this Agreement _.  
  

8.1 _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. All of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements of the Parties contained in this
Agreement or in any certificate, document, instrument or agreement delivered

8.2 _Indemnification Provisions for Benefit of Equity One_.   
  

(a) In the event that either Centrefund or the Shareholder breaches (or in the
event any third party alleges facts that, if true, would mean Centrefund or

any of such representatives or warranties is untrue or inaccurate), covenants
and agreements contained herein or in any certificate, document, instrument or
agreement delivered pursuant to this Agreement and, provided that the
Indemnified Equity One Parties (as hereafter defined) make a written claim

Section 8.4 below within the applicable claim period provided in Section 8.1
above, then Centrefund or the Shareholder shall jointly and severally
indemnify Equity One and each of its officers, directors, employees,
representatives and Affiliates (the " _Indemnified Equity One Parties_ ") from
and against the entirety of any Adverse Consequences the Indemnified Equity
One Parties may suffer (including any Adverse Consequences the Indemnified
Equity One Parties may suffer after the end of any applicable claim period)

the breach (or the alleged breach).  
  

(b) Centrefund and the Shareholder shall jointly and severally indemnify the
Indemnified Equity One Parties from and against the entirety of any Adverse
Consequences the Indemnified Equity One Parties may suffer resulting

Liability of the Target (a) for any Corporate Taxes of the Target Companies
with respect to any tax year or portion thereof ending on or before the
Closing Date or for any tax year beginning before and ending after the
Closing Date to the extent allocable (determined in a manner consistent with
Section 10.2) to the portion of such period beginning before and ending on the
Closing Date and to the extent such Taxes are not reflected in the reserve
for Tax Liability (excluding any reserve for deferred Taxes established to
reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) shown on the face of
the most recent Financial Statements, (b) for the unpaid Taxes of any Person
(other than the Target) under Reg. Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision
of state, local, or foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by contract,
or otherwise, or (c) for any Taxes payable by any of the Target Companies by
reason of the Transaction failing to qualify as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code by reason of any action of
Shareholder.  
  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article 8, the
Indemnified Equity One Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification for
any Adverse Consequences for any breaches of the representations
and warranties of Centrefund and Shareholder made in Section 3.11 (Real
Property), 3.14 (Events Subsequent to Most Recent Fiscal Year End), 3.15
(Undisclosed Liabilities) and 3.16 (Compliance with Laws)(but only with
respect to the first sentence thereof), 3.18 (Personal Property), 3.19
(Contracts), 3.21 (Power of Attorney), 3.22 (Insurance), 3.23 (Litigation),

Co. pursuant to the Property Management Agreement or the Asset Management
Agreement, and (iii) were not actually known by the present directors or
officers of Centrefund or the Shareholder.  
  

8.3 _Indemnification Provisions for Benefit of Centrefund and the
Shareholder_. In the event Equity One breaches (or in the event any third
party alleges facts that, if true, would mean Equity One had breached) any of
its representations, warranties (or any of such representations or warranties
is untrue or inaccurate), covenants and agreements contained herein or in any
certificate, document, instrument or agreement delivered pursuant to this
Agreement, and, provided that the Shareholder or Centrefund makes a written
claim for indemnification against Equity One pursuant to Section 8.4 below
within the applicable claim period provided in Section 8.1 above, then Equity
One agrees to indemnify Centrefund, the Shareholder and each of their
officers, directors, employees, representatives and Affiliates (the "
_Indemnified Centrefund Parties_ ") from and against the entirety of any
Adverse Consequences the Indemnified Centrefund Parties may suffer (including
any Adverse Consequences the Indemnified Centrefund Parties may suffer after
the end of any applicable claim period) resulting from, arising out of,
relating to, in the nature of, or caused by the breach (or the alleged
breach).  
  

8.4 _Matters Involving Third Parties_.   
  

(a) If any third party shall notify any party entitled to indemnification
hereunder (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") with respect to any matter (a " _Third
Party Claim_ ") which may give rise to a claim for indemnification against
any other Party (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") under this Section 8, then the
Indemnified Party shall promptly notify each Indemnifying Party thereof in
writing; provided, however, that no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party
in notifying any Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from
any obligation hereunder unless (and then solely to the extent) the
Indemnifying Party thereby is materially prejudiced.  
  

(b) Any Indemnifying Party will have the right to defend the Indemnified Party
against the Third Party Claim with counsel of its choice reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party so long as (A) the Indemnifying Party
notifies the Indemnified Party in writing within 15 days after the
Indemnified Party has given notice of the Third Party Claim that the
Indemnifying Party will indemnify the Indemnified Party from and against the
entirety of any Adverse Consequences the Indemnified Party may suffer
resulting from, arising out of, relating to, in the nature of, or caused by
the Third Party Claim, (B) the Indemnifying Party provides the Indemnified
Party with evidence reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party that
the Indemnifying Party will have the financial resources to defend against
the Third Party Claim and fulfill its indemnification obligations hereunder,
(C) the Third Party Claim involves only money damages and does not seek an
injunction or other equitable relief, (D) settlement of, or an adverse
judgment with respect to, the Third Party Claim is not, in the good faith
judgment of the Indemnified Party, likely to establish a precedential custom
or practice materially adverse to the continuing business interests of the
Indemnified Party, (E) the named parties to the Third Party Claim do not
include both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, and (F) the
Indemnifying Party conducts the defense of the Third Party Claim actively and
diligently.  
  

(c) So long as the Indemnifying Party is conducting the defense of the Third
Party Claim in accordance with Section 8.4(b) above, (A) the Indemnified Party
may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and participate
in the defense of the Third Party Claim, (B) the Indemnified Party will not
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect
to the Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party (not to be withheld unreasonably), and (C) the
Indemnifying Party will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into
any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party (not to be withheld unreasonably).  
  

(d) In the event any of the conditions in Section 8.4(b) above is or becomes
unsatisfied, however, (A) the Indemnified Party may defend against, and
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with
respect to, the Third Party Claim in any manner it reasonably may deem
appropriate (and the Indemnified Party need not consult with, or obtain any
consent from, any Indemnifying Party in connection therewith), (B) the
Indemnifying Parties will reimburse the Indemnified Party promptly and
periodically for the costs of defending against the Third Party Claim
(including reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses), and (C) the Indemnifying
Parties will remain responsible for any Adverse Consequences the Indemnified
Party may suffer resulting from, arising out of, relating to, in the nature
of, or caused by the Third Party Claim to the fullest extent provided in this
Section 8.4.  
  

8.5 _Other Indemnification Provisions_. The foregoing indemnification
provisions are in addition to, and not in derogation of, any statutory,
equitable, or common law remedy (including without limitation any such remedy
arising under Environmental, Health, and Safety Requirements) any Party may
have with respect to the Target or the Transaction.   
  

9. _Target Distributions_. Centrefund and the Shareholder covenant and agree that from January 1, 2001 through and including the Closing Date, Centrefund and the Shareholder shall have been entitled to receive from the Target Companies:  
  

(i) distributions payable in cash, shares, stock or property from the Target
Companies (including by repayment of Intercompany Debt or return of capital)
equal to such amounts advanced or contributed to the Target Companies,
whether by way of equity or debt, from January 1, 2001 through the Closing
Date; _plus_   
  

(ii) the Target Distribution Amount, whether paid under Centrefund Management
Arrangements, dividends, distributions (including those made pursuant to
Section 5.12) payable in cash, shares, stock or property, return of capital
or repayment of Intercompany Debt; provided, however, that if the aggregate
dividends declared or paid by Equity One from the date hereof through the
Closing Date exceed $.26 per share of Common Stock, the Target Distribution
Amount will be increased by an amount equal to (a) the per share amount by
which the total dividends paid or declared during such period exceeded $.26
per share of Common Stock, multiplied by (b) 10,500,000; _minus_   
  

(iii) all fees, costs and expenses (including legal and accounting fees, costs
and expenses) paid or incurred by Target in connection with or related to the
Target Restructuring (except for any costs and expenses incurred
in connection with the distributions made pursuant to Section 5.12) and all
costs and expenses paid or incurred by Target between January 1, 2001 and the
Closing Date which are properly attributable to Centrefund or Shareholder.  
  

To the extent that payments or distributions in any form to Centrefund or the
Shareholder from January 1, 2001 to and including the Closing Date have
exceeded or are expected to exceed the sum of the items set forth above (the "
_ Estimated Excess Distribution_ ") then, at the Closing, the number of
Purchase Price Shares shall be reduced by a corresponding number of shares,
valued at its Fair Market Value (as hereafter defined). No later than forty
five (45) days after the Closing Date, the Parties shall prepare a cash flow
reconciliation statement setting forth the amount, if any, by which payments
or distributions in any form from January 1, 2001 to and including the Closing
Date exceeded the sum of the items set forth above (the " _Actual Excess
Distribution_ "). If the Actual Excess Distribution is greater than the
Estimated Excess Distribution, Centrefund and the Shareholder jointly and
severally agree to promptly pay to Target in cash an amount equal to the
amount by which the Actual Excess Distribution exceeds the Estimated Excess
Distribution. "Fair Market Value" as used herein shall mean average of the
high and low quoted sale prices of a share of Common Stock on the New York
Stock Exchange during the 20 trading days preceeding the date on which the E
and P Estimate is made.  
  

10. _Tax Matters_.   
  

The following provisions shall govern the allocation of responsibility as
between Equity One and Shareholder for certain tax matters following the
Closing Date:  
  

10.1 _Tax Periods Ending on or Before the Closing Date_. The Shareholder shall
prepare or cause to be prepared and timely file or cause to be timely filed
all Tax Returns for the Target Companies which are filed after the Closing
Date and relate to periods ending on or prior to the Closing (the " _Pre-
Closing Period_ "). Such Tax Returns shall be prepared by treating items on
such Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the past practices with respect
to such items, unless otherwise required by law. The Shareholder shall permit
Equity One to review and comment on each such Tax Return for all periods
ending on or prior to the Closing Date prior to filing.   
  

10.2 _Tax Periods Beginning Before and Ending After the Closing Date_. Equity
One shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed any
Tax Returns of the Target for Tax periods which begin before the Closing Date
and end after the Closing Date. The portion of any such Tax that relates to
the portion of a taxable period ending on the Closing Date shall (x) in the
case of any Taxes other than Taxes based on or related to income or receipts
be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the
taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
number of days in the entire taxable period, and (y) in the case of any Tax
based on or related to income or receipts be deemed equal to the amount that
would be payable if the relevant taxable period ended on the Closing Date.
Any credits shall be taken into account as though the relevant taxable period
ended on the Closing Date. All determinations necessary to give effect to the
foregoing allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with prior
practice of the Target and its Subsidiaries. Equity One shall permit
Shareholder to review and comment on each such Tax Return described in the
preceding sentence prior to filing.   
  

10.3 _Cooperation on Tax Matters_.  
  

(a) Equity One, the Target and Shareholder shall cooperate fully, as and to
the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the
filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Section and any audit, litigation or
other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the other party\'s request) the provision of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or
other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder. Equity One agrees (A) to retain all books and records with
respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Target relating to any taxable period
beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of
limitations (and, to the extent notified by Shareholder, any extensions
thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any taxing authority, and (B)
to give the other Parties reasonable written notice prior to transferring,
destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if any other Party so
requests, allow the other Party to take possession of such books and
records.  
  

(b) Equity One and Shareholder further agree, upon request, to use their
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document
from any governmental authority or any other Person as may be necessary
to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including,
but not limited to, with respect to the Transaction).  
  

(c) Each Party further agrees, upon request, to provide another Party with all
information in its possession or control that such other Party may be required
to report pursuant to Section 6043 of the Code and all Treasury
Department Regulations promulgated thereunder.  
  

10.4 _Certain Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties, interest
and additions) incurred in connection with this Agreement, shall be paid by
Equity One when due, and Equity One will, at its own expense, file all
necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all
such transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other Taxes
and fees and, if required by applicable law, Shareholder will, and will cause
its affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other
documentation.   
  

11. _Registration Rights_.  
  

11.1 After the passage of nine months after the Closing Date and upon
receiving demands therefor from the Shareholder, from time to time, Equity One
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to prepare and file with the
SEC, on up to four occasions, a registration statement and such other
documents as may be necessary in the opinion of both counsel for Equity One
and counsel for the Shareholder, in order to comply with the provisions of the
Securities Act so as to permit the registered resale of the Purchase Price
Shares for 12 consecutive months (each a " _Demand Registration_ "). No Demand
Registration shall be made hereunder with respect to registration of the sale
of fewer than 1,000,000 shares of the Purchase Price Shares. Equity One may
postpone for up to three months the filing or the effectiveness of a
registration statement pursuant to a Demand Registration if Equity One
notifies the Shareholder that such Demand Registration would reasonably be
expected to have an adverse effect on any business plan of Equity One or any
of its Subsidiaries; provided that in such event, the Shareholder will be
entitled to withdraw such request and, if such request is withdrawn, such
Demand Registration will not count as one of the permitted Demand
Registrations hereunder and that Equity One shall pay all registration
expenses in connection with such registration. In the event circumstances
change and Demand Registration would no longer have an adverse effect on any
business plan of Equity One or any of its Subsidiaries or upon the
expiration of the three month period (whichever occurs earlier), Equity One
shall within 30 days file with the SEC a registration statement and such other
documents as may be necessary in the opinion of both counsel for Equity One
and counsel for the Shareholder, in order to comply with the provisions of
the Securities Act so as to permit the registered resale of the Purchase Price
Shares and, upon filing, Shareholder will be deemed to have exercised one of
its permitted Demand Registrations.  
  

11.2 (a) If Equity One proposes to register any of the Common Stock under the
Securities Act for sale to the public, whether for its own account or for the
account of other security holders or both (except with respect to
registration statements on Form S-4, S-8 or another form not available for
registering the Common Stock for sale to the public), each such time Equity
One will give written notice to the Shareholder of its intention to do so.
Upon the written request of the Shareholder to register any of its Purchase
Price Shares, which notice must be received by Equity One within 15 Business
Days after Equity One has given notice of the proposed registration to the
Shareholder, Equity One will use its reasonable commercial efforts to cause
the Purchase Price Shares as to which registration shall have been so
requested to be included in the securities to be covered by the registration
statement proposed to be filed by Equity One, all to the extent required to
permit the sale or other disposition by the Shareholder (in accordance with
such written request) of the Purchase Price Shares so registered (a " _Piggy-
Back Registration_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, Equity One may elect, at any time, to register sale of the Purchase
Price Shares, in which event the Shareholder agrees to reasonably cooperate to
facilitate such registration.  
  

(b) In the event that any registration pursuant to Section 11.2(a) shall be,
in whole or in part, an underwritten public offering, the number of shares of
common stock of the Shareholder and the other holders of the securities of
Equity One requested to be included in such underwritten offering (the "
_Requesting Holders_ ") may be reduced (pro-rata among the Shareholder and the
Requesting Holders based upon the number of securities held by the Shareholder
and the Requesting Holders) if and to the extent that the managing underwriter
believes that such inclusion would adversely affect the marketing of the
securities to be sold by Equity One therein. The Shareholder agrees to execute
and deliver a customary lock-up agreement as may be requested by the managing
underwriter; provided, however, that all Requesting Holders of similar
securities in an amount equal to or greater than that held by Shareholder
shall have agreed to execute such agreements.  
  

11.3 The registration obligations of Equity One identified in this Section 11
shall be suspended and tolled for such period of time as is necessary, but in
no event longer than 120 days, so that under no circumstances shall
the registered resale of the Purchase Price Shares, by the holders thereof
commence within ninety (90) days (the " _Registration Suspension Period_ ")
after the commencement of an underwritten primary public offering of Equity
One\'s equity securities (a " _Public Offering_ "). The Shareholder
acknowledges and agrees that during the Registration Suspension Period it
shall not resell any Purchase Price Shares. The Shareholder further agrees
that it shall, upon request, enter into an agreement with the underwriter of a
Public Offering, pursuant to which the Shareholder shall agree not to resell
any Purchase Price Shares during the Registration Suspension Period.  
  

11.4 Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, Equity
One shall have no obligation to register the Purchase Price Shares if and to
the extent that they may be transferred without registration under
the Securities Act, pursuant to Rule 144(k) of the Act.  
  

11.5 If and whenever Equity One is required by the provisions of this
Agreement to use its commercially reasonable efforts to effect the
registration of the Purchase Price Shares, Equity One will, as promptly as
possible:  
  

(a) prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement with respect to
such securities and use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such
registration statement to become and remain effective;  
  

(b) prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and supplements to such
registration statement and the prospectus used in connection therewith as may
be necessary to keep such registration statement effective and to comply
with the requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated by the SEC thereunder relating to the sale or other disposition of
the securities covered by such registration statement;  
  

(c) furnish to the Shareholder such numbers of copies of a prospectus,
including a preliminary prospectus, complying with the requirements of the
Securities Act, and such other documents as the Shareholder may reasonably
request in order to facilitate the public sale or other disposition of the
Purchase Price Shares owned by the Shareholder, but the Shareholder shall not
be entitled to use any selling materials other than a prospectus and such
other materials as may be approved by Equity One, which approval will not be
unreasonably withheld; and  
  

(d) use its commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify the
securities covered by such registration statement under applicable state
securities acts as the Shareholder shall reasonably request, and do any and
all such other acts and things as may be necessary or advisable to enable the
Shareholder to consummate the public sale or other disposition of the Purchase
Price Shares owned by the Shareholder, in such states; provided, however, that
Equity One shall not be obligated to register or qualify such securities in
any jurisdiction in which such registration or qualification would require
Equity One to qualify as a foreign corporation or file any general consent to
service of process where it is not then so qualified or has not theretofore
so consented.  
  

11.6 Except as provided below in this Section 11, the expenses incurred by
Equity One in connection with actions taken by Equity One to comply with this
Section 11, including, without limitation, all registration and filing fees,
printing and delivery expenses, accounting fees, fees and disbursements of
counsel to Equity One, consultant and expert fees, premiums for liability
insurance, if Equity One chooses to obtain such insurance, obtained in
connection with a registration statement filed to effect such compliance and
all expenses, including counsel fees, of complying with state securities acts,
shall be paid by Equity One. All fees and disbursements of any counsel,
experts, or consultants employed by the Shareholder shall be borne by the
Shareholder. Equity One shall not be obligated in any way in connection with
any registration pursuant to this Section 11 for any selling commissions or
discounts payable by the Shareholder to any underwriter or broker of
securities to be sold by the Shareholder. It shall be a condition precedent to
the obligation of Equity One to take any action pursuant to this Section 11
that Equity One shall have received an undertaking satisfactory to it from
the Shareholder to furnish or cause to be furnished to Equity One
specifically for use in the preparation of the registration statement and
prospectus written information concerning the securities held by the
Shareholder and also concerning any underwriter of such securities and the
intended method of disposition thereof and any additional information or
documentation as Equity One shall reasonably request and as may be required by
administrators of the Securities Act or state securities acts in
connection with the action to be taken by Equity One hereunder pursuant to
such registration.  
  

11.7 In the event of any registration under the Securities Act pursuant to
this Section 11, Equity One will indemnify and hold harmless the Shareholder,
its officers, directors and each underwriter of such securities, and
any person who controls the Shareholder or underwriter within the meaning of
Section 15 of the Securities Act, against all claims, actions, losses,
damages, liabilities and expenses, joint or several, to which any of such
persons may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as
such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions arise out of or are based
upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact
contained in any registration statement under which such securities were
registered under the Securities Act, any preliminary prospectus or final
prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereof, or arise
out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse the Shareholder, its
officers, directors and each underwriter of such securities, and each such
controlling person or entity for any legal and any other expenses reasonably
incurred by the Shareholder, such underwriter, or such controlling person or
entity in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, action,
claim, damage, liability, or action; provided, however, that Equity One will
not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim,
damage, liability or action arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement
or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in said
registration statement, said preliminary prospectus or said prospectus, or
said amendment of supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written
information furnished to Equity One by the Shareholder or such underwriter
specifically for use in the preparation thereof, and provided further
however, that Equity One will not be liable in any such case to the extent
that any such loss, claim, damage or liability or action arises out of or is
based upon an untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or an alleged
omission made in any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus if (i) the
Shareholder failed to send or deliver a copy of the final prospectus or
prospectus supplement with or prior to the delivery of written confirmation of
the sale of the Purchase Price Shares, and (ii) the final prospectus or
prospectus supplement would have corrected such untrue statement or
omission.  
  

11.8 In the event of any registration of any securities under the Securities
Act pursuant to this Section 11, the Shareholder will, or will furnish the
written undertaking of such other person or entity as shall be acceptable to
Equity One to, indemnify and hold harmless Equity One, its officers, directors
and any person who controls it within the meaning of Section 15 of the
Securities Act, against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, or actions,
joint or several, to which Equity One, its officers, directors, or such
controlling person or entity may become subject under the Securities Act or
otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, or actions
arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement of any material fact contained in any registration statement under
which such securities were registered under the Securities Act, any
preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein, or any amendment
or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or
alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each
case to the extent and only to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage,
liability, or action arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in said
registration statement, said preliminary prospectus or said prospectus or
said amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written
information furnished to Equity One by the Shareholder or any underwriter of
the Shareholder\'s securities specifically for use in the preparation
thereof.

(a) Equity One and the Shareholder may terminate this Agreement by mutual
written consent at any time prior to the Closing;  
  

(b) Equity One may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to the
Shareholder at any time prior to the Closing (A) in the event the Shareholder

contained in this Agreement); and  
  

(c) the Shareholder or Centrefund may terminate this Agreement by giving
written notice to Equity One at any time prior to the Closing (A) in the event

13. _Miscellaneous_.  
  

13.1 _Press Releases and Public Announcements_. No Party shall issue any press
release or make any public announcement relating to the subject matter of

to advise the other Parties prior to making the disclosure and give the other
Parties a reasonable opportunity to consult as to the content and form of the
proposed disclosure).

made.

hereunder to the intended recipient at the address set forth above using any
other means (including personal delivery, expedited courier, messenger
service, telecopy, telex, ordinary mail, or electronic mail), but no such

13.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the domestic laws of the State of Florida without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the
State of Florida or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Florida.  
  

13.9 _Amendments and Waivers_. No amendment of any provision of this Agreement
shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and signed by Equity One
and the Shareholder. No waiver by any Party of any default, misrepresentation,
or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder, whether intentional or not, shall
be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation, or
breach of warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in any way any rights
arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence.  
  

13.10 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the

situation or in any other jurisdiction.  
  

13.11 _Expenses_. Each of the Parties and Target will bear its own costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transaction. The
Parties agree that the expenses allocable to the Target shall be determined
reasonably and in good faith.  
  

13.12 _Construction_. The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation
of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of
this Agreement. Any reference to any federal, state, local, or foreign statute
or law shall be deemed also to refer to all rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise. The word "including" shall
mean including without limitation. The Parties intend that each
representation, warranty, and covenant contained herein shall have independent
significance. If any Party has breached any representation, warranty, or
covenant contained herein in any respect, the fact that there exists another
representation, warranty, or covenant relating to the same subject matter
(regardless of the relative levels of specificity) which the Party has not
breached shall not detract from or mitigate the fact that the Party is in
breach of the first representation, warranty, or covenant.  
  

13.13 _Incorporation of Exhibits, Annexes, and Schedules_. The Exhibits,
Annexes, Schedules and Certificates identified in this Agreement are
incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof.  
  

13.14 _Specific Performance_. Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that
the other Parties would be damaged irreparably in the event any of the
provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or otherwise are breached. Accordingly, each of the Parties
agrees that the other Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof in any
action instituted in any court of the United States or any state thereof
having jurisdiction over the Parties and the matter (subject to the
provisions set forth in Section 13.15 below), in addition to any other remedy
to which they may be entitled, at law or in equity.  
  

13.15 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each of the Parties submits to the
jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in Dade County, Florida,
in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement and
agrees that all claims in respect of the action or proceeding may be heard and
determined in any such court. Each of the Parties waives any defense of
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought
and waives any bond, surety, or other security that might be required of any
other Party with respect thereto. Any Party may make service on any other
Party by sending or delivering a copy of the process to the Party to be
served at the address and in the manner provided for the giving of notices in
Section 13.7. Nothing in this Section 13.15, however, shall affect the right
of any Party to bring any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to
this Agreement in any other court or to serve legal process in any other
manner permitted by law or at equity. Each Party agrees that a final judgment
in any action or proceeding so brought shall be conclusive and may be
enforced by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law or at
equity.  
  

13.16 _Prevailing Party_. In any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover
