securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of

3.2 _Treatment_ _of Company Equity Awards_ _._

 

(a) _Company Options_. At the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares

Stock subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by (B) the Exchange Ratio, (ii) at an exercise price per share of
Parent Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the
quotient of (A) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock of such
Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (B) the
Exchange Ratio. Except as otherwise provided in this _Section_ __ _ 3.2(a)_,
each such Parent Option shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the

nearest whole share) equal to the product of (A) the total number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company SAR immediately prior to the

(c) _Company RSU Awards_. At the Effective Time, each time-vesting restricted

Stock (rounded to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of (i) the
total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU
Award immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Exchange
Ratio. Except as otherwise provided in this _Section_ __ _ 3.2(c)_, each such
Parent RSU Award shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same
terms and conditions (including with respect to vesting and dividend
equivalents) as applied to the corresponding Company RSU Award immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

4

Exchange Ratio. Each such Parent RSU Award shall be subject solely to time-
based vesting over the originally scheduled vesting period of the
corresponding Company Performance Share Award. Except as otherwise provided
in this _Section_ __ _ 3.2(e)_, each such Parent RSU Award shall continue to
have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions (including with

corresponding Company Performance Share Award immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

available to the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, cash sufficient
to pay any dividends and other distributions pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.3(g)_ and to make payments in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 3.3(h)_. The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be issued in
exchange for shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement out of
the Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 3.3(a)_ and
_Sections 3.3(g)_ and _3.3(h)_ , the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any
other purpose. Any cash and shares of Parent Common Stock deposited with the
Exchange Agent (including as payment for fractional shares in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 3.3(h)_ and any dividends or other distributions in accordance
with  _Section_ __ _ 3.3(g)_) shall hereinafter be referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_." The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and
expenses, including those of the Exchange Agent, in connection with the
exchange of shares for the Merger Consideration. Any interest or other income
resulting from investment of the cash portion of the Exchange Fund shall
become part of the Exchange Fund.

 

(b) _Payment Procedures_.

 

(i) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event more than
two (2) Business Days after the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Exchange
Agent to deliver to each record holder, as

 



5

    

 of immediately prior to the Effective Time, of (A) shares represented by a
certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") or (B)
shares of Company Common Stock represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry
Shares_ "), in each case, which shares were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time, a letter of
transmittal (" _Letter of Transmittal_ ") (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent or, in
the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in
the Letter of Transmittal, and which shall be in a customary form and agreed
to by Parent and the Company prior to the Closing) and instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or, in the case of Book-Entry
Shares, the surrender of such shares, for payment of the Merger Consideration
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.1(b)(i)_.

 

(ii) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares, together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other customary
documents as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of
such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor (A) one or more shares of Parent Common Stock (which
shall be in uncertificated book-entry form unless a physical certificate is
requested by such holder) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of
shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.1_ (after taking into account all shares
of Company Common Stock then held by such holder) and (B) a check in the
amount equal to the cash payable in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3(h)_ and dividends and other
distributions pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3(g)_. No interest shall be paid
or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares on the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a
Person other than the record holder of such shares of Company Common Stock,
it shall be a condition of payment that shares so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that
the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of such shares surrendered or shall
have established to the satisfaction of Parent that such Taxes either have
been paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
_Section_ __ _ 3.3(b)(ii)_, each Certificate and each Book-Entry Share shall
be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration payable in respect of
such shares of Company Common Stock, cash in lieu of any fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to  _Section_
__ _ 3.3(h)_ and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3(g)_.

 

(c) _Termination of Rights_. All Merger Consideration (including any dividends
or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 3.3(g)_ and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3(h))_ paid upon the surrender of
and in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the
terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such Company Common Stock. At the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation shall be
closed immediately, and there shall be no further registration of transfers
on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of
Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are
presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled
and exchanged for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of
Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares (other than Certificates or Book-Entry Shares evidencing shares
of Company Common Stock described in _Section_ __ _ 3.1(b)(iii)_), any cash
in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which the holders
thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3(h)_ and any dividends or
other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 3.3(g)_, without any interest thereon.

 



6

    

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the former shareholders of the Company on the one
hundred eightieth (180th) day after the Closing Date shall be delivered to
Parent, upon demand, and any former common shareholders of the Company who
have not theretofore received the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 3.3(h)_ and any dividends or other distributions with
respect to Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 3.3(g)_, in each case without interest thereon, to which they
are entitled under this _Article_ __ _ III_ shall thereafter look only to
Parent for payment of their claim for such amounts.

(e) _No Liability_. None of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or
the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of Company Common Stock for
any amount of Merger Consideration properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any
Certificate or Book-Entry Share has not been surrendered prior to the time
that is immediately prior to the time at which Merger Consideration in respect
of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share would otherwise escheat to or become
the property of any Governmental Entity, any such shares, cash, dividends or
distributions in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(f) _Lost, Stolen, or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate (other than
a Certificate evidencing shares of Company Common Stock described in
_Section_ __ _ 3.1(b)(iii)_) shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by
the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of
Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, any cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which the holders thereof
are entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3(h)_ and any dividends or other
distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 3.3(g)_.

 

(g) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of Parent Common Stock_.
No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to shares
of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Shares with
respect to the whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder would
be entitled to receive upon surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
shall be paid to any such holder, in each case until such holder shall
surrender such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 3.3_. Following surrender of any such Certificate or Book-
Entry Shares, there shall be paid to such holder of whole shares of Parent
Common Stock issuable in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly
after the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid
with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Effective Time but with a subsequent payment date with
respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock. For purposes
of dividends or other distributions in respect of shares of Parent Common
Stock, all whole shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the
Merger shall be entitled to dividends pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence as if such whole shares of Parent Common Stock were issued and
outstanding as of the Effective Time.

(h) _No Fractional Shares of Parent Common Stock_. No certificates or scrip
or shares representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be
issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to
vote or to have any rights of a stockholder of Parent or a holder of shares of
Parent Common Stock. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
each holder of shares of Company Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger
who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of
Parent Common Stock (after

 



7

    

 taking into account all Certificates and Book-Entry Shares delivered by such
holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount
equal to the product of (i) such fractional part of a share of Parent Common
Stock multiplied by (ii) the volume weighted average price of Parent Common
Stock for the five consecutive trading days ending on the date that is two (2)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date as reported by _The Wall Street
Journal_. As promptly as practicable after the determination of the amount of
cash, if any, to be paid to holders of shares of Company Common Stock
exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to
receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after taking into
account all Certificates and Book-Entry Shares delivered by such holder), the
Exchange Agent shall so notify Parent, and Parent shall cause the Exchange
Agent to forward payments to such holders of fractional interests subject to
and in accordance with the terms hereof.

(i) _Withholding Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Parent, the Company, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement any amount required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under
applicable Tax Laws. To the extent that any amounts are so deducted or
withheld and paid over to the relevant Taxing Authority, such deducted or
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was
made.

 

3.4 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any Person who is entitled to
dissent and properly perfects such Persons dissenters rights of appraisal
with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Dissenting
Shares_ ") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section
10A-2-13.01 _et seq_. of the ABNEC (the " _ABNEC Article 13_ ") shall not be
converted into shares of Parent Common Stock as provided in _Section_ __ _
3.1(b)(i)_, but rather the holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to
payment of the "fair value" (as defined in ABNEC Article 13) of such
Dissenting Shares plus accrued interest in accordance with ABNEC Article 13;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or
otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to dissent under ABNEC
Article 13, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such
holders Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be
deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and shall have
become exchangeable solely for the right to receive, shares of Parent Common
Stock as provided in _Section_ __ _ 3.1(b)(i)_. The Company shall serve
prompt written notice to Parent of any demand received by the Company from
a holder of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 13.21 of ABNEC
Article 13, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to any such demand. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent (not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), make any payment with respect
to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or waive any failure by
any holder of Company Common Stock to timely deliver a written demand for
appraisal or the taking of any other action by any such holder as may be
necessary to perfect appraisal rights under the ABNEC, or agree to do any of
the foregoing.

The Company is duly qualified and in good standing to do business in each

Material Adverse Effect. Each Subsidiary of the Company is duly qualified and
in good standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which the business it
is conducting, or the operation, ownership or leasing of its properties, makes

(c) The Company has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act), which are
effective (as such term is used in Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act) to
ensure that material information relating to the Company, including its
Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive officer and the chief
financial officer of the Company by others within those entities in connection
with the reports it files under the Exchange Act.

 

4.6 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

 

(a) Since June 30, 2018, there has not been any Company Material Adverse
Effect or any event, change, effect or development that, individually or in

material to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

 

(j) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in conjunction
with any other event) (i) result in, cause the vesting, exercisability or
delivery of, cause the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to transfer or set

Plan, (ii) increase in the amount or value of, any payment, right or other
benefit to any employee or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,

its business in the manner described, and subject to the limitations,
qualifications, reservations and encumbrances contained in any Company SEC
Document, except for such Rights-of-Way the absence of which does not have and
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has

(a) Except as does not have and would not reasonably be expected to have,

except for property (i) sold or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course
of business since the dates of the reserve report prepared by Ryder Scott

Encumbrances, except for Permitted Encumbrances. For purposes of the foregoing

Company or its Subsidiaries to the Company Independent Petroleum
Engineers relating to the Company interests referred to in the Company
Reserve Report was, as of the time provided, accurate in all respects. Except
for any such matters that, individually or in the aggregate, do not have and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect,
the oil and gas reserve estimates of the Company set forth in the Company
Reserve Report are derived from reports that have been prepared by the Company
Independent Petroleum Engineers, and such reserve estimates fairly reflect,
in all respects, the oil and gas reserves of the Company at the dates
indicated therein and are in accordance with SEC guidelines applicable thereto
applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved. Except
for changes generally affecting the oil and gas exploration, development and
production industry (including changes in commodity prices) and normal
depletion by production, there has been no change in respect of the matters
addressed in the Company Reserve Report that has had or would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

Company Oil and Gas Properties (" _Company Oil and Gas Leases_ ") have been
properly and timely paid, (ii) all royalties, minimum royalties, overriding
royalties and other Production Burdens with respect to any Company Oil and Gas
Properties have been timely and properly paid, (iii) none of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (and, to the Companys knowledge, no third party
operator) has violated any provision of, or taken or failed to take any action
that, with or without notice, lapse of time, or both, would constitute a
default under the provisions of any Company Oil and Gas Lease (or entitle the
lessor thereunder to cancel or terminate such Company Oil and Gas Lease)
included in the Company Oil and Gas Properties.

 

(d) Except as does not have and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, all
proceeds from the sale of Hydrocarbons produced from the Company Oil and Gas
Properties are being received by such selling entities in a timely manner and
no proceeds from the sale of Hydrocarbons produced from any such Company Oil
and Gas Properties are being held in suspense (by the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries, any third party operator thereof or any other Person or
individual) for any reason other than (i) as reported in the Company SEC
Documents or (ii) awaiting preparation and approval of division order title
opinions for recently drilled Wells. Neither Company nor its Subsidiaries is
obligated by virtue of a take-or-pay payment, advance payment, or similar
payment (other than royalties, overriding royalties and similar arrangements
established in the Oil and Gas Leases) to deliver Hydrocarbons or proceeds
from the sale thereof, attributable to such Persons interest in its Oil and
Gas Properties at some future time without receiving payment therefor at the
time of delivery, except, in each case, as does not have and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

(e) All of the Wells and all water, CO2, injection or other wells located on
the Oil and Gas Leases of the Company and its Subsidiaries or otherwise
associated with an Oil and Gas Property of the Company or its Subsidiaries
have been drilled, completed and operated within the limits permitted by the
applicable contracts entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
related to such wells and applicable Law, and all drilling and completion (and
plugging and abandonment) of such wells and all related development,
production and other operations have been conducted in compliance with

each case as attributable to interests owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries,
free and clear of any Encumbrances, except for Permitted Encumbrances. For
purposes of the foregoing sentence, "good and defensible title" means that
Parents or one or more of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, title (as of the

by them) (A) entitles Parent (or one or more of its Subsidiaries, as

applicable thereto), not less than the net revenue interest share shown in the
Parent Reserve Report of all Hydrocarbons produced from such Oil and Gas
Properties throughout the life of such Oil and Gas Properties, (B) obligates
Parent (or one or more of its Subsidiaries, as applicable) to bear a

the Parent interests referred to in the Parent Reserve Report was, as of the
time provided, accurate in all respects. Except for any such matters that,
individually or in the aggregate, do not have and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, the oil and gas reserve
estimates of Parent set forth in the Parent Reserve Report are derived from
reports that have been prepared by the Parent Independent Petroleum Engineers,
and such reserve estimates fairly reflect, in all respects, the oil and
gas reserves of Parent at the dates indicated therein and are in accordance
with SEC guidelines applicable thereto applied on a consistent basis
throughout the periods involved. Except for changes generally affecting the
oil and gas exploration, development and production industry (including
changes in commodity prices) and normal depletion by production, there has
been no change in respect of the matters addressed in the Company Reserve
Report that has had or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(c) Except as does not have and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, (i) all

Parent Oil and Gas Properties (the " _Parent Oil and Gas Leases_ ") have been
properly and timely paid, (ii) all royalties, minimum royalties, overriding
royalties and other Production Burdens with respect to any Parent Oil and Gas
Properties have been timely and properly paid, (iii) none of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries (and, to the Parents knowledge, no third party operator) has
violated any provision of, or taken or failed to take any action that, with
or without notice, lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default under
the provisions of any Parent Oil and Gas Lease (or entitle the lessor
thereunder to cancel or terminate such Parent Oil and Gas Lease) included in

Statement, and, in each case, any amendments or supplements thereto.

Parent Stockholders Meeting, and Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC
the Registration Statement (of which the Joint Proxy Statement will be a
part). The Company and Parent shall each use reasonable best efforts to cause
the Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy Statement to comply with the
rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC and to respond promptly to any
comments of the SEC or its staff. Parent and the Company shall each use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement to become
effective under the Securities Act as soon after such filing as reasonably
practicable and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to keep the
Registration Statement effective as long as is necessary to consummate the
Merger. Each of the Company and Parent will advise the other promptly after

or the Registration Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or any
request by the SEC for additional information, and Parent and the Company
shall jointly prepare any response to such comments or requests, and each of
the Company and Parent agrees to permit the other (in each case, to the extent
practicable), and their respective outside counsels, to participate in
all meetings and conferences with the SEC. Each of the Company and Parent

reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document or response
(including the proposed final version of such document or response), (ii)
include in such document or response all comments reasonably and promptly
proposed by the other and (iii) not file or mail such document or respond to
the SEC prior to receiving the approval of the other, which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

the Merger and the Transactions under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act

party shall advise the other, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of
the time when the Registration Statement has become effective or any
supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the
suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in
connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction. Each of
the Company and Parent will use reasonable best efforts to have any such stop
order or suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise terminated.

 

(d) If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to
Parent or the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or
directors, should be discovered by Parent or the Company that should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Joint

a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other party and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, disseminated to the shareholders of the Company
and the stockholders of Parent.

insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or
by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct business at such
Company Shareholders Meeting and (ii) may adjourn or postpone the Company
Shareholders Meeting if, as of the time for which the Company Shareholders
Meeting is scheduled, the Company reasonably determines in good faith

_provided_ , _however_ , that unless otherwise agreed to by the parties, the
Company Shareholders Meeting shall not be adjourned or postponed to a date
that is more than thirty (30) days after the date for which the meeting was

extent necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy
Statement that is required to be filed and disseminated under applicable Law

Parent Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to obtain the
Parent Stockholder Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that unless otherwise
agreed to by the parties, the Parent Stockholders Meeting shall not be
adjourned or postponed to a date that is more than thirty (30) days after the
date for which the meeting was previously scheduled (it being understood that
such Parent Stockholders Meeting shall be adjourned or postponed every time
the circumstances described in the foregoing _clauses (i)(A)_ and _(i)(B)_

 written communications from or to Parents stockholders with respect
thereto. Unless there has been a Parent Change of Recommendation as expressly

their reasonable best efforts to defend against any efforts by any of Parents
stockholders or any other Person to prevent the Parent Stockholder Approval

8.1(d)_, each of the Company and Parent agrees that its obligations to call,
give notice of, convene and hold the Company Shareholders Meeting and the
Parent Stockholders Meeting, as applicable, pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
6.6_ shall not be affected by the making of a Company Change of Recommendation
or a Parent Change of Recommendation, as applicable, and its
obligations pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ shall not be affected by
the commencement, announcement, disclosure, or communication to the Company or
Parent, as applicable, of any Company Competing Proposal or Parent Competing
Proposal or other proposal (including, a Company Superior Proposal or Parent
Superior Proposal) or the occurrence or disclosure of any Company Intervening
Event or Parent Intervening Event.

 

6.7 _Access to Information_.

 

(a) Subject to applicable Law and the other provisions of this _Section_ __ _
6.7_, the Company and Parent each shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to), upon request by the other, furnish the other with all information
concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
shareholders/stockholders (as applicable) and such other matters as may be
reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Registration
Statement, the Joint Proxy Statement or any other statement, filing, notice or
application made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to any third party or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Transactions. Each party shall, and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries to, afford to the other party and its Representatives, during
the period prior to the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to _Article_ __ _ VIII_, reasonable access, at
reasonable times upon reasonable prior notice, to the officers, key employees,
agents, properties, offices and other facilities of such party and its
Subsidiaries and to their books, records, contracts and documents and shall,
and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish reasonably promptly to
the other party and its Representatives such information concerning its and
its Subsidiaries business, properties, contracts, records and personnel as
may be reasonably requested, from time to time, by or on behalf of the other
party. Each party and its Representatives shall conduct any such activities in
such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or
operations of the other party or its Subsidiaries or otherwise cause any
unreasonable interference with the prompt and timely discharge by the
employees of the other party and its Subsidiaries of their normal duties.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.7(a)_,
neither party shall be required to, or to cause any of its Subsidiaries to,
grant access or furnish information to the other party or any of its
Representatives to the extent that such information is subject to an
attorney/client privilege or the attorney work product doctrine or that such
access or the furnishing of such information is prohibited by applicable Law
or an existing contract or agreement ( _provided_ , _however_ , the Company
or Parent, as applicable, shall inform the other party as to the general
nature of what is being withheld and the Company and Parent shall reasonably
cooperate to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable
disclosure that does not suffer from any of the foregoing impediments).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither party shall have access to personnel
records of the other party or any of its Subsidiaries relating to individual
performance or evaluation records, medical histories or other information that
in the other partys good faith opinion the disclosure of which could subject
the other party or any of its Subsidiaries to risk of
liability. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither party shall be permitted to
conduct any sampling or analysis of any environmental media or building
materials at any facility of the other party or its Subsidiaries without the
prior written consent of the other party, which may be granted or withheld in
such other partys sole discretion. Each party agrees that (i) no
investigation or information provided pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_
shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by
the Company, Parent or Merger Sub herein and (ii) it

 



51

    

 will not, and will cause its Representatives not to, use any information
obtained pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.7(a)_ for any purpose unrelated to
the consummation of the Transactions.

(b) The Confidentiality Agreement dated as of August 4, 2018 between Parent
and the Company (as amended from time to time, the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ ") shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
shall apply to all information furnished thereunder or hereunder. All
information provided to any party or its Representatives pursuant to or in
connection with this Agreement is deemed to be "Confidential Information" as
defined under the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

6.8 _Regulatory Approvals_ _; Efforts_.

 

(a) Each of the parties shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other party in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the Merger and the other Transactions.

 

(b) Except for the filings and notifications made pursuant to Antitrust Laws
to which _Section_ __ _ 6.8(c)_ and  _Section_ __ _ 6.8(d)_, and not this
_Section_ __ _ 6.8(b)_, shall apply, promptly following the execution of this
Agreement, the parties shall proceed to prepare and file with the appropriate
Governmental Entities all authorizations, consents, notifications,
certifications, registrations, declarations and filings that are necessary in
order to consummate the Transactions and shall diligently and expeditiously
prosecute, and shall cooperate fully with each other in the prosecution of,
such matters. Neither Party nor its Subsidiaries shall agree to any actions,
restrictions or conditions with respect to obtaining any consents,
registrations, approvals, permits, expirations of waiting periods
or authorizations in connection with the Transactions without the prior
written consent of the other Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

(c) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the execution of this
Agreement, but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days following the
date of this Agreement, the parties shall make any filings required under the
HSR Act. Each of Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to, cooperate fully with each other and shall furnish
to the other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the
other may reasonably request in connection with its preparation of any filings
under any applicable Antitrust Laws. Unless otherwise agreed, Parent and the
Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts to ensure the prompt
expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act.
Parent and the Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts to respond
to and comply with any request for information or documentary material from
any Governmental Entity charged with enforcing, applying, administering, or
investigating any Antitrust Law, including the Federal Trade Commission, the
Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice, any attorney general of
any state of the United States, or any other competition authority of any
other jurisdiction (" _Antitrust Authority_ "). Each of Parent and the Company
shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, in connection with
the efforts referenced in this Section 6.8, (i) cooperate in all respects with
each other in connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including
any proceeding initiated by a private party; (ii) promptly notify the
other Party of any communication concerning this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby to that Party from or with any Governmental
Entity, or from any other Person alleging that the consent of such person (or
another Person) is or may be required in connection with the Transactions,
and consider in good faith the views of the other Party and keep the other
Party reasonably informed of the status of matters related to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including furnishing the other Party with any
written notices or other communications received by such Party from, or given
by such Party to, any Governmental Entity and of any communication received or
given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case
regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby, except that any
materials concerning one Partys valuation of the other Party may be redacted;
and (iii) permit the other Party to review in draft any
proposed communication to be submitted by it to any Governmental Entity with
reasonable time and opportunity to comment, and consult with each other in
advance of any in-person or telephonic meeting or conference with any
Governmental Entity or, in connection with any

 



52

    

 proceeding by a private party, with any other Person, and, to the extent
permitted by the applicable Governmental Entity or Person, not participate in
any meeting or discussion with any Governmental Entity relating to any
filings or investigations concerning this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby unless it consults with the other Party and its
Representatives in advance and invites the other Partys Representatives to
attend in accordance with applicable Laws. The parties shall take reasonable
efforts to preserve the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine,
joint defense privilege or any other privilege with respect to any
information shared pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.8(c)_.

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent shall take any
and all action necessary, including but not limited to (i) selling or
otherwise disposing of, or holding separate and agreeing to sell or otherwise
dispose of, assets, categories of assets or businesses of the Company or
Parent or their respective Subsidiaries; (ii) terminating existing
relationships, contractual rights or obligations of the Company or Parent or
their respective Subsidiaries; (iii) terminating any venture or other
arrangement; (iv) creating any relationship, contractual rights or
obligations of the Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries or (v)
effectuating any other change or restructuring of the Company or Parent or
their respective Subsidiaries and, in each case, to enter into agreements or
stipulate to the entry of an order or decree or file appropriate applications
with any Antitrust Authority in connection with any of the foregoing and in
the case of actions by or with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries or
its or their businesses or assets (each, a " _Divestiture Action_ ") to ensure
that no Governmental Entity enters any order, decision, judgment, decree,
ruling, injunction (preliminary or permanent), or establishes any Law or
other action preliminarily or permanently restraining, enjoining or
prohibiting the consummation of the Merger, or to ensure that no Antitrust
Authority with the authority to clear, authorize or otherwise approve the
consummation of the Merger, fails to do so by the End Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, none
of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to take or agree to
take any Divestiture Action or other action that would reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the
business, financial condition or operations of Parent and its Subsidiaries
(including the Company and its Subsidiaries) from and after the Effective
Time, taken as a whole (a " _Regulatory Material Adverse Effect_ "). The
Company shall not be required to take any Divestiture Action requested by
Parent unless such action is only effective after the Effective Time and
conditioned upon the consummation of the Transactions.

(e) In the event that any action is threatened or instituted challenging the
Merger as violative of any Antitrust Law, Parent shall take such action,
including any Divestiture Action, as may be necessary to avoid, resist or
resolve such action ( _provided_ , that in no event shall this  _Section_ __
_ 6.8(e)_ require Parent to make or agree to take any Divestiture Action that
would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Regulatory Material Adverse Effect). Subject to the terms of this  _Section_
__ _ 6.8_, including the immediately foregoing sentence, in the event that
any permanent or preliminary injunction or other order is entered or becomes
reasonably foreseeable to be entered in any Proceeding that would make
consummation of the Transactions in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement unlawful or that would restrain, enjoin or otherwise prevent or
materially delay the consummation of the Transactions, Parent shall take
promptly any and all steps necessary to vacate, modify or suspend such
injunction or order so as to permit such consummation prior to the End Date.

(f) Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall not take any action that could
reasonably be expected to hinder or delay obtaining the clearance, or the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period, under the HSR Act.

 

6.9 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first
anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Continuation Period_ "), Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries to,
provide each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries who continues to be
employed by Parent or its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries) immediately following the

 



53

    

 Effective Time (collectively, the " _Continuing Employees_ ") with (i) a
base salary or base wage rate, as applicable, that is no less favorable than
the base salary or base wage rate, as applicable, provided by the Company or
its Subsidiaries to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time; (ii) short- and long-term target incentive compensation
opportunities that are no less favorable in value, in the aggregate, than the
short- and long-term target incentive compensation opportunities provided by
the Company or its Subsidiaries to such Continuing Employee immediately prior
to the Effective Time; _provided_ that, if the relative allocation of short-
and long-term target incentive compensation opportunities as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time is adjusted, the fraction of the aggregate target
incentive compensation opportunity allocated to short-term incentives shall
not be smaller than that applicable to similarly situated employees of Parent
and its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _further_ , in order to address Parent and
the Companys different grant-timing practices, Parent may grant long-
term incentive awards at different times of the year than such awards are
granted to its employees generally (to prevent Continuing Employees from not
receiving full 2019 award opportunities) and may adjust future awards to
ensure that there is not a duplication of incentive compensation
opportunities with respect to the same performance period (or portion
thereof); and (iii) other compensation and employee benefits that are
substantially comparable in value, in the aggregate, to those provided by the
Company or its Subsidiaries to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to
the Effective Time. Without limiting the immediately preceding sentence,
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or one of its
Subsidiaries to, provide to each Continuing Employee whose employment
terminates during the Continuation Period with severance benefits equal to the
greater of (A) the severance benefits for which such Continuing Employee is
eligible under the Companys Change in Control Severance Pay Plan (in
accordance with its terms at the Effective Time) and (B) the severance
benefits for which similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries
are eligible, in each case, determined (x) solely for the purpose of _clause
(A)_ above, without taking into account any reduction after the Effective
Time in compensation paid to such Continuing Employee and (y) taking into
account each Continuing Employees service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries (and any predecessor entities) and, after the Effective Time,
Parent and its Subsidiaries. In addition, for as long as there are adequate
assets in the trusts underlying the Retiree Welfare Plans to meet the benefit
obligations under the Retiree Welfare Plans, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries to continue to, maintain the
Retiree Welfare Plans for the benefit of the individuals who are
receiving benefits thereunder as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
or would be eligible to receive benefits thereunder as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time, based on the plan terms and level of benefits as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plans of Parent or its Subsidiaries
in which any Continuing Employees become eligible to participate on or after
the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), Parent shall or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries to: (i) obtain waivers of
all pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to such employees and their
eligible dependents under any New Plans, except to the extent such pre-
existing conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would apply under the
analogous the Company Benefit Plan, (ii) provide each such employee and his or
her eligible dependents with credit for any eligible expenses incurred by
such employee or dependent prior to the Effective Time (or, if later, the time
that such employee becomes eligible for coverage under a New Plan) under a
Company Benefit Plan (to the same extent that such credit was given under the
analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time (or, if later, the
time that such employee becomes eligible for coverage under a New Plan)) in
satisfying any applicable deductible, co-payment or out-of-pocket
requirements under any New Plans, and (iii) recognize all service of such
employees with the Company and its Subsidiaries for all purposes in any New
Plan to the same extent that such service was taken into account under the
analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that
the foregoing service recognition shall not apply to the extent it would
result in duplication of benefits for the same period of services.

(c) Subject to  _Section_ __ _ 6.9(d)_, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, assume and honor all Company Benefit Plans in
accordance with their terms. Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change in
control" (or similar phrase) within the meaning of the Company Benefit Plans
will occur at the Effective Time.

 



54

    

(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee, director or
consultant of the Company or any of its Affiliates any right to continue in
the employ or service of the Surviving Corporation, the Company, or any
Affiliate thereof, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights
of the Surviving Corporation, the Company, Parent or any Affiliate thereof to
discharge or terminate the services of any employee, director or consultant of
the Company or any of its Affiliates at any time for any reason whatsoever,
with or without cause. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to (i)
establish, amend, or modify any Company Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other
benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement, or (ii) alter
or limit the ability of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates to
amend, modify or terminate any particular Company Benefit Plan, New Plan or
any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after
the Effective Time. Without limiting the generality of the final sentence of 
_Section_ __ _ 9.6_, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to or shall confer upon any person, including, without limitation,
any current or former employee, director or consultant of the Company or any
of its Affiliates, any third party beneficiary or other right, benefit or
remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

 

6.10 _Indemnification; Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Insurance_.

 

(a) Without limiting any other rights that any Indemnified Person may have
pursuant to any employment agreement or indemnification agreement in effect
on the date hereof or otherwise (which shall be assumed by Parent and the
Surviving Corporation), from the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall, jointly and severally, indemnify, defend and hold harmless
each Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this
Agreement or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director, officer or
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or who acts as a fiduciary
under any Company Benefit Plan or any of its Subsidiaries or is or was
serving at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
limited liability company, joint venture, employee benefit plan, trust or
other enterprise (the " _Indemnified Persons_ ") against all losses, claims,
damages, costs, fines, penalties, expenses (including attorneys and other
professionals fees and expenses), liabilities or judgments or amounts that
are paid in settlement, of or incurred in connection with any threatened or
actual Proceeding to which such Indemnified Person is a party or is otherwise
involved (including as a witness) based, in whole or in part, on or arising,
in whole or in part, out of the fact that such Person is or was a director,
officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, a fiduciary
under any Company Benefit Plan or any of its Subsidiaries or is or was serving
at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director,
officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, limited
liability company, joint venture, employee benefit plan, trust or other
enterprise or by reason of anything done or not done by such Person in any
such capacity, whether pertaining to any act or omission occurring or existing
prior to, at or after the Effective Time and whether asserted or claimed prior
to, at or after the Effective Time (" _Indemnified Liabilities_ "), including
all Indemnified Liabilities based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole
or in part out of, or pertaining to, this Agreement or the Transactions, in
each case to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law (and Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally, pay expenses
incurred in advance of the final disposition of any such Proceeding to each
Indemnified Person to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law and
in accordance with the procedures (if any) set forth in the Organizational
Documents of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company; provided, that such
Covered Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay
such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Covered Person is not
entitled to indemnification).

(b) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not amend, repeal or otherwise
modify any provision in the Organizational Documents of the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries in any manner that would affect (or manage the
Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, with the intent to or in a manner
that would) adversely the rights thereunder or under the Organizational
Documents of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries of any
Indemnified Person to indemnification, exculpation and advancement except to
the extent required by applicable Law. Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, fulfill and honor any
indemnification, expense advancement or exculpation agreements between the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of its directors, officers or
employees existing immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



55

    

(c) To the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall indemnify any Indemnified Person against all
reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses), such amounts to be payable in advance upon request as provided in
this  _Section_ __ _ 6.10_, relating to the enforcement of such Indemnified
Persons rights under this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_ or under any charter, bylaw
or contract regardless of whether such Indemnified Person is ultimately
determined to be entitled to indemnification hereunder or thereunder.

(d) Parent and the Surviving Corporation will cause to be put in place, and
Parent shall fully prepay immediately prior to, and conditioned upon the
occurrence of, the Effective Time, "tail" insurance policies with a claims
reporting or discovery period of at least six (6) years from the Effective
Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the
Companys current insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers
liability insurance companies with terms and conditions no less favorable
than the current directors and officers liability insurance policies
maintained by the Company with respect to matters, acts or omissions existing
or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Parent may elect in its sole discretion to, but shall not be required to,
spend more than three hundred percent (300%) (the " _Cap Amount_ ") of the
last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof for the
six (6) years of coverage under such "tail" policy; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that if the cost of such insurance exceeds the Cap Amount, and Parent elects
not to spend more than the Cap Amount for such purpose, then Parent
shall purchase the greatest coverage available for the six year period for
the Cap Amount.

(e) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of
the Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or such
Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_. Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall not sell, transfer, distribute or otherwise dispose of any
of their assets or the assets of any Subsidiary in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to render Parent or the Surviving Corporation unable to
satisfy their obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_. The provisions of
this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_ are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, the parties and each Person entitled to indemnification or
insurance coverage or expense advancement pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _

Persons under this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_ are in addition to any rights such
Indemnified Persons may have under the Organizational Documents of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under any applicable contracts or Law.
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall pay all expenses, including
attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Person in enforcing
the indemnity and other obligations provided in this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_.

6.11 _Transaction Litigation_. In the event any Proceeding by any
Governmental Entity or other Person is commenced or, to the knowledge of the
Company or Parent, as applicable, threatened, that questions the validity or
legality of the Transactions or seeks damages in connection therewith ("

Parent, including requests for information in accordance with and subject to
the terms and conditions of _Section_ __ _ 6.7_, in connection with any
refinancing of any Indebtedness of the Company or Parent or any of their
respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Transactions. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 6.19_ shall require

foregoing arises from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct
of, or breach of this Agreement by, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) any breach by
the Company of its obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 6.19_ shall not, in
and of itself, constitute a breach for purposes of _Section_ __ _ 8.1(c)(B)_
or give rise to a failure of the condition precedent set forth in _Section_
__ _ 7.2(b)_ to be satisfied and (ii) Parent and Merger Sub each (A)
acknowledge and agree that neither the obtaining of financing nor any
refinancing of existing Indebtedness by any Person is a condition to the
Closing and (B) reaffirm their respective obligations to consummate the
Transactions in accordance with the terms of this Agreement irrespective and
independently of the availability of any financing or refinancing, subject to
the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _
7.1_ and _Section_ __ _ 7.2_.

9.4 _Rules of Construction_.

 

(a) Each of the parties acknowledges that it has been represented by counsel
of its choice throughout all negotiations that have preceded the execution of
this Agreement and that it has executed the same with the advice of said
independent counsel. Each party and its counsel cooperated in the drafting and
preparation of this Agreement and the documents referred to herein, and any
and all drafts relating thereto exchanged between the parties shall be deemed
the work product of the parties and may not be construed against any party by
reason of its preparation. Accordingly, any rule of law or any legal decision
that would require interpretation of any ambiguities in this Agreement
against any party that drafted it is of no application and is hereby expressly
waived.

 

(b) The inclusion of any information in the Company Disclosure Letter or
Parent Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed an admission or acknowledgment,
in and of itself and solely by virtue of the inclusion of such information in
the Company Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter, as applicable, that
such information is required to be listed in the Company Disclosure Letter or
Parent Disclosure Letter, as applicable, that such items are material to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as the case may be, or that such items have
resulted in a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. The headings, if any, of the individual sections of each of the Parent
Disclosure Letter and Company Disclosure Letter are inserted for convenience
only and shall not be deemed to constitute a part thereof or a part of this
Agreement. The Company Disclosure Letter and Parent Disclosure Letter are
arranged in sections corresponding to the Sections of this Agreement merely
for convenience, and the disclosure 

 



65

    

 of an item in one section of the Company Disclosure Letter or Parent
Disclosure Letter, as applicable, as an exception to a particular
representation or warranty shall be deemed adequately disclosed as an
exception with respect to all other representations or warranties to the
extent that the relevance of such item to such representations or warranties
is reasonably apparent, notwithstanding the presence or absence of an
appropriate section of the Company Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure
Letter with respect to such other representations or warranties or an
appropriate cross reference thereto, and for purposes of _Schedule 6.1_ of
this Company Disclosure Letter, any item disclosed in response to any
subclause of _Schedule 6.1_ shall be deemed to be disclosed in response to
each other subclause of _Schedule 6.1_ to the extent that the relevance of
such item to such subclause is reasonably apparent. 

(c) The specification of any dollar amount in the representations and
warranties or otherwise in this Agreement or in the Company Disclosure Letter
or Parent Disclosure Letter is not intended and shall not be deemed to be an
admission or acknowledgment of the materiality of such amounts or items, nor
shall the same be used in any dispute or controversy between the parties
to determine whether any obligation, item or matter (whether or not described
herein or included in any schedule) is or is not material for purposes of this
Agreement.

 

(d) All references in this Agreement to Annexes, Exhibits, Schedules,
Articles, Sections, subsections and other subdivisions refer to
the corresponding Annexes, Exhibits, Schedules, Articles, Sections,
subsections and other subdivisions of this Agreement unless expressly provided
otherwise. Titles appearing at the beginning of any Articles, Sections,
subsections or other subdivisions of this Agreement are for convenience only,
do not constitute any part of such Articles, Sections, subsections or other
subdivisions, and shall be disregarded in construing the language contained
therein. The words "this Agreement," "herein," "hereby," "hereunder" and
"hereof" and words of similar import, refer to this Agreement as a whole and
not to any particular subdivision unless expressly so limited. The words
"this Section," "this subsection" and words of similar import, refer only to
the Sections or subsections hereof in which such words occur. The word
"including" (in its various forms) means "including, without limitation."
Pronouns in masculine, feminine or neuter genders shall be construed to state
and include any other gender and words, terms and titles (including terms
defined herein) in the singular form shall be construed to include the
plural and vice versa, unless the context otherwise expressly requires.
Unless the context otherwise requires, all defined terms contained herein
shall include the singular and plural and the conjunctive and disjunctive
forms of such defined terms. Unless the context otherwise requires, all
references to a specific time shall refer to Central time. The word "extent"
in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree to which a subject or
other thing extends and such phrase shall not mean simply "if." The term
"dollars" and the symbol "$" mean United States Dollars. The table of contents
and headings herein are for convenience of reference only, do not constitute
part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or otherwise affect
any of the provisions hereof.

(e) In this Agreement, except as the context may otherwise require,
references to: (i) any agreement (including this Agreement), contract, statute
or regulation are to the agreement, contract, statute or regulation as
amended, modified, supplemented, restated or replaced from time to time (in
the case of an agreement or contract, to the extent permitted by the terms
thereof and, if applicable, by the terms of this Agreement); (ii) any
Governmental Entity includes any successor to that Governmental Entity; (iii)
any applicable Law refers to such applicable Law as amended, modified,
supplemented or replaced from time to time (and, in the case of statutes,
include any rules and regulations promulgated under such statute) and
references to any section of any applicable Law or other law include any
successor to such section; (iv) "days" mean calendar days; and (v) when
calculating the period of time within which, or following which, any act is to
be done or step taken pursuant to this Agreement, the date that is
the reference day in calculating such period shall be excluded (e.g., if an
act must be completed within two days of an event, if such event occurs on a
Tuesday, then such act must be completed by the end of the day on Thursday)
and if the last day of the period is a non-Business Day, the period in
question shall end on the next Business Day or if any action must be taken
hereunder on or by a day that is not a Business Day, then such action may be
validly taken on or by the next day that is a Business Day.

9.5 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, including via electronic means (such as Docusign, Adobe Sign,
photocopy or scan of an original signature, or otherwise), all of which

 



66

    

 shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective
when two (2) or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and
delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not
sign the same counterpart.

9.6 _Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement (together
with the Confidentiality Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and any
other documents and instruments executed pursuant hereto) constitutes the
entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings,
both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof. Except for the provisions of _Article_ __ _ III_ (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the rights of the former holders of Company Common
Stock, Company RSU Awards and/or Company Performance Share Awards to receive
the Merger Consideration), _Section_ __ _ 6.10_ (which from and after the
Effective Time are intended for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
the Persons referred to therein and by their respective heirs and
representatives), nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended
to or shall confer upon any Person other than the parties any right, benefit
or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of Parents or Merger Subs
Willful and Material Breach of this Agreement or intentional and knowing
fraud, then the Companys shareholders, acting solely through the Company,
shall be beneficiaries of this Agreement and shall be entitled to pursue any
and all legally available remedies, including equitable relief, and to seek
recovery of all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses of every
kind and nature, including reasonable attorneys fees; _provided_ , _however_
, that the rights granted pursuant to this sentence shall be enforceable only
by the Company, on behalf of the Company shareholders, in the Companys sole
discretion, it being understood and agreed such rights shall attach to such
shares of Company Stock and subsequently trade and transfer therewith and,
consequently, any damages, settlements, or other amounts recovered or
received by the Company with respect to such rights may, in the Companys
sole discretion, be (a) distributed, in whole or in part, by the Company to
the holders of shares of Company Common Stock of record as of any date
determined by the Company or (b) retained by the Company for the use and
benefit of the Company on behalf of its shareholders in any manner the Company
deems fit.

 

9.7 _Governing Law; Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 

(a) THIS AGREEMENT, AND ALL CLAIMS OR CAUSES OF ACTION (WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR
TORT) THAT MAY BE BASED UPON, ARISE OUT OF OR RELATE TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR
THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT, SHALL BE GOVERNED
BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT
GIVING EFFECT TO THE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW THEREOF.
NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, ALL MATTERS RELATING TO THE FIDUCIARY
OBLIGATIONS OF THE COMPANY BOARD AND THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF THE COMPANY OR
THE COMPANY BOARD (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE INTERPRETATION OF THE
COMPANYS CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS AND THE ABNEC) SHALL BE
GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF ALABAMA WITHOUT
REGARD TO THE CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH
PRINCIPLES WOULD DIRECT A MATTER TO ANOTHER JURISDICTION.

 

(b) THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY SUBMIT TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE COURT OF
CHANCERY OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE OR, IF THE COURT OF CHANCERY OF THE STATE
OF DELAWARE OR THE DELAWARE SUPREME COURT DETERMINES THAT, NOTWITHSTANDING
SECTION 111 OF THE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, THE COURT
OF CHANCERY DOES NOT HAVE OR SHOULD NOT EXERCISE SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION
OVER SUCH MATTER, THE SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE AND THE FEDERAL
COURTS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA LOCATED IN THE STATE OF DELAWARE SOLELY
IN CONNECTION WITH ANY DISPUTE THAT ARISES IN RESPECT OF THE INTERPRETATION
AND ENFORCEMENT OF THE PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE DOCUMENTS
REFERRED TO IN THIS AGREEMENT OR IN RESPECT OF THE TRANSACTIONS, AND HEREBY
WAIVE, AND

 



67

    

 AGREE NOT TO ASSERT, AS A DEFENSE IN ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING FOR
INTERPRETATION OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF OR ANY SUCH DOCUMENT THAT IT IS NOT
SUBJECT THERETO OR THAT SUCH ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING MAY NOT BE BROUGHT OR
IS NOT MAINTAINABLE IN SAID COURTS OR THAT VENUE THEREOF MAY NOT BE
APPROPRIATE OR THAT THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY SUCH DOCUMENT MAY NOT BE ENFORCED IN
OR BY SUCH COURTS, AND THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY AGREE THAT ALL CLAIMS WITH
RESPECT TO SUCH ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING SHALL BE HEARD AND DETERMINED
EXCLUSIVELY BY SUCH A DELAWARE STATE OR FEDERAL COURT. THE PARTIES HEREBY
CONSENT TO AND GRANT ANY SUCH COURT JURISDICTION OVER THE PERSON OF SUCH
PARTIES AND OVER THE SUBJECT MATTER OF SUCH DISPUTE AND AGREE THAT MAILING OF
PROCESS OR OTHER PAPERS IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING IN
THE MANNER PROVIDED IN _SECTION_ _9.3_ OR IN SUCH OTHER MANNER AS MAY BE
PERMITTED BY LAW SHALL BE VALID AND SUFFICIENT SERVICE THEREOF.

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT
OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (II) SUCH PARTY
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (III)
SUCH PARTY MAKES THE FOREGOING WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 9.7_.

9.8  _S_ _everability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect
the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or
provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If a final
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or
provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto
agree that the court making such determination shall have the power to limit
such term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases or to replace such
term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and
that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable
term or provision, and this Agreement shall be valid and enforceable as so
modified. In the event such court does not exercise the power granted to
it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or
unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision
that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other
purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term or provision.

9.9 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties (whether by
operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other
party. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment in
violation of this _Section_ __ _ 9.9_ shall be void.

 

9.10 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage, for
which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached by the
parties. Prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to  _Article_ __
_ VIII_, it is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions, or any other appropriate form of specific
performance or equitable relief, to prevent 

 



68

    

 breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in any court of competent jurisdiction, in each case in
accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 9.10_, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled under the terms of this Agreement at
law or in equity. Each party accordingly agrees (a) the non-breaching party
will be entitled to injunctive and other equitable relief, without proof of
actual damages; (b) the breaching party will not to raise any objections to
the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent
or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with,
the covenants and obligations of such party under this Agreement and will not
plead in defense thereto that there would be an adequate remedy at Law; and
(c) the breaching party agrees to waive any requirement that the non-breaching
party obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection
with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this _Section_
__ _ 9.10_, all in accordance with the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 9.10_.
If prior to the End Date, any party hereto brings an action to
enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof by
any other party, the End Date shall automatically be extended by such other
time period established by the court presiding over such action.

 

9.11 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties, by action
taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors at any time
before or after approval of this Agreement by the shareholders of the Company,
but, after any such approval, no amendment shall be made which by law would
require the further approval by such shareholders without first obtaining
such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties.

9.12  _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
Company and Parent may, by action taken or authorized by their respective
Boards of Directors, to the extent legally allowed:

 

(a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of
the other party hereunder;

 

(b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other
party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto; or

(c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the other
party contained herein.

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company or Parent in
exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall
any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
of any other right hereunder. No agreement on the part of a party to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid unless set forth in an instrument
in writing signed on behalf of such party.
