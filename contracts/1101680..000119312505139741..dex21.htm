Parent ("Merger Sub"), and Paradyne Networks, Inc., a Delaware corporation
(the "Company").



WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company have approved and declared advisable the merger of Merger Sub with and
into the Company (the "Merger") upon the terms and subject to the conditions
of this Agreement and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware (the "DGCL");



WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent and the Company have
determined that the Merger is in furtherance of and consistent with their
respective business strategies and is in the best interest of
their respective stockholders, and Parent has approved this Agreement and the
Merger as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub;



WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
intend that the Merger qualify as a reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Code");



WHEREAS, certain stockholders of the Company have executed and delivered to
Parent an irrevocable proxy and voting agreement (the "Company Voting
Agreement"), in substantially the form attached hereto as  _Exhibit A_ (with
such stockholders listed on Schedule A to the Company Voting Agreement), as an
inducement to Parent to enter into this Agreement;



WHEREAS, certain stockholders of Parent have executed and delivered to the

(with such stockholders listed on Schedule A to the Parent Voting Agreement),
as an inducement to the Company to enter into this Agreement; and



WHEREAS, certain executives of the Company have executed and delivered
to Parent a Consulting Agreement and Restrictive Covenant Agreement in
substantially the forms attached hereto as _Exhibits C_ and _D_ ,
respectively, as a further inducement to Parent to enter into this Agreement.



NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the
respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in
this Agreement and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto
agree as follows:



 

Article I

The Merger 



_Section 1.1_ _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with
the DGCL, Merger Sub, at the Effective Time, shall be merged with and into the
Company. As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of
Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving
corporation of the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation") and shall be a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent.

 _Section 1.2_ _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take
place as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than the first
business day after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions (excluding
conditions that, by their nature, cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date)
set forth in Article VI, unless this Agreement has been theretofore
terminated pursuant to its terms or unless another time or date is agreed to
in writing by the parties hereto (the actual date of the Closing being
referred to herein as the "Closing Date"). The Closing shall be held at the
offices of Latham and Watkins LLP, 12636 High Bluff Drive, Suite 400, San Diego,
California 92130, unless another place is agreed to in writing by the parties
hereto. As soon as practicable on or after the Closing Date, the parties
hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of
merger relating to the Merger (the "Certificate of Merger") with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware, in such form as required by, and
executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of, the DGCL (the date
and time of such filing, or if another date and time is agreed to in writing
by the parties hereto and is specified in such filing, such specified date and
time, being the "Effective Time").



_Section 1.3_ _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of
the Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time,
except as otherwise provided herein, all the property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of Merger Sub and the Company shall vest in the
Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of Merger Sub and
the Company shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.



_Section 1.4_ _Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws_. At the Effective Time,
(a) the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended in its entirety to contain the provisions set forth in the Certificate
of Incorporation of Merger Sub and (b) the Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation shall be amended in their entirety to contain the provisions set
forth in the Bylaws of Merger Sub, each as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and in each case until thereafter changed or amended as
provided therein or pursuant to applicable Law.



_Section 1.5_ _Directors and Officers of Surviving Corporation_. At the
Effective Time, the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be
the directors of Merger Sub, each to hold office in accordance with the
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. The
initial officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be the officers of Merger
Sub, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation
and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. 



Article II

Conversion of Securities; Exchange of Certificates



_Section 2.1_ _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holders of any of the following securities:



(a) _Conversion Generally_. Each share of common stock, par value $.001 per
share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares of Company
Common Stock to be canceled pursuant  



 

2  to Section 2.1(b)), shall be converted, subject to Section 2.2(e), into the
right to receive 1.0972 shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of common stock, par
value $.001 per share, of Parent ("Parent Common Stock"). All such shares of
Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each certificate
previously representing any such shares shall thereafter represent the right
to receive a certificate representing the shares of Parent Common Stock into
which such Company Common Stock was converted in the Merger. Certificates
previously representing shares of Company Common Stock shall be exchanged for
certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in
consideration therefor upon the surrender of such certificates in accordance
with the provisions of Section 2.2, without interest. No fractional share of
Parent Common Stock shall be issued, and in lieu thereof, a cash payment shall
be made pursuant to Section 2.2(e) hereof. 

---|--- 



(b) _Cancellation of Certain Shares_. Each share of Company Common Stock held
by Parent, Merger Sub, any wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub,
in the treasury of the Company or by any wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and
extinguished without any conversion thereof and no payment shall be made with
respect thereto.



(c) _Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $.001 per share, of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and be exchanged for one newly and validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.



(d) _Change in Shares_. If between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Parent
Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a
different class, by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination, exchange of shares or
other similar event or transaction, the Exchange Ratio shall be equitably
adjusted to reflect such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination, exchange of shares or other similar
event or transaction.



_Section 2.2_ _Exchange of Certificates_.



(a) _Exchange Agent_. As of the Effective Time, Parent shall irrevocably
deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with Computershare Trust Company or
another bank or trust company mutually agreeable to Parent and the Company
(the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Article II through the
Exchange Agent, certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable pursuant to Section 2.1 and cash in an amount sufficient to permit
payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.2(e) (such
certificates for shares of Parent Common Stock, together with cash in lieu of
fractional shares and any dividends or distributions with respect thereto,
being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund") in exchange for
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock. The Exchange Agent shall,
pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Parent Common Stock
contemplated to be issued pursuant to Section 2.1 and the cash contemplated to
be issued pursuant to Section 2.2(e) out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange
Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.



 

3 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall
instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate
or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the "Certificates") (i) a letter
of transmittal reasonably acceptable to the Company (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange
Agent and shall be in reasonable and customary form) and (ii) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for
certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock. Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such letter
of transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, and such other documents
as may be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
a certificate representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock
which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the shares of Company
Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate (after taking into
account all shares of Company Common Stock then held by such holder), cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and any dividends or other distributions
to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c), and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be
paid or accrued on any cash in lieu of fractional shares or on any unpaid
dividends and distributions payable to holders of Certificates. In the event
of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock which is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, a certificate representing
the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock may be issued to a
transferee if the Certificate representing such shares of Company Common
Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents
reasonably required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence
reasonably satisfactory that any applicable stock transfer taxes, if any,
have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the certificate representing
shares of Parent Common Stock, cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and
any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 2.2(c).



(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of Parent Common
Stock_. No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the
Effective Time with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after
the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented
thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any
such holder pursuant to Section 2.2(e), unless and until the holder of
such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to the effect of
escheat, tax or other applicable Laws, following surrender of any such
Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the certificates
representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor,
without interest, (i) promptly, the amount of any cash payable with respect to
a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to
such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment
date, the amount of dividends or other distributions, with a record date
after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date occurring
after surrender, payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common
Stock.



 

4 (d) _Further Rights in Company Common Stock_. All shares of Parent Common
Stock issued upon conversion of the shares of Company Common Stock in
accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid pursuant to Section
2.2(c) or Section 2.2(e)) shall be deemed to have been issued in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock.



(e)  _Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange
of Certificates, no dividend or distribution with respect to Parent Common
Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share and such
fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to any rights of
a stockholder of Parent. In lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock that would otherwise be issued, each stockholder that would have been
entitled to receive a fractional share of Parent Common Stock shall, upon
proper surrender of the Certificates, receive a cash payment equal to such
fraction multiplied by the average closing price of one share of Parent
Common Stock as reported on the Exchange for the five (5) trading days ending
on and including the second trading day preceding the Effective Time.



(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for nine (9)
months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and
any holders of Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with
this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for the shares of Parent
Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to
which they are entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and any dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled
pursuant to Section 2.2(c), in each case, without any interest thereon.



(g) _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Company
shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any such
shares of Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect
thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.



(h) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required
by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as
Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of Parent Common
Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which
the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and any dividends
or other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to
Section 2.2(c), in each case, without any interest thereon.



(i)  _Withholding_. Parent or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent or the
Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold under applicable Law with
respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by Parent or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of Company  



 

5  Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by
Parent or the Exchange Agent.



_Section 2.3_ _Appraisal Rights_. Pursuant to Section 262(b) of the DGCL, the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock shall not be entitled to appraisal
rights as a result of the Merger.



_Section 2.4_ _Stock Options_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of
Directors of the Company (the "Company Board") (or, if appropriate, any
committee thereof) shall take all actions necessary and appropriate to provide
that, at the Effective Time, all unexercised and unexpired options to purchase
Company Common Stock ("Company Options") then outstanding, under any stock
option plan of the Company or any other plan, agreement or arrangement (the
"Company Stock Option Plans"), whether or not then exercisable, shall be
assumed by Parent and, as so assumed, shall continue to have, and be subject
to, the same terms and conditions (including vesting schedule) as set forth
in the Company Stock Option Plan and any agreements thereunder immediately
prior to the Effective Time, except that (a) each Company Option shall be
exercisable (or shall become exercisable in accordance with its terms) for
that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the
number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of
such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the
Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent
Common Stock, (b) the per share exercise price for the shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed Company Option shall be equal to
the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of Company
Common Stock at which such Company Option was exercisable immediately prior to
the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest
whole cent, and (c) such assumed Company Option will be eligible to
participate in any "cashless exercise" or "same day sale" program to the
extent made available to the holders of Parent Options and to the extent
consistent with the terms of the Company Option agreements. The conversion of
any Company Options into options to purchase Parent Common Stock shall be made
so as not to constitute a "modification" of such Company Options within the
meaning of Sections 409A and 424 of the Code. As of the Effective Time,
Parent shall amend the Company Stock Option Plans to allow Parent to grant
awards under the terms of the Company Stock Option Plans (including the right
to grant incentive stock options) with respect to Parent Common Stock after
the Effective Time equal to the product of (i) the sum of (A) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock authorized for issuance under the Company Stock
Option Plans less (B) shares of Company Common Stock issued under the Company
Stock Option Plans prior to the Effective Time, less (C) shares of Company
Common Stock subject to outstanding Company Options, multiplied by (ii) the
Exchange Ratio; _provided_ , _however_ , such awards shall be made solely
to employees of the Company.



_Section 2.5_ _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company Board shall take all actions with respect to the Company Employee
Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP"), including, if appropriate, amending the
terms of the ESPP, that are necessary to (a) cause the ending date of the
Offering under the ESPP (as such term is defined therein) that is in effect as
of the date of this Agreement to occur on or before the last trading day prior
to the Effective Time, if the Effective Time is prior to the end of such
Offering, (b) cause all existing Offerings under the ESPP to terminate
immediately following the purchase on the earlier of the last trading day
prior to the Effective Time or the ending date of the Offering that is in
effect as  



 

6  of the date of this Agreement (such earlier date, the "Final Purchase
Date"), (c) suspend all future Offerings that would otherwise commence
under the ESPP following the Final Purchase Date and (d) cease all further
payroll deductions under the ESPP effective as of the Final Purchase Date. On
the Final Purchase Date, the Company shall apply the funds credited as of such
date under the ESPP within each participantÂ’s payroll withholding account to
the purchase of whole shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the
terms of the ESPP, which shares shall be treated in the manner described in
Section 2.1.



_Section 2.6_ _Warrants_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or,
if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall take all actions necessary and
appropriate to provide that, at the Effective Time, each warrant to purchase
shares of Company Common Stock (a "Company Warrant") then outstanding shall,
in accordance with the terms thereof, cease to represent a right to acquire
shares of Company Common Stock and automatically shall be converted, at the
Effective Time, without any action on the part of the holder thereof, into a
warrant to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock (as so converted, a
"Company Converted Warrant") and, as so converted, shall continue to have, and
be subject to, the same terms and conditions as set forth in any agreements
thereunder immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that, as of the
Effective Time, (a) each Company Converted Warrant shall be exercisable (or
shall become exercisable in accordance with its terms) for that number of
whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the number of
shares that were issuable upon exercise of such Company Warrant immediately
prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to
the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, and (b) the per
share exercise price for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of such Company Converted Warrant shall be equal to the quotient
determined by dividing the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock at
which such Company Warrant was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective
Time by the Exchange Ratio, rounded to the nearest whole cent.



_Section 2.7_ _Restricted Stock_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall take all actions
necessary and appropriate to provide that, if any shares of Company Common
Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time are
unvested or are subject to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other
condition providing that such shares may be forfeited or repurchased upon any
termination of the stockholdersÂ’ employment, directorship or other
relationship with the Company (and/or any Subsidiary of the Company), under
the terms of any agreement with the Company (and/or any Subsidiary of the
Company) that does not by its terms provide that such repurchase option, risk
of forfeiture or other condition lapses upon consummation of the Merger, then
the shares of Parent Common Stock issued upon the conversion of such shares
in the Merger shall continue to be unvested and subject to the same repurchase
options, risks of forfeiture or other conditions following the Effective Time,
and the certificates representing such shares of Parent Common Stock
may accordingly be marked with appropriate legends noting such repurchase
options, risks of forfeiture or other conditions.



 

7 Article III

Representations and Warranties of the Company



Except as set forth in a disclosure memorandum delivered by the Company to
Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure
Memorandum"), which identifies exceptions by specific Section references (
_provided_ , that any matter disclosed in any section of the Company
Disclosure Memorandum shall be considered disclosed for other sections of the
Company Disclosure Memorandum, but only to the extent such matter on its
face would be reasonably expected to be pertinent to a particular section of
the Company Disclosure Memorandum in light of the disclosure made in such
section), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent as follows:



_Section 3.1_ _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_. The Company is
a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the State of Delaware. Each Subsidiary of the Company has been duly
organized, and is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization, as the case may be.
The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has the requisite power and authority
and all necessary governmental approvals to own, lease and operate its
properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except
for such powers, authorities and approvals that would not, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business, and is in good
standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned,
leased or operated by it or the nature of its business makes such
qualification, licensing or good standing necessary, except for such
failures to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. Section 3.1
of the Company Disclosure Memorandum sets forth a true and complete list of
all of the Subsidiaries of the Company. Except as set forth in Section 3.1 of
the Company Disclosure Memorandum and shares of other Subsidiaries, none of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries holds an Equity Interest in any other
person.



_Section 3.2_ _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Corporate Books and
Records_. The copies of the CompanyÂ’s Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, as amended (the "Company Certificate"), and Amended and
Restated Bylaws, as amended (the "Company Bylaws"), that are listed as
exhibits to the CompanyÂ’s Form 10-K filed with the SEC for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2004 (the "2004 Form 10-K") are complete and correct copies
thereof as in effect on the date hereof. The Company is not in violation of
any of the provisions of the Company Certificate or the Company Bylaws. True
and complete copies of all minute books of the Company have been made
available by the Company to Parent.



_Section 3.3_ _Capitalization_.



(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 80,000,000 shares
of Company Common Stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value
$.001 per share, of the Company ("Company Preferred Stock"). As of July 5,
2005, (i) 46,876,088 shares of Company Common Stock (other than treasury
shares) were issued and outstanding, all of which were validly issued and
fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, (ii) no shares of
Company Common Stock were held in the treasury of the Company or by its
Subsidiaries,  



 

8  (iii) 14,058,641 shares of Company Common Stock were issuable (and such
number was reserved for issuance) upon exercise of Company Options outstanding
as of such date, and (iv) 1,008,065 shares of Company Common Stock were
issuable (and such number was reserved for issuance) upon exercise of Company
Warrants outstanding as of such date. As of such date, no shares of Company
Preferred Stock were issued or outstanding. All capital stock or other equity
securities of the Company have been issued in compliance with applicable
federal and state securities laws. 

---|--- 



(b) Except for Company Options to purchase not more than 14,058,641 shares of
Company Common Stock, Company Warrants to purchase not more than 1,008,065
shares of Company Common Stock and arrangements and agreements set forth in
Section 3.3 of the Company Disclosure Memorandum, there are no options,
warrants or other rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments of any
character to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound relating to the issued
or unissued capital stock or other Equity Interests of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for such
capital stock or other Equity Interests, or obligating the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to issue or sell any shares of its capital stock or other
Equity Interests, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for such
capital stock of, or other Equity Interests in, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. Since December 31, 2004, the Company has not issued any shares
of its capital stock, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for such
capital stock or other Equity Interests, other than those shares of capital
stock reserved for issuance as set forth in this Section 3.3 or Section 3.3 of
the Company Disclosure Memorandum. The Company has provided Parent with a
true and complete list, as of the date hereof, of the prices at which
outstanding Company Options may be exercised under the Company Stock Option
Plans, the number of Company Options outstanding at each such price and
the vesting schedule of the Company Options. All shares of Company Common
Stock subject to issuance under the Company Options and the Company Warrants,
upon issuance on the terms and conditions specified in the instruments
pursuant to which they are issuable, will be duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights.



(c) Except for the Company Voting Agreement and as set forth in Section 3.3 of
the Company Disclosure Memorandum, there are no outstanding contractual

repurchase, redemption or disposition of, or containing any right of first
refusal with respect to, (iv) requiring the registration for sale of, or (v)
granting any preemptive or antidilutive right with respect to, any shares of
Company Common Stock or any capital stock of, or other Equity Interests in,
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Except as set forth in Section 3.3 of
the Company Disclosure Memorandum, each outstanding share of capital stock of
each Subsidiary of the Company is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid,
nonassessable and free of preemptive rights and is owned, beneficially and of
record, by the Company or another of its Subsidiaries, free and clear of all
security interests, liens, claims, pledges, options, rights of first refusal,
agreements, limitations on the CompanyÂ’s or such other of its SubsidiaryÂ’s
voting rights, charges and other encumbrances of any nature whatsoever. There
are no outstanding contractual obligations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to provide funds to, or make any investment (in the form of a
loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in, any of its Subsidiaries or any
other person, other than guarantees by the Company of any indebtedness or
other obligations of any wholly-owned Subsidiary.



 

9 (d) The Company does not have outstanding any bonds, debentures, notes or
other obligations the holders of which have the right to vote (or convertible
into or exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with the
stockholders of the Company on any matter. The Company has not adopted a
stockholder rights plan. 



(e) Except as set forth in Section 3.3 of the Company Disclosure Memorandum,
none of the Merger or other transactions contemplated hereby will result in an
acceleration of vesting, or modification of vesting terms, with respect to any
Company Options.

authorized by all necessary corporate action and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of the Company and no stockholder votes are necessary

declared that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the Merger) are advisable, (ii) approved and adopted this Agreement
and (iii) resolved to recommend (subject to Section 5.3(a)) that the

and no such state takeover Law is applicable to the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, the
restrictions on business combinations contained in Section 203 of the DGCL.

others any right of termination, vesting, amendment, acceleration or
cancellation of, or result in the creation of a lien or other encumbrance on
any property or asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to,
any Contract, Company Permit or other instrument or obligation, except, with
respect to clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such conflicts, violations,
consents, approvals, breaches, losses, defaults or other occurrences which
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. 

---|--- 



(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company does not, and
the performance of this Agreement by the Company will not, require any
consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification
to, any Governmental Entity or any other person, except (i) under the Exchange
Act, the Securities Act, applicable Blue Sky Law, the HSR Act, the rules
and regulations of the Exchange and the filing and recordation of the
Certificate of Merger as required by the DGCL and (ii) where failure to obtain
such consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings
or notifications, would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect.



_Section 3.6_ _Permits; Compliance With Law_. The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries is in possession of all authorizations, licenses, permits,
certificates, approvals and clearances of any Governmental Entity necessary
for the Company and each of its Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate its
properties or to carry on its respective businesses substantially in the
manner described in the Company SEC Filings filed prior to the date hereof and
substantially as it is being conducted as of the date hereof (the "Company
Permits"), and all such Company Permits are valid, and in full force and
effect, except where the failure to have, or the suspension or cancellation
of, or failure to be valid or in full force and effect of, any of the Company
Permits would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect. None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is in conflict with, or
in default or violation of, (a) any Law applicable to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or by which any property or asset of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is bound or affected or (b) any Company Permits, except in
each case for any such conflicts, defaults or violations that would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.



_Section 3.7_ _SEC Filings; Financial Statements_.



(a) The Company has timely filed all registration statements, prospectuses,
forms, reports, definitive proxy statements, schedules and documents required
to be filed by it under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case
may be, since December 31, 2001 (collectively, the "Company SEC Filings").
Each Company SEC Filing (i) as of the time it was filed, complied or, if filed
subsequent to the date hereof, will comply, in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be,
and (ii) did not, at the time it was filed, or, if filed subsequent to the
date hereof, will not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were or will be made, not misleading.



 

11 (b) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each case,
any notes thereto) contained in the Company SEC Filings was, or will be,
prepared in accordance with GAAP applied (except as may be indicated in the
notes thereto and, in the case of unaudited quarterly financial statements, as
permitted by Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act) on a consistent basis
throughout the periods indicated (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto), and each presented, or will present, fairly the consolidated
financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company and
the consolidated Subsidiaries of the Company as of the respective dates
thereof and for the respective periods indicated therein (subject, in the case
of unaudited statements, to normal year-end adjustments which did not and
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect).
The books and records of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries have been,
and are being, maintained in accordance with applicable material legal and
accounting requirements, except for such failures as would not, individually
or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.



(c) Except as and to the extent set forth on the consolidated balance sheet of
the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004
included in the 2004 Form 10-K (the "Company Balance Sheet"), none of the
Company or any of its consolidated Subsidiaries has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent
or otherwise) that would be required to be reflected on a balance sheet or in
notes thereto prepared in accordance with GAAP, except for liabilities or
obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business since December 31,
2004 that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect.



(d) Each required form, report and document containing financial statements
that the Company has filed with or furnished to the SEC since July 31, 2002
was accompanied by the certifications required to be filed or furnished by
the CompanyÂ’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer pursuant to
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations promulgated under
such Act or the Exchange Act (collectively, the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act"), and at
the time of filing or submission of each such certification, such
certification (i) was true and accurate and complied with the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, (ii) did not contain any qualifications or exceptions to the matters
certified therein, except as otherwise permitted under the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, and (iii) has not been modified or withdrawn. As of the date of this
Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its officers has received notice
from any Governmental Entity questioning or challenging the accuracy,
completeness, content, form or manner of filing or furnishing of such
certifications. The CompanyÂ’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Sections 13a-14(c) and 15d-14(c) of the Exchange Act) effectively enable
the Company to comply with, and the appropriate officers of the Company to
make all certifications required under, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Company is
in compliance in all material respects with the applicable listing
and corporate governance rules and regulations of The Nasdaq Stock Market.



_Section 3.8_ _Brokers_. No broker, finder or investment banker (other than
the Company Financial Advisor) is entitled to any brokerage, finderÂ’s or other
fee or commission in connection with the Merger based upon arrangements made
by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company has
heretofore made available to Parent a true and complete copy of all agreements
between the Company and the Company Financial Advisor  



 

12  pursuant to which such firm would be entitled to any payment relating to the
Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement.



_Section 3.9_ _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since December 31,
2004, except as specifically contemplated by, or as disclosed in, this
Agreement or Section 3.9 of the Company Disclosure Memorandum, the Company and
each of its Subsidiaries has conducted its businesses in the ordinary
course consistent with past practice and, since such date, there has not been
any Material Adverse Effect or an event or development that would,

Company, nor to the knowledge of the Company, any other person or entity, has
any commitment to establish, modify, change or terminate any Company Benefit
Plan, other than with respect to a modification, change or termination
required by ERISA or the Code. With respect to each Company Benefit Plan,

in accordance with its terms and all applicable Laws, including ERISA and the
Code, and contributions required to be made under the terms of any of the
Company Benefit Plans as of the date of this Agreement have been timely made
or, if not yet due, have been properly reflected on the most recent
consolidated balance sheet filed or incorporated by reference in the Company
 



 

13  SEC Filings prior to the date of this Agreement. With respect to the Company
Benefit Plans, no event has occurred and, to the knowledge of the Company,
there exists no condition or set of circumstances in connection with which
the Company could be subject to any material liability (other than for routine
benefit liabilities) under the terms of, or with respect to, such Company
Benefit Plans, ERISA, the Code or any other applicable Law.

Plan that could result in liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
(iii) each Company Benefit Plan can be amended, terminated or otherwise
discontinued after the Effective Time in accordance with its terms, (iv) no
suit, administrative proceeding, action or other litigation has been brought,
or to the knowledge of the Company is threatened, against or with respect to
any such Company Benefit Plan, including any audit or inquiry by the IRS or
United States Department of Labor (other than routine benefits claims), (v) no
Company Benefit Plan is a multiemployer pension plan (as defined in Section
3(37) of ERISA) ("Multiemployer Plan") or other pension plan subject to Title

not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.



(d) No amount that could be received (whether in cash or property or the
vesting of property), as a result of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, by any employee, officer or director of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries who is a "disqualified individual" (as such
term is defined in proposed Treasury Regulation  



 

14  Section 1.280G-1) under any Company Benefit Plan could be characterized as
an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code).



(e) Except as required by Law, no Company Benefit Plan provides any of the
following retiree or post-employment benefits to any person medical,
disability or life insurance benefits. No Company Benefit Plan is a voluntary
employee benefit association under Section 501(a)(9) of the Code. The Company
and each ERISA Affiliate are in material compliance with (i) the requirements
of the applicable health care continuation and notice provisions of the
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended, and

all applicable Laws respecting labor, employment, fair employment practices,
terms and conditions of employment, workersÂ’ compensation, occupational
safety, plant closings, and wages and hours, except where the failure to so

Effect. Except as set forth in Section 3.11(a) of the Company Disclosure
Memorandum, none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party to
any collective-bargaining agreement or other labor union contract applicable
to persons employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and no
collective-bargaining agreement or other labor union contract is being
negotiated by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. There is no labor
dispute, strike, slowdown or work stoppage against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened that may
interfere in any respect that would have a Material Adverse Effect with the
respective business activities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The
Company has not engaged in any unfair labor practices within the meaning of
the National Labor Relations Act or the Railway Labor Act. To the CompanyÂ’s
knowledge, no employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is in any
material respect in violation of any term of any employment contract, non-
disclosure agreement, non-competition agreement, or any restrictive covenant
to a former employer relating to the right of any such employee to be
employed by the Company or such Subsidiary because of the nature of the
business conducted or presently proposed to be conducted by it or to the use
of trade secrets or proprietary information of others.

of the Company Disclosure Memorandum, none of the execution and delivery of

deemed to be automatically amended to contain in substitution for such
comparable provisions such less restrictive provisions, or to omit such
restrictive provisions, as the case may be, and in connection with the

35  receipt of a Superior Proposal (A) the Company has complied with its
obligations under this Section 5.5, (B) the Company Board reasonably
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
(which may be its current outside legal counsel), that failure to take such

advisor.

shall as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 48 hours) advise
Parent of any request for information with respect to any Acquisition Proposal
or of any Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry, proposal, discussions
or negotiation with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, the terms and
conditions of such request, Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, proposal,
discussion or negotiation, and the Company shall, within 48 hours of the

details (including material amendments) with respect to the information
previously provided by the Company in connection with the Acquisition

written materials received by it with respect thereto. The Company shall
promptly provide to Parent any non-public information concerning it provided
to any other person in connection with any Acquisition Proposal, which was
not previously provided to Parent. With respect to any Acquisition Proposal
that constitutes a Superior Proposal, during the five (5) day period referred

parties from complying with Rule 14d-9 or 14e-2 under the Exchange Act.



_Section 5.6 _ _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.



(a) The Company and Parent shall use their reasonable best efforts to (i)

Entity any consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations or
orders required to be obtained or made by the Company or Parent or any of
their respective Subsidiaries, or to avoid any action or proceeding by any
Governmental Entity (including, without limitation, those in connection with
the HSR Act), in connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including, without limitation, the Merger, and (iii) make all necessary
filings, and thereafter make any other required submissions, with respect to
this Agreement and the Merger required under (A) the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act, and any other applicable federal or state securities Laws, (B)
the HSR Act, and (C) any other applicable Law; _provided_ , that the Company
and Parent shall cooperate with each other in connection with the making of
 



 

36  all such filings, including, if requested, by providing copies of all such
documents to the non-filing party and its advisors prior to filing and,
if requested, to accept all reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested in connection therewith. The Company and Parent shall furnish to

respective Subsidiaries to use, reasonable best efforts to obtain any third
party consents (i) necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement, (ii) required to be disclosed in
the Company Disclosure Memorandum or the Parent Disclosure Memorandum, as
applicable, or (iii) required to prevent a Material Adverse Effect with
respect to the Company or Parent from occurring prior to or after the
Effective Time. In the event that either party shall fail to obtain any third
party consent described in the first sentence of this Section 5.6(b), such
party shall use its reasonable best efforts, and shall take any such actions
reasonably requested by the other party hereto, to minimize any adverse effect
upon the Company and Parent, their respective Subsidiaries, and their
respective businesses resulting, or which could reasonably be expected to
result after the Effective Time, from the failure to obtain such consent.



_Section 5.7_ _Certain Notices_. From and after the date of this Agreement
until the Effective Time, each party hereto shall promptly notify the other
party hereto of (a) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event that
would be likely to cause any condition to the obligations of any party to
effect the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
not to be satisfied, or (b) the failure of the Company or Parent, as the case
may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement which would
reasonably be expected to result in any condition to the obligations of any
party to effect the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement not to be satisfied; _provided, however_ , that the delivery of any
notice pursuant to this Section 5.8 shall not cure any breach of any
representation or warranty requiring disclosure of such matter prior to the
date of this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available
hereunder to the party receiving such notice.



_Section 5.8_ _Public Announcements_. The press release announcing the
execution of this Agreement, if any, shall be issued only in such form
as shall be mutually agreed upon by the Company and Parent and each of the
Company and Parent shall consult with, and obtain the consent of, the other
party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) before issuing any

the Merger or this Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or
make any such public statement prior to consulting with and obtaining the
prior consent of the other party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed); _provided_ , that a party may, without consulting with or obtaining
the prior consent of the other party, issue such press release or make such
public statement as may be required by applicable Law or by any listing
agreement with a national securities exchange or automated quotation system to
which it is a party, if such party has used reasonable best efforts to consult
with the other party and to obtain such other partyÂ’s consent, but has been
unable to do so in a timely manner.



 

37 _Section 5.9_ _Exchange Listing_. Parent shall promptly prepare and submit to

Plan") in which employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries ("Company
Employees") participate after the Effective Time, for purposes of determining
vesting and entitlement to benefits, including for Company Options, severance
benefits and vacation entitlement, service with the Company (or predecessor
employers to the extent the Company provides past service credit) shall be
treated as service with Parent; _provided,_ that such service shall not be
recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication
of benefits or to the extent that such service was not recognized under the
applicable Company Benefit Plan. Such service also shall apply for purposes
of satisfying any waiting periods, evidence of insurability requirements, or
the application of any pre-existing condition limitations.



(b) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in
this Section 5.10 with respect to employees are included for the sole benefit
of the respective parties hereto and shall not create any right (i) in any
other person, including, without limitation, any employees, former employees,
any participant in any Company Benefit Plan or Parent Benefit Plan or
any beneficiary thereof or (ii) to continued employment with the Company or
Parent. After the Effective Time, nothing contained in this Section 5.10 shall
interfere with ParentÂ’s right to amend, modify or terminate any Company
Benefit Plan or Parent Benefit Plan or to terminate the employment of any
employee of the Company or Parent for any reason.



(c) The Parent Board, or a committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall
adopt a resolution in advance of the Effective Time providing that the

the rules and regulations thereunder, "Section 16") of Parent Common Stock in
exchange for shares of Company Common Stock, and of options to purchase Parent
Common Stock upon assumption and conversion by Parent of options to purchase
Company Common Stock, in each case pursuant to the transactions
contemplated hereby, is intended to be exempt from liability pursuant to
Section 16. The Company Board, or a committee of non-employee directors
thereof, shall adopt a resolution in advance of the Effective Time providing
that the disposition by any officer or director of the Company who is a
covered person of the Company for purposes of Section 16 of Company Common
Stock in exchange for shares of Parent Common Stock, and options to purchase
Parent Common Stock upon assumption and conversion by Parent of options to
purchase Company Common Stock, in each case pursuant to the transactions
contemplated hereby, is intended to be exempt from liability pursuant to
Section 16.



(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall amend the Paradyne
Corporation Involuntary Severance Benefit Plan, and use its reasonable best
efforts to amend all other severance plans and policies (excluding any written
employment agreements), in each case in a manner reasonably acceptable to
Parent to provide that any severance payable under such  



 

38  plans and policies shall be offset by any notice or amount of damages in
lieu of notice applicable under the Worker Adjustment Retraining and
Notification Act or other similar applicable state law. Parent shall provide
or cause the Surviving Corporation to provide that if any Company Employee is
terminated on or after the Effective Time, such Company Employee shall be
entitled to severance equal to the greater of (i) the amount of severance
such Company Employee would have been entitled to receive under the severance
benefits and policies set forth in Section 3.11 of the Company Disclosure
Memorandum (as amended to the extent provided above) had such Company
Employee been involuntarily terminated as of the Effective Time and (ii) the
amount of severance such Company Employee would be entitled to receive under
the applicable severance policies and practices of Parent or its
subsidiaries, as applicable, assuming (for purposes of calculating their
severance entitlement hereunder) that their employment with Parent commenced
as of the Effective Time.

Indemnified Persons shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force
and effect and be honored by the respective parties and their successors,
without any amendment thereto, for a period of six (6) years after the
Effective Time. A "Company Indemnified Person" shall mean any individual who
on or prior to the Effective Time was a director, officer, trustee, fiduciary,

the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer,
trustee, partner, fiduciary, employee or agent of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or
enterprise, unless such amendment or modification is required by applicable
Law.



(b) Parent shall obtain a prepaid director and officer insurance policy (the
"DandO Insurance") prior to the Effective Time, which DandO Insurance policy shall
be reasonably acceptable to the Company and shall provide the Company
Indemnified Persons with coverage that is no less favorable than the
CompanyÂ’s existing policy (a true and complete copy of which has been
previously provided to Parent) for an aggregate period of six (6) years with
respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the
Effective Time, including, without limitation, in respect of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Parent shall maintain such policy in full
force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.



(c) In the event Parent (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper
provisions shall be made so that such continuing or surviving corporation or
entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 5.11.



(d) The obligations under this Section 5.11 shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Company Indemnified
Person to whom this Section 5.11 applies or the heirs and representatives of

party beneficiaries of this Section 5.11).

_Section 7.2_ _Effect of Termination_.



(a) _Limitation on Liability_. In the event of termination of this Agreement
by either Parent or the Company as provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement
shall forthwith become  



 

45  void and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Parent or
the Company or their respective Subsidiaries, officers or directors except
(i) with respect to the confidentiality obligations of Section 5.4, Section
5.9, this Section 7.2 and Article VIII and (ii) with respect to any
liabilities or damages incurred or suffered by a party as a result of the
willful breach by the other party of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or other agreements set forth in this Agreement.



(b) _Termination Fee._ The Company shall pay Parent a termination fee of
$2,000,000 (the "Termination Fee") in immediately available funds in the
event that this Agreement is terminated solely as follows: (i) if the Company
shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(e); (ii) if Parent
shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d); or (iii) if
(A) Parent shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(f), or
either party shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(b) or
7.1(i)(1), and, at any time after the date of this Agreement and before the
termination of this Agreement, an Acquisition Proposal with respect to the
Company shall have been publicly made, proposed or communicated and not bona
fide withdrawn and (B) within twelve (12) months following the termination of
this Agreement, the Company consummates such Acquisition Proposal or enters
into a binding agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal which is
subsequently consummated. Any Termination Fee payable under this provision
shall be payable as liquidated damages to compensate Parent for the damages
Parent will suffer if this Agreement is terminated under the circumstances set
forth in this Section 7.2(b), which damages cannot be determined with
reasonable certainty. It is specifically agreed that the Termination Fee
represents liquidated damages and not a penalty. __



(c) _All Payments_. Any payment required to be made pursuant to Section
7.2(b)(i) shall be paid prior to or contemporaneously with, and shall be a
pre-condition to the effectiveness of, termination of this Agreement pursuant
to Section 7.1(e). Any payment required to be made pursuant to Section
7.2(b)(ii) shall be paid not later than two (2) business days after the date
of termination. Any payment required to be made pursuant to Section
7.2(b)(iii) shall be paid prior to or contemporaneously with, and shall be a
pre-condition to the effectiveness of, consummation of the Acquisition
Proposal. All payments under this Section 7.2 shall be made by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an account designated by Parent. The
Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 7.2 are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that,
without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay any amount due pursuant to
this Section 7.2 and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit
which results in a judgment against the Company for the fee set forth in this
Section 7.2, the Company shall pay to Parent its costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees and expenses) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on the amount of the fee at the prime rate of
Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.



_Section 7.3_ _Amendment_. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, this
Agreement may be amended by the parties, by action taken or authorized by
their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval of
the matters presented in connection with the Merger by the stockholders of
Parent and the Company; _provided_ , that after any such approval, no
amendment shall be made that by Law requires further approval by the CompanyÂ’s
or  



 

46  ParentÂ’s stockholders, as the case may be, without such further approval.
This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed
on behalf of each of the parties.



_Section 7.4 _ _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party
hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations
or other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of the other parties contained herein or in
any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) waive compliance by the other
parties with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein; _provided,
however_ , that after any approval of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by the stockholders of any party, there may not be, without further
approval of such stockholders, any extension or waiver of this Agreement or
any portion thereof which, by Law or in accordance with the rules of the
Exchange, requires further approval by such stockholders. Any such extension
or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed
by the party or parties to be bound thereby, but such extension or waiver or
failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement
or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to,
any subsequent or other failure.



_Section 7.5_ _Fees and Expenses_. Subject to Section 7.2(a) hereof, all
expenses incurred by the parties hereto shall be borne solely and entirely by
the party which has incurred the same (including, but not limited to, fees and
expenses of counsel, accountants, investment bankers and other advisors); 
_provided, however_ , that each of Parent and the Company shall pay one-half
of (a) the expenses related to printing, filing and mailing the Registration
Statement and the Joint Proxy/Prospectus and all SEC and other regulatory
filing fees incurred in connection with the Registration Statement and the
Joint Proxy/Prospectus, and (b) the filing fees related to any filings under
the HSR Act.

its terms contemplates performance after the Effective Time.

_Section 8.5 _ _Headings_. The headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.



_Section 8.6_ _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the  



 

53  economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that transactions
contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.



_Section 8.7_ _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Exhibits,
Parent Disclosure Memorandum and Company Disclosure Memorandum and the other
documents delivered pursuant hereto) and the Confidentiality Agreement (other
than the disclaimer of any representations and warranties contained therein
which is superseded hereby) constitute the entire agreement of the parties and
supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral,
between the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter
hereof, and except as otherwise expressly provided herein, are not intended to
confer upon any other person any rights or remedies hereunder.



_Section 8.8_ _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties
hereto, in whole or in part (whether by operation of Law or otherwise),
without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any attempt to
make any such assignment without such consent shall be null and void.



_Section 8.9_ _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto and their respective
successors and assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied,
other than pursuant to Sections 5.11 and 5.17, is intended to or shall confer
upon any other person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever
under or by reason of this Agreement.



_Section 8.10_ _Mutual Drafting_. Each party hereto has participated in the
drafting of this Agreement, which each party acknowledges is the result of
extensive negotiations between the parties.



_Section 8.11_ _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Trial by
Jury_.



(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to laws that may be applicable
under conflicts of laws principles.



(b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees that
any suit, action or other legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or any of the agreements delivered in connection herewith or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be brought in state
courts of the State of Delaware (or, if such courts do not have jurisdiction
or do not accept jurisdiction, in the United States District Court located in
the State of Delaware), (ii) consents to the jurisdiction of any such court
in any such suit, action or proceeding, and (iii) waives any objection that
such party may have to the laying of venue of any such suit, action or
proceeding in any such court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final
judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by Law. Each party to this  



 

54  Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided
for notices in Section 8.2. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right
of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted
by Law.



(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS
VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION
8.11(c).



_Section 8.12_ _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.



_Section 8.13_ _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage could occur in the event that any of the provisions
of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms
or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall
not object to the granting of such relief on the basis that an adequate remedy
exists at law and shall not insist upon the posting of any bond as a
condition to the granting of any such relief, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
