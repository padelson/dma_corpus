AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

  

  

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of November
7, 2013, is among Essilor International SA, a French societe anonyme (the "
_Parent_ "), GWH Acquisition Sub Inc., a Rhode Island corporation and an
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent (the " _Merger Sub_ "), and
Costa Inc., a Rhode Island corporation (the " _Company_ ").

  

  

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of the Parent, the Merger Sub and
the Company have determined that it would be in the best interests of their
respective companies and their shareholders for the Parent to acquire the
Company upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement;

  

  

WHEREAS, the acquisition of the Company shall be effected through a merger
(the " _Merger_ ") of the Merger Sub with and into the Company in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement and the Rhode Island Business Corporation Act
(the " _RIBCA_ "), as a result of which the Company shall become an indirect
wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent; and

  

  

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and as
a condition and inducement to the Parent's willingness to enter into this
Agreement, the shareholders of the Company listed on _Schedule A_ have entered
into a Shareholders Agreement, dated as of the date of this Agreement, in the
form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the " _Company Shareholder Agreement_ "),
pursuant to which such shareholders have, among other things, agreed to vote
all of the shares of voting capital stock of the Company that such
shareholders own in favor of the Company Voting Proposal, on the terms and
subject to the conditions provided for in the Company Shareholder Agreement;

  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the
Parent, the Merger Sub and the Company agree as follows:

  

  

ARTICLE I

  


 

  

 _THE MERGER_

  

  

1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, and in accordance with the RIBCA, the Merger Sub shall merge
with and into the Company at the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, the
separate corporate existence of the Merger Sub shall cease and the Company
shall continue as the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ")
and shall succeed to and assume all the rights and obligations of the Merger
Sub in accordance with the RIBCA.

  

  

1.2 _Closing_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at
9:00 a.m., Eastern Time, on a date to be specified by the parties (and in any
event within three business days) after the satisfaction or (to the extent
permitted by applicable Law) waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII
(other than those that by their terms cannot be satisfied until the time of
the Closing but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of such conditions), at
the offices of Edwards Wildman Palmer LLP, 111 Huntington Avenue, Boston, MA
02199, or at such other time, date or place agreed to in writing by the Parent
and the Company. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this
Agreement as the " _Closing Date_."   

1.3 _Effective Time_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, as soon as practicable on or after the Closing Date, the
articles of merger or other appropriate documents (in any such case, the "
_Articles of Merger_ ") shall be duly prepared, executed and acknowledged by
the parties in accordance with the relevant provisions of the RIBCA and filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Rhode Island (the " _Rhode Island
Secretary of State_ "). The Merger shall become effective at such date and
time as the Parent and the Company may agree and as set forth in the Articles
of Merger that shall be filed with the Rhode Island Secretary of State. The
date and time at which the Merger becomes effective as set forth in the
Articles of Merger is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Effective
Time_."

  

  

1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in
Section 7-1.2-1005 of the RIBCA. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the properties,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall
vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of
the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of
the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

1.5 _Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws_. The Articles of Incorporation of
the Company as in effect on the date of this Agreement shall, by virtue of the
Merger, be amended at the Effective Time in its entirety to read in
substantially the form as set forth in _Exhibit B_ until thereafter amended in
accordance with the terms thereof or the RIBCA. The By-laws of the Merger Sub
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the By-laws of
the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the
terms thereof, the Articles of Incorporation of the Company or the RIBCA.

  

  

1.6 _Directors and Officers_. The directors of the Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time will be the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation, and the officers of the Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, in
each case until their successors are elected and qualified. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall cause each member of the Company Board to
execute and deliver a letter effectuating his or her resignation as a director
of the Company (and, to the extent requested by the Parent, the Company's
Subsidiary) effective upon the Effective Time.

  

    

ARTICLE II

  


 

  

 _CONVERSION OF SECURITIES_

  

2.1 _Effect of Merger on Capital Stock_.

  

  

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holder of any shares of the capital stock of the Company or
capital stock of the Merger Sub:

  

  

(i) each share of the Merger Sub's capital stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of the same class of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation;

  

  

(ii) each Class A Common Share, $1.00 par value per share (" _Class A Common
Share_ "), and Class B Common Share, $1.00 par value per share (" _Class B
Common Share_ "), of the Company (collectively, the " _Company Common Shares_
") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is
owned by the Parent, the Merger Sub or the Company or any direct or indirect
wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent, the Merger Sub or the Company,
including all Company Common Shares held by the Company as treasury shares,
shall automatically be cancelled, and no payment shall be made with respect
thereto; and

  

  

(iii) each Company Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than Company Common Shares to be cancelled pursuant
to clause (ii) above) shall be automatically cancelled and extinguished and be
converted into and become the right to receive $21.50 in cash (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all such Company Common Shares
shall no longer be outstanding and shall be automatically cancelled and shall
cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate which immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented any such Company Common Shares (each, a "
_Certificate_ ") and each holder of any such Company Common Shares held in
book entry form immediately prior to the Effective Time (" _Book Entry Shares_
") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.1(a)(iii) upon
surrender of such Certificate or such Book Entry Shares in accordance with
Section 2.2, without interest and subject to any applicable withholding rights
in accordance with Section 2.2(g).

  

  

(b) In connection with the Merger, each outstanding option to purchase Company
Common Shares (" _Company Stock Options_ ") and each award consisting of
Company Common Shares subject to forfeiture, repurchase, redemption, right of
first refusal or other restrictions, whether granted under a Company Stock
Plan or otherwise (other than Company Stock Options) (" _Company Restricted
Stock Awards_ "), shall be treated in the manner set forth in Section 6.11.

  

    

2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_. The procedures for exchanging outstanding
Company Common Shares for the Merger Consideration pursuant to the Merger are
as follows:

  

  

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Parent shall select a
bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent
(the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the holders of Company Common Shares to receive,
on terms reasonably acceptable to the Company, for the benefit of the holders
of Company Common Shares, the aggregate Merger Consideration to which the
holders of the Company Common Shares shall be entitled after the Effective
Time upon surrender of Certificates or Book Entry Shares. The Parent shall
deposit such aggregate Merger Consideration with the Paying Agent at or prior
to the Closing (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Payment
Fund_ ").

  

  

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event
more than three business days thereafter), the Parent shall instruct the
Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or of Book
Entry Shares, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to a Certificate shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificate to the Paying Agent and, in the case of
Book Entry Shares, delivery shall be effected and risk of loss and title shall
pass only upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of
transmittal, and which letter of transmittal shall be in such form and have
such other reasonable provisions as the Parent may specify) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates and Book Entry
Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Surrender of any Book Entry
Shares shall be effected in accordance with the Paying Agent's customary
procedures with respect to securities represented by book entry. Upon
surrender of a Certificate or Book Entry Shares for cancellation to the Paying
Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and properly
executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying
Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book Entry Shares shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor an amount of cash equal to the Merger
Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section
2.1(a)(iii), and the Certificate or Book Entry Shares so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company
Common Shares that is not registered in the stock transfer records of the
Company, payment may be made to a person other than the person in whose name
the Certificate or Book Entry Shares so surrendered is or are registered if,
in the case of a Certificate, such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer, or, in the case of Book Entry
Shares, the person in whose name such Book Entry Shares are registered shall
have delivered to the Paying Agent instruments of transfer in such form as the
Paying Agent may require in accordance with its customary procedures for the
transfer for securities represented by book entry, and, in each case, the
person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required
by reason of the payment to a person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Book Entry Shares or establish to the satisfaction of the
Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate and all Book Entry Shares
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the amount of cash, without interest,
into which the Company Common Shares formerly represented by such Certificate
or Book Entry Shares have been converted pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(iii). No
interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of
any Certificate or Book Entry Shares.

  

    

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Shares_. The Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender of a Certificate or Book Entry Shares in
accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of the capital
stock of the Company formerly represented by such Certificate or Book Entry
Shares. Upon the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on
the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of the capital
stock of the Company that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates or Book Entry Shares are
presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason,
they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

  

  

(d) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates or Book Entry Shares for
six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered by the Paying Agent to
the Parent or the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any holder of a
Certificate or Book Entry Shares who has not theretofore complied with this
Article II shall thereafter look only to the Parent or the Surviving
Corporation for payment of the Merger Consideration (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar laws), but shall have no greater rights
against the Parent or the Surviving Corporation than may be accorded to
general unsecured creditors of the Parent or the Surviving Corporation under
applicable law.

  

  

(e) _No Liability_. None of the Parent, the Merger Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in
respect of any cash from the Payment Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any
Certificate or any Book Entry Shares have not been surrendered prior to the
date on which the Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book
Entry Shares would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity, any such cash in respect of such Certificate or Book
Entry Shares shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

  

  

(f) _Investments of Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Payment Fund in (i) direct obligations of the United States of
America, (ii) obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United
States of America is pledged to provide for payment of all principal and
interest, (iii) commercial paper obligations receiving the highest rating from
either Moody's Investor Services, Inc. or Standard and Poor's, a division of The
McGraw-Hill Companies, or (iv) money market funds investing solely in a
combination of the foregoing, or a combination thereof, as directed by and for
the benefit of the Parent; _provided_ , however, that no gain or loss thereon
shall affect the amounts payable hereunder. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to and be the property of the
Parent.

  

  

(g) _Withholding Rights_. The Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to
be deducted and withheld by any of them with respect to the making of such
payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "),
or any other applicable law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and
paid over to the appropriate Taxing Authority by the Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the
Company Common Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent. In the
event that the Parent does not assign its rights hereunder (in accordance with
Section 9.5) to a U.S. entity, the foregoing withholding rights shall be
limited to amounts that would have been withheld had the Parent assigned such
rights to a U.S. entity.

  

    

2.3 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Paying Agent shall pay to such holder the Merger Consideration
required pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(iii), in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
holder thereof with such assurances as the Parent or Paying Agent, in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of the Merger
Consideration, may require of the holder of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate.

Company SEC Document filed on or after the date of this Agreement, (b) any
disclosures that contain cautionary, predictive or forward-looking statements,
(c) any disclosures set forth in any section of a Company SEC Document
entitled "risk factors" or constituting "forward-looking statements" or any

statements and notes thereto included in any such Company SEC Document) or
(ii) as set forth herein or in the disclosure schedule delivered by the
Company to the Parent on or before the date of this Agreement (the " _Company
Disclosure Schedule_ "). The Company Disclosure Schedule shall be arranged in
paragraphs corresponding to the numbered and lettered paragraphs contained in
this Article III and the disclosure in any paragraph or in any section of the
Company Disclosure Schedule or any Company SEC Document shall be deemed
disclosure with respect to any other section of this Agreement to which the
relevance of such item is reasonably apparent on its face. The phrase "made
available to the Parent" shall be deemed to include Company filings and
documents that are publicly available on the SEC's EDGAR system. Each
statement of the Company contained in this Article III with respect to a CAD
Subsidiary that relates to facts, circumstances or conditions in existence
during a time period prior to and including the date hereof shall be deemed
made as to facts, circumstances or conditions in existence during the time
period specified in such representation or warranty up to and including the
closing of the CAD Sale, and each representation and warranty of the Company
contained in this Article III with respect to a CAD Subsidiary that relates to
facts, circumstances or conditions in existence on the date hereof shall be
deemed made as to facts, circumstances or conditions in existence immediately
prior to the closing of the CAD Sale.

qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in
each jurisdiction listed in Section 3.1 of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
which jurisdictions constitute the only jurisdictions in which the character

makes such qualification necessary, except for such failures to be so
organized, qualified or in good standing that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "
_Company Material Adverse Effect_ " means any change, event, circumstance,
development or effect (any such item, a " _Change_ ") that, individually or in
the aggregate with all other Changes occurring or existing prior to the
determination of a Company Material Adverse Effect, has or would reasonably be
expected to have, a material adverse effect on (i) the business, assets,
liabilities, capitalization, financial condition or results of operations of
the Company and its Subsidiary, taken as a whole, or (ii) the ability of the
Company to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; _provided_ that, solely for purposes of clause (i) above, none
of the following, and no effect arising out of or resulting from the
following, in each case to the extent arising after the date of this
Agreement, shall constitute (in and of itself) a Company Material Adverse
Effect or be taken into account in determining whether a "Company Material
Adverse Effect" has occurred or may, would or could occur (except, in the case
of clauses (A), (B), (E) or (I), where the Company or its Subsidiary are
disproportionately affected relative to other comparable persons operating in
the industries in which the Company and its Subsidiary operate): (A) any
changes in national or world economic or political conditions or the national
or foreign financial, credit or securities markets; (B) any changes that
affect generally the sunglass industry; (C) any outbreak or escalation of
hostilities or war or any act of sabotage or terrorism, or any escalation or
worsening of such acts, or any earthquakes, hurricanes, tornados, other wind
storms, floods or other natural disasters, except in the event, and only to
the extent, of any damage or destruction to or losses of the Company's or its
Subsidiary's physical properties; (D) any action taken or not permitted to be
taken pursuant to the express terms and conditions of this Agreement or taken
or requested not to be taken at the express written direction or with the
express written consent of Parent; (E) any changes in GAAP or any laws,
statutes, ordinances, codes, rules, regulations, decrees and orders of any
Governmental Entity (each a " _Law_ ") or interpretation or application of the
foregoing; (F) any failure, in and of itself, by the Company to meet any
internal or external projections, forecasts or revenue or earnings predictions
or guidance for any period (it being understood that the facts or occurrences
giving rise or contributing to such failure may be deemed to constitute, or be
taken into account in determining whether there has been, or would reasonably
be expected to be, a Company Material Adverse Effect); (G) the suspension of
trading in securities on the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ Global
Market or a decline in the price, or a change in the trading volume, of the
Class A Common Shares on the NASDAQ Global Market (it being understood, in
each case, that the facts or occurrences giving rise or contributing to such
decline or change may be deemed to constitute, or be taken into account in
determining whether there has been, or would reasonably be expected to be, a
Company Material Adverse Effect); (H) any shareholder litigation or threatened
shareholder litigation, in each case, arising from allegations of a breach of
fiduciary duty or similar obligations in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger; (I) any shutdown of
the United States government, the failure of the United States government to
meet its debt obligations or the downgrading of the United States credit
rating; or (J) the execution or announcement of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, including any Change
that is directly attributable to the identity or business of the Parent or its
Subsidiaries, including any impact on relationships, contractual or otherwise,
with customers, suppliers, or employees.

  

    

(b) The Company has made available to the Parent complete and accurate copies
of the Articles of Incorporation and By-laws of the Company. The Company is
not in violation of any of the provisions of its Articles of Incorporation or
in material violation of any provisions of its By-laws.

  

  

(c) The Company has made available to the Parent true and correct copies of
the minutes (or, in the case of minutes that have not yet been finalized, a
brief summary of the meeting) of all meetings of shareholders, the Company
Board and each committee of the Company Board since January 1, 2011 and with
respect to the acquisition by the Company or its Affiliates of Native Eyewear,
Inc. and Costa Del Mar Sunglasses, Inc.; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company has not made available to the Parent any minutes (or portions thereof)
reflecting any consideration or discussion of this Agreement, the Merger, the
other transactions contemplated hereby or any related matters.

  

  

3.2 _Capitalization_.

5.2 _Target Cash Amount_.

  

  

(a) Subject to the following provisions of this Section 5.2, the Company shall
as of the Closing Date have net cash equal to or greater than the Target Cash
Amount. For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, the
parties acknowledge that the only failure to achieve the Target Cash Amount
that shall constitute a breach of this Section 5.2(a) is one that (i) is
caused by the Company failing to comply with any of the covenants set forth in
Section 5.1 and (ii) constitutes a material ($4.25 million or more) shortfall
(" _Material Shortfall_ ") of the Target Cash Amount, _provided_ that a
Material Shortfall caused by third-party actions or events violating any of
the covenants set forth in Section 5.1 will constitute a breach of this
Section 5.2(a) if the Company had knowledge, as of the date of this Agreement,
of such third-party action or event, and did not disclose such matter in
detail in a Company Disclosure Schedule. The parties acknowledge that the
foregoing shall not limit the Parent's rights with respect to violations by
the Company of Section 5.1.

  

  

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Target Cash Amount_ " shall mean, as of
the Closing Date, either (x) a net cash amount equal to $41.5 million
(assuming a Closing Date of December 31, 2013 or earlier), or (y) the net cash
amounts reflected in Section 5.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule for
Closing Dates subsequent to December 31, 2013, in both cases reflecting the
calculations set forth in Section 5.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
_provided_ that to the extent costs are identified in Section 5.2(b) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule as being scheduled to be paid at or subsequent to
the Closing, then the Target Cash Amount shall be reduced accordingly. In
addition, to the extent that the Parent consents in writing to any Company
action or inaction otherwise prohibited by Section 5.1 and is informed in
writing by the Company prior to providing such consent that the consequence of
such consented action or inaction will be a specific reduction in the Target
Cash Amount, then the Target Cash Amount shall be deemed reduced by such
consented amount.

  

    

(c) The Company shall provide the Parent with reports regarding the Target
Cash Flow as described in Section 5.2(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

  

  

(d) The parties acknowledge that the foregoing shall not limit the Parent's
rights with respect to violations of the covenants set forth in Section 5.1
that do not cause a Material Shortfall.

  

  

5.3 _Confidentiality_. The parties acknowledge that the Parent and the
Company have previously executed a confidentiality agreement, dated as of May
16, 2013, as amended (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which
Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms.

  

  

ARTICLE VI

  


 

  

 _ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS_

  

6.1 _No Solicitation_.

  

  

(a) Except as set forth in this Section 6.1, the Company shall not, nor shall
it authorize or permit its Subsidiary or any of its or their respective
directors, officers or employees to, and it shall use reasonable best efforts
to cause the Company's and its Subsidiary's Affiliates, investment bankers,
attorneys, accountants or other advisors, agents or representatives (such
directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants, other advisors, agents and representatives, collectively, "
_Representatives_ ") not to, directly or indirectly:

  

  

(i) solicit, initiate, propose, knowingly encourage or knowingly take any
other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal or
offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal, including (A) approving any transaction under Section
7-5.2-4 of the Rhode Island Business Combination Act, (B) approving any person
becoming an "interested shareholder" under Section 7-5.2-4 of the Rhode Island
Business Combination Act and (C) amending or granting any waiver or release
under any standstill or similar agreement with respect to any Company Common
Shares (except for any portion of any such standstill or similar agreement
that restricts the ability of a person to privately communicate an Acquisition
Proposal to the Company, the Company Board or any committee thereof); or

  

  

(ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any communications,
discussions or negotiations regarding, furnish to any person any information
or data with respect to, knowingly assist or participate in any effort or
attempt by any person with respect to, or otherwise knowingly cooperate in any
way with, any Acquisition Proposal (other than to advise such person of the
Company's obligations under this Section 6.1).

  

    

Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the receipt of the Company Shareholder
Approval (the " _Specified Time_ "), the Company may, in response to a bona
fide, unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal (that has not been withdrawn)
made or received after the date of this Agreement, in each case that did not
result from a breach by the Company of this Section 6.1, (x) contact the
person or group of persons who has made such Acquisition Proposal in order to
clarify terms for the sole purpose of the Company Board informing itself about
such Acquisition Proposal in order to assess whether such proposal is
reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and (y) if the Company Board
reasonably determines in good faith after consultation with outside counsel
and the Financial Advisor or another nationally recognized independent
financial advisor that such Acquisition Proposal is reasonably likely to lead
to a Superior Proposal and that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board under applicable
Law, (1) furnish information or data with respect to the Company to the person
making such Acquisition Proposal and its Representatives pursuant to a
customary confidentiality agreement not less restrictive of the other party
than the Confidentiality Agreement (a copy of which shall be provided to the
Parent within 48 hours of being fully executed) ( _provided_ that such
confidentiality agreement shall not be required to restrict a person from
privately communicating an Acquisition Proposal to the Company, the Company
Board or any committee thereof, and _provided_ _further_ that such
confidentiality agreement and any related agreements shall not include any
provision calling for any exclusive right to negotiate with such party or
having the effect of otherwise prohibiting the Company from complying with any
provisions of this Section 6.1) and (2) participate in discussions or
negotiations with such person and its Representatives regarding such
Acquisition Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any
violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 6.1(a) by any
director, officer or employee of the Company or its Subsidiary, whether or not
such person is purporting to act on behalf of the Company or otherwise, shall
be deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.1(a) by the Company.

  

  

(b) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall:

  

  

(i) except as set forth in this Section 6.1(b), withhold, withdraw, qualify or
modify, or propose to any third party to withhold, withdraw, qualify or
modify, in a manner adverse to the Parent or the Merger Sub, the approval or
recommendation by the Company Board or any such committee of this Agreement or
the Merger;

  

  

(ii) cause or permit the Company to enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement,
merger agreement or similar agreement constituting or relating to, or that
could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (other than
a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 6.1(a) entered into in the
circumstances referred to in Section 6.1(a)); or

  

  

(iii) adopt, approve or recommend, or propose to adopt, approve or recommend,
any Acquisition Proposal.

  

    

Notwithstanding the foregoing, _provided_ the Company shall not have breached
in a material respect its obligations under Section 6.1(a), the Company Board
may withdraw or modify the recommendation by the Company Board or any
committee thereof of this Agreement or the Merger if:

  

  

(A) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside counsel and the Financial Advisor or another nationally recognized
independent financial advisor, that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board to the
shareholders of the Company either (1) based upon a material development or
change that impacts the Company (other than an Acquisition Proposal) that was
neither known to, nor reasonably foreseeable by, the Company Board or
management of the Company or its Subsidiary as of or prior to the date hereof
(it being agreed that the results of the introduction of new or modified
products or the results of sales or marketing initiatives (including any
increase in sales as a result thereof whether to new or existing customers)
are reasonably foreseeable and shall not be considered a material development
or change in circumstances) (such material development or change in
circumstances, an " _Intervening Event_ ") or (2) the Company Board determines
in good faith after consultation with its outside counsel and the Financial
Advisor or another nationally recognized independent financial advisor that
the Company has received an Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a Superior
Proposal, but in each case only at a time that is prior to the Specified Time
and is after 11:59 pm, New York City time, on the fourth business day
following the Parent's receipt of written notice (an " _Adverse Recommendation
Notice_ ") advising the Parent that the Company Board desires to withdraw or
modify the recommendation (and the manner and timing in which it intends to do
so, and in the case of an Intervening Event, specifying the reasons therefor
in reasonable detail) (such four business day period, the " _Notice Period_
"); and

  

  

(B) the Company provides the Parent with a reasonable opportunity to make
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement and negotiates in
good faith with the Parent with respect thereto during the Notice Period, in
each case as would enable the Company Board or committee thereof to conclude
that (1) the Intervening Event is no longer a basis for any Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or (2) the Acquisition Proposal that was determined to
be a Superior Proposal is no longer a Superior Proposal.

  

  

Any material changes to the financial terms or any material change to other
material terms of such Superior Proposal occurring prior to the Company
Board's effecting a Company Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this
Section 6.1(b) shall require the Company to provide to the Parent a new
Adverse Recommendation Notice and a new Notice Period and to comply with the
requirements of this Section 6.1(b) with respect to each such Adverse
Recommendation Notice, except that the references to the "fourth business day"
shall be deemed to be to the "second business day." Any Company Adverse
Recommendation Change shall not change the approval of this Agreement or any
other approval of the Company Board, including in any respect that would have
the effect of causing any state (including Rhode Island) corporate takeover
statute or other similar statute to be applicable to the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, including the Merger. Nothing in this Section
6.1 (but subject to the provisions of Section 8.1(d)(ii), if applicable) shall
be deemed to (A) permit the Company to take any action described in clauses
(ii) or (iii) of the first sentence of this Section 6.1(b) or (B) limit the
Company's obligation to call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company
Meeting, regardless of whether the Company Board has withdrawn or modified its
recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger.

  

    

(c) The Company shall promptly advise the Parent orally, with written
confirmation to follow within 48 hours, of any Acquisition Proposal or any
request for nonpublic information in connection with any Acquisition Proposal,
or any inquiry with respect to or that could reasonably be expected to lead to
any Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any such
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry and the identity of the person making any such
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry. The Company shall (i) keep the Parent
reasonably informed, on a prompt basis, of the status and details (including
any change to the terms) of any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry and (ii)
provide to the Parent as soon as practicable (and in any event within 48
hours) after receipt or delivery thereof copies of all material correspondence
and other material written material sent or provided to the Company or its
Representatives, including those provided by electronic mail, from any third
party in connection with any Acquisition Proposal or sent or provided by the
Company or its Representatives to any third party in connection with any
Acquisition Proposal. Contemporaneously with providing any information to a
third party in connection with any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, the
Company shall furnish a copy of such information to the Parent.

  

  

(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall restrict the Company from issuing a "stop,
look and listen" communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act or taking or disclosing a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 or 14e-2(a)
under the Exchange Act, or otherwise making disclosure to comply with
applicable Law; _provided_ , that any such disclosure that constitutes a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change shall be subject to Section 6.1(b). For
the avoidance of doubt, a factually accurate public statement that describes
the receipt of an Acquisition Proposal and the operation of this Agreement
with respect thereto (without including such a reaffirmation of the
recommendation of the Company Board of this Agreement) shall not be deemed a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change.

  

  

(e) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiary and its and their
Representatives to, cease immediately all communications, discussions and
negotiations regarding any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be
expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal.

  

  

(f) Except as set forth in Section 6.1(a)(i)(C), the Company agrees to enforce
or cause to be enforced each confidentiality, "standstill" or similar
agreement to which the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company is a party at
the request of the Parent, including by seeking specific performance of, or
injunctive or other equitable relief under, any such agreements, provided that
any expenses incurred by the Company in connection with such enforcement shall
reduce the Target Cash Amounts.

  

    

(g) For purposes of this Agreement:

  

  

" _Acquisition Proposal_ " means (i) any inquiry, proposal or offer for a
merger, consolidation, dissolution, sale of substantial assets, tender offer,
exchange offer, recapitalization, share exchange or other business combination
however effected involving the Company or its Subsidiary, (ii) any liquidation
or dissolution (or the adoption of a plan or liquidation or dissolution) of
the Company or any recapitalization or declaration of an extraordinary
dividend (whether in cash or other property) by the Company, (iii) any
proposal for the issuance by the Company or its Subsidiary of over 20% of its
equity securities, (iv) any proposal or offer to acquire in any manner,
directly or indirectly, over 20% of the equity securities or consolidated
total assets of the Company and its Subsidiary, in each case other than the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (v) any
exclusive, long term license of Intellectual Property of the Company and its
Subsidiary to any third party if such license would be material to the Company
and its Subsidiary, taken as a whole, or (vi) any combination of the
foregoing.

  

  

" _Superior Proposal_ " means any unsolicited, bona fide written proposal made
by a third party which, if consummated, would result in such third party
owning a majority of the equity securities of the Company or all or
substantially all of the assets of the Company, pursuant to a tender or
exchange offer, a merger, consolidation, share exchange, other business
combination however to be effected or a sale of its assets, (i) on terms which
the Company Board determines in its good faith judgment (after consultation
with outside counsel and the Financial Advisor or another nationally
recognized independent financial advisor) to be more favorable from a
financial point of view to the holders of Company Common Shares than the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, taking into
account (A) all the terms and conditions of such proposal and the implications
(with respect to financial, legal, regulatory and other matters) thereof on
the Company, (B) the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including any
proposal by the Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement), (C) the identity
of the person making such proposal and (D) the anticipating timing for
completion of such proposal and (ii) that is reasonably capable of being
completed on the terms proposed, taking into account all financial,
regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal, including the nature of
any financing arrangements made or to be undertaken by the third party as part
of such proposal.

  

  

6.2 _Proxy Statement_. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the
execution of this Agreement, and not later than 30 calendar days after the
date hereof, the Company, in cooperation with the Parent, shall prepare and
file with the SEC the Proxy Statement. The Company shall respond to any
comments of the SEC or its staff as promptly as practicable and shall cause
the Proxy Statement to be mailed to its shareholders on or prior to the fifth
business day after the resolution of any such comments or, if the SEC staff
informs the Company that it does not intend to review the Proxy Statement, on
or prior to the fifth business day following such tenth calendar day. The
Company shall notify the Parent promptly upon the receipt of any comments from
the SEC or its staff or any other government officials and of any request by
the SEC or its staff or any other government officials for amendments or
supplements to the Proxy Statement and shall supply the Parent with copies of
all correspondence between the Company or any of its representatives, on the
one hand, and the SEC or its staff or any other government officials, on the
other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement. The Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause all documents that it is responsible for
filing with the SEC or other regulatory authorities under this Section 6.2 to
comply in all material respects with all applicable requirements of Law (it
being understood that the Company shall not be responsible for any information
furnished solely by the Parent or any of its Affiliates for use in any such
documents). Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing or mailing the
Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any
comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company (i) shall provide the
Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document or
response and (ii) shall consider in good faith all comments reasonably
proposed by the Parent. Whenever any event occurs which is required to be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Parent or the
Company, as the case may be, shall promptly inform the other of such
occurrence and cooperate in filing with the SEC or its staff or any other
government officials, and/or mailing to shareholders of the Company, such
amendment or supplement. The Parent shall cooperate with the Company and
promptly provide the Company with any information it reasonably requests so
that the Company may fulfill its obligations under this Section 6.2.

  

    

6.3 _Nasdaq Quotation_. The Company agrees to use reasonable best efforts to
continue the quotation of the Class A Common Shares on The Nasdaq Stock Market
during the term of this Agreement.

  

  

6.4 _Access to Information_. The Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiary and the Company's and its Subsidiary's Representatives to, afford
to the Parent and its Representatives reasonable access during normal business
hours and upon reasonable prior notice, during the period prior to the
Effective Time, to all of the Company's and its Subsidiary's properties,
books, records, contracts, commitments and personnel and shall furnish the
Parent all financial, operating and other data and information as the Parent
may reasonably request, and during such period the Company shall furnish
promptly to the Parent a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement
and other document filed or received by it during such period pursuant to the
requirements of federal or state securities laws. Unless it is required by
Law, the Parent will hold any such information that is nonpublic in confidence
in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. The Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to secure for the Company access to and copies of the
workpapers of its independent public accountants. No information or knowledge
obtained in any investigation pursuant to this Section 6.4 or otherwise shall
affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty contained in the
Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate
the Merger. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated
to provide such access or information if the Company determines, in its
reasonable judgment, that doing so would (a) violate applicable Law or a
contract or obligation of confidentiality owing to a third-party, (b)
jeopardize the protection of an attorney-client privilege, (c) expose the
Company to risk of liability for disclosure of sensitive or personal
information, or (d) require invasive environmental sampling (it being
understood, in case of clauses (a), (b) and (c), that the parties shall use
their reasonable best efforts to cause such access or information to be
provided in a manner that would not result in such jeopardy, violation or
exposure).

  

    

6.5 _Shareholders Meeting_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with
Article VIII, the Company, acting through the Company Board, shall take all
actions in accordance with applicable Law, its Articles of Incorporation and
By-laws and the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market to promptly and duly fix a
record date for, call, give notice of, convene and hold as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, and not later than
the 40th calendar day immediately following the date of the mailing of the
Proxy Statement absent any legal restraint that prevents such action, the
Company Meeting for the purpose of considering and voting upon the Company
Voting Proposal. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject to Section 6.1, the Company agrees that its obligations pursuant to
this Section 6.5 shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal,
public disclosure or communication to the Company or any other person of any
Acquisition Proposal. Subject to Section 6.1, the Company Board shall
recommend adoption of the Company Voting Proposal by the shareholders of the
Company and include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement. Except to the
extent the Company Board has effected a Company Adverse Recommendation Change,
the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from its
shareholders proxies in favor of the Company Voting Proposal and shall use
reasonable best efforts to secure the vote of the shareholders of the Company
required by the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market or the RIBCA to obtain such
approvals. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the Company, after consulting with the Parent and considering in
good faith Parent's recommendation, may, adjourn or postpone the Company
Meeting to the extent necessary to ensure that any required supplement or
amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the Company's shareholders (or
that the information set forth therein is publicly available for a reasonable
period of time so as to allow shareholders to become aware of such
information) or, if as of the time for which the Company Meeting is originally
scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement), there are insufficient
affirmative votes to duly authorize the Company Voting Proposal. If as of the
time for which the Company Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in
the Proxy Statement), there are insufficient affirmative votes to duly
authorize the Company Voting Proposal, the Company shall, if requested to do
so in writing by the Parent, adjourn or postpone the Company Meeting for up to
30 days. The parties agree that the affirmative vote for adoption of the
Company Voting Proposal by the holders of a majority of the shares outstanding
on the record date for the meeting of the Company's shareholders (the "
_Company Meeting_ ") to consider the Company Voting Proposal, of (i) the Class
A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, voting together as a single class,
and (ii) the Class B Common Stock, voting as a separate class (clauses (i) and
(ii) together, the " _Required Company Shareholder Vote_ "), is the only vote
of the holders of any class or series of the Company's capital stock or other
securities necessary for the adoption of this Agreement and for the
consummation by the Company of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except as may otherwise be required by Law.

  

    

6.6 _Legal Conditions to the Merger_.

  

  

(a) Subject to the terms hereof, including Section 6.6(b), the Company and the
Parent shall each use its reasonable best efforts to (i) take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate
with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective, and satisfy all conditions to, the transactions
contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable, (ii) as promptly as
practicable, obtain from any Governmental Entity or any other third party any
consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations, or orders
required to be obtained or made by the Company or the Parent or any of their
Subsidiaries in connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
(iii) as promptly as practicable (and, in the case of the Pre-Merger
Notification and Report Form filed pursuant to the HSR Act, within 15 business
days after the date hereof), make all necessary filings, and thereafter make
any other required submissions, with respect to this Agreement and the Merger
required under (A) the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and any other
applicable federal or state securities laws, (B) the HSR Act and any related
governmental request thereunder, and (C) any other applicable law and (iv)
execute or deliver any additional instruments reasonably necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the
purposes of, this Agreement. The Company and the Parent shall cooperate with
each other in connection with the making of all such filings (including, in
the case of filings, providing copies of all such documentation to the non-
filing party and its advisors prior to filing and considering all reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested in connection therewith), and shall
use their respective reasonable best efforts to furnish to each other all
information that may be reasonably required to effectuate the taking of such
actions (including all information required to be included in the Proxy
Statement) in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parent and
the Company agree that nothing contained in this Section 6.6(a) shall modify
or affect their respective rights and responsibilities under Section 6.6(b).

  

  

(b) Subject to the terms hereof, the Parent and the Company agree, and shall
cause each of their respective Subsidiaries, to cooperate and to use their
respective reasonable best efforts to obtain any government clearances or
approvals required for Closing under the HSR Act, the Sherman Antitrust Act,
as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as
amended, and any other federal, state or foreign law or, regulation or decree
designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions for the purpose or effect
of monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively " _Antitrust Laws_ "),
and to respond to any government requests for information under any Antitrust
Law, and to contest and resist any action, including any legislative,
administrative or judicial action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent) that restricts, prevents or prohibits the
consummation of the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The parties hereto will consult and cooperate with one another,
and consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with any
filings, analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments,
opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto
in connection with proceedings under or relating to any Antitrust Law. The
Parent, in consultation with the Company, shall take the lead in communicating
with any Governmental Entity and developing and executing strategy for
responding to any investigation or other inquiry by any Governmental Entity
under the HSR Act or other applicable Antitrust Law. Notwithstanding the
foregoing sentence, except as prohibited by Applicable Law, each of the Parent
and the Company shall keep the other party and/or its counsel informed of any
substantive communication received by such party from, or given by such party
to any Governmental Entity, in each case regarding any of the transactions
contemplated hereby; and permit the other party and/or its counsel to review
any substantive communication given by it to, and consult with each other in
advance of any meeting or conference with any such Governmental Entity, and
(to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity) give the other party
and/or its counsel the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings
and conferences. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
neither the Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall be under any obligation to
take any action that would be likely to adversely affect the business of the
Company and its Subsidiary, taken as a whole, or of the Parent or any of its
Affiliates.

  

    

(c) The Company shall confer with the Parent as reasonably requested by the
Parent concerning operational matters (to the extent permitted by applicable
Law) and promptly advise the Parent orally and in writing of any change or
event having, or which, insofar as reasonably can be foreseen, could have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each
party shall promptly provide to the other (or its counsel) copies of all
filings made by such party with any Governmental Entity in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

(d) Neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates shall make any settlement
offers or, except as directed by the Parent, negotiate any consent decree or
consent order with any Governmental Entity relating to the Merger or any of
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Parent alone shall
be responsible for making any settlement offers and negotiating any consent
decree or consent order with any Governmental Entity relating to the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent shall
promptly communicate to the Company if any Governmental Entity suggests or
proffers any settlement, consent decree or consent order, including the
material terms thereof (and any written documentation provided by such
Governmental Entity reflecting the same). The Parent may accept or reject any
settlement, consent decree or consent order proposed by any Governmental
Entity in its sole discretion which would be likely to adversely affect the
business of the Company and its Subsidiary, taken as a whole, or of the Parent
or any of its Affiliates.

  

  

(e) Without limiting the generality of Section 6.2(a), if any "fair price" or
"control share acquisition" or "anti-takeover" statute, or other similar
statute or regulation or any state "blue sky" statute shall become applicable
to the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or by the Company Shareholder Agreement, the Company and the Company Board
shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably necessary
so that the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and thereby, and
otherwise act to minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

  

  

(f) Each of the Company and the Parent shall give (or shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to give) any notices to third parties, and use, and
cause their respective Subsidiaries to use, their reasonable best efforts to
obtain any third party consents related to or required in connection with the
Merger that are (i) necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, (ii) disclosed or required to be disclosed in the Company Disclosure
Schedule or (iii) required to prevent the occurrence of an event that may have
a Company Material Adverse Effect prior to or after the Effective Time;
provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement will require the Company or
its Subsidiary to make any material payments to any third parties or make any
other material changes to the Company or its Subsidiary's arrangements or
obligations in order for the Company to obtain such third party consents. Any
such payment or change shall require the Parent's written consent and shall be
conditioned on the consummation of the Merger, and any such payments shall be
deemed to reduce the Target Cash Amount.

  

    

6.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_.

  

  

 

(a) The Company shall give prompt notice to the Parent of (i) any Change which
occurs or exists that causes or is reasonably likely to cause the failure of
the conditions set forth in Section 7.2(a), 7.2(b), 7.2(d) or 7.2(e), (ii) any
notice or other communication from any person alleging that the consent of
such person is or may be required in connection with the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) any notice or other
communication from any Governmental Entity in connection with (A) the Merger
or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (B) the
transactions contemplated by the CAD Sale Agreement, (iv) any Legal Actions
commenced or, to the best of its knowledge, threatened against, relating to or
involving or otherwise affecting the Company or its Subsidiary which, if
pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been required to have been

contemplated hereby, (v) any notice or other communication received by the
Company or its Subsidiary from an insurer under any Insurance Policy that such
insurer intends to cancel or generally disclaim liability under any such

from any customer set forth in Section 3.20(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule that such customer will stop, or decrease the rate of, buying
products from the Company or its Subsidiary, (vii) any notice or other
communication from any supplier set forth in Section 3.20(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule that such supplier will stop, or decrease the rate of,
supplying materials, products or services to the Company or its Subsidiary,
(viii) any written notices or claims received by, or Legal Actions commenced
or, to the best of its knowledge, threatened in writing against, the Company
or its Subsidiary, in each case (a) from or by Clarion relating to or
involving or otherwise affecting the Company or its Subsidiary or Clarion
relating to the transactions contemplated by the CAD Sale Agreement or (b)
from or by any third party relating to or involving the retained liabilities
under the CAD Sale Agreement, and (ix) any audit commenced, or to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened in writing, against or with respect to
the Company, its Subsidiary or any CAD Subsidiary in respect of any Tax or Tax
asset of the Company, its Subsidiary or any CAD Subsidiary; _provided_ ,
however, that (x) no such notification shall be deemed to cure any breach or
otherwise affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of
the Company or the conditions to the obligations of the parties hereunder and
(y) no disclosure by the Company shall be deemed to amend or supplement the
Company Disclosure Schedule or constitute an exception to any representation
or warranty.

  


 

 

  

(b) The Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company of any Change which
occurs or exists that would cause the failure of the conditions set forth in
Section 7.3(a) or 7.3(b); _provided_ , however, that (i) no such notification
shall be deemed to cure any breach or otherwise affect the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the Parent or the Merger Sub or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties hereunder and (ii) no disclosure
by the Parent shall constitute an exception to any representation or warranty.

  

    

6.8 _Public Disclosure_. The initial press release announcing the execution
of this Agreement shall be issued only in such form as shall be mutually
agreed upon by the Company and the Parent. Neither party shall issue any
other press release or public statement concerning this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, without the prior
approval of the other parties (except with respect to a Superior Proposal or
Company Adverse Recommendation Change or any action taken pursuant thereto, or
with respect to any dispute among the parties regarding this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger) (which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as may be required by law,
court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any
national securities exchange.

  

  

6.9 _Indemnification_.

  

  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Parent and the Merger Sub shall, to
the fullest extent permitted by Law, cause the Surviving Corporation, for a
period of ten years from the Effective Time, to honor all of the Company's
obligations under the organizational documents of the Company and its
Subsidiary and the agreements listed in Section 6.9 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule to indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and
officer of the Company (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), against any costs or
expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages, liabilities or amounts paid in settlement incurred in connection with
any Legal Action, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, to the extent that such obligations to indemnify and hold
harmless exist on the date of this Agreement. The Surviving Corporation will
not be liable for any settlement effected without the Surviving Corporation's
prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section
6.9 or elsewhere in this Agreement, Parent shall not (and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation not to) settle or compromise or consent to the entry
of any judgment or otherwise seek termination with respect to any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, unless such settlement, compromise,
consent or termination includes an unconditional release of all of the
Indemnified Parties covered by the claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parent's
obligations under this Section 6.9 shall include the obligation to honor (or
cause another of its Affiliates to honor) the Company's indemnification and
other obligations referenced in this Section 6.9 in circumstances where the
Surviving Corporation fails to honor, or is incapable of honoring, such
obligations. The obligations of the Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to this
Section 6.9 shall include the advancement of expenses to the extent so
provided in the organizational documents of the Company and its Subsidiary
and/or in the agreements as set forth in Section 6.9 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule. For a period of ten years after the Effective Time, the Parent
shall not cause there to be any changes to the provisions of the Surviving
Corporation's organizational documents affecting the indemnification and other
obligations covered by this Section 6.9.

  

    

(b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the Parent and the
Merger Sub shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain (to the extent
available in the market) in effect a directors' and officers' liability
insurance policy covering those persons who are currently covered by the
Company's directors' and officers' liability insurance policy (a complete and
accurate copy of which has been made available to the Parent prior to the date
of this Agreement) with coverage in amount and scope at least as favorable to
such persons as the Company's existing coverage; _provided_ , that in no event
shall the Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in excess
of 200% per year of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such
coverage. At its sole discretion, the Company may purchase prior to the
Effective Time a six-year prepaid "tail policy" on terms and conditions
providing substantially equivalent benefits as the current directors' and
officers' liability insurance policy covering those persons who are currently
covered by the Company's directors' and officers' liability insurance policy,
in which case the Parent and the Merger Sub shall be relieved of their
obligations pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, _provided_ that
the premium for any such "tail" policy shall not be in excess of 200% of the
last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date of this Agreement in
respect of the coverages required to be obtained pursuant hereto. If such
"tail" policy has been obtained by the Company prior to the Effective Time, it
shall be deemed to satisfy all obligations to obtain insurance pursuant to
this Section 6.9 and the Parent shall cause such policy to be maintained in
full force and effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder
to be honored by the Surviving Corporation, and no party shall have any
further obligation to purchase or pay for insurance hereunder. The Company
represents and warrants that the annual premium currently paid by the Company
for directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage is as set forth in
Section 6.9(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

  

  

(c) The provisions of this Section 6.9 are intended to be in addition to the
rights otherwise available to the current officers and directors of the
Company by Law, charter, statute, by-law or agreement, and shall operate for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties,
their heirs and their representatives.

  

  

(d) In the event that the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates or merges into any other
person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person, then, and in either such case, if the
Parent and the Surviving Corporation's successors and assigns do not assume
all of the obligations set forth in this Section 6.9 by operation of Law, then
proper provision shall be made such that such successors and assigns assume
such obligations. The agreements and covenants contained herein shall not be
deemed to be exclusive of any other rights to which any Indemnified Party is
entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise. Nothing in this
Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or
impair any rights to directors' and officers' insurance claims under any
policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or its
Subsidiary or their respective officers or directors, it being understood and
agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 6.9 is not prior
to, or in substitution for, any such claims under any such policies.

  

    

6.10 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

  

  

(a) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits) under the employee benefit plans of the
Parent and its Subsidiaries providing benefits after the Effective Time (the "
_New Plans_ ") to any employees of the Company and its Subsidiary as of the
Effective Time to the extent such employees remain employed by the Surviving
Corporation (" _Company Employees_ "), each Company Employee shall, subject to
applicable law and applicable Tax qualification requirements, be credited with
his or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiary and their
respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such
Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such
service under any similar Company Employee Plan in which such Company Employee
participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective
Time; _provided_ , that the foregoing shall not apply (i) to the extent that
its application would result in a duplication of benefits, (ii) for purposes
of any New Plan under which similarly-situated employees of the Parent and its
Subsidiaries do not receive credit for prior service, and (iii) for purposes
of any New Plan that is grandfathered or frozen, either with respect to level
of benefits or participation. In addition, but subject to the proviso of the
preceding sentence, (A) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent
coverage under such New Plan is comparable to the Company Employee Plan in
which such Company Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective
Time (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), and (B) for purposes of
each New Plan providing primarily medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision
benefits to any Company Employee (each, a " _New Medical Plan_ "), the Parent
shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to cause all pre-existing
condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be
waived for such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents, unless
such conditions would not have been waived under an Old Plan of the Company or
its Subsidiary in which such Company Employee participated immediately prior
to the Effective Time. The continued participation and coverage following the
Effective Time under the Company Employee Plans shall be deemed to satisfy the
obligations under Section 6.10(a) for the time period of such continued
participation and coverage, it being understood that the Company Employees may
commence participating in the employee benefit plans of the Parent on
different dates following the Effective Time.

  

  

(b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall make the
payments described and quantified in Section 6.10(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule to the individuals identified therein in exchange for documentation
from each such individual in the form set forth in Section 6.10(b) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule.

  

  

(c) For a period of twelve months after the Closing Date, Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiary to, provide each
Company Employee, while in the employ of Parent or the Surviving Corporation
or any of its Subsidiaries, salary, wages, target annual cash bonus
opportunities and medical and other welfare benefit plans, programs and
arrangements (excluding change in control or retention cash bonuses, if any)
that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the salary, wages,
target annual cash bonus opportunities and medical and other welfare benefit
plans, programs and arrangements (excluding change in control or retention
cash bonuses, if any) provided to Company Employees prior to the Closing Date,
_provided_ that for purposes of this covenant, stock options, restricted stock
and other equity-based awards, profit sharing, deferred compensation, retiree
medical and defined benefit pension plans shall be disregarded.

  

    

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.10, the
provisions of Sections 6.10(a), 6.10(b) and 6.10(c) shall apply only with
respect to Company Employees who are primarily employed in the United States.
With respect to Company Employees not described in the preceding sentence,
from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Company
and its Subsidiary to, comply with all applicable laws relating to employees
and employee benefits matters applicable to such employees.

  

  

(e) Without limiting the generality of Section 9.4, the provisions of this
Section 6.10 and of Section 6.11 are solely for the benefit of the parties to
this Agreement, and no current or former director, officer, employee or any
other individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a
third party beneficiary of this Agreement. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall (i) constitute or be deemed to be an amendment to any Company
Employee Plan or any other compensation or benefit plan, program or
arrangement of the Company or its Subsidiary for any purpose, (ii) guarantee
employment for any period of time, or preclude the ability of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiary to terminate any employee of the
Company or its Subsidiary for any reason, (iii) require Parent or the Company
or any of their respective Subsidiaries to continue any Company Employee Plan,
or provide any employee benefits plans or arrangements, or (iv) prevent the
amendment, modification or termination of any employee benefit plan or
arrangement, in accordance with the terms thereof and applicable law.

  

  

6.11 _Treatment of Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Stock Awards and
Company Stock Plans_.

  

  

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all steps necessary to
cause all Company Stock Options, whether vested or unvested, that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time to become fully vested and
each such Company Stock Option to be cancelled, as of the Effective Time, in
exchange for the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest and less
any applicable Tax withholding in accordance with Section 2.2(g) with respect
to such payment) determined by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the
Merger Consideration over the applicable exercise price per share of such
Company Stock Option by (ii) the number of Company Common Shares subject to
such Company Stock Option (the " _Option Consideration_ "). In the event that
the exercise price of any Company Stock Option is equal to or greater than the
Merger Consideration, the Company shall take such action as is required to
cause such Company Stock Option to be cancelled for no consideration and to
have no further force or effect from and after the Effective Time. At least
ten business days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall provide the
Parent and the Merger Sub with a schedule including the names of holders of
Company Stock Options and the amount of Option Consideration to be paid to
each such holder in respect of such Company Stock Options pursuant to this
Section 6.11(a), which schedule shall be updated by the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time. Payment of the Option Consideration shall be
made following the Effective Time in accordance with the Company's payroll
practices and, to the extent practicable, as part of the payment made in
respect of the first full payroll period ending after the Effective Date, but
in no event later than 30 days from the Effective Date.

  

    

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all steps necessary to
cause all Company Restricted Stock Awards, whether vested or unvested, that
are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time to become fully vested
and each such Company Restricted Stock Award to be cancelled, as of the
Effective Time, in exchange for the right to receive an amount in cash
(without interest and less any applicable Tax withholding in accordance with
Section 2.2(g) with respect to such payment) determined by multiplying (i) the
aggregate number of Company Common Shares subject to such Company Restricted
Stock Award by (ii) the Merger Consideration (the " _Restricted Stock
Consideration_ "). At least ten business days prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall provide the Parent and the Merger Sub with a schedule
including the names of holders of Company Restricted Stock Awards and the
amount of Restricted Stock Consideration to be paid to each such holder in
respect of such Company Restricted Stock Awards pursuant to this Section
6.11(b), which schedule shall be updated by the Company immediately prior to
the Effective Time. Payment of the Restricted Stock Consideration shall be
made following the Effective Time in accordance with Article II, _provided_ ,
that any Restricted Stock Consideration payable in respect of Company
Restricted Stock Awards for which an election under Section 83(b) of the Code
was not made shall be distributed through the Company's payroll process.

  

  

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such actions as are
necessary to terminate each of its Company Stock Plans, including as described
in this Section 6.11, all awards thereunder, effective as of the Effective
Time.

  

  

6.12 _Shareholder Litigation._ Until the earlier of the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms or the Effective Time, the Company
shall give the Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense or
settlement of any shareholder litigation against the Company or the Company
Board relating to the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and shall not settle any such litigation without the Parent's
prior written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed
in the event any injunction has issued as the result of any such litigation.

  

  

6.13 _Cooperation on Tax Matters_.

  

  

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall retain all books, records,
working papers (including any documentation relating to FIN48) with respect to
Tax matters pertinent to the Company, its Subsidiary and the CAD Subsidiaries
relating to any taxable periods (or portion thereof) ending on or before the
Closing Date.

  

  

(b) The parties further agree, upon the Parent's request, and at the Parent's
sole cost and expense, to use reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or
other document from any Governmental Entity, Taxing Authority or customer of
the Company or its Subsidiary or any other person as may be necessary to
mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed with respect to
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

(c) The Company shall deliver to the Parent a properly executed statement,
dated as of the Closing Date, in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent,
conforming to the requirements of Treasury Regulations Section 1.1445-2(c)(3),
and Parent shall timely file the FIRPTA Certificate in accordance with the
requirements of Treasury Regulations Section 1.897-2(h)(2).

to any materiality qualifications therein) would not reasonably be expected to
materially impair the ability of the Parent or the Merger Sub to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereunder).

  

  

(b) _Performance of Obligations of the Company_. The Parent and Merger Sub
shall each have performed in all material respects all obligations required to
be performed by them under this Agreement on or prior to the Closing Date.

  

  

ARTICLE VIII 
 

  

 _TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER_

  

  

8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time, whether prior to or after approval by the shareholders of the
Company, upon written notice (other than in the case of Section 8.1(a) below)
from the terminating party to the non-terminating party specifying the
subsection of this Section 8.1 pursuant to which such termination is effected,
as follows:

  

  

(a) by mutual written consent of the Parent, the Merger Sub and the Company;

  

  

(b) by either the Parent or the Company:

  

  

(i) if the Merger is not consummated on or before the six-month anniversary of
the date hereof (the " _Outside Date_ "), unless, on the Outside Date, the
conditions set forth in Section 7.1(b) or 7.1(c) (to the extent relating
solely to the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under
the HSR Act or any other waiting period imposed by any Governmental Entity)
are the only conditions that are not capable of being satisfied, in which
event each of the Parent and the Company, acting individually, has the option,
but not the obligation, to extend the Outside Date by a maximum of an
additional sixty (60) days for the purpose of satisfying such conditions;
_provided_ , however, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 8.1(b)(i) shall not be available to any party whose failure to
fulfill any obligations under this Agreement has caused, or resulted in, the
failure of the Merger to occur on or before the Outside Date;

  

    

(ii) if any Governmental Entity issues an order, decree or ruling or takes any
other action, in each case having the effect of permanently restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger and such order, decree, ruling
or other action shall have become final and nonappealable; _provided_ ,
however, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
8.1(b)(ii) shall not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill any
obligations under this Agreement has caused, or resulted in, the action or
event described in this Section 8.1(b)(ii); or

  

  

(iii) if at the Company Meeting at which a vote on the Company Voting Proposal
is taken, the Required Company Shareholder Vote in favor of the Company Voting
Proposal shall not have been obtained; _provided_ , however, that the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b)(iii) shall not be
available to the Company if (A) at such time the Company is in material breach
of or has failed to fulfill in a material respect its obligations under this
Agreement or (B) the failure to obtain the requisite vote has been caused by a
breach of the Company Shareholder Agreement by any party thereto other than
the Parent.

  

  

(c) by the Parent:

  

  

(i) if: (A) the Company Board shall have failed to recommend approval of the
Company Voting Proposal in the Proxy Statement or shall have withheld,
withdrawn, qualified or modified its recommendation of the Company Voting
Proposal in a manner adverse to the Parent; (B) following the request of the
Parent, the Company Board fails within ten business days of such request to
reaffirm its recommendation that the Company Voting Proposal in the Proxy
Statement be approved; (C) the Company Board shall have approved, endorsed or
recommended to the shareholders of the Company an Acquisition Proposal (other
than the Merger); (D) a tender offer or exchange offer for outstanding Company
Common Shares shall have been commenced and the Company Board recommends that
the shareholders of the Company tender their shares in such tender or exchange
offer or, within ten business days after the commencement of such tender or
exchange offer, the Company Board fails to recommend against acceptance of
such offer; (E) the Company Board makes any public statement inconsistent with
its recommendation of the Company Voting Proposal; or (F) the Company Board or
any committee thereof shall have publicly resolved to do any of the foregoing
(each, a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ ");

  

  

(ii) if the Company breaches or fails to perform any of its representations,
warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure
to perform (A) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in
Section 7.1 or 7.2 and (B) cannot be or has not been cured within 20 days
after the giving of written notice to the Company of such breach or failure to
perform; or

  

    

(iii) if the Company knowingly and materially breaches the covenants contained
in Section 6.1 or 6.5 of this Agreement.

  

  

(d) by the Company:

  

  

(i) if the Parent or the Merger Sub breaches or fails to perform any of their
respective representations, warranties or covenants contained in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform materially impairs the Parent's
and the Merger Sub's ability to consummate the Merger and which breach or
failure to perform cannot be or has not been cured within 20 days after the
giving of written notice to the Parent of such breach or failure to perform
(provided in each case that the Company is not then in material breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement); or

  

  

(ii) if (A) the Company Board approves, and the Company enters into, a
definitive agreement providing for the implementation of a Superior Proposal
to the extent permitted by, and subject to the terms and conditions of,
Section 6.1, and (B) concurrently with such termination, the Company pays to
the Parent the amounts specified in Section 8.3(c)(iii).

  

  

8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement as provided in Section 8.1, all obligations and agreements of the
parties set forth in this Agreement shall forthwith terminate and be of no
further force or effect, and there shall be no liability on the part of the
Parent, the Merger Sub or the Company (or their respective officers,
directors, stockholders, Affiliates or Representatives) hereunder, except as
set forth in this Section 8.2, Section 8.3 and Article IX, which provisions
shall survive such termination; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not
relieve any party for liability for damages actually incurred as a result of
fraud or any willful breach of this Agreement.

  

  

8.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

  

  

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 8.3, each party shall bear
all of the fees and expenses incurred by it in connection with the negotiation
and performance of this Agreement, and no party may recover any such fees and
expenses from the other parties upon any termination of this Agreement.

  

  

(b) The Company shall reimburse the Parent for all documented out-of-pocket
expenses, fees and costs (including, but not limited to, expenses and fees of
the Parent's counsel, accountants, financial advisors and consultants and all
filing fees paid to any Governmental Entity) of the Parent relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including in connection with the
Parent's due diligence investigation and the authorization, negotiation,
execution and performance of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Merger) actually incurred prior to termination
(collectively, " _Transaction Expenses_ "), in the event of the termination of
this Agreement:

  

    

(i) by the Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i) if the failure
to satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 7.1(a) or 7.2(a) or (b) by the
Outside Date shall have resulted in the Closing not occurring;

  

  

(ii) by the Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(ii);

  

  

(iii) by the Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(iii); or

  

  

(iv) by the Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(iii);

  

  

 _provided_ , however, that the Company shall not have to reimburse
Transaction Expenses (A) pursuant to Section 8.3(b)(i), (ii) or (iv) in excess
of $2 million in the aggregate or (B) pursuant to Section 8.3(b)(iii) in
excess of $3 million in the aggregate (the amount in clause (A) or (B), as the
case may be, the " _Transaction Expense Cap_ ") (which Transaction Expense Cap
shall be increased if the Parent receives a request for additional information
from a Governmental Entity with respect to Anti-Trust Law compliance (a "
_Request_ "), but only to the extent the Parent incurs additional Transaction
Expenses from and after the date of such Request; _provided_ , however, that
the Transaction Expense Cap shall not exceed $5 million). The expenses
payable pursuant to this Section 8.3(b) shall be paid by wire transfer of
same-day funds within ten business days after demand therefor (and receipt by
the Company of reasonably appropriate supporting documentation) following the
occurrence of the termination event giving rise to the payment obligation
described in this Section 8.3(b).

  

  

(c) The Company shall pay to the Parent $8,965,500 (the " _Termination Fee_ ")
in cash if:

  

  

(i) this Agreement is terminated by the Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(i);

  

  

(ii) after the date of this Agreement:

  

  

(A) (x) an Acquisition Proposal (or an amendment to an Acquisition Proposal
made prior to the date of this Agreement) shall be announced, commenced,
publicly disclosed or otherwise made publicly known; (y) this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(iii); and (z) within nine months after
such termination the Company enters into a definitive agreement to consummate,
or consummates, any Acquisition Proposal (regardless of whether made before or
after the termination of this Agreement), or

  

  

(B) (x) any person makes an Acquisition Proposal (or amends an Acquisition
Proposal made prior to the date of this Agreement); (y) this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i), or 8.1(c)(ii); and (z) within nine
months after such termination the Company enters into a definitive agreement
to consummate, or consummates, any Acquisition Proposal (regardless of whether
made before or after the termination of this Agreement); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that for purposes of Sections 8.3(c)(ii)(A) and (B), the
references to 20% in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to
be references to 50%; or

  

  

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section
8.1(d)(ii).

  

    

Any fee due under Section 8.3(c)(iii) shall be paid by wire transfer of same-
day funds on the date of termination of this Agreement. Any fee due under
Section 8.3(c)(i) shall be paid by wire transfer within two business days of
termination of this Agreement. Any fee due under Section 8.3(c)(ii) shall be
paid by wire transfer of same-day funds on or prior to the date on which the
condition set forth in clause (z) of Section 8.3(c)(ii)(A) or (B), as the case
may be, is satisfied and shall be less any amounts previously paid to the
Parent by the Company pursuant to Section 8.3(b). If the Company fails to
timely pay the amount due pursuant to Section 8.3, or any portion thereof, (i)
such amount or portion thereof shall accrue interest from the date such
payment was required to be made through the date of payment at the prime rate
of Citibank N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made
plus 5% and (ii) the Company shall pay to the Parent or Merger Sub its
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys'
fees) in connection with any suit (and any appeals thereof) that results in a
final, non-appealable judgment against the Company for the amount set forth in
Section 8.3 or any portion thereof.

  

  

(d) The parties agree that, except in the case of liability of the Company for
fraud under this Agreement, the amounts referenced in Section 8.3(b) and (c)
shall be the sole and exclusive monetary remedy available to Parent and Merger
Sub with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby in
the event such amounts are paid by the Company, and, upon payment of such
amounts by the Company, the Company, the Company's Affiliates and its and
their respective directors, officers, employees, stockholders and
Representatives shall have no further liability to Parent and Merger Sub under
this Agreement, except to the extent that following any payment of Transaction
Expenses, the Termination Fee subsequently becomes payable pursuant to Section
8.3(c)(ii). In no event shall the Company be obligated to pay amounts
referenced in Section 8.3(b) and (c) on more than one occasion.

  

  

 

8.4 _Buyer 's Liability for Breach_. Notwithstanding anything in this Article
VIII or in Section 9.4 hereof, the parties agree that in the event of a
material breach by the Parent or Merger Sub of any of their representations,
warranties, covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement, occurring
prior to the Effective Time, the Company may seek, on behalf of itself and its
shareholders, damages in an amount to compensate the Company and its
shareholders for the loss of the benefits of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including the Merger, and to the extent proven, taking into
consideration relevant matters, recover such damages on behalf of itself and
its shareholders.

  


 

 

  

8.5 _Amendment_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties may
amend, modify and supplement this Agreement in any and all respects, whether
before or after any vote of the shareholders of the Company contemplated
hereby; _provided_ , however, that after any such shareholder approvals shall
have been obtained, no amendment shall be made which, under applicable law,
requires the further approval of such shareholders without such approval. Any
such amendment, modification or supplement shall be valid only if set forth in
a written instrument executed and delivered by a duly authorized officer on
behalf of each of the parties.

  

    

8.6 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties
may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
acts of the other parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations
and warranties of the other parties contained in this Agreement or in any
document delivered pursuant to this Agreement, or (c) subject to the proviso
in Section 8.5, waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of
the other parties contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a
party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a
written instrument executed and delivered by a duly authorized officer on
behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert
any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a
waiver of such rights.

Any party to this Agreement may change the address to which notices and other
communications hereunder are to be delivered by giving the other parties to
this Agreement notice in the manner set forth in this Section 9.2.

  

  

9.3 _Entire Agreement._ This Agreement (including the Schedules and Exhibits
hereto) constitutes the entire agreement among the parties hereto and
supersedes any prior understandings, agreements or representations by or among
the parties hereto, or any of them, written or oral, with respect to the
subject matter hereof; _provided_ that the Confidentiality Agreement shall
remain in effect in accordance with its terms.

  

  

9.4 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Other than the provisions of Section 6.9,
this Agreement is not intended, and shall not be deemed, to confer any rights
or remedies upon any other person other than the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, to create any agreement of
employment with any person or to otherwise create any third-party beneficiary
hereto.

  

    

9.5 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in
part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without
the prior written consent of the other parties, and any such assignment
without such prior written consent shall be null and void, except that the
Parent and/or the Merger Sub may assign this Agreement to any direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Parent without the consent of the
Company, _provided_ that the Parent and/or the Merger Sub, as the case may be,
shall remain liable for all of its obligations under this Agreement. Subject
to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

  

  

9.6 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid
or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making such
determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to delete
specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term
or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In the
event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior
sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable
term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that will
achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of
such invalid or unenforceable term.

  

  

9.7 _Counterparts and Signature_. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which
together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and
delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not
sign the same counterpart. This Agreement may be executed and delivered by
facsimile or "PDF" transmission.

  

  

9.8 _Interpretation_. When reference is made in this Agreement to an Article
or a Section, such reference shall be to an Article or a Section of this
Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents, table of defined
terms and headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be
the language chosen by the parties to express their mutual intent, and no rule
of strict construction shall be applied against any party. Whenever the
context may require, any pronouns used in this Agreement shall include the
corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form of
nouns and pronouns shall include the plural, and vice versa. Any reference to
any federal, state, local or foreign statute or law shall be deemed also to
refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context
requires otherwise. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." Where this Agreement refers to information that was
"made available", that means that such information was either (i) provided
directly to the Parent or its outside counsel or (ii) included in the Merrill
Corporation DataSite: "Project GWH," in each case no later than 12:01 a.m.,
Eastern Time, on the date of this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, the
term "person" means any individual, corporation, partnership, joint venture,
association, trust, limited liability company, unincorporated organization or
other entity. As used in this Agreement, references to any "agreement" to
which a person is bound means any contract, agreement, instrument, obligation,
undertaking, lease, license, arrangement, commitment or understanding, whether
written or oral, in each case that is or purports to be legally binding on
such person and as it may be amended or otherwise modified from time to time.
As used in this Agreement, references to the "Company's knowledge" or
"knowledge of the Company", or any other phases of similar meaning, means the
actual knowledge, after due inquiry, of the individuals identified in Section
9.8 of the Company Disclosure Schedule. No summary of this Agreement prepared
by any party shall affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

  

    

9.9 _Governing Law_. Except to the extent that the internal laws of the State
of Rhode Island apply in respect of the procedural aspects of the Merger that
are set forth in Article II of this Agreement, this Agreement shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of
New York without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or
rule (whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would
cause the application of laws of any jurisdictions other than those of the
State of New York, other than Section 5-1401 of the New York General
Obligation Law.

  

  

9.10 _Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies
herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such
party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. Accordingly, the parties hereto shall be entitled to seek an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

  

  

9.11 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereto (a) consents to
submit itself to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of any state or federal
court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, City of New York, in any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Merger or any of
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that all
claims in respect of such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in
any such court, (c) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such
court, and (d) agrees not to bring any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the transaction contemplated
by this Agreement in any other court. Each of the parties hereto waives any
defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding
so brought and waives any bond, surety or other security that might be
required of any other party with respect thereto. Any party hereto may make
service on another party by sending or delivering a copy of the process to the
party to be served at the address and in the manner provided for the giving of
notices in Section 9.2. Nothing in this Section 9.11, however, shall affect
the right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by
law.

  

    

9.12 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARENT, THE MERGER SUB AND THE
COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF THE PARENT, THE MERGER SUB OR THE COMPANY IN THE
NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.
