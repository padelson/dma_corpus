The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting (as
such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the 1934 Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under
the 1934 Act. The Company&rsquo;s disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or furnishes under the 1934 Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is accumulated
and communicated to the Company&rsquo;s management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the &ldquo;<B>Sarbanes-Oxley
Act</B>&rdquo;). The Company&rsquo;s management completed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company&rsquo;s internal control
over financial reporting in compliance with the applicable requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as of December
31, 2015, and such evaluation concluded that the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
such date. Based on its most recent evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting prior to the date hereof, the Company
has disclosed to the Company&rsquo;s auditors or the audit committee of the Board of Directors, and to Parent, (i) any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting
that are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material respect the Company&rsquo;s ability to record, process, summarize
and report financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting.</P>
