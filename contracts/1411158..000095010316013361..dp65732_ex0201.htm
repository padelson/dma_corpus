 _ARTICLE 2_

  

THE OFFER

  



  

Section 2.01. _The Offer_. (a) Provided that nothing shall have occurred that
would give rise to a right of Parent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 11.01, and the Company shall have complied with its obligations under
Section 2.02, as promptly as practicable after the date hereof, but in no
event later than thirteen Business Days after the date hereof, Merger
Sub shall commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the 1934 Act) the
Offer. The Offer shall be

  



  

10

  



    



 



    

subject to the conditions set forth in Annex I hereto (the "Offer
Conditions"). The date on which Merger Sub commences the Offer is referred to
as the "Offer Commencement Date".

  



  

(b)  Merger Sub expressly reserves the right to waive any of the Offer
Conditions and to make any change in the terms of or conditions to the Offer;
_provided_ that, without the prior written consent of the Company, Merger Sub
shall __ not:

  



  

(i)  waive or change the Minimum Condition or the Termination Condition (in
each case, as defined in Annex I);

  



  

(ii) decrease the Offer Price;

  



  

(iii) change the form of consideration to be paid in the Offer;

  



  

(iv) decrease the number of Shares subject to the Offer;

  



  

(v)  extend or otherwise change the expiration date of the Offer except as
otherwise required or expressly permitted herein;

  



  

(vi)  impose additional Offer Conditions or otherwise amend, modify or
supplement any of the Offer Conditions or terms of the Offer in a manner
adverse to the holders of the Shares; or

  



  

(vii)  provide any "subsequent offering period" in accordance with Rule
14d-11 of the 1934 Act.

  



  

(c)  Unless extended as provided in this Agreement, the Offer shall expire at
11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on the date that is 20 Business Days
(calculated as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the 1934 Act) after the
Offer Commencement Date (the "Initial Expiration Time"). Subject to the
rights of Parent and Merger Sub to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 11.01, (i) if any of the Offer Conditions is not satisfied or waived
at the Initial Expiration Time or at any other scheduled expiration time of
the Offer, Merger Sub shall extend the Offer from time to time until such
Offer Condition or Offer Conditions are satisfied or waived; _provided_ that
(i) Merger Sub shall not be required to extend the Offer beyond the __ End
Date unless Parent is not then permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Section 11.01(b)(i), in which case Merger Sub shall be required to extend
the Offer beyond the End Date if this Agreement is not otherwise terminated
pursuant to Section 11.01, (ii) no such individual extension of the Offer
shall be for a period of more than ten Business Days or such other period as
mutually agreed between the parties, and (iii) Merger Sub may extend the
Offer for the minimum period required by any Applicable Law or the rules and
regulations of the SEC or the NASDAQ or as may be necessary to resolve any
comments of the SEC or its staff applicable to the Offer, the Schedule TO or
Offer Documents. The Offer may not be terminated prior to its expiration date
(as such expiration date may be extended pursuant to this Section 2.01)
unless this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 11.01.

  



  

11

  



    



 



    

If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 11.01, Merger Sub
shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours following such termination)
terminate the Offer and not acquire any Shares pursuant thereto. If the Offer
is terminated by Merger Sub prior to the acceptance for payment and payment
for Shares tendered in the Offer, Merger Sub shall promptly return, and shall
cause any depositary acting on behalf of Merger Sub to return, in accordance
with Applicable Law, all tendered Shares to the registered holders thereof.

  



  

(d)  Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and to
the satisfaction or waiver of the Offer Conditions, Merger Sub shall, and
Parent shall cause it to, accept for payment and pay for, promptly (within the
meaning of Rule 14e-1(c) of the 1934 Act) after the expiration of the Offer,
all Shares validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer
(the time at which Shares are first accepted for payment and paid for under
the Offer, the "Acceptance Time").

  



  

(e) On the Offer Commencement Date, Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) file
with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the
Offer (together with all amendments and supplements thereto and including
exhibits thereto, the "Schedule TO") that shall include the summary term
sheet required thereby and, as exhibits, the offer to purchase and a form of
letter of transmittal and summary advertisement (collectively, together with
any amendments or supplements thereto, the "Offer Documents") and (ii) cause
the Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares to the extent
required by applicable U.S. federal securities laws and any other Applicable
Law. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees promptly to correct
any information provided by it for use in the Schedule TO and the Offer
Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become (or
shall have become known to be) false or misleading in any material respect.
Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the
Schedule TO as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and the Offer Documents
as so corrected to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case to the
extent required by applicable U.S. federal securities laws and any other
Applicable Law. The Company shall furnish to Parent and Merger Sub the
information relating to the Company required by the 1934 Act to be set forth
in the Offer Documents. The Company and its counsel shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule TO and the
Offer Documents each time before any such document is filed with the SEC, and
Parent and Merger Sub shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to
any comments made by the Company and its counsel (it being understood that the
Company and its counsel shall provide any comments thereon as soon as
reasonably practicable). Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the Company
and its counsel with (A) any written comments or other written communications
(and a summary of all substantive oral comments or communications) that
Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC
or its staff with respect to the Schedule TO or Offer Documents promptly
after receipt of those comments or other communications and (B)  a reasonable
opportunity to participate in the response of Parent and Merger Sub to those
comments and to provide comments on that response (to which reasonable and
good faith consideration shall be given), including by participating with
Parent

  



  

12

  



    



 



    

and Merger Sub or their counsel in any substantive discussions or meetings
with the SEC.

  



  

Section 2.02. _Company Action_. (a) The Company hereby consents to the Offer
and represents that the board of directors of the Company (the "Board
of Directors"), at a meeting duly called and held, has unanimously (i)
determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Offer and the Merger, are fair to and in the best interests of
the Company and its stockholders, (ii) approved, adopted and declared
advisable this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Offer and the Merger, (iii) resolved that this Agreement and
the Merger shall be governed by Section 251(h) of Delaware Law and that the
Merger shall be consummated as soon as practicable following the Acceptance
Time and (iv) subject to Section 7.03(b), resolved to make the Company
Recommendation. Subject to Section 7.03(b), the Company hereby consents to the
inclusion in the Offer Documents of the Company Recommendation, as it may be
amended or modified in accordance with this Agreement.

  



  

(b)  The Company shall promptly furnish Parent with a list of its
stockholders and any available listing or computer file containing the names
and addresses of all record holders of Shares and lists of securities
positions of Shares held in stock depositories, in each case true and correct
as of the most recent practicable date (the date of the list used to determine
the Persons to whom the Offer Documents and the Schedule 14D-9 are first
disseminated, the "Stockholder List Date"), and of all persons becoming
record holders subsequent to such date, and shall provide to Parent such
additional information (including updated lists of stockholders and lists of
securities positions) and such other assistance as Parent may
reasonably request in connection with the Offer.

  



  

(c)  Except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer
Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall hold in
confidence the information contained in any such lists, listings and files,
shall use such information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger
and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, shall, upon the Company's
request, return to the Company or destroy all copies of such information in
the possession of Parent and its Subsidiaries and direct its and their
respective Representatives to do the same.

  



  

(d) On the Offer Commencement Date, as soon as practicable after the
commencement of the Offer, the Company shall (i) file with the SEC
and disseminate to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable U.S. federal securities laws and any other Applicable
Law, a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with
any amendments or supplements thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") that, subject to
Section 7.03(b), shall include the Company Recommendation and a description
thereof, and (ii) cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be disseminated to holders of
Shares as and to the extent required by applicable U.S. federal securities
laws and any other Applicable Law, including by setting the Stockholder List
Date as the record date for purposes

  



  

13

  



    



 



    

of receiving the notice required by Section 262(d)(2) of Delaware Law. The
Schedule 14D-9 shall include (A) in its entirety the Financial Advisor Opinion
and a description thereof and (B) the notice of appraisal required to be
delivered by the Company under Section 262(d) of Delaware Law at the time the
Company first files the Schedule 14D-9 with the SEC. Each of the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub agrees promptly to correct any information provided by
it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that it shall have
become (or shall have become known to be) false or misleading in any material
respect. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Schedule
14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to
holders of Shares, in each case to the extent required by applicable U.S.
federal securities laws and any other Applicable Law. Parent, Merger Sub and
their counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
on the Schedule 14D- 9 each time before it is filed with the SEC, and the
Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments
made by Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel (it being understood that Parent,
Merger Sub and their counsel shall provide any comments thereon as soon as
reasonably practicable). Except with respect to any amendments filed after an
Adverse Recommendation Change or in connection with any disclosure made in
compliance with Section 7.03, the Company shall provide Parent, Merger Sub
and their counsel with (i) any written comments or other written
communications (and a summary of all substantive oral comments or
communications) that the Company or its counsel may receive from time to time
from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after
receipt of those comments or other communications and (ii) a reasonable
opportunity to participate in the Company's response to those comments and to
provide comments on that response (to which reasonable and good
faith consideration shall be given), including by participating with the
Company or its counsel in any substantive discussions or meetings with the
SEC.

  



  

(e) The Company shall register the transfer of Shares accepted for payment
pursuant to the Offer effective immediately after the Acceptance Time.

  



  

 _ARTICLE 3_

  

THE MERGER

  



  

Section 3.01. _The Merger_. (a) At the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be
merged (the "Merger") with and into the Company in accordance with
Delaware Law, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and
the Company shall be the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation").
The Merger shall be governed by Section 251(h) of Delaware Law and shall be
effected as soon as practicable following the consummation of the Offer.

  



  

(b) Subject to the provisions of Article 10, the closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") shall take place in New York City at the offices of Davis Polk and
Wardwell LLP, 450 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, 10017 as soon as
practicable after (and in no event later than the Business Day following) the
Acceptance Time, subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent permissible)
waiver by

  



  

14

  



    



 



    

the party or parties entitled to the benefit thereof of the conditions set
forth in Article 10 (other than conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent
permissible, waiver of those conditions at the Closing), or at such other
place, at such other time or on such other date as Parent and the Company may
mutually agree.

  



  

(c)  At the Closing, the Company and Merger Sub shall file a certificate of
merger (the "Certificate of Merger") with the Delaware Secretary of State and
make all other filings or recordings required by Delaware Law in connection
with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time (the
"Effective Time") as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the
Delaware Secretary of State (or at such later time as may be mutually agreed
by Parent and the Company and specified in the Certificate of Merger).

  



  

(d)  From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
possess all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to
all of the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the
Company and Merger Sub, all as provided under Delaware Law.

  



  

Section 3.02. _Conversion of Shares_. At the Effective Time:

  



  

(a)  Except as otherwise provided in Section 3.02(b) or Section 3.04, each
Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into the right to receive the Offer Price in cash, without interest (the
"Merger Consideration"). As of the Effective Time, all such Shares shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and each applicable holder thereof shall thereafter
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration upon the surrender of such Shares in
accordance with this Section 3.02.

  



  

(b)  Each Share held by the Company as treasury stock (other than Shares in a
Company Plan) or owned directly by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be cancelled, and no payment shall be made with
respect thereto. Each Share held by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the
Company or Parent (other than Merger Sub) immediately prior to the Effective
Time, if any, shall be converted into such number of shares of stock of the
Surviving Corporation such that each such Subsidiary shall own the same
percentage of the outstanding capital stock of the Surviving Corporation
immediately following the Effective Time as such Subsidiary owned in the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(c)  Each share of common stock of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges
as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation (except for any such shares
resulting from the conversion of Shares held by Subsidiaries of the Company,
if any, pursuant to Section 3.02(b)).

  



  

15

  



    



 



    

Section 3.03. _Surrender and Payment_. (a) Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall appoint an agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the
"Exchange Agent") for the purpose of exchanging for the Merger Consideration
as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time (i) certificates
representing Shares (the "Certificates") or (ii) uncertificated Shares (the
"Uncertificated Shares"). Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall make
available (or cause to be made available) to the Exchange Agent the Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the Certificates and the Uncertificated
Shares. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time (but no later
than four Business Days thereafter), Parent shall send, or shall cause the
Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of Shares at the Effective Time a
letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that the
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares
to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange.

  



  

(b)  Each holder of Shares that have been converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon (i) surrender to
the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed letter
of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agent's message" by the Exchange Agent
(or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may
reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated
Shares, the Merger Consideration payable for each Share represented by a
Certificate or for each Uncertificated Share. Until so surrendered or
transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or Uncertificated
Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right
to receive the Merger Consideration. No interest shall be paid or shall
accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any Shares.

  



  

(c)  If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the
transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to
such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share
shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment
shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a
result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

  



  

(d)  After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Shares. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall
be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in
accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article 3.

  



  

(e)  Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to Section 3.03(a) (and any interest or other income earned
thereon) that remains unclaimed by the holders of Shares twelve months after
the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such
holder who

  



  

16

  



    



 



    

has not exchanged such Shares for the Merger Consideration in accordance with
this Section 3.03 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for
payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of such Shares without any
interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor any of
its Affiliates shall be liable to any holder of Shares for any amount paid to
a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar laws.

  



  

Section 3.04. _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding Section 3.02, Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who
is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal rights in accordance
with Section 262 of Delaware Law shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, but shall instead be entitled only to such
rights as are provided under Section 262 of Delaware Law, unless such holder
fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal under
Section 262 of Delaware Law. If, after the Effective Time, such holder fails
to perfect, withdraws or loses the right to appraisal under Section 262 of
Delaware Law, such Shares shall be treated as if they had been converted
pursuant to Section 3.02(a) as of the Effective Time into, and shall
represent only, the right to receive the Merger Consideration. The Company
shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal of Shares and any withdrawals of any such demands, and Parent shall
have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to such demands. Except with the prior written consent of Parent,
the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, offer to settle or
settle, or otherwise negotiate any such demands, or agree to do any of the
foregoing.

  



  

Section 3.05. _Treatment of Equity Awards_. (a) At the Effective Time, each
option to purchase Shares granted under any Company Plan, whether vested or
unvested and whether subject to time-based or performance-based vesting, that
is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a
"Company Option") shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of such Company Option,
become fully vested and exercisable as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time and shall be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive a cash
payment at the Effective Time from Parent to the holder thereof, equal to the
product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Offer Price less the applicable per
share exercise price of such Company Option _multiplied by_ (ii) the number
of Shares subject to such Company Option. Any __ Company Options with a per
share exercise price equal to or greater than the Offer Price shall be
cancelled for no consideration.

  



  

(b) Subject to Section 3.05(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, at the
Effective Time, each restricted stock unit payable in Shares or the value of
which is determined with reference to the value of Shares granted under any
Company Plan, whether subject to time-based or performance-based vesting,
that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a
"Company Restricted Stock Unit") shall, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of
such Company Restricted Stock Unit, become fully vested as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time and shall be

  



  

17

  



    



 



    

cancelled in exchange for the right to receive a cash payment at the
Effective Time from Parent to the holder thereof equal to the product of (i)
the Offer Price _multiplied_ _by_ (ii) the number of Shares underlying such
Company Restricted Stock Unit.

  



  

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all action necessary
to ensure that (i) no new offering periods under the Company's 2010 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP") will commence during the period from the date
of this Agreement through the Effective Time, (ii) there will be no increase
in the amount of payroll deductions permitted to be made by the participants
under the ESPP during the current offering periods, except those made in
accordance with payroll deduction elections that are in effect as of the date
of this Agreement, and (iii) no individuals shall commence participation
in the ESPP during the period from the date of this Agreement through the
Effective Time. The accumulated contributions of the participants in the
current offering periods shall be used to purchase Shares as of no later than
ten Business Days prior to the Effective Time, and the participants' purchase
rights under such offerings shall terminate immediately after such purchase.
As of no later than the Business Day immediately prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall terminate the ESPP.

  



  

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all necessary action
with respect to the Company Plans that provide for equity compensation as are
necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section
3.05, including satisfying any notice requirements. Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, Parent may process any payments contemplated
by Sections 3.05(a) and 3.05(b) through the payroll of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, the Company or their respective Affiliates.

  



  

Section 3.06. _Adjustments_. If, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding Shares (or securities
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for Shares) shall have been
changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of
any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including reverse stock
split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of Shares, or stock dividend

other transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

Section 5.04. _Non-Contravention_. The execution, delivery and performance by
the Company of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions

controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or furnishes under the 1934 Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC,
and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to the
Company's management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-
Oxley Act"). The Company's management completed an evaluation of the
effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting in
compliance with the applicable requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-

Parent, (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of the Company's internal control over financial
reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material
respect the Company's ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Company's internal control over financial reporting.

maintained in all material respects as necessary to permit the preparation of
financial statements in accordance with GAAP and any other applicable legal

Company SEC Documents.

controlled Affiliates is a party; _provided_ that, notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if the Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel

inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, the Company may
waive any such standstill provision solely to the extent necessary to permit
a Third Party to make, on a confidential basis to the Board of Directors, an
Acquisition Proposal, conditioned upon such Third Party agreeing that the
Company shall not be prohibited from providing any information to Parent
(including regarding any such Acquisition Proposal) in accordance with, and
otherwise complying with, this Section 7.03. Except to the extent
otherwise permitted by the proviso in the foregoing sentence, the Company

that did not result from a breach of Section 7.03(a) and that the Board of
Directors reasonably determines, in good faith, after consultation with
outside counsel and its financial advisor, constitutes or would reasonably be
expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and the failure to take such action
would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
Applicable Law, (A) engage in negotiations or discussions with any Third Party
and its Representatives regarding such an Acquisition Proposal and (B)
furnish to such Third Party (or its Representatives) making such an
Acquisition Proposal information, including non-public information, relating

48

  



    



 



    

Subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality agreement containing terms that
are not less restrictive in any non _de minimis_ respect to the other party
than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood and
agreed that such confidentiality agreement need not contain a standstill
provision); _provided_ that all such information (to the extent that such
information has not __ been previously provided or made available to Parent)
is provided or made available to Parent, as the case may be, prior to or
substantially concurrently with the time it is provided or made available to
such Third Party;

  



  

(ii) subject to compliance with Section 7.03(e), the Board of Directors may,
(A) in response to a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal that did not
result from a breach of Section 7.03(a) and that the Board of Directors has
determined, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisor, constitutes a Superior Proposal, make an Adverse Recommendation
Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to and in accordance with Section
11.01(d)(i) in order to enter into a definitive agreement for such Superior
Proposal, or (B) in response to an Intervening Event (and not in response to
an Acquisition Proposal), make an Adverse Recommendation Change, in each case
referred to in the foregoing clauses (A) and (B), only if the Board of
Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel and its independent financial advisor, that the failure to take such
action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under Applicable Law.

  



  

(c) In addition, nothing contained herein shall prevent the Company or the
Board of Directors from (i) taking and disclosing to the Company's
stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the 1934 Act (or any similar communication to
stockholders) or (ii) making any disclosure to stockholders if the Board of
Directors determines, in consultation with outside counsel, that the failure
to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under Applicable Law; _provided_  that any Adverse
Recommendation Change will be subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement (it being understood that (A) any "stop, look and listen"
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the
1934 Act and (B) any factual information to the Company's stockholders that
describes the Company's receipt of an Acquisition Proposal and the operation
of this Agreement with respect thereto and contains a statement that the Board
of Directors has not effected an Adverse Recommendation Change, shall not, in
and of itself, be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change).

  



  

(d) _Required Notices_. The Company shall not take any of the actions
referred to in Section 7.03(b)(i) unless the Company shall have delivered to
Parent a prior written notice advising Parent that it intends to take such
action. In addition, the Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no
event later than twenty-four hours) after receipt by the Company (or any of
its Representatives) of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for non-
public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for
access to the business, properties, assets,

  



  

49

  



    



 



    

books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any Third Party
that has notified the Company that it may be considering making, or has made,
an Acquisition Proposal, including the identity of such Third Party making
the Acquisition Proposal and the material terms and conditions thereof
(including providing Parent copies of any written materials submitted in
connection with any Acquisition Proposal). The Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of the status and material
terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal or the nature of any
information requested of the Company or its Subsidiaries with respect thereto
(including by promptly (but in no event later than twenty-four hours after
receipt) providing to Parent copies of any written proposals, indications of
interest, and/or draft agreements relating to such Acquisition Proposal. The
Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries will not enter into any
agreement with any Person subsequent to the date of this Agreement that
prohibits the Company from providing any information to Parent in accordance
with, or otherwise complying with, this Section 7.03.

  



  

(e) _Last Look_. Neither the Board of Directors nor the Company shall take
any of the actions referred to in Section 7.03(b)(ii) unless (i) the Company
shall have notified Parent, in writing and at least three Business Days prior
to taking such action, of its intention to take such action, specifying, in
reasonable detail, the reasons for the Adverse Recommendation Change,
including, if applicable, the terms and conditions of, and the identity of
the Third Party making, any such Superior Proposal and attaching a copy of any
proposed agreements for the Superior Proposal (or a description of all
material terms and conditions thereof) (it being understood and agreed that
the delivery of the notification contemplated by this clause (i) shall not,
in and of itself, constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change), (ii) the
Company has negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to negotiate, in
good faith with Parent during such notice period, to the extent Parent wishes
to negotiate, concerning any revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed
by Parent, (iii) following the end of such notice period, the Board of
Directors shall have determined, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisor, and giving due consideration to the revisions
to the terms of this Agreement to which Parent has committed in writing,
that, in the case of an Acquisition Proposal, such Acquisition Proposal would
nevertheless continue to constitute a Superior Proposal (assuming the
revisions committed to by Parent were to be given effect), and in any case and
that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, and (iv) in the
event of any change to any of the financial terms (including the form, amount
and timing of payment of consideration) or any other material terms of such
Superior Proposal, if applicable, the Company shall, in each case, have
delivered to Parent an additional notice consistent with that described in
clause (i) above and a new notice period under clause (i) above shall
commence, during which time the Company shall be required to comply with the
requirements of this Section 7.03(e) anew with respect to such additional
notice, including clauses (i) through (iv) above; and _provided_ , _further_ ,
that the Company has complied in all material respects with its obligations
__ under this Section 7.03(e).

  



  

50

  



    



 



    

(f) _Definition of Superior Proposal_. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Superior Proposal" means a _bona fide_ , unsolicited written
Acquisition Proposal (but substituting "50%" for all references to "15%" in
the definition of such term), (i) on terms that the Board of Directors
determines in good faith after consultation with outside counsel and its
financial advisor, are more favorable from a financial point of view to the
Company's stockholders than the Offer and the Merger, taking into account the
terms and conditions and all other relevant factors (including all financial,
regulatory, financing, conditionality, legal and other terms and conditions)
of such proposal and this Agreement (taking into account any revisions to the
terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such Acquisition
Proposal as contemplated by Section 7.03(e)) and (ii) that the Board of
Directors determines is reasonably likely to be completed on the terms
proposed, taking into account all financial, regulatory, financing, timing,
conditionality, legal and other aspects of such proposal.

  



  

(g) _Definition of Intervening Event_. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Intervening Event" means an event, fact, circumstance, development or
occurrence that (i) was not known to the Board of Directors as of the date of
this Agreement and does not relate to an Acquisition Proposal, which event or
circumstance becomes known to or by the Board of Directors prior to the
Acceptance Time or (ii) was known to the Board of Directors as of the date of
this Agreement, but the consequences of which (or the magnitude thereof) were
not.

  



  

Section 7.04. _Compensation Arrangements._  Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company (acting through its Compensation Committee) shall take all steps that
may be necessary or advisable to cause (a) each employment compensation,
severance and other employee benefit plan of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, including the Company Plans, whether entered into by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or amended prior to, on or after the date
hereof with any of its directors, officers or employees pursuant to which
consideration is payable to any director, officer or employee, (b) the
treatment of the Company Options and Company Restricted Stock Units, as
applicable, in accordance with the terms set forth in this Agreement, and (c)
the applicable terms of Section 8.02 and Section 8.03, to be approved by the
Compensation Committee as an "employment compensation, severance or other
employee benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under
the 1934 Act and to satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor
set forth in Rule 14d-10(d) of the 1934 Act.

  



  

Section 7.05. _Treatment of Convertible Notes and Capped Call Transactions_.

  



  

(a) _Treatment of Convertible Notes_. Within the time periods required by the
terms of each Indenture, the Company shall take all actions required by
the applicable Indentures to be performed by the Company prior to the
Effective Time as a result of the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
the Offer, the Merger, and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the giving of any notices that may be required prior to
the Effective Time in connection with the

  



  

51

  



    



 



    

convertibility of the Convertible Notes, the delivery to the applicable
trustee of any documents or instruments required to be delivered prior to the
Effective Time to such trustee in connection with such transactions or
otherwise required pursuant to either Indenture. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, prior to the Effective Time, the Company agrees
to cooperate with Parent, at Parent's written request, by (i) executing and
delivering (or causing to be executed and delivered, as applicable) at the
Effective Time, a supplemental indenture, officer's certificate and opinion
of counsel pursuant to Section 4.07 and Article 9, as applicable, of each
Indenture and (ii) using its reasonable best efforts to cause the trustee
under each Indenture to execute at the Effective Time such supplemental
indentures.

  



  

(b)   _Treatment of Capped Call Transactions_. The Company agrees to use __
its reasonable best efforts to reasonably cooperate with Parent, at Parent's
written request, to enter into arrangements (such arrangements to be in form
and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent) with the counterparties of
each of the Capped Call Transactions to cause such Capped Call Transactions
to be terminated and cancelled as of the Effective Time, it being understood
that the calculation and settlement of any amounts payable thereunder shall
be payable only in cash and subject to Parent's prior approval.

  



  

(c)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, it is understood and
agreed that nothing in Section 7.05 shall require the Company to (i) pay any
fees, incur or reimburse any costs or expenses, or make any payment prior to
the occurrence of the Effective Time or (ii) enter into any instrument or
agreement, or agree to any change or modification to any instrument or
agreement, that is effective prior to the occurrence of the Effective Time or
that would be effective if the Effective Time does not occur. For
the avoidance of doubt, and without limiting the foregoing in this Section
7.05, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the execution of
supplemental indentures pursuant to Section 4.07 of the Indentures by the
trustree pursuant to each Indenture, and terminating and cancelling the
Capped Call Transactions, are not Offer Conditions.

  



  

Section 7.06. _Delisting_. The Company shall reasonably cooperate with Parent
and use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under
Applicable Laws and rules and policies of NASDAQ to enable the delisting of
the Shares from the NASDAQ and the termination of its registration under the
1934 Act, in each case, as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time.

Parent agrees that:

  



  

Section 8.01. _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall take all action
necessary to cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement
and

  



  

52

  



    



 



    

to consummate the Offer and the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth
in this Agreement.

  



  

Section 8.02. _Director and Officer Liability_.

  



  

(a)  For six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall,
and Parent shall cause (including, if required, by providing sufficient funds
to) the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless the present and
former directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries and agents of the Company
and its Subsidiaries (each, an "Indemnified Person") from and against any
losses, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including attorneys' fees),
judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all
interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or
in respect of any thereof) in respect of the Indemnified Persons' having
served in such capacity prior to the Effective Time, in each case to the
fullest extent permitted by Delaware Law or any other Applicable Law or
provided under the Company's certificate of incorporation and bylaws in
effect on the date hereof. If any Indemnified Person is made party to Action
arising out of or relating to matters that would be indemnifiable pursuant to
the immediately preceding sentence, the Surviving Corporation shall, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, advance fees, costs and
expenses (including attorneys' fees and disbursements) as incurred by such
Indemnified Person in connection with and prior to the final disposition of
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation;  _provided_ , that the
Indemnified Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to
repay such advances if it is ultimately determined by a final and
nonappealable judicial determination that such Indemnified Person is not
entitled to indemnification.

  



  

(b)  For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be
maintained in effect provisions in the Surviving Corporation's certificate of
incorporation and bylaws (or in such documents of any successor to the
business of the Surviving Corporation) regarding elimination of liability of
directors, indemnification of directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries and
agents and advancement of fees, costs and expenses that are no less
advantageous to the intended beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions
in existence on the date of this Agreement.

  



  

(c)  From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor and comply with their respective
obligations under any indemnification agreement with any Indemnified Person,
and not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such agreement in any manner
that would adversely affect any right of any Indemnified Person thereunder.

  



  

(d)  Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall (after consultation with
Parent) or, if the Company is unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation as of the Effective Time to, obtain, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect for six years following the
Effective Time, an extension of the directors' and officers' liability
coverage of the Company's existing directors' and

  



  

53

  



    



 



    

officers' insurance policies and the Company's existing fiduciary liability
insurance policies (collectively, "DandO Insurance"), which DandO Insurance shall
(i) be for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six years from
and after the Effective Time with respect to any claim related to any period
of time at or prior to the Effective Time, (ii) be from an insurance carrier
with the a minimum "A-" AM Best rating, with respect to DandO Insurance and
(iii) have terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no
less favorable than the coverage provided under the Company's existing
policies with respect to any actual or alleged error, misstatement,
misleading statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or any matter
claimed against an Indemnified Person by reason of his or her having served
in such capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective Time
(including in connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions
contemplated hereby). If the Company or the Surviving Corporation for any
reason fails to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall continue to maintain in effect, for a
period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time, the DandO
Insurance in place with the Company's current insurance carrier or with an
insurance carrier with a minimum "A-" AM Best rating, with respect to DandO
Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are
no less favorable than the coverage provided under the Company's existing
policies, or the Surviving Corporation shall purchase from the
Company's current insurance carrier or from an insurance carrier with a
minimum "A-" AM Best rating, with respect to DandO Insurance comparable DandO
Insurance for such six-year period with terms, conditions, retentions and
limits of liability that are no less favorable than as provided in the
Company's existing policies; _provided_ that in no event shall Parent or the
Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such policies pursuant to this
sentence an annual premium amount in excess of 300% of the premium amount per
annum for the Company's existing policies; and _provided_ , _further_ , that
if the aggregate premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such __ amount,
the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance,
which in the Surviving Corporation's good faith determination, provide the
greatest coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior to the
Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount.

  



  

(e) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 8.02.

  



  

(f)  The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 8.02 shall be
in addition to any rights such Person may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, under
Delaware Law or any other Applicable Law or under any agreement of any
Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. These rights
shall survive consummation of the

  



  

54

  



    



 



    

Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Person.

  



  

Section 8.03. _Employee Matters._  (a) For a period commencing at the
Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary thereof (or, such shorter
period of employment, as the case may be), each Company Service Provider who
continues to provide services to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Subsidiaries (each, a "Continuing Employee") shall receive from
Parent or Merger Sub (i) an annual rate of salary, wages or commissions that
is no less favorable than the annual rate of salary, wages or commissions
provided to such Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the
expiration date of the Offer, (ii) cash bonus opportunities and aggregate
employee benefits that are no less favorable than the cash bonus
opportunities or aggregate employee benefits, as applicable, provided to such
Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the expiration date of the
Offer and (iii) severance benefits that are no less favorable than the
severance benefits for which such Continuing Employee was eligible immediately
prior to the expiration date of the Offer; _provided_  that, upon a
qualifying termination of employment, such severance benefits shall in no
event be less than six months of the annual rate of salary or wages provided
to such Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the expiration date of
the Offer.

  



  

(b) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and any of its respective Subsidiaries or any of their respective
third-party insurance providers or third party administrators to use
commercially reasonable efforts, waive all limitations as to any pre-existing
condition or waiting periods in its applicable welfare plans with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to each Continuing
Employee under any welfare plans that such employees may be eligible
to participate in after the Effective Time and to credit each Continuing
Employee for any copayments, deductibles, offsets or similar payments made
under any employee benefit plan of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
during the plan year (which includes the Acceptance Time) for purposes of
satisfying any applicable copayment, deductible, offset or similar
requirements under the comparable plans of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Subsidiaries. In addition, as of the Effective Time, Parent shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and any applicable Subsidiary to,
give Continuing Employees full credit for purposes of eligibility, vesting,
accruals and determination of level of benefits under any employee
benefit and compensation plans or arrangements maintained by Parent, Merger
Sub or an applicable Subsidiary that such employees may be eligible to
participate in after the Effective Time (each, a "Parent Plan") for such
Continuing Employees' service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, to
the same extent that such service was credited for purposes of any comparable
employee benefit or compensation plan or arrangement immediately prior to the
Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that such service shall not be
recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication
of benefits and Parent shall not be required to provide credit for any
purpose under any Parent Plan that is (i) a cash or equity
incentive compensation plan, (ii) a defined benefit pension plan, (iii) a
postretirement welfare plan or (iv) any Parent Plan under which similarly

  



  

55

  



    



 



    

situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries do not receive credit for
prior service or that is grandfathered or frozen, either with respect to level
of benefits or participation.

  



  

(c) Without limiting the generality of Section 12.06, the provisions of this
Section 8.03 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and
no current or former Company Service Provider or any other individual
associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-
party beneficiary of this Section 8.03. Nothing herein shall be deemed to (i)
establish, amend or modify any Company Plan or any other benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement maintained or sponsored by Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates, or (ii) limit the
ability of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any of their Affiliates to
discharge or terminate the employment or services of any current or former
Company Service Provider at any time or for any reason whatsoever.

  



  

Section 8.04.  _Transfer Taxes_. Except as otherwise provided in Section
3.03(c), all transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other
such similar Taxes imposed with respect to the Offer and the Merger shall be
paid by Parent and Merger Sub when due.

of its Subsidiaries or Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be,
that relate to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement;

  



  

 _provided_ that a party's good faith failure to comply with this Section
9.06 (including __ the following sentence) shall not provide any other party
the right not to effect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
except to the extent that any other provision of this Agreement
independently provides such right. The Company shall notify Parent as
promptly as practicable of any written notice or other written
communication from any party to any Material Contract to the effect that such
party has terminated or intends to terminate or otherwise
materially adversely modify its relationship with the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company as a result of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

  



  

Section 9.07. _Litigation and Proceedings_. The Company shall control the

Company or any of its directors relating to this Agreement, the Offer or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_  that the
Company shall promptly advise Parent of any such litigation of which the
Company is aware of, keep Parent reasonably informed regarding any such
litigation and give Parent the opportunity to participate, at Parent's
expense, in such litigation or other legal proceedings; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the Company agrees that it shall not settle

  



  

59

  



    



 



    

any such litigation or other legal proceedings without the prior written
consent of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned.

  



  

Section 9.08. _Takeover Statutes._  None of Parent, the Company and their
respective Subsidiaries shall take any action that would cause the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be subject to requirements
imposed by any takeover statute. If any "control share acquisition," "fair
price," "moratorium" or other antitakeover or similar statute or regulation
shall become applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub and the respective members of
their boards of directors shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law,
grant such approvals and to take such actions as are reasonably necessary so
that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated herein and otherwise to
take all such other actions as are reasonably necessary to eliminate or
minimize the effects of any such statute or regulation on the transactions
contemplated hereby.

or remedies provided by Applicable Law.

  



  

Section 12.04. _Expenses_. (a) _General_. Except as otherwise provided

shall be paid by the party incurring such cost or expense.

  



  

(b) _Termination Fee_. (i) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant

Person publicly proposes or announces an intention to make an Acquisition
Proposal, in each case that is not publicly withdrawn, (C) on the date of
termination, the Offer Conditions set forth in clauses (B) and (C) of Annex I

deemed to be a reference to "50%"), then the Company

  



  

64

Acquisition Proposal or the consummation of such Acquisition Proposal, the
Termination Fee.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent and Merger Sub
agree that, upon any termination of this Agreement under circumstances where
the Termination Fee is payable by the Company pursuant to this Section and
such Termination Fee is paid in full, except in the case of fraud
(which fraud shall be governed by Section 11.02), Parent and Merger Sub shall
be precluded from any other remedy against the Company, at law or in equity
or otherwise, and neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall seek to obtain any
recovery, judgment or damages of any kind, including consequential, indirect
or punitive damages, against the Company or any of the Company's Subsidiaries
or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, partners,
managers, members, stockholders or Affiliates or their
respective Representatives in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

Section 12.05. _Disclosures._ The parties hereto agree that any disclosure in
a particular Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall only be deemed
to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) (i)
the representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the
Company that are contained in the corresponding Section of this Agreement and
(ii) such other representations and warranties of the Company that are
contained in this Agreement to the extent that it is reasonably apparent from
the face of such disclosure that such disclosure also qualifies or applies to
such other representations and warranties. The mere inclusion of an item in
the Company Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or
warranty (or covenant, as applicable) shall not be deemed an admission that
such item represents a material exception or material fact, event or
circumstance or that such item has had or would reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

Section 12.06. _Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment_. (a) Subject to Section
12.06(b), the provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall

assigns. Except (i) as provided in Section 8.02, Section 11.02 or Section
12.04(c) and (ii) for the right of the Company, on behalf of
its stockholders, to pursue damages (which the parties acknowledge and agree
may include the benefit of the bargain lost by the Company's stockholders,
which shall be deemed in such event to be damages of the Company) incurred or
suffered as a result of Parent's or Merger Sub's Willful Breach of this
Agreement, no provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any rights,
benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other
than the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns, and
other than the right of any holders of Shares, Company Options and
Company Restricted Stock Units to receive the Merger Consideration in respect
of their Shares, Company Options and Company Restricted Stock Units, as
contemplated by Article 3.

  



  

65

  



    



 



    

(b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each other party
hereto, except that each of Parent and Merger Sub may assign its rights or
interests hereunder, in whole or in part, to any of Parent's wholly owned
Subsidiaries, _provided_ that no such assignment shall (i) relieve such Person
of its obligations __ hereunder, (ii) impose any additional or incremental
non- _de minimis_ obligation, or otherwise have any non- _de minimis_
adverse effect, on the Company or (iii) prevent or materially delay the
consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Any purported assignment, delegation or other transfer without such
consent shall be void.

  



  

Section 12.07. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard
to the conflicts of law rules of such state.

  



  

Section 12.08. _Jurisdiction._ The parties hereto agree that any suit, action
or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter
arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (whether brought by any party or any of its Affiliates or
against any party or any of its Affiliates) shall be brought in the Delaware
Chancery Court or, if such court shall not have jurisdiction, any federal
court located in the State of Delaware or other Delaware state court, and each
of the parties hereby irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of
such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any
such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by Applicable Law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have
to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such
court or that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court
has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or
proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within
or without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the
foregoing, each party agrees that service of process on such party as provided
in Section 12.01 shall be deemed effective service of process on such party.

  



  

Section 12.09. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY.

  



  

Section 12.10. _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be signed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the
same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same
instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto
shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties
hereto. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed
by each other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party
shall have any right or obligation

  



  

66

  



    



 



    

hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other
communication).

  



  

Section 12.11. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to
the subject matter of this Agreement and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both oral and written, between the parties with respect to
the subject matter of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 12.12. _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance
of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order
that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

  



  

Section 12.13. _Specific Performance._  The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with its terms, and that monetary damages, even if
available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. Accordingly, the
parties hereto agree that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions, or any other appropriate form of equitable relief, to prevent
breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the
terms and provisions hereof in any court referred to in Section 12.08,
without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy
(and each party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of
any bond in connection with such remedy), in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity.

ARTICLE X

  



  

(a) The Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law as it presently exists or may hereafter be
amended, any person who was or is made or is threatened to be made a party or
is otherwise involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a "Proceeding") by reason
of the fact that he or she, or a person for whom he or she is the legal
representative, is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the
Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another Corporation or of a
partnership, joint venture, trust, nonprofit entity, or other enterprise,
including service with respect to employee benefit plans, against all
liability and loss suffered and expenses (including attorneys' fees)
reasonably incurred by such person. The Corporation shall be required to
indemnify a person in connection with a Proceeding (or part thereof) initiated
by such person only if the Proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the
Board of the Corporation.

  



  

(b) The Corporation shall pay the expenses (including attorneys' fees)
incurred by an officer or director of the Corporation in defending any civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding in
advance of its final disposition, upon receipt of an undertaking by or on
behalf of such director or officer to repay all amounts advanced if it shall
ultimately be determined that the director or officer is not entitled to be
indemnified. Payment of such expenses incurred by former directors and
officers, or by any other employees and agents of the Corporation, may be
made by the Corporation, subject to such terms and conditions as the General
Counsel in his or her discretion deems appropriate.

  



  

(c) If a claim for indemnification or payment of expenses (including
attorneys' fees) under this Article Ten is not paid in full within sixty days
after a written claim therefor has been received by the Corporation the
claimant may file suit to recover the unpaid amount of such claim and, if
successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid the expense of
prosecuting such claim. In any such action the Corporation shall have the
burden of proving that the claimant was not entitled to the requested
indemnification or payment of expenses under applicable law.

  



  

(d) The right conferred on any person by this Article Ten shall not be
exclusive of any other rights which such person may have or hereafter acquire
under any statute, provision of this Certificate, the By-Laws, agreement,
vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

  



  

(e) The Corporation's obligation, if any, to indemnify any person who was or
is serving at its request as a director, officer, employee or agent of
another company, partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise or nonprofit
entity shall be reduced by any amount such person may collect as
indemnification from such other company, partnership, joint venture, trust,
nonprofit entity, or other enterprise.

  



  

  



    



 



    

(f) Any repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this Article
Ten shall not adversely affect any right or protection hereunder of any person
in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such repeal
or modification.
