ARTICLE II 
Legend

2.1. Securities Act Legend. Each certificate representing securities of the
Company will bear a legend substantially in the following form or as otherwise
determined by the Company until sold pursuant to, and in accordance with, the
plan of distribution contained in an effective registration statement or such
restriction is no longer required by applicable law, as determined by the
Company:

"THESE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933,
AS AMENDED, OR QUALIFIED UNDER ANY STATE SECURITIES LAWS. THE SECURITIES MAY
NOT BE OFFERED, SOLD, TRANSFERRED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF WITHOUT SUCH
REGISTRATION OR THE DELIVERY TO THE ISSUER OF AN OPINION OF COUNSEL, OR IF
PURSUANT TO RULE 144, A WRITTEN STATEMENT, SATISFACTORY TO THE ISSUER, THAT
SUCH DISPOSITION WILL NOT REQUIRE REGISTRATION OF SUCH SECURITIES UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR ANY STATE SECURITIES LAWS."

The Company will make a notation on its records and give instructions to any
transfer agent of its equity securities to implement the restrictions on
transfer established in this Agreement. Each Holder agrees and consents to the
entry of stop transfer instructions by the Company or any such transfer agent
in order to enforce the restrictions on transfer established in this
Agreement. 



ARTICLE III 
Registration

3.1. Shelf Registration Statement.

(a) Registration Requirement. Within 45 (forty-five) days of the Exchange
Date, the Company shall, at its option, file with the SEC a Shelf Registration
Statement, or file a prospectus supplement to an effective Automatic Shelf
Registration Statement on file with the SEC containing the Selling Stockholder
Information, with the SEC meeting the requirements of the Securities Act and
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Shelf Registration Statement
to be declared effective by the SEC. No Holder of Registrable Securities shall
be entitled to include any of its Registrable Securities in any Shelf
Registration pursuant to this Agreement unless and until such Holder agrees in
writing to be bound by all of the provisions of this Agreement applicable to
such Holder and furnishes to the Company in writing (or if not furnished
within 10 (ten) business days after receipt of a request therefor, the Company
shall be entitled to file a prospectus supplement or a post-effective
amendment to any then effective registration statement following the receipt
of such Selling Stockholder Information), the Selling Stockholder Information.
Each Holder as to which any Shelf Registration is being effected agrees to
furnish to the Company all Selling Stockholder Information with respect to
such Holder necessary to make the Selling Stockholder Information previously
furnished to the Company by such Holder not materially misleading.

(b) Effectiveness Requirement. Subject to the terms and conditions of Section
3.2(a)(viii), the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to keep
the Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective under the Securities
Act until all of the Registrable Securities covered by such Shelf Registration
Statement have been sold pursuant to such Shelf Registration Statement or
cease to be Registrable Securities or this Agreement otherwise terminates in
accordance with its terms (the "Effectiveness Period").

(c) Underwritten Offerings; Selection of Underwriters. If any Holder(s)
intends to distribute the Registrable Securities covered by the Shelf
Registration Statement by means of an underwritten offering of Registrable
Securities of at least $50 million in Market Value (a "Qualified Offering"),
it will so advise the Company in writing (the "Qualified Offering Notice"),
and within 10 (ten) business days of the receipt thereof, the Company will
give written notice of such request to all Holders. In such event, the selling
Holders will use one or more investment banker(s) and/or manager(s) to
administer the offering, subject to the Company's prior written consent of the
selection of such investment banker(s) and/or manager(s), which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld. If and only if the offering is a Qualified
Offering, the Company and each such Holder will (together with the other
Holders distributing their securities through such underwriting) enter into an
underwriting agreement in customary form approved by the Company with the
underwriter or underwriters selected for such underwriting (and will complete
and execute all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, and other
documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting
arrangements). The right of any Holder to an underwritten registration
pursuant to this Section 3 will be conditioned upon such Holder's
participation in such underwriting and the inclusion of the Holder's
Registrable Securities that it wishes to sell in the underwriting. If any
Holder disapproves of the terms of the underwriting, such Holder may elect to
withdraw therefrom by written notice to the Company, the managing underwriter
and the other Holders. In no event 

shall the Holders collectively be entitled to (i) more than three Qualified
Offerings and (ii) more than one Qualified Offering in any twelve-month period
pursuant to this Section 3.1.

3.2. Shelf Registration Procedures.

(a) Company Obligations. In accordance with the registration obligations of
the Company under Section 3.1, the Company will, as applicable, from and after
the Exchange Date until the end of the Effectiveness Period:

(i) use commercially reasonable efforts to have a Shelf Registration Statement
declared effective or file a prospectus supplement to an effective Automatic
Shelf Registration Statement on file with the SEC on or prior to 45 (forty-
five) days following the Exchange Date;

(ii) as promptly as reasonably practicable, prepare and file with the SEC such
amendments or post-effective amendments to the Shelf Registration Statement as
may be necessary to keep the Shelf Registration Statement continuously
effective during the Effectiveness Period (except as otherwise set forth
herein); cause the related Prospectus to be supplemented by any required
prospectus supplement, and as so supplemented to be filed pursuant to Rule 424
under the Securities Act;

(iii) at least three (3) business days prior to the filing of the Shelf
Registration Statement (other than an Automatic Shelf Registration Statement),
or any Prospectus, amendment or supplement thereto, furnish a copy thereof to
each selling Holder and its counsel;

(iv) deliver to the selling Holder, without charge, as many copies of the
Prospectus as it may reasonably request (the Company hereby consenting to the
use of each such Prospectus by such selling Holder in connection with the
offering and sale of the Registrable Securities covered by such Prospectus)
and a reasonable number of copies of the Shelf Registration Statement and any
post-effective amendments thereto and any supplements to the Prospectus,
including financial statements and schedules, all documents incorporated
therein by reference and all exhibits (including those incorporated by
reference);

(v) use commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify such
Registrable Securities under such other securities or blue sky laws of such
U.S. jurisdictions as the selling Holders reasonably request and keep such
registration or qualification effective during the Effectiveness Period, and
do any and all other acts and things that may be reasonably necessary or
advisable to enable the selling Holders to consummate the disposition in such
jurisdictions of the Registrable Securities covered by the Shelf Registration
Statement; provided, however, that the Company will not be required (i) to
qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not
otherwise be required to qualify but for this clause, (ii) to subject itself
to taxation in any such jurisdiction, (iii) to consent to general service of
process in any such jurisdiction or (iv) to comply with requirements under so-
called "fair, just and equitable standards" under state securities laws;

(vi) notify each Holder of Registrable Securities, its counsel and the
managing underwriters of an underwritten offering of Registrable Securities,
if any (A) when the Shelf Registration Statement covering such Registrable
Securities has become effective and when 

any post-effective amendments thereto become effective; (B) of any written
request by the SEC or any state securities authority for amendments and
supplements to such Shelf Registration Statement or Prospectus or for
additional information after such Shelf Registration Statement has become
effective; and (C) of the issuance or threatened issuance by the SEC or any
state securities authority of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of
such Shelf Registration Statement or the qualification of the Registrable
Securities in any jurisdiction described in Section 3.2(a)(v) hereof or the
initiation of any proceedings for that purpose;

(vii) file the reports required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations adopted by the SEC thereunder
to make available adequate current public information with respect to the
Company meeting the current public information requirements of Rule 144(c)
under the Securities Act, to the extent required to enable the Holders to sell
Registrable Securities without registration under the Securities Act within
the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rule 144;

(viii) notify each selling Holder, at any time that a prospectus covered by
the Shelf Registration Statement is required to be delivered under the
Securities Act, of the happening of any event of which it has knowledge and as
a result of which the prospectus included in the Shelf Registration Statement
as then in effect would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein not misleading, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, and, at the request of the Selling Holders, the Company
will promptly prepare a supplement or amendment to such prospectus so that, as
thereafter delivered to the selling Holders, such prospectus, as so amended or
supplemented, will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made; provided, however,
that at any time, upon written notice to the Holders and for a period not to
exceed ninety (90) days in the aggregate during any calendar year (the
"Suspension Period"), the Company may suspend the use or effectiveness of any
registration statement or prospectus (and the selling Holders hereby agree not
to offer or sell any Registrable Securities pursuant to such registration
statement or prospectus during the Suspension Period) if the Company
reasonably believes that there is or may be in existence material nonpublic
information, developments or events (including, but not limited to, a pending
or contemplated merger or acquisition or other material transaction or similar
event) involving the Company, the failure of which to be disclosed in the
prospectus included in the registration statement could constitute a material
misstatement or omission. If so directed by the Company, all Holders of
Registrable Securities registering shares under any registration statement
shall (i) not offer to sell any Registrable Securities pursuant to any such
registration statement or prospectus during the period in which the delay or
suspension is in effect after receiving notice of such delay or suspension
(and, if required, until such Holder receives copies of the supplemented or
amended Prospectus) and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to
the Company (at the Company's expense) all copies, other than permanent file
copies then in such holders' possession, of the Prospectus relating to such
Registrable Securities current at the time of receipt of such notice. The
Company covenants and agrees that it shall not deliver such notice with
respect to the Suspension Period unless Company employees, officers and
directors and any other holders of registration rights with respect to the
Company's Common Stock are also prohibited by the Company for the duration of
such Suspension Period from effecting any public sales of 

shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by them, if such holders of
registration rights sell pursuant to a registration statement;

(ix) cooperate and assist in any filings required to be made with the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority;

(x) cause all securities covered by such Shelf Registration Statement to be
listed on each securities exchange on which similar securities issued by the
Company are then listed and to be qualified for trading on each system on
which similar securities issued by the Company are from time to time
qualified;

(xi) provide a transfer agent and registrar for all securities covered by the
Shelf Registration Statement not later than the effective date of the Shelf
Registration Statement or the filing of a prospectus pursuant to an effective
Automatic Shelf Registration Statement and thereafter maintain such a transfer
agent and registrar;

(xii) take all such other actions as may be reasonably required to expedite or
facilitate the disposition of the securities covered by the Shelf Registration
Statement;

(xiii) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a cold comfort letter
from the Company's independent public accountants in customary form and
covering such matters of the type customarily covered by cold comfort letters,
which letter shall be addressed to the underwriters;

(xiv) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an opinion from the
Company's outside counsel in customary form and covering such matters of the
type customarily covered by such opinions, which opinion shall be addressed to
the underwriters and the Holders of such Registrable Securities;

(xv) make reasonably available for inspection by any underwriter participating
in any registered public offering in which Registrable Securities are included
and any attorney or accountant retained by any such underwriter (collectively,
the "Inspectors"), all financial and other records, and pertinent corporate
documents of the Company (collectively, the "Records") as shall be reasonably
made available for purposes of a due diligence investigation and reasonably
requested by such Inspector, and cause the Company's officers, directors and
employees to supply all information reasonably made available for purposes of
a due diligence investigation and reasonably requested by any such Inspector
to enable them to exercise their due diligence responsibility under the
Securities Act with respect to such registered public offering; provided,
however, that Records which the Company determines, in good faith, to be
confidential and which it notifies the Inspectors are confidential shall be
kept confidential by the Inspectors;

(xvi) in the case of no more than two Qualified Offerings, make the Company's
executive officers available for a total of five (5) business days to
participate in "road show" presentations in the United States for each such
Qualified Offering; and with respect to any Qualified Offering, make the
Company's executive officers reasonably available at the Company's principal
executive offices to discuss the affairs of the Company at times that may be
mutually and reasonably agreed upon; and 

(xvii) take reasonable efforts to prevent the entry of any stop order
suspending the effectiveness of a registration statement, and upon the
issuance of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of a registration
statement, or of any order suspending or preventing the use of any related
prospectus or suspending the qualification of any securities included in the
Shelf Registration Statement for sale in any jurisdiction, the Company will
use commercially reasonable efforts promptly to obtain the withdrawal of such
order.

(b) Selling Holder Obligations. In addition to the other obligations of the
Holders contained herein, each Holder agrees that the Company may require each
seller of Registrable Securities as to which any registration is being
effected to furnish to it the Selling Stockholder Information and any other
information that may be required by the Staff of the SEC to be included in the
applicable Shelf Registration Statement and related prospectus, the Company
may exclude from such registration the Registrable Securities of any selling
Holder who fails to furnish such information within ten (10) business days
after receiving such request, and the Company shall have no obligation to
register under the Securities Act the Registrable Securities of a Holder who
so fails to furnish such information.

the Company shall have the privilege to (i) postpone, for one time only, the

postpone, for one time in every rolling 12 (twelve) months until such
Registrable Securities are no longer outstanding, a Qualified Offering under
Sections 3.1(c), respectively, for a reasonable period of time (not exceeding
90 days) if the Company furnishes the Holders with a certificate signed by the
Chairman of the Board or the Chief Executive Officer of the Company stating
that, in its good faith judgment, the Company's board of directors has
determined that effecting the registration or filing such prospectus at such
time and/or effecting a Qualified Offering would adversely affect a material
financing, acquisition, disposition of assets or shares, merger or other
comparable transaction or would require the Company to make public disclosure
of information the public disclosure of which would have a material adverse
effect upon the Company.

3.3. Holdback Agreements. Each Holder of Registrable Securities agrees not to
effect any public sale or distribution (including sales pursuant to Rule 144)

convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such securities,
including, without limitation, any short sale, loan or hedge, during the seven
(7) days prior to and the ninety (90)-day period beginning on the effective
date of any underwritten Shelf Registration Statement in which the Registrable
Securities are included or the pricing date of any underwritten offering
pursuant to any such registration statement (except as part of any such
underwritten registration), or such longer period agreed to by the holders of
a majority of the Registrable Securities participating in such offering,
unless the underwriters managing the registered public offering otherwise
agree (the "Applicable Period"). If requested by the Company, each Holder of
Registrable Securities agrees to execute customary lock-up agreements with the
managing underwriter(s) of an underwritten offering with a duration not to
exceed the Applicable Period in such form as agreed to by the holders of a
majority of the Registrable Securities participating in such underwritten
offering.

3.4. Block-Out Rights. Notwithstanding anything contained herein, the Company
shall not be obligated to effect, or take any action to effect, a Qualified
Offering if, at the time the Company receives either a Qualified Offering
Notice, the Company (i) is actively undertaking an underwritten offering of
its capital stock, (ii) is in active discussions with underwriters, in good
faith, regarding an underwritten offering of its capital stock and it is
reasonably likely that such an underwritten offering will be initiated by the 

Company or (iii) is actively undertaking an underwritten offering pursuant to
an existing registration rights agreement on the date hereof.

3.5. Registration Expenses. The Company will pay the Registration Expenses in
connection with the Shelf Registration Statement. All other expenses will be
paid by the Holders, including, without limitation, any legal fees and
expenses of their counsel or other advisors and any underwriting discounts and
commissions and taxes of any kind (including without limitation, transfer
taxes) relating to any disposition, sale or transfer of Registrable
Securities. The term "Registration Expenses" means any and all expenses
incident to the Company's performance of or compliance with this Agreement,
including, without limitation, all registration and filing fees, fees and
expenses of compliance with securities or blue sky laws, printing expenses,
messenger and delivery expenses, and fees and expenses of counsel for the
Company and all independent certified public accountants, including the
expenses of "comfort letters" required by or incident to such performance and
compliance.

3.6. Indemnification; Contribution.

(a) Indemnification by the Company. In connection with any registration
statement in which a Holder of Registrable Securities is participating, the
Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless, to the full extent permitted by
law, each such Holder of Registrable Securities, their officers, directors,
members, and employees and each Person who controls such Holder (within the
meaning of the Securities Act) against any and all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, joint or several, together with reasonable out-of-pocket costs
and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees), to which such indemnified
party may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as
such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (or actions or proceedings,
whether commenced or threatened, in respect thereof) arise out of, are based
upon, are caused by, or result from (i) any untrue or alleged untrue statement
of material fact contained (A) in any such registration statement, prospectus,
or preliminary prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or
(B) in any application or other document or communication (in this Section 3.6
collectively called an "application") executed by or on behalf of the Company
or based upon written information furnished by or on behalf of the Company
filed in any jurisdiction in order to qualify any securities covered by such
registration statement under the "blue sky" or securities laws thereof, (ii)
any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in light of the
circumstances under which they were made in the case of any prospectus) not
misleading, or (iii) any violation or alleged violation by the Company in
connection with any offering under this Agreement of the federal securities
laws, any applicable state law or any rule or regulation promulgated under the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any applicable state securities law, and
the Company will reimburse such Holder and each such director, officer, member
and employee for any legal or any other expenses incurred by them in
connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, liability,
action, or proceeding; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable
in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability
(or action or proceeding in respect thereof), or expense arises out of, is
based upon, is caused by, or results from an untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement, or omission or alleged omission, made in such registration
statement, any such prospectus or preliminary prospectus or any amendment or
supplement thereto, or in any application, in reliance upon, and in conformity
with, written information prepared and furnished to the Company by such Holder
(including, without limitation, the Selling Stockholder Information) or other
indemnified party or underwriter (in the case of an underwritten offering)
expressly for use therein or by such Holder's failure to deliver a copy of the
registration statement or prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto
after the Company has 

furnished such Holder with a sufficient number of copies of the same;
provided, further, that the indemnification required by this Section 3.6(a)
shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage,
liability or expense if such settlement is effected without the consent of the
Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

(b) Indemnification by Selling Holder. In connection with any registration
statement in which a Holder of Registrable Securities is participating, each
such Holder will furnish to the Company in writing such information and
affidavits as the Company reasonably requests for use in connection with any
such registration statement or prospectus (including, without limitation, the
Selling Stockholder Information) and, to the full extent permitted by law,
will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, and each of its directors,
officers, agents retained in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, employees and each other Person who controls the Company (within the
meaning of the Securities Act) against any losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, joint or several, together with reasonable costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorney's fees), to which such indemnified party may
become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses,
claims, damages, or liabilities (or actions or proceedings, whether commenced
or threatened, in respect thereof) arise out of, are based upon, are caused
by, or result from (i) any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact
contained in the registration statement, prospectus or preliminary prospectus
or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or in any application, (ii) any
omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein (in light of the circumstances
under which they were made in the case of any prospectus) not misleading, but
only to the extent that such untrue statement or omission is made in such
registration statement, any such prospectus or preliminary prospectus or any
amendment or supplement thereto, or in any application, in reliance upon and
in conformity with written information prepared and furnished to the Company
by such Holder expressly for use therein (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, the Selling Stockholder Information), or (iii) any violation or alleged
violation by such Holder in connection with any offering under this Agreement
of the federal securities laws, any applicable state law or any rule or
regulation promulgated under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any
applicable state securities law; provided, however, that the liability of a
Holder under this Section 3.6(b) shall be limited to the net proceeds (before
expenses) received by it from the sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to
such registration statement.

(c) Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings. Promptly after receipt by an
indemnified party under this Section 3.6 of notice of the commencement of any
action, suit, proceeding, investigation or threat thereof made in writing for
which such indemnified party may make a claim under this Section 3.6, such
indemnified party shall deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice of
the commencement thereof and the indemnifying party shall have the right to
participate in, and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly
with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume the defense
thereof with counsel retained by the indemnifying party (in which case the
indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and
expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or
parties); provided, however, that such counsel shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the indemnified party. The failure to deliver written notice
to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time following the commencement
of any such action, if it prejudices or results in forfeiture of rights or
defenses, shall relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the
indemnified party under this Section 3.6, to the extent of any damage directly
suffered by the indemnifying party as a result thereof. Any reasonable out-of-
pocket fees and expenses incurred by the indemnified party (including any fees
and expenses incurred in connection with investigating or preparing to defend
such action 

or proceeding) shall be paid to the indemnified party, as incurred, within
thirty (30) days of written notice thereof to the indemnifying party. Any such
indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such
action, claim or proceeding and to participate in the defense thereof, but the
fees and expenses of such counsel shall be the expenses of such indemnified
party unless (i) the indemnifying party has agreed to pay such fees and
expenses, (ii) the indemnifying party shall have failed to promptly assume the
defense of such action, claim or proceeding or (iii) the named parties to any
such action, claim or proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include
both such indemnified party and the indemnifying party, and such indemnified
party shall have been advised by counsel that there may be one or more legal
defenses available to it which are different from or in addition to those
available to the indemnifying party (in which case, if such indemnified party
notifies the indemnifying party in writing that it elects to employ separate
counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party shall
not have the right to assume the defense of such action, claim or proceeding
on behalf of such indemnified party, it being understood, however, that the
indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any one such action, claim or
proceeding or separate but substantially similar or related actions, claims or
proceedings in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general
allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses
of more than one additional firm of attorneys (together with appropriate local
counsel) at any time for all such indemnified parties. No indemnifying party
shall be liable to an indemnified party for any settlement of any action,
proceeding or claim without the written consent of the indemnifying party,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

(d) Contribution. If the indemnification required by this Section 3.6 from the
indemnifying party is unavailable to an indemnified party hereunder in respect
of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to in this
Section 3.6:

(i) The indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party,
shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a
result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying
party and indemnified parties in connection with the actions which resulted in
such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other
relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of such indemnifying
party and indemnified parties shall be determined by reference to, among other
things, whether any action has been committed by, or relates to information
supplied by, such indemnifying party or indemnified parties, and the parties'
relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct
or prevent such action. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of
the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall
be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 3.6(a)
and Section 3.6(b), any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by
such party in connection with any investigation or proceeding. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the liability of a Holder under this Section 3.6(d) shall be
limited to the net proceeds (before expenses) received by it from the sale of
securities pursuant to the applicable registration statement.

(ii) The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contribution pursuant to this Section 3.6(d) were determined by pro rata
allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take into
account the equitable considerations referred to in Section 3.6(d)(i). No
Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section
11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person
who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. 

(e) Full Indemnification. If indemnification is available under this Section
3.6, the indemnifying parties shall indemnify each indemnified party to the
full extent provided in this Section 3.6 without regard to the relative fault
of such indemnifying party or indemnified party or any other equitable
consideration referred to in Section 3.6(d)(i) hereof.

(f) Survival. The obligations of the Company, the Holders of Registrable
Securities under this Section 3.6 shall survive the completion of any offering
of securities pursuant to a registration statement under this Agreement, and
otherwise.

confer or be deemed to create or confer any third party beneficiary rights in
any person or other legal entity not party to this Agreement.

4.4. Assignment. The rights and obligations of the Put Holders pursuant to
this Agreement are not assignable except that such rights and obligations as
they relate to a particular security will be 

automatically assigned to any transferee of such security if such security was

waiver, by the party taking such action, of the other party's compliance with

the part of any party in exercising any right or remedy under this Agreement
will operate as a waiver thereof or of any other right or remedy. No waiver by

exercise of any other right or remedy.

4.7. Further Assurances. Each party to this Agreement hereby covenants and

(b) The terms "hereof", "herein" and "herewith" and words of similar import

unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall be ineffective to the extent of such

in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such
provision in any other jurisdiction.

4.10. Business Days. If the last or appointed day for the taking of any action

and the Put Holders with respect to those matters.

4.12. Remedies. All remedies under this Agreement are cumulative and are not
exclusive of any other remedies provided by applicable law. The parties agree
and acknowledge that money damages may not be an adequate remedy for any
breach by a party of the provisions of this Agreement and that the any party
may in its sole discretion apply to a court of law or equity of competent
jurisdiction (without posting any bond or other security) for specific
performance and for other injunctive relief to enforce or prevent violation of
the provisions of this Agreement.

shall be governed by and interpreted and enforced in accordance with the laws

other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of New York.
