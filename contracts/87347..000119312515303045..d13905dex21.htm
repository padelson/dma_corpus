AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") dated as of August 25,
2015, is by and among Schlumberger Holdings Corporation, a Delaware
corporation and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Schlumberger
("Schlumberger US"), Rain Merger Sub LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Schlumberger US ("Merger Sub"),
Schlumberger N.V., a Curaçao corporation ("Schlumberger"), and Cameron
International Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Cameron").

 

RECITALS

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Cameron, Schlumberger US,
Merger Sub and Schlumberger have deemed it advisable and in the best interests
of their respective companies and equity holders that Cameron, Schlumberger US
and Schlumberger engage in a business combination whereby Schlumberger US
will acquire all of the outstanding capital stock of Cameron in exchange for
shares of Schlumberger common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the
"Schlumberger Common Stock"), and cash;

WHEREAS, in furtherance thereof, the respective Boards of Directors of
Cameron, Schlumberger US, Merger Sub and Schlumberger have approved and
declared advisable (1) this Agreement and (2) the merger of Merger Sub with
and into Cameron (the "Merger") in accordance with the applicable provisions
of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL") and the Delaware Limited
Liability Company Act (the "Delaware LLC Act") and upon the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement; and

 

WHEREAS, Schlumberger US, Merger Sub, Schlumberger and Cameron intend that the
Merger be treated for United States federal income tax purposes as an
acquisition by Schlumberger US of stock of Cameron that does not qualify as a
reorganization under Section 368(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the "Code"), and, therefore, that those stockholders of Cameron
who are subject to United States federal income tax recognize gain or loss on
the exchange of their stock of Cameron for Schlumberger Common Stock and cash;

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and their respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in
this Agreement, the parties agree as follows:

Article 1

 

THE MERGER

 

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to conditions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into
Cameron in accordance with this Agreement, and the separate limited liability
company existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease. Cameron shall be the
surviving entity in the Merger (the "Surviving Entity"). The Merger shall
have the effects specified herein and in the DGCL and the Delaware LLC Act.

  

  

 

Section 1.2 _The Closing_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place
(a) at the offices of Baker Botts L.L.P., One Shell Plaza, 910 Louisiana
Street, Houston, Texas 77002, at 9:00 a.m., local time, on the first business
day or, if Schlumberger so elects, on the third business day, in each case
immediately following the day on which the last to be fulfilled or waived of
the conditions set forth in Article 9 (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be fulfilled at the Closing, but subject to fulfillment
or waiver of such conditions) shall be fulfilled or waived in accordance with
this Agreement or (b) at such other time, date or place as Schlumberger and
Cameron may agree. The date on which the Closing occurs is hereinafter
referred to as the "Closing Date."

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date, Schlumberger US, Merger
Sub, Schlumberger and Cameron shall cause a certificate of merger (the
"Certificate of Merger") meeting the requirements of Section 251 of the DGCL
and Section 18-209 of the Delaware LLC Act to be properly executed and filed
in accordance with such sections. The Merger shall become effective at such
time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware in accordance with the DGCL and the Delaware LLC Act,
or at such later time that Schlumberger and Cameron shall have agreed upon and
designated in such filing as the effective time of the Merger (the "Effective
Time").

represent the right to receive (i) 0.716 shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Schlumberger Common

a combination thereof, that number of shares of Schlumberger Common Stock that
are to be delivered by Schlumberger US to the holders of Cameron Common Stock
pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(b) _Cancellation of Shares (other than Cameron Excluded Shares and Cameron
Surviving Shares)_. As a result of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holders thereof, at the Effective Time, all shares of Cameron
Common Stock (other than Cameron Excluded Shares and any Cameron Surviving
Shares) shall cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and each certificate that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented any shares of Cameron Common Stock (other than
Cameron Excluded Shares and any Cameron Surviving Shares) (the "Certificates")
and each non-certificated share represented by book entry ("Book Entry
Share") shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration with respect to the shares of Cameron Common Stock formerly
represented thereby, and any dividends or other distributions to which the
holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 4.2(c). For purposes of this
Agreement, "Cameron Excluded Shares" shall mean (i) any shares of Cameron
Common Stock held by Schlumberger, Cameron or any direct or indirect wholly
owned subsidiary of Schlumberger, in each case except for any such shares held
on behalf of third parties, and (ii) any Dissenting Shares. "Cameron Surviving
Shares" shall mean any shares of Cameron Common Stock held by any direct or
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Cameron except for any such shares held on
behalf of third parties.

 

(c) _Cancellation of Cameron Excluded Shares_. Each Cameron Excluded Share at
the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holder thereof, cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled
and retired without payment of any consideration therefor, and no Schlumberger
Common Stock or other consideration shall be 

 



3

   

  

 

 delivered in exchange therefor, subject to the right of the holder of any
Dissenting Share to receive the payment to which reference is made in Section
4.4.

 

(d) _Survival of Cameron Surviving Shares_. Each Cameron Surviving Share at
the Effective Time shall remain outstanding and shall continue to exist as a
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Entity
("Surviving Entity Common Stock") and shall not be canceled by virtue of the
Merger and no Schlumberger Common Stock or other consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

(e) _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, the member interests of Merger
Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
be converted into and become a number of validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Surviving Entity Common Stock equal to the number of
shares of Cameron Common Stock converted into the Merger Consideration.

(f)  _Cameron Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, all options to acquire
shares of Cameron Common Stock outstanding and unexercised immediately prior
to the Effective Time under Camerons stock plans (collectively, the "Cameron
Stock Plans", which are identified in Section 4.1(f) of the Cameron
Disclosure Letter), including all options to acquire shares of Cameron Common
Stock issued after the date hereof in accordance with Section 8.1(b)(iv)
(each, a "Cameron Post-Signing Option", and together with any other option to
acquire shares of Cameron Common Stock, each a "Cameron Option"), shall cease
to represent a right to acquire Cameron Common Stock and shall be converted
automatically into an option (a "Converted Option") to acquire shares of
Schlumberger Common Stock in amounts and at an exercise price determined as
provided in this Section 4.1(f) (and otherwise subject to the terms of the
Cameron Stock Plans, as applicable, under which they were issued and the
agreements evidencing grants thereunder except as provided in this Section
4.1(f)). The number of shares of Schlumberger Common Stock to be subject to a
Converted Option shall be equal to the product of the number of shares of
Cameron Common Stock subject to the Cameron Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, _provided_ that
any fractional shares of Schlumberger Common Stock resulting from such
multiplication shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share. The exercise
price per share of Schlumberger Common Stock under a Converted Option shall be
equal to the exercise price per share of Cameron Common Stock under the
original Cameron Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the
Equity Award Exchange Ratio, _provided_ that such exercise price shall be
rounded up to the nearest whole cent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
exercise price and/or the number of shares of Schlumberger Common Stock that
may be purchased under each such Converted Option shall be further adjusted to
the extent required to remain in compliance with, or exempt from,
the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder (collectively "Section 409A") and, in the case of each
Cameron Option that is intended to qualify as an "incentive stock option"
within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, the exercise price and the
number of shares of Schlumberger Common Stock subject to the Converted Option
shall be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section
424 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. The
duration and other terms of a Converted Option (including terms relating to
acceleration of vesting upon termination of employment) shall otherwise remain
the same as the original Cameron Option from which it was converted except
that all references to "Cameron" in such original Cameron

 



4

   

  

 

 Option shall be deemed to be references to Schlumberger. For purposes of
this Agreement, (1) "Equity Award Exchange Ratio" means the sum of (i) the
Exchange Ratio and (ii) the quotient of the Per Share Cash Amount divided by
the Schlumberger Per Share Fair Market Value, and (2) "Schlumberger Per Share
Fair Market Value" means the average of the volume weighted average price per
share of Schlumberger Common Stock on the NYSE Composite Transactions Tape
(as reported by Bloomberg L.P. or such other authoritative source as mutually
agreed between Cameron and Schlumberger) on each of the five consecutive
trading days ending with the second complete trading day immediately prior to
the Effective Time.

(g) _Cameron Restricted Stock Unit Awards_. At the Effective Time, each
restricted stock unit award granted under any Cameron Stock Plan
(collectively, the "Cameron Restricted Stock Unit Awards") that is outstanding
and unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time, including the
Cameron Restricted Stock Unit Awards granted after the date hereof pursuant
to Section 8.1(b)(iv) ("Cameron Post-Signing Restricted Stock Unit Awards"),
shall be converted into and become a right to receive a restricted stock unit
with respect to Schlumberger Common Stock with substantially the same terms
as those of the applicable Cameron Restricted Stock Unit Award and the
agreement by which such Cameron Restricted Stock Unit Award is evidenced, as
in effect as of the date of this Agreement (all outstanding Cameron
Restricted Stock Unit Awards that are assumed pursuant to this Section 4.1(g)
are hereafter referred to as "Assumed RSUs"). All rights to receive shares of
Cameron Common Stock under Assumed RSUs shall thereupon be converted into
rights to receive restricted stock units with respect to Schlumberger Common
Stock. Accordingly, from and after the Effective Time: (A) each Assumed RSU
award will be settled in shares of Schlumberger Common Stock; (B) the number
of shares of Schlumberger Common Stock subject to each Assumed RSU award shall
be determined by multiplying the number of shares of Cameron Common Stock that
were subject to such Assumed RSU award immediately prior to the Effective
Time by the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, and rounding the resulting number to
the nearest whole number of shares of Schlumberger Common Stock; and (C) any
conditions and restrictions on the receipt of any Assumed RSUs shall continue
in full force and effect and the term, vesting schedule and other provisions
of such Assumed RSUs (including terms relating to acceleration of vesting upon
termination of employment) shall otherwise remain unchanged as a result of
the assumption of such Assumed RSUs.

(h) _Cameron Deferred Stock Unit Awards_. At the Effective Time, each deferred
stock unit granted or deferred under any Cameron Stock Plan (collectively,
the "Cameron Deferred Stock Unit Awards") that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, Cameron, Schlumberger US, Merger
Sub or Schlumberger, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration based on the total number of shares of Cameron Common
Stock subject to such Cameron Deferred Stock Unit Award immediately prior to
the Effective Time.

(i) _Cameron Performance Share Awards_. At the Effective Time, each
performance-based restricted stock unit award granted under any Cameron Stock
Plan (collectively, the "Cameron Performance Share Awards") that is
outstanding and unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be converted into and become a fully vested deferred stock unit with respect
to Schlumberger Common Stock with the same payment

 



5

   

  

 

 schedule as the applicable Cameron Performance Share Award and the agreement
by which such Cameron Performance Share Award is evidenced, as in effect as of
the date of this Agreement (all outstanding Cameron Performance Share Awards
that are assumed pursuant to this Section 4.1(i) are hereafter referred to as
"Converted Performance Shares"). All rights to receive shares of Cameron
Common Stock under Converted Performance Shares shall thereupon be converted
into fully vested deferred stock units with respect to Schlumberger Common
Stock. Accordingly, from and after the Effective Time: (A) each Converted
Performance Share award will be settled in shares of Schlumberger Common
Stock; and (B) the number of shares of Schlumberger Common Stock subject to
each Converted Performance Share award shall be determined by (i) for that
portion of the Cameron Performance Share Award subject to performance against
a TSR goal, multiplying the number of shares of Cameron Common Stock that were
subject to such portion of the Converted Performance Share award earned at the
attainment level determined by the Compensation Committee of the Cameron
Board as of the Effective Time by the Equity Award Exchange Ratio plus (ii)
for that portion of the Cameron Performance Share Award subject to performance
against a ROIC goal, multiplying the number of shares of Cameron Common
Stock that were subject to such portion of the Converted Performance Share
award earned at the attainment level determined based on methodology set forth
on Section 4.1(i) of the Cameron Disclosure Letter by the Equity Award
Exchange Ratio, and rounding the resulting number to the nearest whole number
of shares of Schlumberger Common Stock.

(j) _Assumed Awards_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1) Schlumberger US
shall assume all obligations with respect to each Converted Option, Assumed
RSU award, and Converted Performance Share award (collectively the "Assumed
Awards"), (2) each Assumed Award shall, in accordance with its terms, be
subject to further adjustment as appropriate to reflect any stock split,
division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split,
consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar
transaction with respect to Schlumberger Common Stock subsequent to the
Effective Time; (3) the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of
Schlumberger shall succeed to the authority and responsibility of the Cameron
Board or any committee thereof with respect to each Assumed Award; (4) each
Assumed Award shall be subject to administrative procedures consistent with
those in effect under Schlumbergers equity compensation plan; and (5) each
Assumed Award shall be provided with dividend equivalent rights to the extent
provided to Schlumberger awards of a comparable type.

 

(k) _Withholding_. Cameron shall make arrangements reasonably satisfactory to
Schlumberger US to satisfy all employment and income tax withholding
requirements, if applicable, with respect to each Cameron Restricted Stock
Unit Award, Cameron Performance Share Award or Cameron Deferred Stock Unit
Award as a result of the consummation of the transactions as contemplated by
this Agreement.

(l) _Post-Signing Equity Awards_. Any Cameron Post-Signing Restricted Stock
Unit Award and Cameron Post-Signing Option shall, as of the Effective Time,
cease to represent a right to receive Cameron Common Stock and shall be
converted into an award of applicable type (a "Schlumberger Stock Incentive
Award") with respect to a number of whole shares of Schlumberger Common Stock
in the same manner described in Section 4.1(f) and (g) above.

 



6

   

  

 

Section 4.2 _Exchange of Shares_.

 

(a) _Exchange Fund_. As of the Effective Time, Schlumberger US shall appoint a
commercial bank or trust company or such other party as is reasonably
satisfactory to Cameron to act as exchange agent hereunder for the purpose of
exchanging Certificates and Book Entry Shares for the Merger Consideration
(the "Exchange Agent"). Immediately after receiving the shares of
Schlumberger Common Stock from Schlumberger pursuant to the last sentence of
Section 4.1(a), Schlumberger US shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, in
trust for the benefit of holders of shares of Cameron Common Stock, the number
of shares of Schlumberger Common Stock that are issuable pursuant to Section
4.1 and an amount of cash representing the aggregate cash consideration
payable pursuant to Section 4.1. Schlumberger US shall deposit such shares
of Schlumberger Common Stock with the Exchange Agent by providing to the
Exchange Agent an uncertificated book-entry for such shares. In addition,
Schlumberger US shall make available to the Exchange Agent from time to time
as needed, cash sufficient to make payments for the cash consideration
pursuant to Section 4.1, payments in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
Section 4.2(e) and any dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section
4.2(c). Any cash and shares of Schlumberger Common Stock deposited by
Schlumberger US with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as
the "Exchange Fund."

 

(b) _Exchange Rules._ Promptly after the Effective Time, Schlumberger US shall
cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of one or more
shares of Cameron Common Stock as of the Effective Time: (i) a letter of
transmittal (the "Letter of Transmittal"), which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the shares of Cameron Common
Stock shall pass, only upon delivery of the corresponding Certificates to the
Exchange Agent or receipt by the Exchange Agent of an "agents message" with
respect to Book Entry Shares, which letter shall be in customary form and
have such other provisions as Schlumberger US may reasonably specify, and (ii)
instructions for effecting the surrender of such Certificates or Book Entry
Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Each holder of shares of
Cameron Common Stock that have been converted into a right to receive the
Merger Consideration, upon surrender of a Certificate or Book Entry Shares to
the Exchange Agent together with such Letter of Transmittal, duly executed
and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, will be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor (i) one or more shares of
Schlumberger Common Stock which shall be in uncertificated book-entry form
and which shall represent, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares that
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 4.1(a) (after taking
into account all shares of Cameron Common Stock then held by such holder) and
(ii) a check in the amount equal to any cash that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to this Article 4, consisting of the cash consideration
pursuant to Section 4.1, cash in lieu of any fractional shares of
Schlumberger Common Stock pursuant to Section 4.2(e) and any dividends and
other distributions pursuant to Section 4.2(c). No interest will be paid or
will accrue on any cash payable pursuant to Section 4.2(c) or Section 4.2(e).
In the event of a transfer of ownership of Cameron Common Stock that is not
registered in the transfer records of Cameron, one or more shares of
Schlumberger Common Stock evidencing, in the aggregate, the proper number of
shares of Schlumberger Common Stock and a check in the amount equal to any
cash that is payable pursuant to Section 4.1(a) and any cash in lieu of any
fractional shares of Schlumberger Common Stock pursuant to Section 4.2(e) and
any dividends 

 



7

   

  

 

 or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
4.2(c), may be issued with respect to such Cameron Common Stock, as the case
may be, to such a transferee if the Certificate representing such shares of
Cameron Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that
any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid.

 

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. All shares of
Schlumberger Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be deemed
issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time. No dividends or other
distributions declared or made in respect of Schlumberger Common Stock shall
be paid to the holder of any shares of Cameron Common Stock until the holder
of such shares shall surrender such shares in accordance with this Article 4.
Subject to Applicable Law, following surrender of any such shares, there shall
be issued and/or paid to the holder of the whole shares of Schlumberger Common
Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such
surrender, the dividends or other distributions payable in respect of such
shares of Schlumberger Common Stock with a record date after the Effective
Time and a payment date on or prior to the date of such surrender and not
previously paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or
other distributions payable with respect to such shares of Schlumberger Common
Stock with a record date after the Effective Time but on or prior to the date
of such surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such surrender.

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Cameron Common Stock_. All shares of
Schlumberger Common Stock issued and cash paid upon conversion of shares of
Cameron Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Article 4 (including
any cash paid pursuant to Section 4.2(c) or Section 4.2(e)) shall be deemed
to have been issued or paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
the shares of Cameron Common Stock previously represented by such Certificates
and/or Book Entry Shares.

 

(e) _No Fractional Shares of Schlumberger Common Stock_.

 

(i) No certificates or scrip or shares of Schlumberger Common Stock
representing fractional shares of Schlumberger Common Stock or book-entry
credit of the same shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates and/or Book Entry Shares and such fractional share interests will
not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights of a stockholder
of Schlumberger.

(ii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of
shares of Cameron Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would
otherwise have been entitled to receive a fractional share of Schlumberger
Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates and/or Book Entry
Shares held by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without
interest) in an amount equal to the product of (A) such fractional part of a
share of Schlumberger Common Stock multiplied by (B) the closing price for a
share of Schlumberger Common Stock on the NYSE Composite Transactions Tape on
the business day immediately preceding the Closing Date.

 



8

   

  

 

(iii) As promptly as practicable after the determination of the amount of
cash, if any, to be paid to holders of fractional interests, the Exchange
Agent shall so notify Schlumberger US, and Schlumberger US shall deposit or
cause the Surviving Entity to deposit such amount with the Exchange Agent and
shall cause the Exchange Agent to forward payments to such holders of
fractional interests subject to and in accordance with the terms hereof.

(f)  _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Schlumberger US shall be entitled to
require the Exchange Agent to deliver to Schlumberger US or otherwise on the
instruction of Schlumberger US any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates and/or Book Entry Shares
as of the date six months after the Effective Time, and any holders of the
Certificates and/or Book Entry Shares who have not theretofore complied with
this Article 4 shall thereafter look only to Schlumberger US for the Merger
Consideration with respect to the shares of Cameron Common Stock formerly
represented thereby to which such holders are entitled pursuant to Section
4.1, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Schlumberger Common Stock to which
such holders are entitled pursuant to Section 4.2(e) and any dividends or
distributions with respect to shares of Schlumberger Common Stock to which
such holders are entitled pursuant to Section 4.2(c). Any such portion of the
Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Cameron Common Stock
five years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to
such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any Governmental Entity) shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law,
become the property of Schlumberger US free and clear of any claims or
interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

 

(g) _No Liability_. None of Schlumberger US, Merger Sub, Schlumberger,
Cameron, the Surviving Entity, any affiliate of any of the foregoing or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any Merger
Consideration from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official or
Governmental Entity pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law. 

(h) _Investment of the Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any
cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Schlumberger US on a daily
basis; _provided_ that no such gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts
payable to the stockholders of Cameron pursuant to this Article 4 and that if
at any time prior to the termination of the Exchange Fund pursuant to Section
4.2(f), the amount of cash included in the Exchange Fund is reduced below the
amount necessary to pay any cash that is payable pursuant to Section 4.1(a)
and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Schlumberger Common Stock
payable pursuant to Section 4.2(e), and dividends and distributions payable
pursuant to Section 4.2(c), Schlumberger US shall promptly deposit additional
cash into the Exchange Fund sufficient to rectify this deficiency.
Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid
promptly to Schlumberger US.

(i) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required
by Schlumberger, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable
amount as Schlumberger US may direct as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall
deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
applicable

 



9

   

  

 

 Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Schlumberger
Common Stock to which the holder is entitled pursuant to Section 4.2(e) and
any dividends and distributions with respect to shares of Schlumberger Common
Stock to which the holder is entitled pursuant to Section 4.2(c), in each case
with respect to the shares of Cameron Common Stock formerly represented by
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate.

 

(j) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Exchange Agent, Schlumberger US and the
Surviving Entity shall be entitled, without duplication, to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any holder of shares of Cameron Common Stock or any other equity rights in
Cameron such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
the making of such payment under the Code and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, or any provision of Applicable Law and shall further
be entitled to sell Schlumberger Common Stock otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement to satisfy any such withholding requirement (which
Schlumberger Common Stock will be valued with respect to such withholding at
the average of the high and low trading prices of Schlumberger Common Stock on
the NYSE Composite Transactions Tape on the day of such sale). To the extent
that amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent, Schlumberger or the
Surviving Entity, as the case may be, and paid over to the applicable
Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

(k)  _Further Assurances_. After the Effective Time, the officers and
directors of the Surviving Entity will be authorized to execute and deliver,
in the name and on behalf of Cameron, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or
assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of Cameron, any
other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in
the Surviving Entity any and all right, title and interest in, to and under
any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the
Surviving Entity as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

(l) _Stock Transfer Books_. The stock transfer books of Cameron shall be
closed immediately upon the Effective Time and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Cameron Common Stock thereafter on the
records of Cameron. At or after the Effective Time, any Certificates or Book
Entry Shares presented to the Exchange Agent or Schlumberger US for any reason
shall represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration with respect to
the shares of Cameron Common Stock formerly represented thereby (including
any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Schlumberger Common Stock to which
the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 4.2(e)) and any dividends
or other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to
Section 4.2(c).

Section 4.3 _Certain Adjustments_. If, subsequent to the date of this
Agreement but prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding Schlumberger
Common Stock or Cameron Common Stock shall have been changed by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, split-up, combination or
exchange of shares, or a stock dividend or dividend payable in any other
securities shall be declared with a record date within such period, or any
similar event shall have occurred, the Exchange Ratio, the Per Share Cash
Amount, the Merger Consideration, the Equity Award Exchange Ratio and any
other similarly dependent items, as the case may be, shall be

 



10

   

  

 

 appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of Cameron Common Stock
consideration having the same economic effect as was contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such event.

 

Section 4.4 _Appraisal Rights_. No holder of Dissenting Shares (a "Dissenting
Stockholder") shall be entitled to any Merger Consideration or dividends or
other distributions pursuant to Section 4.2(c) in respect of such Dissenting
Shares unless and until such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost such holders right to seek appraisal of its
Dissenting Shares under the DGCL, and any Dissenting Stockholder shall be
entitled to receive only the payment provided by Section 262 of the DGCL with
respect to the Dissenting Shares owned by such Dissenting Stockholder. If any
person who otherwise would be deemed a Dissenting Stockholder shall have
failed properly to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost the
right to seek appraisal with respect to any Dissenting Shares,
such Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be treated as though such Dissenting
Shares had been converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section
4.1. Cameron shall give Schlumberger US (a) prompt notice of any written
demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to Applicable Law received by Cameron relating to
stockholders rights of appraisal and (b) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demand for appraisal under the
DGCL. Cameron shall not, except with the prior written consent of Schlumberger
US, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisals of
Dissenting Shares, offer to settle or settle any such demands or approve any
withdrawal of any such demands. For purposes of this Agreement, "Dissenting
Shares" means shares of Cameron Common Stock as to which the holder thereof
has exercised appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL.

represents and warrants to Schlumberger US and Schlumberger that:

the character of the properties owned or leased by it therein or in which the
transaction of its business makes such

 



11

   

  

 

 qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified has not
had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Cameron Material Adverse Effect. Cameron has made available to
Schlumberger true and correct copies of Camerons certificate of incorporation
and bylaws, each as amended to date, and each as so delivered is in full force
and effect.

 

Section 5.2 _Authorization, Validity, Enforceability and Fairness_.

deliver this Agreement and all other agreements and documents contemplated
hereby to which it is a party and to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, subject in the case of the consummation of the Merger to
the Cameron Stockholder Approval. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation by Cameron of the transactions contemplated
hereby have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action on behalf
of Cameron, other than the Cameron Stockholder Approval and the filing of the
Certificate of Merger. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
Cameron and constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of Cameron,
enforceable against Cameron in accordance with its terms.

called and held on or prior to the date hereof, has unanimously (i)
determined that this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions

submitted to the holders of Cameron Common Stock for their adoption. The
Cameron Board has received the opinion of Camerons financial advisor, Credit
Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, dated the date this Agreement was approved by
the Cameron Board, to the effect that, as of such date and subject to the
assumptions, qualifications, limitations and other matters considered in
connection with the preparation of such opinion, the Merger Consideration
to be received by the holders of Cameron Common Stock in the Merger pursuant
to this Agreement is fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of
Cameron Common Stock (a written copy of which opinion will be provided to
Schlumberger for informational purposes only promptly after receipt thereof
by the Cameron Board).

Section 5.3 _Capitalization_.

 

(a) The authorized capital stock of Cameron consists of 400,000,000 shares of

file any registration statement, prospectus, report, schedule, form, statement
or any other document with the SEC. No Subsidiary of Cameron is, or since
January 1, 2012 has been, subject to any requirement to file periodic reports
under the Exchange Act. As of their respective dates (or, if amended, as of
the date of such amendment), the Cameron Reports complied in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act, the Securities
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and complied in all material
respects with applicable accounting standards. As of their respective dates
(or, if amended, as of the date of such amendment), the Cameron Reports did
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading.

the consolidated statements of comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in
equity included in or incorporated by reference into the Cameron Reports
(including any related notes and schedules) fairly presents, in all material
respects, the results of operations, cash flows or changes in equity, as the
case may be, of Cameron and its Subsidiaries for the periods set forth
therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to (i) such exceptions
as may be permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC and (ii) normal year-end audit
adjustments which have not been and are not expected to be material), in each
case in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP")
consistently applied during the periods involved, except as may be noted
therein.

(c) There are no liabilities or obligations of Cameron or any of
its Subsidiaries (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise and
whether or not required to be disclosed) that would be required to be
reflected on, or reserved against in, a balance sheet of Cameron or in the
notes thereto prepared in accordance with GAAP, other than liabilities or
obligations to the extent (i) (A) reflected or reserved against on the
consolidated balance sheet of Cameron or (B) readily apparent in the notes
thereto, in each case included in Camerons annual report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2014 or Camerons quarterly report on Form 10-Q
for the period ended June 30, 2015, (ii) liabilities or obligations incurred
in the ordinary course of business since June 30, 2015 or (iii) liabilities or
obligations which have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,

Letter, and excluding inter-company indebtedness among Cameron and its wholly
owned Subsidiaries and any indebtedness for borrowed money in an individual
amount not in excess of $50 million and in the aggregate not in excess of $250
million. Since June 30, 2015, neither Cameron nor any of its Subsidiaries has
incurred any indebtedness for borrowed money except in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice, excluding intercompany indebtedness
among Cameron and its wholly owned Subsidiaries.

 

Section 5.7 _Controls and Procedures_.

 

(a) Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley
Act"), Cameron has been and is in compliance in all material respects with
(i) the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) the
applicable listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of the NYSE.

 

(b) Each of the principal executive officer and the principal financial
officer of Cameron (or each former principal executive officer and former
principal financial officer of Cameron, as applicable) has made all
certifications required under Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
and the related rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and under the
Exchange Act with respect to the Cameron Reports. For purposes of the
preceding sentence, "principal executive officer" and "principal financial
officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act.

 

(c) Cameron has (i) designed and maintained disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule
13a-15 under the Exchange Act, and (ii) disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation and knowledge, to its auditors and the audit committee of the
Cameron Board (A) any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting which could
adversely affect its ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial data and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in its internal
controls over financial reporting.

(d) Cameron has designed and maintains a system of internal controls over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the
Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. Camerons
management, with the participation of Camerons principal executive and
financial officers, has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of
Camerons internal controls over financial reporting in compliance with the
requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year
ended December 31, 2014, and such assessment concluded that such internal
controls were effective using the framework specified in Camerons annual
report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014. To the knowledge of
Cameron, there is no reason to believe that its auditors and its principal
executive officer and principal financial officer will not be able to give the
certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations
adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without
qualification, when next due.

 



17

   

  

 

(e) No personal loan or other extension of credit by Cameron to any of its or
their executive officers or directors has been made or modified (other than
as permitted by Section 13 of the Exchange Act and Section 402 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act) since July 30, 2002.

 

Section 5.8 _Information Supplied_.

 

(a) None of the information supplied or to be supplied by Cameron for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the Form S-4 will, at the time
the Form S-4 is filed with the SEC, at any time it is amended or supplemented
or at the time it becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading and (ii) the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will, on the date it is
first mailed to Cameron stockholders or at the time of the Cameron
Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. The portions of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
supplied by Cameron will comply as to form in all material respects with the
provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.8, no
representation or warranty is made by Cameron with respect to statements made
or incorporated by reference in the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
based on information supplied by Schlumberger US or Schlumberger for inclusion
or incorporation by reference therein.

 

Section 5.9 _Litigation_. There are no (a) civil, criminal or administrative
actions, suits, claims, hearings, arbitrations, investigations or proceedings
pending or, to the knowledge of Cameron, threatened against Cameron or any of
its Subsidiaries or their respective assets, or any director, officer or
employee of Cameron or any of its Subsidiaries or other affiliates, in each
case, for whom Cameron or any of its Subsidiaries may be liable, or (b)
litigations, arbitrations, investigations or other proceedings, or injunctions
or final judgments relating thereto, pending or, to the knowledge of
Cameron, threatened before any Governmental Entity or arbitrator against
Cameron or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective assets, or any
director, officer or employee of Cameron or any of its Subsidiaries or other
affiliates, in each case, for whom Cameron or any of its Subsidiaries may be
liable, except in the case of either clause (a) or (b), for those that would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
Cameron Material Adverse Effect. None of Cameron or any of its Subsidiaries
or their respective assets, or any director, officer or employee of Cameron or
any of its Subsidiaries or other affiliates, in each case, for whom Cameron or
any of its Subsidiaries may be liable, is a party to or subject to the
provisions of any judgment, order, writ, injunction, decree or award of any
Governmental Entity which would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to result in a Cameron Material Adverse Effect. This Section 5.9
does not relate to Tax matters, employee benefits matters, labor matters,
environmental matters, intellectual property matters, export control or trade
matters, or the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which are the subjects of

are not now under any administrative, civil or criminal investigation or
indictment involving alleged violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
or any other applicable anticorruption or antibribery laws. Neither
Schlumberger nor any of its affiliates (other than Schlumberger US and its
Subsidiaries) are participating in any investigation by a Governmental Entity
relating to alleged violations by Schlumberger or its affiliates (other than

any other applicable anticorruption or antibribery laws.

 

(e) The U.S. Government has not notified Schlumberger or any of its affiliates
(other than Schlumberger US and its Subsidiaries) in writing since January 1,
2012 of any actual or alleged violation or breach of the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act or any other applicable anticorruption or antibribery law.

 

Section 7.14 _Decrees, Etc_. Except for such matters as have not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have a Schlumberger Material Adverse Effect,
(a) no order, writ, fine, injunction, decree, judgment, award or determination
of any court or Governmental Entity or any arbitral or other dispute

Non-Schlumberger US Subsidiaries that continues to be in effect that affects
the ownership or operation of any of their respective assets or that involves
an amount greater than $25 million and (b) since December 31, 2012,
no criminal order, writ, fine, injunction, decree, judgment or determination
of any Governmental Entity has been issued against Schlumberger or any of the
Non-Schlumberger US Subsidiaries.

 

Section 7.15 _Controls and Procedures_.

 

(a) Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Schlumberger has been and
is in compliance in all material respects with (i) the applicable provisions
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) the applicable listing and corporate
governance rules and regulations of the NYSE.

 

(b) Each of the principal executive officer and the principal financial
officer of Schlumberger (or each former principal executive officer and
former principal financial officer of Schlumberger, as applicable) has made
all certifications required under Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act and the related rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and under the
Exchange Act with respect to the Schlumberger Reports. For purposes of the
preceding sentence, "principal executive officer" and "principal financial
officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act.

 

(c) Schlumberger has (i) designed and maintained disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as required
by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, and (ii) disclosed, based on its most
recent evaluation and knowledge, to its auditors and the audit committee of
the Schlumberger Board (A) any significant deficiencies or
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over
financial reporting which could adversely affect its ability to record,
process, summarize and report

 



43

   

  

 

 financial data and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in its internal
controls over financial reporting.

 

(d) Schlumberger has designed and maintains a system of internal controls over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the
Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act.
Schlumbergers management, with the participation of Schlumbergers principal
executive and financial officers, has completed an assessment of the
effectiveness of Schlumbergers internal controls over financial reporting in
compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for
the year ended December 31, 2014, and such assessment concluded that such
internal controls were effective using the framework specified in
Schlumbergers annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2014. To the knowledge of Schlumberger, there is no reason to believe that
its auditors and its principal executive officer and principal financial
officer will not be able to give the certifications and attestations required
pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due.

(e) No personal loan or other extension of credit by Schlumberger to any of
its executive officers or directors has been made or modified (other than as
permitted by Section 13 of the Exchange Act and Section 402 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act) since July 30, 2002.

 practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities

and hold the Cameron Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of obtaining the
Cameron Stockholder Approval. Cameron shall otherwise coordinate and cooperate

Applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be
disseminated and reviewed by Camerons stockholders prior to the Cameron
Stockholders Meeting; _provided_ that in the event that the Cameron
Stockholders Meeting is delayed to a date after the Termination Date as a

Section 8.3 _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) Cameron shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, and shall
direct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries
respective officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, consultants,
attorneys, accountants, advisors, agents and other representatives (with
respect to any person, the foregoing persons are referred to herein as
such persons "Representatives") not to, directly or indirectly, (i) take any
action to solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate the
making, submission or announcement of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry
with respect thereto, or engage in, continue or otherwise participate in
discussions or negotiations with any person with respect thereto (except to
notify such person of the existence of the provisions of this Section
8.3), (ii) furnish any nonpublic information or afford access to properties,
books or records to any person that has made or, to the knowledge of Cameron,
is considering making, any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) approve or recommend,
or propose to approve or recommend, or execute or enter into any letter of
intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement, stock purchase agreement,
asset purchase agreement or stock exchange, or option agreement, relating to
an Acquisition Proposal (other than confidentiality agreements contemplated
by this Section 8.3), or (iv) propose publicly or agree to do any of the
foregoing.

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to (but not after) the occurrence of the
Cameron Stockholder Approval, Cameron may, directly or indirectly through its
Representatives (A) contact any person making an Acquisition Proposal to
clarify the terms and conditions thereof or to inform such person that any
Acquisition Proposal made orally can only be considered if made in writing,
(B) furnish information and access, but only in response to a written request
for information or access, to any person making an Acquisition Proposal to the
Cameron Board after the date hereof which was not solicited,
initiated, knowingly encouraged or knowingly facilitated by Cameron or any of
its affiliates or any Representative of Cameron or any of its Subsidiaries on
or after the date hereof and (C) participate in discussions and negotiate 

 



51

   

  

 

 with such person concerning any such unsolicited Acquisition Proposal, if
and only if, in any such case set forth in clause (B) or (C) of this sentence,
(i) Cameron has not breached this Section 8.3(a) in any material respect with
respect to such Acquisition Proposal, (ii) the Cameron Board concludes in good
faith, after receipt of the advice of a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition
Proposal is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal, and (iii)
Cameron receives from the person making such an Acquisition Proposal an
executed confidentiality agreement the material terms of which, as they
relate to confidentiality, are (without regard to the terms of such
Acquisition Proposal) in all material respects (x) no less favorable in the
aggregate to Cameron and (y) no less restrictive in the aggregate to
the person making such Acquisition Proposal than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement dated June 11, 2015 between a subsidiary of
Schlumberger and Cameron (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), and for the
avoidance of doubt, any such confidentiality agreement need not include
explicit or implicit standstill restrictions or otherwise restrict the making
of or amendment or modification to any Acquisition Proposal, and any
information provided to such person has previously been provided to
Schlumberger or is provided to Schlumberger substantially concurrently with
its provision to such person.

(b) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 8.3(b), the Cameron Board
shall recommend approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger by
Camerons stockholders, and unless permitted by this Section 8.3(b), neither
the Cameron Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) fail to make, withdraw,
modify or qualify, or propose publicly to withhold, withdraw, modify or
qualify, in any manner adverse to Schlumberger or its affiliates, the approval
of this Agreement, the Merger or the Cameron Recommendation, except for
notice provided to Schlumberger with respect to such Acquisition Proposal and
Camerons views thereof prior to any definitive Change in Recommendation (any
of the foregoing, a "Change in Recommendation") or (ii) approve, endorse or
recommend, or propose publicly to approve, endorse or recommend, any
Acquisition Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement, a Change in
Recommendation shall include any approval, endorsement or recommendation (or
public proposal to approve, endorse or recommend), by the Cameron Board or any
committee thereof of an Acquisition Proposal, but shall not include any notice
provided to Schlumberger with respect to such Acquisition Proposal and
Camerons views thereof prior to any definitive Change in Recommendation.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Cameron Board shall be permitted not to
recommend to Camerons stockholders that they give the Cameron Stockholder
Approval, to withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose to publicly
withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to Schlumberger or
its affiliates the Cameron Recommendation, or to approve, endorse or
recommend, or propose publicly to approve, endorse or recommend, any
Acquisition Proposal, only if and to the extent that all of the following
conditions are met: (i) the Cameron Stockholder Approval has not been
obtained; (ii) the Cameron Board determines in good faith, after consulting
with outside legal counsel, that failure to so withhold, withdraw, modify or
qualify the Cameron Recommendation would be inconsistent with the directors
exercise of their fiduciary duties to stockholders under Applicable Law; and
(iii) before taking any such action, Cameron promptly gives Schlumberger three
business days written notice advising Schlumberger of the decision of the
Cameron Board to take such action; _provided, however,_ that notwithstanding
any Change in Recommendation, unless this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with the terms hereof, Cameron shall nevertheless submit this

 



52

   

  

 

 Agreement and the Merger to the stockholders of Cameron for the purpose of
obtaining the Cameron Stockholder Approval at the Cameron Stockholders Meeting
and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve Cameron of such
obligation, unless Schlumberger otherwise directs Cameron in writing or this
Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms prior to the
Cameron Stockholders Meeting. In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing,
Cameron may terminate this Agreement, upon payment of the Cameron Termination
Fee in accordance with Section 10.5(a), in order to enter into any agreement,
understanding or arrangement providing for an Acquisition Proposal if all of
the following conditions are met: (x) the Cameron Stockholder Approval has not
been obtained, (y) Cameron gives Schlumberger written notice at least three
business days prior to taking such action, which notice advises Schlumberger
of the intention of the Cameron Board to take such action and such notice
specifies the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and
identifies the person making such Acquisition Proposal (provided that if there
are any subsequent changes in the financial terms of such proposal, Cameron
will not take any such action prior to the second business day following a
subsequent notice to Schlumberger of such changes) (it being understood that
there may be multiple extensions); and (z) the Cameron Board determines in
good faith that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and
does not revoke such determination notwithstanding any revisions to the terms
of the Merger or this Agreement proposed by Schlumberger after being notified
pursuant to clause (y).

(c) In the event Cameron receives an Acquisition Proposal, or any request
for nonpublic information relating to Cameron or any Subsidiary of Cameron or
for access to the properties, books or records of Cameron or any Subsidiary of
Cameron by any person that has made or, to the knowledge of Cameron, would
reasonably be expected to make, an Acquisition Proposal, Cameron will (i) as
promptly as practicable (and in no event later than 24 hours after receipt of
any Acquisition Proposal or request) notify (which notice shall be provided
orally and confirmed in writing and shall identify the person making such
Acquisition Proposal or request and set forth the material terms thereof, to
the extent known) Schlumberger thereof and (ii) will keep Schlumberger
reasonably and promptly informed of the status and material terms of
(including with respect to changes to the status or material terms of) any
such Acquisition Proposal or request.

 

(d) Subject to Schlumbergers rights under Article 10, nothing in this Section
8.3 shall prohibit the Cameron Board from taking and disclosing to Camerons
stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act, or other
Applicable Law, if the Cameron Board, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, determines in good faith that the failure to so disclose such
position would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors
exercise of their fiduciary obligations to Camerons stockholders under
Applicable Law; _provided, however_ , that the Cameron Board may only make a
Change in Recommendation to the extent that the Cameron Board has complied
with the requirements of Section 8.3(b).

 

(e) Cameron (i) shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, immediately cease
and cause to be terminated and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its
and their Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated,
all discussions and negotiations, if any, that have taken place prior to the
date hereof with any persons with respect to any Acquisition Proposal
and (ii) shall promptly request each person, if any, that has executed

 



53

   

  

 

 a confidentiality agreement within the 12 months prior to the date hereof in
connection with its consideration of any Acquisition Proposal to return or
destroy all confidential information heretofore furnished to such person by
or on behalf of it or any of its Subsidiaries.

(f) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

"Acquisition Proposal" means any bona fide written offer or proposal for, or
any bona fide written indication of interest in, any (i) direct or indirect
acquisition or purchase of any business or assets of Cameron or any of its
Subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, constitutes 33% or more
of the net revenues, net income or assets of Cameron and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, (ii) direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of 33% or
more of any class of equity securities of Cameron, (iii) tender offer or
exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any person
beneficially owning 33% or more of any class of equity securities of Cameron,
or (iv) merger, consolidation, business combination, joint venture,
partnership, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction
involving Cameron or any of its Subsidiaries whose business constitutes 33%
or more of the net revenue, net income or assets of Cameron and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 

"Superior Proposal" means any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal for or in
respect of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Cameron Common
Stock or all or substantially all of Camerons and its Subsidiaries assets
(A) on terms that the Cameron Board determines in its good faith judgment
(after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation and outside legal counsel) are more favorable to Cameron and its
stockholders than the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby
and (B) that constitutes a transaction that is reasonably likely to
be consummated on the terms so proposed, taking into account all legal,
financial, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal.

(g) Cameron agrees that it will take the necessary steps promptly to inform
its Subsidiaries and its officers, directors, investment bankers, consultants,
attorneys, accountants, agents and other representatives of the obligations
undertaken in this Section 8.3.

Section 8.4 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Subject to Section 8.2 and Section 8.6,
each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist
and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under Applicable Law to consummate and make effective the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as
practicable, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or
nonactions, waivers, authorizations, expirations or terminations of waiting
periods, clearances, consents and approvals from Governmental Entities and the
making of all necessary registrations and filings and the taking of all steps
as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an
action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, (ii) the obtaining of all
necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties, (iii) the
defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial
or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iv) the execution and
delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



54

   

  

 

Section 8.5 _Preparation of Proxy Statement/Prospectus_.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date hereof,
Schlumberger and Cameron shall prepare and file with the SEC the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and Schlumberger shall prepare and file the Form
S-4. The Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be included in and will constitute a
part of the Form S-4 as Schlumbergers prospectus. The Form S-4 and the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall comply as to form in all material respects
with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder.

 

(b) Each of Schlumberger and Cameron shall use reasonable best efforts to have
the Form S-4 declared effective by the SEC as promptly as practicable after
the date hereof and to keep the Form S-4 effective as long as is necessary to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby.

 

(c) Schlumberger and Cameron shall, as promptly as practicable after receipt
thereof, provide the other party copies of any written comments, and advise
the other party of any oral comments, received from the SEC with respect to
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Schlumberger shall provide Cameron with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any amendment or supplement to
the Form S-4 and any communications prior to filing such with the SEC, and
will promptly provide Cameron with a copy of all such filings and
communications made with the SEC.

 

(d) Schlumberger shall take any action (other than qualifying to do business
in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified or to file a general
consent to service of process) required to be taken under any applicable state
securities laws in connection with the issuance of Schlumberger Common Stock
in connection with the Merger, and Cameron shall furnish all
information concerning Cameron and the holders of Cameron Common Stock as may
be reasonably requested in connection with any such action. Each party shall
advise the other party, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time
when the Form S-4 has become effective, the issuance of any stop order, the
suspension of the qualification of the Schlumberger Common Stock issuable in
connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any
request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the
Form S-4.

(e) If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to
Schlumberger or Cameron, or any of their respective affiliates, officers or
directors, should be discovered by Schlumberger or Cameron which should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the Form S-4 or the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus so that any of such documents would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information
shall promptly notify the other party hereto and, to the extent required by
law, rules or regulations, an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall be filed promptly with the SEC and disseminated to
the stockholders of Cameron.

Section 8.6 _Filings, Etc_.

 



55

   

  

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, including
the limitations set forth in Section 8.6(d), each of the parties hereto
shall, and each of Cameron and Schlumberger shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best efforts (subject to, and in
accordance with Applicable Law) to take promptly, or to cause to be taken,
all actions, and to do promptly, or to cause to be done, and to assist and to
cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under Applicable Law to consummate and make effective the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable,
including (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers,
authorizations, expirations or terminations of waiting periods, clearances,
consents and approvals from Governmental Entities and the making of all
necessary registrations and filings and the taking of all steps as may be
necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or
proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary
consents, approvals or waivers from third parties, (iii) the defending of any
lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional
instruments reasonably necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 

(b) Subject to Section 8.6(c) and the other terms and conditions herein
provided and without limiting the foregoing, Cameron and Schlumberger shall
(and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to):

(i) make their respective required filings (and filings reasonably determined
by Schlumberger after consultation with Cameron to be advisable) under the HSR
Act, the EC Merger Regulation and any other Regulatory Laws (and shall share
equally all filing fees incident thereto), which filings shall be made as
promptly as practicable, but in no event later than 20 business days after the
date hereof with respect to the filing under the HSR Act, and thereafter shall
promptly make any other required submissions under the HSR Act or other
such laws; without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each party shall
use its reasonable best efforts to respond to and comply promptly with and
expeditiously achieve substantial compliance with any request for information
regarding the Merger or any such filings for any Governmental Entity charged
with enforcing, applying, administering, or investigating any Regulatory Law;

 

(ii) use their reasonable best efforts to cooperate with one another in (A)
determining as promptly as practicable which filings are required (or
reasonably determined by Schlumberger after consultation with Cameron to be
advisable) to be made prior to the Effective Time with, and which consents,
approvals, permits or authorizations are required to be obtained prior to the
Effective Time from, Governmental Entities in connection with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement, and the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby and (B) timely making all such filings;

 

(iii) promptly notify each other of any communication concerning this
Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to that party from any Governmental Entity and consult with and
permit the other party to review in advance any proposed communication
concerning this

 



56

   

  

 

 Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to any Governmental Entity; it being understood that correspondence,
filings and communications received from any Governmental Entity shall be
immediately provided to the other party upon receipt, subject in appropriate
cases to appropriate confidentiality agreements to limit disclosure to outside
lawyers and consultants;

 

(iv) not participate or agree to participate in any meeting or substantive
discussion (including any discussion relating to the antitrust merits, any
potential remedies, commitments or undertakings, the timing of any waivers,
consents, approvals, permits, orders or authorizations, and any agreement
regarding the timing of consummation of the Merger) with any
Governmental Entity relating to any filings or investigation concerning this
Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
unless it consults with the other party and its representatives in advance and
invites the other partys representatives to attend, subject in appropriate
cases to appropriate confidentiality agreements to limit disclosure to outside
lawyers and consultants, unless the Governmental Entity prohibits such
attendance;

 

(v) promptly furnish the other party, subject in appropriate cases to
appropriate confidentiality agreements to limit disclosure to outside lawyers
and consultants, with draft copies prior to submission to a Governmental
Entity, with reasonable time and opportunity to comment and consult, of all
correspondence, filings and communications (and memoranda setting forth the
substance thereof) that they, their affiliates or their respective
representatives intend to submit to any Governmental Entity;

 

(vi) promptly furnish the other party, subject in appropriate cases to
appropriate confidentiality agreements to limit disclosure to outside lawyers
and consultants, with such necessary information and reasonable assistance as
such other party and its affiliates may reasonably request in connection with
their preparation of necessary filings, registrations or submissions of
information to any Governmental Entity, including any filings necessary or
appropriate under the provisions of Regulatory Laws; and

 

(vii) deliver to the other partys outside counsel complete copies of all
documents furnished to any Governmental Entity as part of any filing.

(c) Schlumberger shall be entitled to direct the antitrust defense of the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement in any investigation or litigation
by, or negotiations with, any Governmental Entity or other person relating to
the Merger or regulatory filings under applicable Regulatory Law, subject to
the provisions of Section 8.6(a), Section 8.6(b), Section 8.6(d) and Section
8.6(e). Cameron shall not make any offer, acceptance or counter-offer to or
otherwise engage in negotiations or discussions with any Governmental Entity
with respect to any proposed settlement, consent decree, commitment or
remedy, or, in the event of litigation, discovery, admissibility of evidence,
timing or scheduling, except as specifically requested by or agreed with
Schlumberger. Cameron shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide full
and

 



57

   

  

 

 effective support of Schlumberger in all material respects in all such
investigations, litigation, negotiations and discussions to the extent
requested by Schlumberger.

 

(d) Without limiting the foregoing, Schlumberger US, Merger Sub and
Schlumberger shall take all such action as may be necessary to resolve such
objections, if any, that the United States Federal Trade Commission, the
Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice, the European
Commission, state antitrust enforcement authorities or competition authorities
of any other nation or other jurisdiction, or any other person, may assert
under Regulatory Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby,
and to avoid or eliminate, and minimize the impact of, each and every
impediment under Regulatory Laws that may be asserted by any Governmental
Entity with respect to the Merger so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon
as reasonably possible (and in any event no later than the Termination Date);
_provided, however_ , that nothing contained in this Agreement requires
Schlumberger US, Merger Sub, Schlumberger or Cameron or their respective
Subsidiaries to take, or cause to be taken, or agree to take, any action with
respect to any of the assets, businesses or product lines of Cameron or any
of its Subsidiaries ("Cameron Assets"), or of Schlumberger or any of its
Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Entity) ("Schlumberger Assets"), or any
combination thereof, if such action (whether taken with respect to Cameron
Assets or Schlumberger Assets), individually or in the aggregate, would result
in the divestiture, sale, hold separate, license or limitation of the conduct
on business that, individually or taken together, would reasonably be expected
to be material to Cameron and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; _provided,
further_ , that in no event shall Schlumberger be required to take or agree to
take any action that would result in the divestiture, sale, hold separate,
license or limitation of the conduct, in whole or in significant part, of
OneSubsea. For purposes of the foregoing, any actions with respect to
Schlumberger Assets will be deemed to be actions with respect to Cameron
Assets of comparable size and importance. If requested by Schlumberger,
Cameron will agree to and take any action contemplated by this Section 8.6(d),
_provided_ that the consummation of any divestiture or the effectiveness of
any other remedy is conditioned on the consummation of the Merger. The
foregoing agreement in this section is made solely to facilitate the closing
of the Merger and does not constitute a representation or admission that the
Merger, if consummated without any modification, would violate any
Regulatory Laws or that agreeing to any divestitures, hold separate
conditions or other restrictions permitted herein or suggested by any person
or authority acting under any Regulatory Law would not be harmful to the
parties hereto.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary but subject to
the next sentence, Schlumberger shall have the right, but not the obligation,
to oppose or refuse to consent to, through litigation or otherwise any
request, attempt or demand by any Governmental Entity or other person for any
divestiture, hold separate condition or any other restriction with respect to
any assets, businesses or product lines of Schlumberger, Cameron or any of
their respective Subsidiaries and shall have the obligation to defend any
litigation instituted by a Governmental Entity or other person with respect to
the legality of the Merger under applicable Regulatory Laws. In the event
Schlumberger opposes or refuses to consent to, through litigation or
otherwise, including any appeals, any request, attempt or demand by any
Governmental Entity or other person as provided in the preceding sentence,
and (i) such proceedings conclude prior to the Termination Date with a decree,
injunction or order restricting or prohibiting the Merger or (ii) no decree,
order or injunction has been issued in such proceedings prior to the
Termination Date, then Schlumberger shall take such actions, in a timely

 



58

   

  

 

 manner, as are necessary to achieve the clearance by or approval of the
Governmental Entity and satisfaction of the condition set forth in Section
9.1(b), Section 9.1(c) and Section 9.1(d) (with respect to any Regulatory
Law) or other person prior to the Termination Date, subject to the proviso in
the first sentence of Section 8.6(d). If there is no decree, order or
injunction restricting or prohibiting the Merger, but the decision of a
Governmental Entity in litigation contemplated by this Section 8.6(e) is under
appeal, Schlumberger shall have the right to elect, and Cameron shall have the
obligation upon such election by Schlumberger, to proceed to close the Merger
if the other conditions to Closing have been satisfied.

(f) For purposes of this Agreement, "Regulatory Laws" means the Sherman Act,
as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade
Commission Act, as amended, the EC Merger Regulation, and all other federal,
state or foreign statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees,
administrative and judicial doctrines and other Applicable Laws, including any
antitrust, competition or trade regulation laws, that are designed or intended
to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of
monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening competition through merger
or acquisition.

(g) The parties will cooperate and use their respective reasonable efforts to
cooperate in identifying and obtaining any approvals or consents under any so
called "transaction triggered" or "responsible property transfer" requirements
under Environmental Laws necessary to consummate the Merger.

Section 8.7 _Listing Application_. Schlumberger shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the shares of Schlumberger Common Stock to be issued in the
Merger and the shares of Schlumberger Common Stock to be reserved for issuance
upon exercise or vesting, as applicable, of the Assumed Awards and the
Schlumberger Stock Incentive Awards to be approved for listing on the NYSE,
subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

Section 8.8  _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, each of
Schlumberger and Cameron shall take all such steps as may be required to cause
any dispositions of Cameron Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to Cameron Common Stock) or acquisitions of Schlumberger Common Stock
(including derivative securities with respect to Schlumberger Common Stock)
resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act with respect to Cameron, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 8.9 _Converted Options and Stock Incentive Awards_. As of the Closing
Date, to the extent necessary to provide for registration of shares of
Schlumberger Common Stock subject to an Assumed Award or Schlumberger Stock
Incentive Award, Schlumberger shall file with the SEC a registration statement
on Form S-8 (or any successor form), a post-effective amendment on Form S-8
(or any successor form) to the Form S-4 (or any successor form), a post-
effective amendment to Form S-3 (or any successor form), or such other
registration statement or amendment as may be required to effect such
registration with respect to such shares of Schlumberger Common Stock and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain such registration
statement, including the current status of any related prospectus or

 



59

   

  

 

 prospectuses, for so long as such Assumed Awards or Schlumberger Stock
Incentive Awards remain outstanding.

 

Section 8.10 _Inspection_. From the date hereof to the Effective Time, each of
Cameron on the one hand, and Schlumberger US, Merger Sub and Schlumberger on
the other hand, shall allow designated officers, attorneys, accountants and
other representatives of the other access, at reasonable times, upon
reasonable notice, to the records and files, correspondence, audits
and properties, as well as to all information relating to commitments,
contracts, titles and financial position, or otherwise pertaining to its and
its Subsidiaries business and affairs, including inspection of such
properties; _provided_  that no investigation pursuant to this Section 8.10
shall affect any representation or warranty given by it hereunder.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or a partys provision of
information or investigation pursuant to the preceding sentence, no party
shall be deemed to make any representation or warranty except as expressly set
forth in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Cameron on the
one hand, nor Schlumberger US, Merger Sub or Schlumberger on the other hand,
shall be required to provide any information which it reasonably believes it
may not provide to the other by reason of any Applicable Law, which
constitutes information protected by attorney/client privilege, or which it is
required to keep confidential by reason of contract or agreement with third
parties. Each party shall use reasonable efforts to make reasonable and
appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which
the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. Each party agrees that it
shall not, and shall cause its representatives not to, use any information
obtained pursuant to this Section 8.10 for any purpose unrelated to the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. All nonpublic information obtained pursuant to this Section 8.10
shall be governed by the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

Section 8.11 _Publicity_. Schlumberger and Cameron shall, unless otherwise
required by Applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with or rules of any securities exchange, consult with each other
before issuing any press release or, to the extent practical, otherwise making
any public statement or communication with respect to this Agreement, the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In addition
to the foregoing, except to the extent disclosed in or consistent with the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus in accordance with the provisions of Section 8.2,
neither Schlumberger nor Cameron shall issue any press release or otherwise
make any public statement or disclosure concerning the other party or the
other partys business, financial condition or results of operations without
the consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. Schlumberger and Cameron agree to issue a mutually
acceptable joint press release announcing this Agreement.

 

Section 8.12 _Expenses_. Subject to Section 10.5, whether or not the Merger is
consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby shall be
paid by the party incurring such expenses, except as otherwise agreed in
writing by the parties, including the costs of any economists or
other experts utilized by outside counsel in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



60

   

  

 

Section 8.13 _Charter Provisions; Takeover Laws_. If (a) the restrictions
on business combinations set forth in Article Fifth of Camerons certificate
of incorporation or (b) any "fair price," "moratorium," "business
combination," or "control share acquisition" statute or other similar statute
or regulation is or shall become applicable to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, Cameron and the Cameron Board shall use all reasonable
efforts to grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary
so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly
as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and shall otherwise act to
minimize the effects of any such statute or regulation on the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 8.14 _Stockholder Litigation_. Cameron shall give Schlumberger the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder
litigation against Cameron and/or its directors or officers relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Cameron agrees that it shall not
settle or offer to settle any litigation commenced on or after the date
hereof against Cameron or any of its directors or officers by any stockholder
of Cameron relating to this Agreement, the Merger, any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise, without the prior written consent
of Schlumberger (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

Section 8.15 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity (i) shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person who is, or at any time prior
to the Effective Time has been, a director, officer or employee of Cameron or
any of its Subsidiaries and each person who is, or at any time prior to the
Effective Time, served at the request of Cameron as a director, officer,
employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture,
trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit
plans (individually, an "Indemnified Party" and, collectively,
the "Indemnified Parties") against all expense, liability and loss (including
attorneys fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise Taxes or penalties and amounts
paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by
such person in connection with any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative (an "Action"), by reason of the fact
that such Indemnified Party is or was a director, officer, employee or agent
of Cameron, any of its Subsidiaries or any such corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise, to the fullest extent permitted by
Applicable Law, and (ii) without limitation to clause (i), to the fullest
extent permitted by Applicable Law, shall also advance expenses as incurred
to the same such extent; _provided_ that the person to whom fees and expenses
are advanced shall, if required by Applicable Law, provide an undertaking to
repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not
entitled to indemnification; and _provided, further_ , that the Surviving
Entity shall not be required to pay the fees and expenses of more than one
counsel (which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to Schlumberger) in
addition to local counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any single Action
unless, in the good faith judgment of any of the Indemnified Parties, there is
or may be a conflict of interest between two or more of such Indemnified
Parties.

(b) At or prior to the Effective Time, Cameron may purchase a "tail"
directors and officers liability insurance policy covering the Indemnified
Parties who are or at any time prior to the Effective Time covered by
Camerons existing directors and officers

 



61

   

  

 

 liability insurance policies for at least six years after the Effective Time
on terms no less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties than such existing
insurance, _provided_ that the premium thereof shall not exceed the amount
specified in Section 8.15(b)(1) of the Cameron Disclosure Letter. If Cameron
does not purchase such a policy, then for a period of six years after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall cause to be maintained officers
and directors liability insurance covering the Indemnified Parties who are,
or at any time prior to the Effective Time were, covered by Camerons existing
officers and directors liability insurance policies on terms substantially
no less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties than such existing insurance,
_provided_ that the Surviving Entity shall not be required to pay annual
premiums in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by Cameron prior
to the date hereof (the amount of which premium is set forth in Section
8.15(b)(2) of the Cameron Disclosure Letter), but in such case shall purchase
as much coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount. In either case,
Schlumberger US, Schlumberger and the Surviving Entity will maintain such
policies in full force and effect and honor the obligations thereunder.

 

(c) In the event Schlumberger US, Schlumberger or the Surviving Entity or any
of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges
into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then and in
either such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Surviving Entity shall assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 8.15.

 

(d) The rights of any Indemnified Party under this Section 8.15 will be in
addition to any other rights such Indemnified Party may have under the
organizational documents of Cameron, the Surviving Entity or any Subsidiary of
Cameron, indemnification or employment agreements with Cameron or any
Subsidiary of Cameron or under the DGCL or other Applicable Law. The
provisions of this Section 8.15 will survive the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby for a period of six years and are expressly
intended to benefit, and be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties
and their respective heirs and representatives; provided, however, that in
the event that any claim or claims for indemnification set forth in this
Section 8.15 are asserted or made within such six year period, all rights to
indemnification in respect of any such claim or claims will continue until
disposition of all such claims.

Section 8.16 _Certain Benefits_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Schlumberger and its Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Entity) will honor in accordance with their terms
all Cameron Benefit Plans and compensation arrangements and agreements in
accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, including terms related to the ability to amend or terminate such plans.
For a period of one year following the Effective Time, Schlumberger shall
provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each current and former employee of
Cameron and its Subsidiaries (the "Covered Employees") compensation and
benefits that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the compensation
and benefits provided to each such Covered Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Without limiting the foregoing, Schlumberger shall provide, or
cause to be provided, to any Covered Employee whose employment is terminated
for reasons other than cause prior to the second anniversary of the Effective
Time severance benefits

 



62

   

  

 

 equal to the benefits provided under the applicable Cameron severance plan
as in effect immediately prior to the date hereof.

 

(b) For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and benefit accrual
(other than for purposes of benefit accruals under any defined benefit
pension plan or program eligibility or retiree welfare eligibility under any
retiree welfare plan sponsored by Schlumberger or its Subsidiaries (other than
under plans sponsored by Cameron and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to
the Effective Date or a direct successor plan)) under the employee benefit
plans of Schlumberger US, Schlumberger, the Surviving Entity and their
Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Covered Employees after the Effective
Time (the "New Plans"), each Covered Employee shall be credited with his or
her years of service with Cameron and its Subsidiaries (and predecessors)
prior to the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Covered Employee was
entitled, prior to the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any
similar Cameron employee benefit plan in which such Covered Employee
participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective
Time (and to the extent there is no similar Cameron plan, service as
recognized for purposes of Camerons 401(k) Plan), _provided_ that the
foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application would result in a
duplication of benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of
the foregoing: (i) each Covered Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans for which the
Covered Employee is otherwise made eligible to the extent coverage under
such New Plan is comparable to a Cameron Benefit Plan in which such Covered
Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time (such plans,
collectively, the "Old Plans"); and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any
Covered Employee, the Surviving Entity shall cause all pre-existing condition
exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for
such employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would
not have been waived under the comparable plans of Cameron or its Subsidiaries
in which such employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time
and the Surviving Entity shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such
employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year
of the Old Plan ending on the date such employees participation in the
corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan
for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-
pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid
in accordance with such New Plan.

(c) Schlumberger and Cameron hereby acknowledge that a "change of control" or
"change in control" (or term of similar import) within the meaning of each of
the Cameron Benefit Plans identified on Section 8.16(c) of the Cameron
Disclosure Letter will occur at or immediately prior to the Effective Time, as
applicable.

 

(d) Short-term incentive bonuses (i.e., bonuses in respect of a performance
period of one year or less) shall be established and paid in accordance with
Section 8.16(d) of the Cameron Disclosure Letter.

(e) With respect to any Covered Employees based outside of the United States,
Schlumbergers obligations under this Section 8.16 shall be modified to the
extent

 



63

   

  

 

 necessary to comply with Applicable Laws of the foreign countries and
political subdivisions thereof in which such Covered Employees are based.

 

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein, whether express
or implied, shall be treated as an amendment or other modification of any
employee benefit plan, or shall limit the right of Schlumberger or any
Subsidiary, subject to their obligations under this Section 8.16, to amend,
terminate or otherwise modify any employee benefit plan following
the Effective Time.

(g) The parties acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this
Section 8.16 with respect to employees are included for the sole benefit of
the parties to this Agreement, and that nothing in this Agreement, whether
express or implied, shall create any third party beneficiary or other rights
(i) in any other Person, including any employees, former employees, any
participant in any Cameron Benefit Plan, or any dependent or beneficiary
thereof, or (ii) to continued employment with Schlumberger or any Subsidiary.

 

Section 8.17 _Obligations of Schlumberger US_. Schlumberger shall take all
action necessary to cause Schlumberger US to perform its obligations under
this Agreement.

been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Merger to occur on or
before such date; _provided, further_ , that if on the Initial Termination
Date the condition to Closing set forth in Section 9.1(b), (c) or (d) (but
for

 



66

   

  

 

 purposes of Section 9.1(d) only if such judgment, order or decree is

the Initial Termination Date may be extended on one or more occasions at the
option of either Schlumberger or Cameron by written notice to the other to a

seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.2(c) shall
have complied with Section 8.4 and Section 8.6 and, with respect to other

any time prior to the Effective Time by action of the Cameron Board:

(a) if there has been a breach by Schlumberger US or Schlumberger of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement or

correct is not curable by the Termination Date; _provided, however_ , that the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.3(a) shall not

67

   

  

 

(a) there has been a breach by Cameron of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement or if any representation or
warranty of Cameron shall have become untrue, in either case such that the
conditions set forth in Section 9.3 would not be satisfied, and such breach or
failure to be true and correct is not curable by the Termination Date;
_provided, however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 10.4(a) shall not be available to Schlumberger if it, at such
time, is in breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set
forth in this Agreement such that any of the conditions set forth in Section
9.2(a) and Section 9.2(b) shall not be satisfied; or

 

(b) the Cameron Board shall have failed to recommend its approval or
recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger or there has been a Change in
Recommendation, whether or not permitted by the terms hereof.

Section 10.5 _Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) Cameron shall pay Schlumberger US a fee of $321 million (the "Termination
Fee"):

 

(i) if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10.2(b), and (x) such
termination occurs after an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made known
to Cameron (including any of its Representatives) and communicated publicly or
shall have been made directly to the stockholders of Cameron by any person, in
each case such Acquisition Proposal shall not have been withdrawn, and (y)
within one year after such termination, Cameron enters into a definitive
agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or an Acquisition Proposal
is consummated;

 

(ii) if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10.3(b); or

 

(iii) if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10.4(b);

 

which fee shall be payable: in the case of clause (i), upon the first to occur
of such entering into a definitive agreement or consummation referred to
in subclause (y) thereof; and in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), upon
such termination; _provided_ that for purposes of this Section 10.5(a), the
references to "33%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed
to be references to "50%". Any amount payable pursuant to this Section 10.5(a)
shall be reduced by any amount paid pursuant to Section 10.5(b). Schlumberger
US, Merger Sub and Schlumberger agree that in the event that the Termination
Fee is paid or may be payable to Schlumberger US pursuant to this Section
10.5(a), the payment of such Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of Schlumberger, its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective stockholders, affiliates, officers, directors, employees or
Representatives (collectively, "Related Persons") against Cameron or any of
its Related Persons for, and in no event will Schlumberger or any of its
Related Persons be entitled to recover any other money damages or any other
remedy based on a claim in law or equity with respect to, (1) any loss
suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated, (2) the
termination of this Agreement, (3) any liabilities or obligations arising
under this Agreement, or (4) any claims or actions arising out of or relating
to

 



68

   

  

 

 any breach, termination or failure of or under this Agreement, and upon
payment to Schlumberger US of the Termination Fee, neither Cameron nor any
Related Person of Cameron shall have any further liability or obligation to
Schlumberger or any of its Related Persons relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (subject to Section
10.5(f)).

 

(b) Without limiting the rights of Schlumberger US and Schlumberger under
Section 10.5(f), if this Agreement is terminated (i) pursuant to Section
10.2(b) and no Termination Fee is yet payable in respect thereof pursuant to
Section 10.5(a), or (ii) pursuant to Section 10.4(a) because there has been a
willful and material breach by Cameron of any covenant or agreement set forth
herein, then Cameron shall reimburse Schlumberger US and Schlumberger for
their actual costs and expenses incurred in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby in an amount not to exceed $10 million.

 

(c) Without limiting the rights of Cameron under Section 10.5(f), if this
Agreement is terminated by Cameron pursuant to Section 10.3(a) because there
has been a willful and material breach by Schlumberger US or Schlumberger of
any covenant or agreement set forth herein, then Schlumberger US shall
reimburse Cameron for its actual costs and expenses incurred in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby in an amount not to exceed $10
million.

(d) All payments under this Section 10.5 shall be made promptly upon becoming
due by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated
by the receiving party.

 

(e) Each of Cameron, Schlumberger US and Schlumberger acknowledge that the
agreements contained in this Section 10.5 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, neither Cameron, Schlumberger US nor Schlumberger would enter into
this Agreement; accordingly, if either Cameron fails to pay, or Schlumberger
US fails to pay, as applicable, any amount due pursuant to this Section 10.5,
and, in order to obtain such payment, the party entitled to such payment
commences a suit which results in a judgment against the party failing to pay
for the fees to which reference is made in this Section 10.5, then such party
shall pay to the party entitled to such payment its costs and expenses
(including attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, together with
interest through the date of payment on the amount of the fee at the prime
lending rate prevailing during such period as published in _The Wall Street
Journal_.

(f) In the event of termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the
Merger pursuant to this Article 10, all obligations of the parties hereto
shall terminate, except the obligations of the parties pursuant to this
Section 10.5, the last sentence of Section 8.10 and Section 8.12, Section
8.15 and Article 11, _provided_ that nothing herein shall relieve any party
from any liability for any willful and material breach by such party of any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement (it being understood that the failure of a party to effect the
Closing when required under the terms of this Agreement shall constitute a
willful and material breach), and all rights and remedies of such
nonbreaching party under this Agreement in the case of such a willful and
material breach, at law or in equity, shall be preserved. The Confidentiality
Agreement shall survive any termination of this Agreement, 

 



69

   

  

 

 and the provisions of such Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to all
information and material delivered by any party hereunder.

determination that the underlying cause of any such change, decline or
failure referred to therein (if not otherwise falling within any of the

the impact on the person in question and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,

Section 11.12 _Extensions; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
each party may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made
to such party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto
and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the
benefit of such party contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a
party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth
in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The waiver by any
party hereto of a breach of any provision hereunder shall not operate or be
construed as a waiver of any prior or subsequent breach of the same or any
other provision hereunder.

Section 11.13 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which
is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or
unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining
terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or
enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any
other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be
unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is
enforceable.

Section 11.14 _Enforcement of Agreement_. The parties hereto agree
that irreparable damage for which monetary relief (including any fees payable
pursuant to this Agreement), even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy, would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or was otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the 

 



76

   

  

 

 terms and provisions hereof in the applicable Delaware Court without proof
of damages, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. In addition, each of the parties hereto (a)
consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the applicable
Delaware Court in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement, (b)
agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction
by motion or other request for leave from any such court, (c) agrees that it
will not bring any action relating to this Agreement in any court other than
the applicable Delaware Court and (d) waives any right to trial by jury with
respect to any action related to or arising out of this Agreement. The parties
hereto agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is
unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, and not
to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy
or that the parties otherwise have an adequate remedy at law. The parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that any party hereto seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this Section
11.14 shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction.

 

Section 11.15 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF SCHLUMBERGER US, MERGER SUB,
SCHLUMBERGER AND CAMERON HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY LAW, ALL RIGHTS OF TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING, OR
COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED UPON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE MERGER OR ANY OF THE OTHER
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.
