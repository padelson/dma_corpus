cause the Subsidiary Transferors to sell, assign, transfer and convey) the
Acquired Interests to Purchaser, and (b) Purchaser shall purchase the Acquired
Interests from Seller (or, if applicable, the Subsidiary Transferors), for the

attached hereto, Seller hereby represents and warrants to Purchaser as set
forth in this Article 2 as of (a) the date hereof and (b) if the Closing Date
is not the date of this Agreement, the Closing Date, in each case, unless
otherwise specified in the representations and warranties below, in which case
the representation and warranty is made as of such date. Whether or not a
particular Section of this Article 2 refers to a specific, numbered Schedule,

that the relevance of such exceptions, qualifications or other matters is
reasonably apparent on the face thereof.

authorized, in accordance with its Organization Documents, to enter into,
deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement. This Agreement has
been duly executed and delivered by each of Seller and Guarantor and

Guarantor, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except as may
be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization
and similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and
subject to general principles of equity regardless of whether enforceability
is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.

in Schedule 2.5 are obtained) performance by each of Seller and Guarantor of
its obligations under this Agreement, and (assuming the Consents set forth in
Schedule 2.5 are obtained) the performance by each Subsidiary Transferor of
this Agreement, in each case including without limitation the sale of the

in a breach of,



constitute a default under, result in the acceleration of, create in any party
the right to accelerate, terminate, modify or cancel or require any notice
under any Material Contract, except, in the case of this clause (c), as would
not reasonably be expected to be material in the context of the Wind Projects
or the Transmission Project or otherwise prevent or materially impair or delay
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

2.4 No Litigation. None of Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Project
Companies and their Subsidiaries, which, for the avoidance of doubt, are
provided for in Section 2.12) is a party to or has received written notice of
any pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened litigation, action,
suit, proceeding or governmental investigation (other than for such matters as
relate to Broadview Finco Pledgor LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
("Topco"), its Subsidiaries, the Wind Projects or the Transmission Project,
which, for the avoidance of doubt, are provided for in Section 2.12) against
Seller or its Affiliates which would reasonably be expected to be material to
the Project Companies, the Wind Projects and the Transmission Project or the
ownership of the Acquired Interests, or which seeks the issuance of an order
restraining, enjoining, altering or materially delaying the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

2.5 Consents and Approvals. Except as set forth in Schedule 2.5, no consent,
approval, order or Authorization of or registration, declaration or filing
with or exemption by (collectively, the "Consents") any Governmental Authority
or any other Person, is required by or with respect to Seller in connection
with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Seller or Guarantor, or
the consummation by Seller, any Subsidiary Transferor or Guarantor of the
transaction contemplated hereby, except for any consents which if not obtained
would not reasonably be expected to be material in the context of the Wind
Projects or Transmission Project, or to otherwise prevent or materially impair
or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

2.6 Acquired Interests. Seller owns, directly or indirectly through one or
more Seller Affiliates as identified in Part I of Appendix C, of record and
beneficially one hundred percent (100%) of the Acquired Interests. Part I of
Appendix C sets forth the equity capitalization of the Project Companies. All
of the interests described in Part I of Appendix C have been duly authorized,
validly issued and are fully-paid and non-assessable and, except as set forth
on Part I of Appendix C, there are no outstanding (a) equity interests or
voting securities of Topco or any of its Subsidiaries, (b) securities of Topco
or any of its Subsidiaries convertible into or exchangeable for any equity
interests or voting securities of Topco or any of its Subsidiaries or (c)
options or other rights to acquire from Topco or any of its Subsidiaries, or
other obligation of Topco or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, any equity
interests or voting securities or securities convertible into or exchangeable
for equity interests or voting securities of Topco or any of its Subsidiaries,
or any obligations of Topco or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem
or otherwise acquire any of the foregoing. Seller (or, if applicable, the
Subsidiary Transferors) has good and valid title to, and has, or will have,
full power and authority to convey, the Acquired Interests, as of the Closing
Date. The Acquired Interests have been, or will be, validly issued, and are,

proceedings pending against, being contemplated by or, to the Knowledge of
Seller, threatened against, Seller, any Subsidiary Transferor or Guarantor.
None of Seller, any Subsidiary Transferor or Guarantor (a) has had a receiver,

its debts as and when they fall due, (c) has made a general assignment for the
benefit of its creditors, or (d) has taken any action to approve any of the
foregoing.

2.8 Compliance with Law. To the Knowledge of Seller, there has been no actual
violation by Seller, any Subsidiary Transferor or Guarantor of or failure of
Seller, any Subsidiary Transferor or Guarantor to comply with any Governmental
Rule that is applicable to it, or allegation by any Governmental Authority of
such a violation, that would reasonably be expected to be material and relates
to the Wind Projects or Transmission Project or would otherwise reasonably be
expected to prevent or materially impair or delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

2.9 Taxes. Each of the representations and warranties by the Broadview B
Member pursuant to Section 3.5 of the ECCA is true and correct at and as of
the date hereof and the Closing Date (other than any representations or
warranties that are made as of an earlier specific date, which shall be true
and correct as of such date). For each of the representations and warranties
by the Broadview B Member pursuant to Section 3.5 of the ECCA that is made as
of the Funding Date, no facts or circumstances as of the date hereof would
reasonably be expected to preclude such representation or warranty from being
true and correct as of the Funding Date. For purposes of this Section 2.9,
each reference in Section 3.5 of the ECCA to "Company" shall be treated as if
it were a reference to Topco, Holdco, Broadview B Member and Broadview Holdco.
Each of the representations and warranties by the WI Entities pursuant to
Section 4.6 of the Western Interconnect Loan Agreement is true and correct at
and as of the date hereof, and each of the representations and warranties by
PWI Holdings pursuant to Section 4.6 of the Western Interconnect Loan
Agreement is true and correct at and as of the Closing Date, other than in
each case any representations or warranties that are made as of an earlier
specific date, which shall be true and correct as of such date. Each of the
representations and warranties by Holdco pursuant to Section 4.6 of the
Broadview Back-Leverage Loan Agreement is true and correct at and as of the
date hereof and the Closing Date (other than any representations or warranties
that are made as of an earlier specific date, which shall be true and correct
as of such date).

2.10 Unregistered Securities. It is not necessary in connection with the sale
of the Acquired Interests, under the circumstances contemplated by this
Agreement, to register such Acquired Interests under the Securities Act of
1933 (the "Securities Act") or under any other applicable securities laws.

2.11 Broker's Fees. None of Seller, any Subsidiary Transferor or Guarantor has
any liability or obligation for any fees or commissions to any broker, finder
or agent with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



2.12 Matters Relating to the Acquired Interests, the Project Companies, the
Wind Projects, and the Transmission Project. A true, complete and correct list
of all Material Contracts as of the date hereof is set forth on Parts I, III,
IV and V of Appendix D. All representations and warranties set forth in
Schedule 2.12 (disregarding all qualifications set forth therein as to
materiality, material adverse effect or other similar qualifications) are true
and correct at and as of the date hereof and the Closing Date as if made at
and as of such dates (other than any representations or warranties that are
made as of a specific date, which shall be true and correct as of such date),
with only such exceptions as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Impact.

2.13 Broadview MIPA and Assignment Agreement. The Broadview MIPA (a)
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of Seller, enforceable
against it in accordance with its terms, except as may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization and similar laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and subject to
general principles of equity regardless of whether enforceability is
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law, and (b) has not been amended,
amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified. None of Seller or,
to the Knowledge of Seller, any other party to the Broadview MIPA is in
violation of, or default under, the Broadview MIPA, as applicable. None of
Seller or its Affiliates is a party to or has received written notice of any
pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened litigation, action, or suit
relating to the Broadview MIPA. Seller has provided Purchaser with a true,
complete and correct copy of the Broadview MIPA (including the Broadview
Provisions of the Grady MIPA). As of the Closing Date, Seller will have all
requisite power and authority to make the acknowledgment and agreement set
forth under "Assignment Agreement" in Part VII of Appendix B to this
Agreement.

period from the date hereof to the earlier of the Closing Date and the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 5.4:

(a) Project Specific Pre-Closing Covenants of Seller. Unless consented or
otherwise agreed to by Purchaser (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld
or delayed) and except as required by Governmental Rule, Seller agrees to
comply with the provisions, if any, of Schedule 4.1(a).

(b) Access, Information and Documents. Seller will give to Purchaser and to
Purchaser's counsel, accountants and other representatives reasonable access
during normal business hours to all material Books and Records and the Wind

such documents and copies of documents and all information, including
operational reports, with respect to the affairs of the Project Companies, the
Seller Affiliates, the Wind Projects, and the Transmission Project as
Purchaser may reasonably request subject to any confidentiality obligations
imposed on Seller by any unaffiliated counterparties to such contracts and
agreements. Purchaser agrees to comply with any confidentiality obligations
which would be applicable to it under any such contracts, documents or
agreements received from Seller hereunder.

(c) Updating of Disclosure Schedules. Seller shall notify Purchaser in writing
of any material changes, additions, or events occurring after the date of this
Agreement which require a representation and warranty of Seller (other than
any representations or warranties in Sections 2.6 and 2.11) to be supplemented
with a new Schedule or cause any material change in or addition to a Schedule
promptly after Seller becomes aware of the same by delivery of such new
Schedule or appropriate updates to any such Schedule (each, an "Updated
Disclosure Schedule") to Purchaser. Each Updated Disclosure Schedule shall (i)
expressly state that it is being made pursuant to this Section 4.1(c), (ii)
specify the representations and warranties to which it applies and (iii)
describe in reasonable detail the changes, additions or events to which it

which it applies only if Purchaser specifically agrees thereto in writing or,
as provided in and subject to Article 5, consummates the Closing under this
Agreement after receipt of such written notification, and an Updated
Disclosure Schedule shall be considered to constitute or give rise to a waiver
by Purchaser of a condition set forth in this Agreement only if Purchaser
specifically agrees thereto in writing or consummates the Closing under this
Agreement after receipt of such written notification.

(d) Further Assurances. Each of the parties hereto shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or

connection with any reports, studies or other documents listed in Part II of
Appendix D, unless specifically noted in Part II of Appendix D), including
legal fees and the fees of any broker of Seller or its Affiliates, relating to
or resulting from the negotiation, performance of and compliance with this
Agreement by Seller.

(b) Public Announcement; Confidentiality. No party hereto shall make or issue,
or cause to be made or issued, any public announcement or written statement
concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without the
prior written consent of the other party, except to the extent required by law

Governmental Rules and standards governing disclosures to investors) or in
accordance with the rules, regulations and orders of any stock exchange.

employees, agents, consultants, advisors and partners not to, disclose any
confidential information in or relating to this Agreement other than (i) to

equity financing, and the directors, officers, employees, agents, consultants,
advisors and partners of such party, such Affiliates, or such providers or
potential providers, provided in each case that such recipient is bound by
reasonable confidentiality obligations, (ii) as required by applicable law or
regulation or (iii) with the prior consent of Purchaser. Seller shall not use,
and shall not enable any third party to use, any confidential information in
or relating to this Agreement that constitutes material non-public information
regarding Purchaser in a manner that is prohibited by the U.S. securities
laws.

(c) Other Obligations of Seller and Purchaser. The parties mutually covenant
as follows:

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

to cooperate with each other in determining whether filings are required to be

with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
in making or causing to be made any such filings promptly and in seeking to
obtain timely any such consents; 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

to use all reasonable efforts in good faith to obtain promptly the
satisfaction of the conditions to Closing of the transactions contemplated
herein, including obtaining all required consents and approvals; 

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

to furnish to the other party and to the other party's counsel all such
information as may be reasonably required in order to effectuate the foregoing
actions; and 

| 
---|--- 

(iv)

|

to advise the other party promptly if such party determines that any condition
precedent to its obligations hereunder will not be satisfied in a timely
manner. 

(d) Tax Characterization.

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

Purchaser and Seller acknowledge and agree that the transactions contemplated
hereby will be treated for federal income Tax purposes as a purchase of the
assets of the Project Companies (other than Western Interconnect LLC), subject
to the liabilities of the Project Companies. Neither Purchaser nor Seller
shall file any income Tax Return inconsistent with such treatment. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

Within sixty (60) days after the Closing, Purchaser shall prepare a schedule
allocating the Purchase Price among the Project Companies' assets in a manner
consistent with Code sections 755 and 1060 and consistent with the percentages
allocated to different classes of assets in the Cost Segregation Consultant
Report to be provided to Class A Equity Investors pursuant to Section 5.3(bb)
of the ECCA. Purchaser shall deliver such schedule to Seller for its approval,
not to be unreasonably denied or delayed. If Seller objects to Purchaser's
schedule, Seller shall notify Purchaser within fifteen (15) days after its
receipt of the schedule, and Seller and Purchaser shall negotiate in good
faith to resolve any differences. If any dispute cannot be resolved with
fifteen (15) days, Purchaser and Seller shall jointly retain an accounting
firm that is nationally recognized in the United States (the "Accountant").
Accountant shall decide (A) as to whether Seller's objections are unreasonable
and (B) as to the resolution of Seller's objections as are reasonable, shall
be final; provided that such Accountant's decision shall be consistent with
the Cost Segregation Consultant Report referred to above. Purchaser, Seller
and their respective Affiliates shall use the allocation in the schedule, as
modified by the negotiations of Seller and Purchaser and by the resolutions of
Accountant for all federal income Tax purposes and shall not file any Tax
Returns inconsistent with such allocation. 

(e) No Tax-Exempt Controlled Entity. So long as Seller and its Affiliates own
an interest greater than 10% in Purchaser, Seller's and its Affiliates'
ownership shall not cause Purchaser to be a "tax-exempt controlled entity"
within the meaning of Code Section 168(h)(6)(F)(iii)(I).

this Article 6 (an "Indemnifying Party") shall not be liable under this
Article 6 to an Indemnified Party for any Claim for breach of any

for which it would, in the absence of this provision, be liable exceeds the
Basket Amount, and in such event the Indemnified Party will be liable for the
amount of all Claims, including the Basket Amount; provided that the foregoing
limitation shall not apply in the case of actual fraud by the Indemnifying
Party.

(b) Maximum Limit on Claims.

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

Limitation on Seller's Liability. Seller's maximum aggregate liability for
Claims for breaches of representations and warranties under this Agreement is
limited to Seller's Maximum Liability set forth in Part VI of Appendix B;
provided that the Seller's Maximum Liability will not apply to any Claim based
on (A) actual fraud or (B) any breach of the representations and warranties
set forth in Sections 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.5, 2.6, 2.9 and 2.11. 

|

set forth in Part VI of Appendix B.

6.3 Reimbursements; Refunds.



(a) Right of Reimbursement. The amount of Losses payable under Section 6.1 by
an Indemnifying Party shall be net of (i) any amounts recovered by the
Indemnified Party under applicable insurance policies or from any other Person
responsible therefor, and (ii) any Tax benefit actually realized by the
Indemnified Party arising from the incurrence or payment of any such Losses.
If the Indemnified Party receives any amounts under applicable insurance
policies, or from any other Person responsible for any Losses subsequent to an
indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party and such amounts would
result in a duplicative recovery, then such Indemnified Party shall promptly
reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any payment made or expense incurred by
such Indemnifying Party in connection with providing such indemnification
payment up to the amount received by the Indemnified Party, net of any
expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in collecting such amount.

(b) Other Refund Obligations. In addition to the obligations set forth in
Section 6.3(a), the applicable Indemnified Party shall be obligated to
reimburse or refund to the Indemnifying Party for payments made by it to such
Indemnified Party under this Article 6 as set forth in Part VI of Appendix B.

6.4 Right to Control Proceedings for Third Party Claims.

(a) If a third party shall notify any party with respect to any matter that
may give rise to a Claim (a "Third Party Claim"), the Indemnified Party must
give notice to the Indemnifying Party of the Third Party Claim (a "Third Party
Claim Notice") within twenty (20) Business Days after it becomes aware of the
existence of the Third Party Claim and that it may constitute a Third Party
Claim. The Indemnified Party's failure to give a Third Party Claim Notice in
compliance with this Section 6.4(a) of any Third Party Claim which may give
rise to a right of indemnification hereunder shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of any liability which it may have to the Indemnified Party
unless, and solely to the extent that, the failure to give such notice
materially and adversely prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in, or by
giving written notice to the Indemnified Party, to assume control of the
defense of any Third Party Claim with the Indemnifying Party's own counsel, in
each case at the Indemnifying Party's own cost and expense (provided that
prior to assuming control of such defense, the Indemnifying Party must
acknowledge its indemnity obligations under this Article 6), and the
Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith in such defense. The
Indemnified Party shall have the right, at its own cost and expense, to
participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim with separate counsel
selected by it, subject to the Indemnifying Party's right to control the
defense thereof; provided that in such event the Indemnifying Party shall pay
the fees and expenses of such separate counsel (i) incurred by the Indemnified
Party prior to the date the Indemnifying Party assumes control of the defense
of the Third Party Claim, (ii) if such Third Party Claim would reasonably be
expected to be materially detrimental to the business, reputation or future
prospects of any Indemnified Party or (iii) if representation of both the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party by the same counsel would create
a conflict of interest. If the Indemnifying Party (i) fails to promptly notify
the Indemnified Party in writing of its election to defend or fails to
acknowledge its indemnity obligations under this Article 6 as provided in this
Agreement, (ii) elects not to defend (or compromise at its sole cost



and expense) such Third Party Claim, (iii) has elected to defend such Third
Party Claim but fails to promptly and diligently pursue the defense such Third
Party Claim, (iv) otherwise breaches any of its obligations under this Article
6 or (v) as set forth on Schedule 6.4(b) hereto, or if the Third Party Claim
is reasonably expected by the Indemnified Party to result in a payment
obligation on the Indemnified Party in an amount that exceeds the maximum
indemnification then available to the Indemnified Party pursuant to this
Article 6, then the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume or
maintain control of the defense of such Third Party Claim and the Indemnified
Party may (by written notice to the Indemnifying Party) assume control of such
defense (in which case the Indemnifying Party shall pay the fees and expenses
of counsel retained by the Indemnified Party) and/or compromise such Third
Party Claim and seek indemnification for any and all Losses based upon,
arising from or relating to such Third Party Claim. The parties shall
cooperate with each other in all reasonable respects in connection with the
defense of any Third Party Claim.

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Indemnifying
Party shall not enter into any settlement of any Third Party Claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as provided in this Section 6.4(c).
If a firm offer is made to settle a Third Party Claim that (i) does not (A)
result in any liability or create any financial or other obligation on the
part of the Indemnified Party or (B) result in the loss of any right or
benefit on the part of any Indemnified Party, (ii) does not impose injunctive
or other equitable relief against any Indemnified Party, and (iii) provides,
in customary form, for the unconditional release of each Indemnified Party
from all liabilities and obligations in connection with such Third Party
Claim, and the Indemnifying Party desires to accept and agree to such firm
offer, then the Indemnifying Party shall give written notice to that effect to
the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm
offer within twenty (20) days after its receipt of such notice, the
Indemnified Party may continue to contest or defend such Third Party Claim,
and in such event, the maximum liability of the Indemnifying Party as to such
Third Party Claim shall not exceed the amount of such settlement offer. If the
Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm offer within such twenty (20)
day period and also fails to assume defense of such Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party may settle the Third Party Claim upon the terms set forth
in such firm offer to settle such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnified Party
has assumed the defense pursuant to Section 6.4(b), it may settle the Third
Party Claim; provided that if the settlement is made without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), the Indemnifying Party shall have no indemnity
obligation pursuant to this Article 6 with respect to such Third Party Claim.

6.5 Mitigation; Treatment of Indemnification.

(a) The Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate all Losses relating to a Claim for which indemnification is sought
under this Article 6.

(b) All indemnification payments under this Article 6 shall be deemed
adjustments to the Purchase Price.

6.6 Exclusive Remedy. Each of Seller and Purchaser acknowledges and agrees
that, should the Closing occur, and excluding liability for actual fraud, the
foregoing indemnification provisions of this Article 6 and the provisions of
Section 7.16 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy



of Seller and Purchaser with respect to any misrepresentation, breach of
warranty, covenant or other agreement (other than any Post-Closing Purchase
Price Adjustment or Grady Payment set forth in Part I of Appendix B) or other
claim arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Purchaser and Seller
covenants to the other party that, in respect of any matters under or
contemplated in this Agreement, it will not make any Claim whatsoever against
any Affiliate (other than Guarantor) of the other party or the directors,
officers, managers, shareholders, member, controlling persons, employees and
agents of any of the foregoing, in each case in their capacities as such, and
its rights in respect of any such Claim for breach of any provision of this
Agreement are limited solely to such rights as it may have against Seller (and
Guarantor) or Purchaser, as the case may be, under this Agreement.

Selection of Arbitrators. Disputes shall be resolved by a panel of three
independent and impartial arbitrators (the "Arbitrators"). The party or
parties initiating the arbitration shall appoint an arbitrator in its Demand;
the responding party or parties shall appoint an arbitrator in its answering
statement, which is due thirty (30) days after receipt of the Demand. If any
party fails or refuses to timely nominate an arbitrator within the time
permitted, such arbitrator shall be appointed by the AAA from individuals with
significant experience in renewable energy projects from its Large, Complex
Commercial Case Panel. Within thirty (30) days after the appointment of the
second arbitrator, the two party-appointed arbitrators shall appoint the third
arbitrator, who shall act as the chair of the arbitration panel. If the two
party-appointed arbitrators fail or refuse to appoint the third arbitrator
within such thirty (30)-day period, the third arbitrator shall be appointed by
the AAA from individuals with significant experience in renewable energy
projects from its Large, Complex Commercial Case Panel in accordance with Rule
R-12. The Arbitrators, acting by majority vote, shall resolve all Disputes.

Any action in connection therewith shall be brought in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York or, if that court does
not have jurisdiction, any New York state court in New York County. Each party
consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in any such suit, action
or proceeding, and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of
any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit,
action or proceeding which is brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Each party further agrees to accept service of process out
of any of the before mentioned courts in any such Dispute by registered or
certified mail addressed to the party at the address set forth in Part VII of
Appendix B. 

| 
---|--- 

(iv)

|

(vi)

|

and expenses of the arbitration proceeding (including the Arbitrators' fees
and expenses) against any 

 

party. The Arbitrators shall also have the authority to award attorneys' fees
and expenses to the prevailing party or parties. In assessing the costs and
expenses of the arbitration and/or awarding attorneys' fee and expenses, the

prevailed on the disputed issues and the relative importance of those issues.

cross-referenced to such other Schedule to the extent that the relevance of
such matter is reasonably apparent on the face thereof. The fact that any item

"Closing Purchase Price Adjustment":



|

On the Closing Date the Initial Base Purchase Price will be adjusted to
reflect the Sale Model Adjustment as described below.



"Sale Model Adjustment" means an increase or decrease, as the case may be, in
the Initial Base Purchase Price payable at the Closing (i) necessary for the
Purchaser to maintain under the Closing Sale Model (as defined below) the
economic benefits to be received by Purchaser as reflected in the Sale Model,
and (ii) subtracting, if applicable, the GRT Price Adjustment. The Sale Model
Adjustment shall be determined as follows:



(1) Three (3) Business Days prior to the expected Closing Date or, if later,
finalization of the Base Case Model (as defined in the ECCA) pursuant to
Section 2.2(c) of the ECCA, Seller shall provide to Purchaser an updated Sale
Model that shall reflect any changes since the date of this Agreement to the
following (and not any other changes):



(A) the amounts reflected in the update of the Base Case Model pursuant to
Section 2.2(c) of the ECCA with respect to (i) the items set forth in Exhibit
B of the Project Agreement under the caption "Members, Capital Contributions,
Etc." (excluding the Deficit Account Caps and, for the avoidance of doubt, the
amount of the capital contribution of Broadview B Member LLC) and (ii) items
(i) and (j) of Annex 19 to the ECCA;

(B) preserving the Class A Investor Payout;

(C) the number of Wind Turbines (as defined in the ECCA) below one hundred
forty-one (141) with respect to which the Independent Engineer (as defined in
the ECCA) has delivered a certificate substantially in the form of Annex 12 to
the ECCA on or prior to the expected Closing Date; and

(D) Any manifest errors in the Base Case Model corrected in accordance with
Section 2.2(c) of the ECCA.



Separately, to the extent any New Mexico state gross receipts tax is
determined in writing by the relevant taxing authorities after the date of
this Agreement to be assessed (or, potentially in the case of a Post-Closing
Purchase Price Adjustment, not to be assessed) on the transmission wheeling
fees paid by the Project Companies under their Transmission Service
Agreements, the GRT Price Adjustment will be calculated by: (i) revising the
Sale Model solely to reflect the assessment of the state gross receipts tax on
the transmission wheeling fees, (ii) updating the tax equity partnership
parameters in such Sale Model pursuant to Section 2.2(c) of the ECCA but
adjusting the input assumptions in such Sale Model solely for the gross
receipts tax revision, (iii) reducing (or, potentially in the case of a Post-
Closing Purchase Price Adjustment, increasing) the Initial Base Purchase Price
by the amount necessary for the Purchaser to maintain under the Closing Sale
Model the economic benefits to be received by Purchaser as reflected in the
Sale Model, and (iv) multiplying such reduction (or increase, as applicable)
by 50% (the amount resulting after clause (iv) being the "GRT Price
Adjustment").








 

 

App. B - 3 

 
--- 
| | 

|

The updated Sale Model shall be accompanied by a proposed calculation of the
Sale Model Adjustment, together with reasonably detailed supporting
information with respect to such calculation and the nature of the changes to
the Sale Model. Following delivery, Purchaser and Seller shall reasonably
cooperate in a good faith effort to finalize the Sale Model Adjustment, and
Seller shall provide to Purchaser any other information reasonably requested
by Purchaser in connection therewith.



(2) As promptly as practicable, but in no event later than two (2) Business
Days prior to the expected Closing Date, Purchaser shall notify Seller of its
approval of Seller's updated Sale Model and calculation of the Sale Model
Adjustment (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) or,
if Purchaser does not approve of such Sale Model or the Sale Model Adjustment,
Purchaser's reasonable objections thereto. If Purchaser does not approve the
updated Sale Model or the Sale Model Adjustment, Seller and Purchaser shall
meet and negotiate in good faith the appropriate updated Sale Model and Sale
Model Adjustment in a manner consistent with the provisions of this Agreement
and to allow for the consummation of the purchase of the Acquired Interests by
the proposed Closing Date. In the event that Purchaser and Seller are not able
to reach agreement by the expected Closing Date, the dispute shall be
submitted for resolution as provided in Section 7.5. The updated Sale Model as
determined herein shall be the "Closing Sale Model."



"Sale Model" means the model agreed by Purchaser and Seller as of the date of
this Agreement for the calculation of Topco's economic benefits over a 25-year
period from the Closing Date on an after-tax basis, assuming internal use of
any tax benefits.



If the Sale Model Adjustment is positive, the Initial Base Purchase Price
payable by Purchaser to Seller on the Closing Date will be increased by the
amount of the Sale Model Adjustment.



If the Sale Model Adjustment is negative, the Initial Base Purchase Price
payable by Purchaser to Seller on the Closing Date will be decreased by the
amount of the Sale Model Adjustment.

"Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment":

|

After the Closing, the Final Base Purchase Price will be adjusted as follows:
(A) (i) on the date any excess amounts in the Project Completion Account (as
defined in the ECCA) are distributed to the Class B Member (as defined in the
ECCA) pursuant to Section 5.02(f)(ii) of the Project Agreement or, if the
amounts in such Project Completion Account are exhausted prior to the date
Final Completion (as defined in the ECCA) occurs, the date of such Final
Completion or (ii) on the date any excess amounts in the Completion Account
(as defined in the Western Interconnect Loan Agreement) are distributed by PWI
Holdings pursuant to Section 4.07(b)(i) of the Depository Agreement (as
defined in the Western Interconnect Loan Agreement) or, if the amounts in such
Completion Account are exhausted prior to the date Final Completion (as
defined in the Western Interconnect EPC Contract) occurs, the date of such
Final Completion (each such date, a "Completion Adjustment Date"), the amounts
described in Item I below will be paid as an adjustment to the Final Base
Purchase Price, and (B) if there are any Delayed Turbines, on the date the
amounts in the Escrow Account (as defined in the ECCA) are released to the
Class B Member pursuant to the Escrow Agreement (as defined in, and as amended
pursuant to, the ECCA) and the Project Agreement in respect of such Delayed
Turbines (the "Delayed Turbine Adjustment Date"), the amounts described in
Item II below will be paid as an adjustment to the Final Base Purchase Price.



Item I: Completion Adjustment



"Completion Adjustment" means either:

(1) (A) the amount, if any, released to the Class B Member from the Project
Completion Account (as defined in the ECCA) following achievement of Final
Completion (as defined in the ECCA) in accordance with the ECCA or (B) the
amount of distributions by PWI Holdings in accordance with the Depository
Agreement (as defined in the Western Interconnect Loan Agreement) attributable
to funds transferred from the Completion Account (as defined in the Western
Interconnect Loan Agreement) (each such amount so released or distributed, the
"Surplus Amount"); or

(2) (A) if the amounts on deposit in the Project Completion Account (as
defined in the ECCA) are insufficient to (x) fund the actual costs and
expenses (including the costs and expenses of or related to any Delayed
Turbines (as defined in the ECCA)) necessary to achieve Final Completion (as
defined in the ECCA) and (y) pay all Transaction Expenses (as defined in the
ECCA), the aggregate amount of any such shortfall or (B) if the amounts on
deposit in the Completion Account (as defined in the Western Interconnect Loan
Agreement) are insufficient to fund the actual costs and expenses necessary to
achieve Final Completion (as defined in the Western Interconnect EPC
Contract), the aggregate amount of any such shortfall (each such shortfall,
the "Deficit Amount").

If the Completion Adjustment is an amount determined under clause (1), then
the Surplus Amount shall be paid by Purchaser to Seller on the Completion
Adjustment Date, and the Final Base Purchase Price will increase by the
Surplus Amount. If the Completion Adjustment is an amount determined under
clause (2), then the Deficit Amount shall be paid by Seller to Purchaser on
the Completion Adjustment Date, and the Final Base Purchase Price will
decrease by the Deficit Amount. 

 

App. B - 5

Item II: Delayed Turbine Adjustment



"Delayed Turbine Adjustment" means the increase, if any, in the Final Base
Purchase Price necessary for the Purchaser to maintain under the Revised Sale
Model the economic benefits to be received by Purchaser as reflected in the
Closing Sale Model, as expressed in a 25-year unlevered after-tax internal
rate of return and after giving effect (a) to the release to the Class B
Member of funds in the Escrow Account (as defined in the ECCA) in respect of
all or a portion of such Delayed Turbines pursuant to the Escrow Agreement (as
defined in, and as amended pursuant to, the ECCA) and the Project Agreement,
or (b) to the reasonable value, if any, to the Purchaser reasonably expected
to be derived from continued ownership of Delayed Turbines that were not
funded by the Class A Equity Investors.



For purposes of determining the Delayed Turbine Adjustment, the Closing Sale
Model shall be adjusted as follows:



(1)

Three (3) Business Days prior to the expected release of proceeds from the
Escrow Account in respect of all or a portion of such Delayed Turbines, Seller
shall provide to Purchaser an adjusted Closing Sale Model reflecting:



(A)

the number of Delayed Turbines that the Independent Engineer has certified to
have achieved substantial completion;

(B)

The earliest date by which a Unit Commissioning Completion Certificate (as
defined in the ECCA) has been received for each such Delayed Turbine and each
such Delayed Turbine has been Placed in Service (as defined in the ECCA); and

(C)

the amount of funds released from the Escrow Account (as defined in the ECCA);



together with a calculation of the Delayed Turbine Adjustment and reasonably
detailed supporting information with respect thereto.



(2)

As promptly as practicable, but in no event later than two (2) Business Days
prior to the expected date of release of proceeds from the Escrow Account in
respect of all or a portion of the Delayed Turbines, Purchaser shall notify
Seller of its approval of Seller's adjusted Closing Sale Model (which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) or, if Purchaser does not
approve of such model, Purchaser's reasonable objections to Seller's adjusted
Closing Sale Model. If Purchaser does not approve the adjusted Closing Sale
Model, Seller and Purchaser shall meet and negotiate in good faith the
appropriate adjusted Closing Sale Model and Delayed Turbine Adjustment in a
manner consistent with the provisions of this Agreement, and, if they cannot
so agree within five (5) Business Days, the dispute shall be submitted for
resolution as provided in Section 7.5. The updated Closing Sale Model as
determined herein shall become the "Revised Sale Model." 

 

App. B - 6 

 
--- 
| | 

|



If any of the Delayed Turbines were not funded by the Class A Equity Investors
pursuant to the ECCA, but are owned by a Project Company (as contemplated by
Section 2.6(a) of the ECCA), then Purchaser and Seller shall meet and
negotiate in good faith for the adjustment to the Final Base Purchase Price
contemplated by clause (b) of the definition of Delayed Turbine Adjustment
that results in the Purchaser paying to Seller the reasonable value, if any,
to Purchaser reasonably expected to be derived from such continued ownership
of the Delayed Turbines based upon the expected production of such Delayed
Turbines and the economic parameters of the Revised Sale Model (and
appropriately taking into account any funding or credit support provided by or
on behalf of Purchaser), and, if they cannot so agree on a resolution of such
matter within five (5) Business Days, the dispute shall be submitted for
resolution as provided in Section 7.5. If any Delayed Turbines owned by the
Project Companies are transferred to or at the direction of Purchaser, then
such Delayed Turbines will be transferred to Seller unless otherwise agreed by
Purchaser and Seller.





Item III: Gross Receipts Tax Adjustment



To the extent that (i) the Closing Sale Model excludes any New Mexico state
gross receipts tax on the transmission wheeling fees paid by the Project
Companies under their Transmission Service Agreements, and (ii) the relevant
taxing authorities subsequently determine in writing within four (4) years
after the Closing Date that such gross receipts tax is to be assessed on the
transmission wheeling fees, then an amount equal to the GRT Price Adjustment
shall be paid from Seller to Purchaser.

To the extent that (i) either (a) the Closing Sale Model includes New Mexico
state gross receipts tax on the transmission wheeling fees paid by the Project
Companies under their Transmission Service Agreements, or (b) a GRT Price
Adjustment payment is made to Purchaser and (ii) the assessment of such gross
receipts tax on the transmission wheeling fees is subsequently disallowed
within four (4) years after the Closing Date, then a GRT Price Adjustment
shall be calculated and paid from Purchaser to Seller.


 

 

App. B - 7

"Grady Payments"

|

"Grady Transmission Rights" means the 200 MW of firm transmission rights
presently intended for the 220 MW Grady Project.

"Grady Phase" means a wind project using the Grady Transmission Rights.

"Grady Phase COD" means the date on which construction of a Grady Phase has
been completed and the sale of energy, other than on a test basis, from such
Grady Phase has commenced.

Upon each Grady Phase COD that occurs within six (6) years after the Closing
Date, Purchaser will pay the applicable Grady Payment described below to
Seller.

"Grady Payments" means an amount payable upon each Grady Phase COD, determined
using, as applicable, the Closing Sale Model, Revised Sale Model or Further
Revised Sale Model to calculate the present value amount of the following:



(A)

the increase in the 25-year projected revenues of Pattern Payee (as defined in
the Transmission Development Agreement) under the Transmission Development
Agreement as a result of such Grady Phase COD;

(B)

the decrease in the Wind Projects' estimated P50 production delivered over a
25-year period due to wake effects, transmission losses and transmission
outages imposed by such Grady Phase COD, taking into account the effects of
any payments to which the Project Companies are entitled under the Build-Out
Agreement.



The effect of the amounts above in the Closing Sale Model, Revised Sale Model
or Further Revised Sale Model shall be discounted back to the applicable date
of a Grady Phase COD using the 25-year unlevered after-tax internal rate of
return used in connection with acquisition of the Wind Projects and the
Transmission Project. If Purchaser has acquired or is obligated to acquire
such Grady Phase or one or more entities that directly or indirectly own such
Grady Phase, then the rate used to discount the revenues and losses described
in clauses (A) and (B), respectively, shall be adjusted to match the 25-year
unlevered after-tax internal rate of return of such acquisition, which
Purchaser expects to receive on its investment in such Grady Phase.






 

 

App. B - 8

|



(1)

Three (3) Business Days prior to the expected Grady Phase COD, Seller shall
provide to Purchaser, as applicable, an updated Closing Sale Model or Revised
Sale Model, in the case of any initial Grady Payment, or an updated Further
Revised Sale Model, in the case of any subsequent Grady Payment.

(2)

The updated Closing Sale Model, Revised Sale Model or Further Revised Sale
Model, as applicable, shall be accompanied by a proposed calculation of the
Grady Payment, together with reasonably detailed supporting information with
respect to such calculation and the nature of the changes to the Closing Sale
Model, Revised Sale Model or Further Revised Sale Model, as applicable.

(3)

The Grady Payment shall be calculated without duplication of any prior payment
made.

(4)

Following delivery, Purchaser and Seller shall reasonably cooperate in a good
faith effort to finalize the Grady Payment, and Seller shall provide to
Purchaser any other information reasonably requested by Purchaser in
connection therewith.

(5)

As promptly as practicable, but in no event later than two (2) Business Days
prior to the expected Grady Phase COD, Purchaser shall notify Seller of its
approval of Seller's updated Closing Sale Model, Revised Sale Model or Further
Revised Sale Model, as applicable, and calculation of the Grady Payment (which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) or, if Purchaser does
not approve of such Closing Sale Model, Revised Sale Model or Further Revised
Sale Model, as applicable, or the Grady Payment, Purchaser's reasonable
objections thereto. If Purchaser does not approve the updated Closing Sale
Model, Revised Sale Model or Further Revised Sale Model, as applicable, or the
Grady Payment, Seller and Purchaser shall meet and negotiate in good faith the
appropriate Grady Payment in a manner consistent with the provisions of this
Agreement. In the event that Purchaser and Seller are not able to reach
agreement by the expected Grady Phase COD, the dispute shall be submitted for
resolution as provided in Section 7.5. The updated Closing Sale Model, Revised
Sale Model or Further Revised Sale Model, as applicable, shall supersede any
prior Further Revised Sale Model, as applicable, and become the "Further
Revised Sale Model" for all purposes on and after the date of such
determination under this Agreement.
