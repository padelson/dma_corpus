Letters are in full force and effect and have not been amended or modified in any material respect.
As of the date hereof, neither the Sponsor nor any Lender has notified Buyer or Merger Sub of its

As of the date hereof, to the knowledge of Buyer, no event has occurred which, with or without

Merger Sub do not have any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing will not
be timely satisfied or that the Financing will not be made available to Merger Sub on the Closing
Date. All commitment and other fees required to be paid under the Commitment Letters on or prior
to the date hereof have been paid. Except for the payment of fees relating to the Financing, there
are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of the
Financing or the conditions precedent thereto, other than as set forth in the Commitment Letters

determined in the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware (unless the Court of Chancery shall
decline to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, in which case, the Legal Proceeding shall
be filed in any Delaware state or federal court within the State of Delaware and any appeals
therefrom shall be brought and determined in the appropriate, respective, appellate court), and
each of the parties consents to the jurisdiction of such courts and appellate courts in any such
Legal Proceeding and hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any
objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such Legal Proceeding in
any such court or that any Legal Proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Process in any such Legal Proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in
the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court, and the parties are hereby
deemed to consent to such service. Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service
of process on such party as provided in <U>Section&nbsp;8.2</U> shall be deemed effective service of
process on such party. The parties separately agree that any Legal Proceeding contending that this
Agreement is invalid, void ab initio, or voidable on any grounds, including fraud in the
inducement, is subject to the jurisdictional and venue provisions set forth in this <U>Section
8.10</U>, and that this <U>Section&nbsp;8.10</U> is separable and fully enforceable without regard to
the enforceability of this Agreement as a whole or any other portion of it.

of the Company to perform its agreements and covenants hereunder in accordance with their specific
terms, including its failure to take all actions as are necessary on its part to consummate the
Merger, will cause irreparable injury to Buyer and Merger Sub, for which damages, even if
available, will not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, each party agrees that,

hereof, in addition to any other remedy at law or equity. In the event that any action shall be
brought in equity to enforce the provisions of the Agreement, the Company shall not allege, and
hereby waives the defense, that there is an adequate remedy at Law. The parties further
acknowledge that the Company shall not be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement by Buyer or Merger Sub or to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement and that the Company&#146;s sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any
such breach shall be the remedy available to the Company set forth in <U>Section&nbsp;7.2(d)</U>.

illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable Law or rule in any jurisdiction, such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision or portion of any
provision in such jurisdiction, and this Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in
such jurisdiction as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion of any
provision had never been contained herein.
