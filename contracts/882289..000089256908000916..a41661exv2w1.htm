On or prior to the Effective Time, Buyer shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Shares for exchange in accordance with this Article II, cash in an amount sufficient to make payments of the Per Common Share Amount (such cash consideration being deposited hereinafter referred to as the "Payment Fund"). The Paying Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, make payments out of the Payment Fund as provided for in this Article II and the Payment Fund shall not 

   ##### 

  

    

be used for any other purpose. All expenses of the Paying Agent shall be paid
by Buyer or the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (b) _Exchange Procedures for Shares_. As soon as reasonably practicable (but not more than three Business Days) after the Effective Time, Buyer shall mail, or shall cause the Paying Agent to mail, to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Shares (collectively, the "Certificates") (i) a letter of transmittal (a "Letter of Transmittal") (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Buyer may reasonably specify), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment of the Per Common Share Amount, as applicable. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate for cancellation, together with such Letter of Transmittal duly executed, and such other customary documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor by check an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the Per Common Share Amount for each Share formerly represented by such Certificate. Such payment of the Per Common Share Amount shall be sent to such holder by the Paying Agent promptly after receipt by the Paying Agent of such Certificate, together with such Letter of Transmittal duly executed, and such other customary documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, and the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. The right of any stockholder to receive the Per Common Share Amount shall be subject to and reduced by any applicable withholding obligation as set forth in  _Section 2.13_. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash payable upon the surrender of a Certificate. 

  

 (c) _Exchange Procedures for Stock Options_. Promptly after the Effective Time and in any event within three (3) Business Days thereof, Buyer will or will cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of an agreement ("Option Agreement") that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Stock Options, whose Stock Options were converted into the right to receive Option Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.11(a)_, appropriate materials and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such Option Agreement in exchange for Option Consideration. Upon surrender of an Option Agreement to the Paying Agent or the Buyer, together with such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent or the Buyer, the holder of such Option Agreement will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash into which the Stock Options previously represented by such Option Agreement have been converted pursuant to _Section 2.11(a)_. If any holder of Stock Options is unable to surrender such holders Option Agreement because such Option Agreement has been lost, mutilated or destroyed, such holder may deliver in lieu thereof an affidavit and indemnity bond in form and substance and with surety reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer. 

  

 (d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock_. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.10_, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Per Common Share Amount, as the case may be, in respect of the Shares formerly 

   ##### 

  

    

represented by such Certificate as contemplated by this _Section 2.10_. All
cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with
the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares represented by such
Certificates. After the Effective Time, there shall be no
further registration of transfers of Shares on the records of the Company,
and if Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be
canceled and exchanged as provided for, and in accordance with the procedures
set forth, in this Article II. 

  

 (e) _Unregistered Transfer of Capital Stock_. If payment of the Per Common Share Amount is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of such payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and any other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable. 

  

 (f) _Lost Certificates_. In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may require as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Per Common Share Amount payable pursuant to this Article II. 

  

 (g) _Investment of Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Payment Fund, as directed by Buyer or, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation, in: (i) direct obligations of, or obligations the principal of and interest on which are unconditionally guaranteed by, the United States of America with a remaining term at the time of acquisition thereof not in excess of 90 days, (ii) money market accounts or certificates of deposit maturing within 90 days of the acquisition thereof and issued by a bank or trust company organized under the Laws of the United States of America or a state thereof and having a combined capital surplus in excess of $500,000,000, or (iii) commercial paper issued by a domestic corporation and given a rating of no lower than A-1 by Standard and Poors Corporation or P-1 by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid as directed by the Buyer. To the extent that there are losses with respect to such investments, or the Payment Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make prompt payments of the Per Common Share Amount and the Option Consideration as contemplated hereby, Buyer shall promptly replace or restore the portion of the Payment Fund lost through investments or other events so as to ensure that the Payment Fund is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make such payments. 

  

 (h) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of Shares or Stock Options entitled to receive payments with respect thereto pursuant to _Section 2.11_, one year after the Effective Time 

   ##### 

  

    

shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand. Any such holders
who have not complied with this Article II prior to that time shall
thereafter look only to the Buyer and the Surviving Corporation for, and the
Surviving Corporation shall be liable for, payment of the Per Common Share
Amount (subject to abandoned property, escheat and similar Law). Any
such portion of the Payment Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Persons previously entitled thereto. 

  

 (i) _No Liability_. None of Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company or the Paying Agent, or any employee, officer, director, agent or Affiliate thereof, shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash from the Payment Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

  

 Section 2.11 Stock Options. At, or immediately prior to, the Effective Time and except as may be agreed between Buyer and any holder of a Stock Option, the Company and Buyer will cause any outstanding Stock Options to be treated as follows: 

   

 (a) At the Effective Time, all then outstanding Stock Options (whether vested or unvested) shall be canceled and in lieu thereof, each holder of such Stock Option will be entitled to receive from the Surviving Corporation an amount in cash (if any) per each Stock Option, equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Per Common Share Amount over the per share exercise price, purchase price, or base amount, if any, of such Stock Option, and (ii) the number of Shares subject to such Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, without interest and less applicable withholding Taxes (the "Option Consideration"). 

   

 (b) The Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts, prior to the Effective Time, to obtain all necessary consents, waivers or releases from holders of Stock Options and will take such action as may be reasonably necessary to give effect to, and accomplish the transactions contemplated by this _Section 2.11_. 

   

 (c) Except as otherwise provided herein or agreed to by the parties, the Stock Option Plans will terminate effective as of the Effective Time and the Company will, prior to the Effective Time, cause the provisions in any other plan, program or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the capital stock of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to be canceled as of the Effective Time. 

  

 Section 2.12 Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who shall have properly demanded and perfected appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL (the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive the applicable Per Common Share Amount, as the case may be, but instead shall be entitled to receive such payment from the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Dissenting Shares as 

   ##### 

  

    

shall be determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or otherwise lost such holders right to appraisal and
payment under the DGCL, each such Share, held by such holder shall thereupon
be deemed to have been converted into and to have become exchangeable for, as
of the Effective Time, the right to receive, without any interest thereon,
the Per Common Share Amount, in accordance with _Section 2.9(a)_ , and such
share shall no longer be a Dissenting Share. The Company shall give
prompt notice to Buyer of any written demands received by the Company for
appraisals of any Shares, and Buyer shall have the right to participate in
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. 

  

 Section 2.13 Withholding Rights. Each of the Surviving Corporation, Buyer and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article II such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any tax Laws. If the Surviving Corporation, Buyer or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, so withholds any such amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares or Stock Options, as the case may be, in respect of which the Surviving Corporation, Buyer or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding. 

  

 Section 2.14 Adjustments. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding Shares shall be changed into a different number, class or series of shares by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, combination or exchange of shares, then the Per Common Share Amount payable with respect thereto and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted. 

  

ARTICLE III 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY 

   

 Except as set forth on the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to Buyer on the date of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Schedule") which hereby is incorporated by reference and constitutes an integral part of this Agreement (but only to the extent provided in _Section 8.4_ ), or in the SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof (excluding disclosures set forth in the "Risk Factors" section, "Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements" section or any other forward looking statements that are cautionary in nature, it being understood that such exclusions shall not be deemed to apply to, qualify or otherwise exclude any matter that is otherwise set forth in this Agreement, the Company Disclosure Schedule or in any other portion of an SEC Report), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Buyer and Merger Sub as follows: 

  

 Section 3.1 Organization and Standing. The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware. Each of the Companys Significant Subsidiaries (as defined in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X) ("Significant Subsidiaries") is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has the requisite corporate power and authority to carry on its respective business as it is presently being conducted and to own, lease or operate its respective properties and assets, except in the 

   ##### 

  

    

case of any Subsidiaries, other than Significant Subsidiaries, where the
failure to have such corporate power and authority would not, individually or
in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company
and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing
in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned or leased or
the nature of its activities make such qualification necessary, except where
the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not, individually or
in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company
has delivered or made available to the Buyer complete and correct copies of
the certificates of incorporation and bylaws or other constituent documents,
as amended to date, of the Company and each of its Significant
Subsidiaries. 

  

 Section 3.2 Subsidiaries.

 (b) All of the outstanding capital stock of, or other equity or voting interest in, each Subsidiary of the Company (i) have been duly authorized, validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and (ii) except as set forth in _Section 3.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_, are owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company, free and clear of all Liens and free of any other restriction (including any restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other equity or voting interest) that would prevent the operation by the Surviving Corporation of such Subsidiarys business in substantially the same manner as presently conducted. 

   

 (c) Except as set forth in _Section 3.2(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_, there are no outstanding (i) securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries convertible into or exchangeable for shares of capital stock of, or other equity or voting interest in, any Subsidiary of the Company or (ii) options, warrants, rights or other commitments or agreements to acquire from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or that obligates the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, transfer, deliver, sell, register, repurchase, or redeem, or cause to be issued, delivered, sold, repurchased, or redeemed, any capital stock of, or other equity or voting interest in, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of capital stock of, or other equity or voting interest in, any Subsidiary of the Company.

similar Laws affecting or relating to creditors rights generally and (b) is

the Company, at a meeting duly called and held, has (i) approved and declared

The Company has made available to Buyer all material correspondence with the SEC since January 1, 2007 and there are no outstanding or unresolved comments received from the SEC with respect to the SEC Reports.

None of the information supplied by Buyer, Merger Sub or their officers, directors, representatives, agents or employees for inclusion in the Proxy Statement, and any amendments and supplements thereto, will, in the case of the Proxy Statement on the date the Proxy Statement is first sent to the Companys stockholders and at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. 

  

 Section 4.5 Merger Sub; No Prior Activities. The authorized capital stock of Merger Sub consists of 1,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, 100 shares of which are validly issued and outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub is, and at the Effective Time will be, owned directly or indirectly by Buyer. Except for obligations incurred in connection with its incorporation or organization or the negotiation and consummation of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, Merger Sub has neither incurred any obligation or Liability nor engaged in any business or activity of any type or kind whatsoever or entered into any agreement or arrangement with any Person. 

  

 Section 4.6 Compliance with Law. Each of Buyer and Merger Sub is in compliance with all Laws which would affect its ability to perform its obligations hereunder except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect. There is no action pending or, to the knowledge of Buyer and Merger Sub, threatened against Buyer or Merger Sub that would affect their respective abilities to perform their respective obligations hereunder. 

  

 Section 4.7 Litigation. There are no Legal Proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of Buyer, threatened, against Buyer or Merger Sub or any of their respective properties which, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect. Neither Buyer nor Merger Sub is subject to any outstanding Order which could reasonably be expected to have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 Section 4.8 Financing. Buyer has provided the Company true and complete signed copies of (i) a commitment letter (the " **Equity Commitment Letter** ") from Blackstone Capital Partners V L.P. (the " **Sponsor** ") to provide equity financing in an aggregate amount of $700,000,000, (the " **Equity Financing** ") and (ii) a commitment letter (the " **Debt Commitment Letter** " and, together with the Equity Commitment Letter, the " **Commitment Letters** ") from Bank of America, N.A., Banc of America Bridge LLC, Banc of America Securities LLC, Wachovia Bank, National Association, Wachovia Investment Holdings, LLC, Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC and Barclays Capital (each, a " **Lender** " and, collectively, the " **Lenders** ") pursuant to which the Lenders have committed to provide Buyer with financing in an aggregate amount of $1,150,000,000.00 (the " **Debt Financing** " and, collectively with the Equity Financing, the " **Financing** "). The Commitment Letters have been duly executed by Buyer and, 

   ##### 

  

    

to the knowledge of Buyer, the other parties thereto. As of the date hereof,
the Commitment Letters are in full force and effect and have not been amended
or modified in any material respect. As of the date hereof, neither the
Sponsor nor any Lender has notified Buyer or Merger Sub of its intention to
terminate such Commitment Letter or not to provide the financing contemplated
thereby. As of the date hereof, to the knowledge of Buyer, no event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach on the party of
Buyer or Merger Sub under any Commitment Letter. As of the date hereof, Buyer
and Merger Sub do not have any reason to believe that any of the conditions
to the Financing will not be timely satisfied or that the Financing will not
be made available to Merger Sub on the Closing Date. All commitment and other
fees required to be paid under the Commitment Letters on or prior to the date
hereof have been paid. Except for the payment of fees relating to the
Financing, there are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related
to the funding of the full amount of the Financing or the conditions
precedent thereto, other than as set forth in the Commitment Letters (the "
**Disclosed Conditions** "), and there are no material conditions of the
Financing that have not been set forth and agreed to in the Commitment
Letters, and no Person has any right to impose, and none of the Sponsor, any
Lender or Buyer has any obligation to accept (i) any condition precedent to
such funding other than the Disclosed Conditions nor (ii) any reduction to the
aggregate amount available under the Commitment Letters on the Closing Date
(nor any term or condition which would have the effect of reducing the
aggregate amount under the Commitment Letters on the Closing Date). Assuming
the Financing (other than any asset-based loan component or cash flow
revolving loan component) is consummated and the accuracy of the
representations and warranties set forth in  _Section 3.4_, as of the date
such representations and warranties were made, the aggregate proceeds
contemplated by the Commitment Letters (other than any asset-based loan
component or cash flow revolving loan component) will, in the aggregate and
together with the Companys actual cash on hand at the Closing, if any, be
sufficient when funded for Buyer and the Surviving Corporation to (a) pay the
aggregate Per Common Share Amount, (b) pay the aggregate Option Consideration,
(c) refinance the indebtedness and other amounts set forth in _Section
3.5(a)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ and (d) pay all fees and
expenses related to the Financing, the Merger or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 Section 4.9 Guarantee. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Buyer and Merger Sub have delivered to the Company a limited guarantee of the Sponsor in favor of the Company, dated the date hereof, with respect to certain matters on the terms specified therein (the " **Limited Guarantee** "). The Limited Guarantee is in full force and effect and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of its respective guarantor, enforceable in accordance with its terms, and has not been amended, withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. 

  

 Section 4.10 Solvency. 

   

 (a) As of the Closing, Buyer shall have taken all measures necessary to ensure that Merger Sub will have sufficient cash on hand to pay the total consideration contemplated to be paid hereunder. As of the Closing, after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Financing, the payment of the Merger Consideration, the incurrence of indebtedness in connection with the Debt Financing, and the repayment or refinancing of debt as contemplated herein and in the Debt Commitment Letter, and assuming (i) the satisfaction of the conditions to Buyers 

   ##### 

  

    

and Merger Subs obligation to consummate the Merger as set forth herein, or
the waiver of such conditions, (ii) the accuracy of the representations and
warranties of the Company set forth in Article III hereof (without giving
effect to any materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect qualifiers), and
(iii) that the Company performs in accordance with the projections and
forecasts provided by the Company to Buyer prior to the date hereof,
the Surviving Corporation will be Solvent. 

   

 (b) For purposes of this Agreement, "Solvent" when used with respect to the Surviving Corporation, means that, as of any date of determination (i) the amount of the Present Fair Salable Value of its assets will, as of such date, exceed all of its liabilities, contingent or otherwise, as of such date, (ii) the Surviving Corporation will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the business in which it is engaged or will be engaged and (iii) the Surviving Corporation will be able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they become absolute and mature in the ordinary course of business, taking into account the timing of and amounts of cash to be received by it and the timing of and amounts of cash to be payable on or in respect of its indebtedness, in each case after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement including the incurrence of indebtedness in connection with the Debt Financing. The term "Solvency" shall have its correlative meaning. 

   

 (c) For purposes of the definition of "Solvent," "Present Fair Saleable Value" means the amount that may be realized if the aggregate assets of the Surviving Corporation (including goodwill) are sold as an entirety with reasonable promptness in an arms-length transaction under present conditions for the sale of comparable business enterprises. 

  

 Section 4.11 Ownership of Company Capital Stock. Neither Buyer nor Merger Sub is, nor at any time during the last three years has it been, an "interested stockholder" of the Company as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL (other than as contemplated by this Agreement). Neither Buyer nor Merger Sub owns (directly or indirectly, beneficially or of record) or is a party to any agreement, arrangement or understanding for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of, in each case, any shares of capital stock of the Company (other than as contemplated by this Agreement). 

  

 Section 4.12 Brokers. Except for Banc of America Securities LLC and Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC, there is no investment banker, broker, finder or similar agent that has been retained by or is authorized to act on behalf of Buyer or Merger Sub who is entitled to any financial advisors, brokerage, finders or other fee or commission in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 Section 4.13 No Additional Representations; Disclaimer Regarding Estimates and Projections. Buyer and Merger Sub acknowledge that none of the Company, its Affiliates or any other Person acting on behalf of the Company (a) has made any representation or warranty, express or implied, including any implied representation or warranty as to the condition, merchantability, suitability or fitness for a particular purpose of any of the Assets of or held by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or (b) has made any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding the 

   ##### 

  

    

Company, its business or any of its Affiliates, in each case except as
expressly set forth in this Agreement, the certificate delivered pursuant to
_Section 6.3_, or as and to the extent required by this Agreement to be
disclosed on the Company Disclosure Schedule hereto. Buyer and Merger Sub
further agree that none of the Company, its Affiliates or any other Person
acting on behalf of the Company will have or be subject to any Liability,
except as specifically set forth in this Agreement, to Buyer, Merger Sub or
any other Person resulting from the distribution to Buyer, for Buyers use,
of any such information, including, without limitation, any information,
document or material made available to Buyer in physical or virtual "data
rooms," management presentations or any other form in expectation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

concerning an Acquisition Proposal if: (A) such Person or group has submitted
an Acquisition Proposal which the Board of Directors determines in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside counsel, is
reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal which did not result from
a breach by the Company of this _Section 5.3(b)_ and (B) the Board of
Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel,
that failing to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law.

Prior to taking any of the actions referred to in the last sentence of _Section 5.3(b)_, the Company shall notify Buyer orally and in writing that it proposes to furnish information and/or enter into discussions or negotiations as provided therein. The Company shall not be entitled to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement as permitted under  _Section 5.3(c)_ above unless (i) the Company has provided a written notice (a "Notice of Superior Proposal") to Buyer that the Company intends to take such action and describing the material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal that is the basis of such action, including with such Notice of Superior Proposal, a copy of the 

   ##### 

  

    

relevant proposed transaction agreements with the Third Party making such
Superior Proposal (redacted to exclude the identity of such Third Party), to
the extent in the Companys possession, (ii) during the four (4) Business Day
period following Buyers receipt of the Notice of Superior Proposal, the
Company shall, and shall cause its financial and legal advisors, to negotiate
with Buyer and Merger Sub in good faith (to the extent Buyer and Merger Sub
desire to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of
this Agreement so that such Superior Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior
Proposal, and (iii) following the end of such four (4) Business Day period,
the Board of Directors shall have determined in good faith, taking into
account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Buyer to the
Company in response to the Notice of Superior Proposal or otherwise, that the
Superior Proposal giving rise to the Notice of Superior Proposal continues
to constitute a Superior Proposal. Any material amendment to the financial
terms or any other material amendment of such Superior Proposal shall require
a new Notice of Superior Proposal and the Company shall be required to comply
again with the requirements of this _Section 5.3(d)_ (provided that
references to the four (4) Business Day period above shall be deemed to be

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing in this  _Section 5.5_ shall require the Company or its Affiliates to disclose any information to Buyer if such disclosure (i) would be in violation of applicable Laws or agreements or (ii) would, in the Companys good faith opinion after consultation with legal counsel, result in the loss of attorney-client privilege with respect to such books, records and other information (it being agreed that the parties shall use their reasonable efforts to cause such information to be provided in a manner that does not cause such violation, including entering into customary joint defense agreements).

Buyer and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that in the event that any Affiliate of Buyer or Merger Sub take any such action that it shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by Buyer and Merger Sub. In the event that any action is threatened or instituted challenging the Merger as violative of any antitrust Law, the Buyer, Merger Sub and the Company shall use their reasonable best efforts to take and cause their Affiliates to take all action necessary to avoid or resolve such action. In the event that any permanent or preliminary injunction or other order is entered or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered in any proceeding that would make consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms of this Agreement unlawful or that would restrain, enjoin or otherwise prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Buyer, Merger Sub and the Company shall use their reasonable best efforts to take promptly, and cause their Affiliates to take promptly, any and all steps necessary to vacate, modify or suspend such injunction or order so as to permit such consummation prior to the Outside Date. 

   

 (c) Subject to applicable legal limitations and the instructions of any Governmental Entity, the Company, Buyer and Merger Sub shall keep each other apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or other communications received by the Company, Buyer, Merger Sub or Sponsor, as the case may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, from 

   ##### 

  

    

any third party and/or any Governmental Entity with respect to such
transactions. The Company, Buyer and Merger Sub shall permit counsel for the
other party reasonable opportunity to review in advance, and consider in good
faith the views of the other party in connection with, any proposed written
communication to any Governmental Entity. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Section 5.6(c)_, materials provided to the other party or
its outside counsel may be redacted to remove any estimate of the valuation of
the Company, its business or its shares, or identifying other potential
acquirers. The Company shall cooperate with Buyer, Merger Sub and Sponsor,
and shall use its reasonable best efforts to assist Buyer, Merger Sub and
Sponsor, in resisting and reducing any action required by this _Section
5.6_. The parties shall take reasonable efforts to share
information protected from disclosure under the attorney-client privilege,
work product doctrine, joint defense privilege or any other privilege
pursuant to this section so as to preserve any applicable privilege. 

  

 Section 5.7 Approvals and Consents. The parties shall cooperate with each other and use their reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary Consents, including, without limitation, (a) all Consents of any Governmental Entity including those described in _Section 5.6_ and  _(b)_ all Consents set forth in _Section 3.5(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ or described in _Section 3.5(b)_, in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

that the indemnification provided for in this _Section 5.9_ shall apply
without limitation to acts or omissions (other than illegal acts or acts of
fraud), or alleged acts or omissions (other than illegal acts or acts of
fraud), by the Indemnified Persons in their capacities as officers or
directors, as the case may be. Buyer hereby guarantees the payment
and performance of the Surviving Corporations obligations in this _Section
5.9_. Each Indemnified Person, and his or her heirs and legal
representatives, is intended to be a third party beneficiary of this _Section
5.9_ and may specifically enforce its terms. This  _Section 5.9_ shall not
limit or otherwise adversely affect any rights any Indemnified Person may
have under any agreement with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or under
the Companys or any such Subsidiarys certificate of incorporation, bylaws
or other organization documents. 

   

 (b) For a period of six years following the Effective Time, Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain policies of directors and officers liability insurance covering each Person who was a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at any time prior to the Effective Time with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or prior to the Effective Time and providing at least the same coverage and amounts and containing terms that are not less advantageous to the insured parties than those contained in the policies of directors and officers liability insurance in effect as of the date hereof; _provided_ _that_ in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to maintain such current policies if it is required to pay aggregate annual premiums under this _Section 5.9(b)_ in excess of 275% of the amount of the current annual premium paid by the Company. In the event that Buyer is required to pay in excess of such amount, it shall only be obligated to provide a policy with the best coverage Buyer is reasonably able to obtain for such 275% amount. 

   

 (c) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.9_. 

  

 Section 5.10 Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall give prompt notice to Buyer and Merger Sub, and Buyer and Merger Sub shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (a) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event whose occurrence or non-occurrence, as the case may be, causes any representation or warranty of such party contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect or would reasonably be expected to cause any condition set forth in _Article VI_ not to be satisfied in any material respect as of the Closing, and (b) any material failure of the Company, Buyer or Merger Sub, as the case may be, or any officer, director, employee or agent thereof, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 5.10_ shall not affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to the parties.

 Section 5.14 Director Resignations.

 Section 5.15 Employment and Employee Benefits Matters; Other Plans. 

   

 (a) During the one-year period commencing at the Effective Time, Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide to employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the "Continuing Employees") compensation (such term to include salary, bonus opportunities, commissions and severance) and benefits (including the costs thereof to Employee Plan participants) that are in the aggregate, no less favorable than (with such benefits measured in the aggregate, as opposed to on an employee-by-employee basis) the compensation and benefits being provided to Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time under the Companys Employee Plans (excluding for purposes of calculating a Continuing Employees level of compensation and benefits immediately prior to the Effective Time, options, restricted stock units or other equity-based compensation, and any retention or other change in control related compensation); _provided_ , _however_ , that, nothing herein shall (i) prevent the amendment or termination of any Employee Plan in accordance with the terms of any such Employee Plan or interfere with the Surviving Corporations right or obligation to make such changes as are necessary to conform to or comply with applicable Law (ii) limit the right 

   ##### 

  

    

of the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation to terminate any Continuing Employee
after the Closing Date. 

   

 (b) As of and after the Effective Time, Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to recognize service with the Company and its Subsidiaries (and their predecessor entities) prior to the Effective Time ("Prior Service") (to the extent the Company recognized such service for corresponding benefits) under any employee compensation, incentive, and benefit (including vacation) plans, programs, policies and arrangements maintained for the benefit of Continuing Employees as of and after the Effective Time by Buyer, its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation (excluding in all cases benefit accruals under any qualified or non-qualified defined benefit pension plan). With respect to each "Buyer Plan" that is a "welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), Buyer and its Subsidiaries shall (i) cause there to be waived any pre-existing condition or eligibility limitations (to the extent waived, satisfied or inapplicable under the Companys corresponding Employee Plan) and (ii) give effect, in determining any deductible and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to claims incurred and amounts paid by, and amounts reimbursed to, Continuing Employees under similar plans maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (c) This Agreement shall inure exclusively to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto. Nothing in this _Section 5.15_ shall confer any rights or remedies of any kind or description upon any Continuing Employee, or their respective successors and assigns.

 Section 5.16 Financing Efforts. 

   

 (a) Each of Buyer and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to, use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters, including using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Commitment Letters, (ii) satisfy, on a timely basis taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing Period and the Outside Date, all conditions applicable to Buyer and Merger Sub that are within its control to obtaining the Financing set forth therein (including the payment of any commitment, engagement or placement fees required as a condition to the Debt Financing), (iii) enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Commitment Letter on the terms and conditions contained in the Commitment Letters or on terms no less favorable to Buyer (as determined in the good faith judgment of Buyer), and (iv) consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing Date, but in no event later than the Outside Date (including using its reasonable best efforts to cause the Lenders and other Persons providing Financing to provide such financing). Buyer shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, amend, modify or supplement (including in the definitive documents) (x) any of the conditions or contingencies to funding contained in the Commitment Letters, or (y) any other provision of the Commitment Letters, in either case to the extent such amendment, modification or supplement could reasonably be expected to have the effect of (A) adversely affecting the ability of Buyer or Merger Sub to timely consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, or (B) amending, modifying or supplementing the conditions or contingencies to 

   ##### 

  

    

funding in a manner materially adverse to the Company or the holders of Shares
(provided that Buyer agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to
consult with the Company in good faith with respect to any amendments,
modifications or supplements that would be adverse to the Company or the
holders of Shares). In the event that any portion of the
Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters becomes unavailable other
than due to the breach of representations and warranties or covenants of the
Company or a failure of a condition to be satisfied by the Company after
providing notice to the Company and a reasonable opportunity to cure, Buyer
shall notify Company and use its reasonable best efforts to
arrange alternative financing from the same or other sources on terms and
conditions not materially less favorable in the aggregate to Buyer (as
determined in the good faith judgment of Buyer) than those contained in the
Commitment Letters as of the date hereof, and in amount sufficient to timely
(taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing Period and
the Outside Date) consummate the transactions contemplated hereby on the
terms and conditions set forth herein and not materially less favorable in
the aggregate to Buyer (as determined in the good faith judgment of Buyer)
than those contained in the Commitment Letters as of the date hereof. In the
event all conditions applicable to the Commitment Letters (other than
in connection with the Debt Financing, the availability or funding of the
Equity Financing) have been satisfied, Buyer shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause Lenders and the other Persons providing such Financing to
fund the Financing required to consummate the Merger on the Closing Date.
Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to satisfy on or before
the Closing all requirements of the definitive agreements pursuant to which
the Financing will be obtained. Buyer shall give the Company prompt notice of
any breach by any party to either of the Commitment Letters of which Buyer
becomes aware or any termination of either of the Commitment Letters. Buyer
shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable
detail of the status of the Financing. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Marketing Period" shall mean the first period of twenty (20) consecutive
Business Days after the date hereof throughout which (i) Buyer shall have the
Required Information that the Company is required to provide to Buyer
pursuant to _Section 5.16(b)_ and (ii) the conditions set forth in _Section
6.1_ and _Section 6.3_ shall have been satisfied (as if the first date of
such 20 consecutive Business Day period were the Closing Date) and
nothing shall have occurred and no condition shall exist that would cause any
of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ or _Section 6.3_ to fail to be
satisfied assuming the Closing were to be scheduled for any time during such
twenty (20) consecutive Business Day period; provided, however, that (A) if
the Marketing Period has not been completed on or prior to August 15, 2008,
the Marketing Period shall commence no earlier than September 2, 2008, (B) if
the Marketing Period has not been completed on or prior to December 19,
2008, the Marketing Period shall commence no earlier than January 5, 2009,
(C) the Marketing Period shall not be deemed to have commenced if, (x) prior
to the completion of the Marketing Period, Deloitte and Touche LLP shall have
withdrawn its audit opinion with respect to any year end financial statements
of the Company or (y) the financial statements included in the Required
Information that is available to the Buyer on the first day of any such twenty
(20) consecutive Business Day period would not be sufficiently current on any
day during such (20) consecutive Business Day period to permit a registration
statement using such financial statements to be declared effective by the SEC
on the last day of the (20) 

   ##### 

  

    

consecutive Business Day period and (D) the Marketing Period shall end on any
earlier date on which the Debt Financing is consummated. 

   

 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company agrees to provide, and to cause its Subsidiaries to provide, and to use its reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives, to provide, all reasonable cooperation in connection with the arrangement of the Financing as is customary and that may be reasonably requested by Buyer (provided that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries), including (i) assisting in the preparation for, and participating in a reasonable number of road shows, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions, meetings and marketing presentations, and similar presentations, to and with prospective lenders, investors and rating agencies, at times reasonably acceptable to the Company; (ii) assisting with the preparation of materials for rating agency presentations, offering memoranda, private placement memoranda, bank information memoranda (including the delivery of one or more customary representation letters as contemplated in the Debt Financing Letter), prospectuses and similar documents required in connection with the Financing; (iii) cooperating in the preparation of, and executing and delivering (for effectiveness at and after the Effective Time) any, pledge and security documents, other definitive financing documents, and other certificates, legal opinions or documents as may be reasonably requested by Buyer (including, subject to Buyers compliance with _Section 4.10_, a certificate of the chief financial officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to solvency matters) and obtaining consents of accountants for use of their reports in any materials relating to the Debt Financing and otherwise reasonably facilitating the pledging of collateral at and after the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that no obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any certificate, document or instrument shall be effective until the Effective Time; (iv) furnishing Buyer and its Financing sources as promptly as practicable (and in any event no later than 20 Business Days prior to February 13, 2009) with financial information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries, as may be reasonably requested by Buyer reasonably in advance of such date, including (A) the audited consolidated balance sheets of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005, December 31, 2006, and December 31, 2007, and the related audited statements of income, stockholders equity and cash flows for the years then ended, and the notes and schedules thereto, (B) the unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of March 31, 2008 (and as of the end of any subsequent quarterly period ended no less than 40 days prior to the Closing Date), and the related unaudited statements of income, stockholders equity and cash flows for the three month period then ended (and for the period from the beginning of 2008 to the end of any quarterly period ended no less than 40 days prior to the Closing Date) (for which periods, the independent public accountants shall have performed an SAS 100 review) and for the comparable periods of 2007 (which, for the avoidance of doubt, an SAS 100 review by the independent public accountants for the quarter ended December 31, 2007 shall not be required), (C) all financial information related to the Company reasonably required by Buyer for Buyer to produce the pro forma financial statements required to be delivered pursuant to Exhibit E to the Debt Commitment Letter, (D) all other financial statements and financial data of the Company and its Subsidiaries that is of the type required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under the Securities

other pertinent information as may be reasonably requested by Buyer
reasonably in advance of such date, (vi) using commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain accountants comfort letters, legal opinions,

connection with the foregoing; (ix) using commercially reasonable efforts to

_provided_ _further_ that none of the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall
be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any
other liability in connection with the Financing prior to the Effective Time
except for any liabilities that are conditioned on the Effective Time having
occurred. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on any financing documents and any materials that are
to be presented during any road shows conducted in connection with the

 Section 8.4 Disclosure Generally. Except with respect to _Section 5.1 of the Company Disclosure Schedule_, any matter set forth in one item of the Company Disclosure Schedule need not be set forth in any other item of the Company Disclosure Schedule so long as its relevance to the other sections or subsections of the Company Disclosure Schedule or section of this Agreement is reasonably apparent on the face of the information disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule. The fact that any item of information is disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule shall not be construed to mean that such information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement.

Any agreement on the part of any party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only against such party and only if set forth in an instrument, in writing, signed by such party. The failure or delay by any party hereto to assert any of its rights hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of such rights nor shall any single or partial assertion of a right preclude any other or further assertion thereof or the exercise of any other right.

   ##### 

  

    

in addition to other remedies, prior to any valid termination of this
Agreement pursuant to  _Section 7.1_, Buyer and Merger Sub shall be entitled

parties further acknowledge that the Company shall not be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by Buyer or
Merger Sub or to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement and that the Companys sole and exclusive remedy with respect to
any such breach shall be the remedy available to the Company set forth in

 Section 8.17 No Presumption Against Drafting Party. Each of Buyer, Merger Sub and the Company acknowledges that each party to this Agreement has been represented by counsel in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Accordingly, any rule of law or any legal decision that would require interpretation of any claimed ambiguities in this Agreement against the drafting party has no application and is expressly waived.
