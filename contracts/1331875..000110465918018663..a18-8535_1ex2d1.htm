merger with respect to Merger I is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of
State (or at such later time as may be specified in such certificate of
merger). Merger II shall become effective immediately following the Effective
Time at such time (the " **Subsequent Effective Time** ") as the certificate
of merger with respect to Merger II is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary

specified in such certificate of merger).

 



 

(e) From and after the Effective Time, and until the Subsequent Effective
Time, the Initial Surviving Entity shall possess all the rights, powers,
privileges and franchises and be subject to all of the obligations,
liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the Company and Merger Sub I,
all as provided under the DGCL. From and after the Subsequent Effective Time,

Section 2.02. _Conversion of Shares_.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, as a result of Merger I and without any action on
the part of the holder of any capital stock of the Company, Parent or either
Merger Sub, except as otherwise provided in Section 2.02(c) or Section 2.05,
each share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive the following
consideration, without interest thereon (the " **Merger Consideration** "):

 



 

(i) Each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which an election to
receive a combination of stock and cash (a " **Mixed Election** ") has been
properly made

 



      
 

 



 

and not revoked pursuant to Section 2.03(c) (each, a " **Mixed Consideration
Electing Share** ") and each Non-Electing Share shall be converted into the
right to receive (A) a number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
shares of Parent Common Stock (the " **Mixed Election Stock Consideration** ")
equal to the product (rounded to the nearest four decimal places) of (w) the
Exchange Ratio and (x) 0.50 and (B) an amount in cash, without interest, equal
to the product (rounded to the nearest two decimal places) of (y) the Per
Share Price and (z) 0.50 (the " **Mixed Election Cash Consideration** " and,
together with the Mixed Election Stock Consideration, the " **Mixed Election
Consideration** ");

 



 

(ii) Each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which an election to
receive cash (a " **Cash Election** ") has been properly made and not revoked
pursuant to Section 2.03(c) (each, a " **Cash Electing Share** ") shall be
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal
to the Per Share Price; _provided_ that if the product of the number of Cash
Electing Shares and the Per Share Price (such product, the " **Aggregate Cash
Election Amount** ") exceeds the Available Cash Election Amount, then each
Cash Electing Share shall be converted into the right to receive (1) an amount
in cash, without interest, equal to the product (rounded to the nearest two
decimal places) of (w) the Per Share Price and (x) a fraction, the numerator
of which shall be the Available Cash Election Amount and the denominator of
which shall be the Aggregate Cash Election Amount (such amount of cash, the "
**Cash Portion** ") and (2) a number of validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to a fraction (rounded to
the nearest four decimal places), the numerator of which shall be an amount
equal to the Per Share Price _minus_ the Cash Portion and the denominator of
which shall be the Parent Share Price; and

 



 

(iii) Each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which an election to
receive stock consideration (a " **Stock Election** ") has been properly made
and not revoked pursuant to Section 2.03(c) (each, a " **Stock Electing
Share** ") shall be converted into the right to receive a number of validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to
the Exchange Ratio (the " **Stock Election Consideration** "); _provided_ that
if the Available Cash Election Amount exceeds the Aggregate Cash Election
Amount, then each Stock Electing Share shall be converted into the right to
receive (x) an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest two decimal places),
without interest, equal to (1) the amount by which the Available Cash Election
Amount exceeds the Aggregate Cash Election Amount, divided by (2) the number
of Stock Electing Shares (such amount of cash, the " **Cash Substitution
Amount** ") and (y) a number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the quotient (rounded to the nearest
four decimal places) obtained by dividing (a) an amount equal to the Per Share
Price minus the Cash Substitution Amount by (b) the Parent Share Price.

 



 

(iv) At the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock (other
than Excluded Shares) shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and (A) each Certificate
formerly

 



      
 

 



 

representing any of the shares of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded
Shares) and (B) each book-entry account formerly representing any
Uncertificated Shares (other than Excluded Shares) shall thereafter represent
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration, any distributions or
dividends payable pursuant to Section 2.04(h) and cash in lieu of any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable pursuant to ** __** Section
2.07, without interest, in each case to be issued or paid in consideration
therefor upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with Section 2.04,
in the case of certificated shares of Company Common Stock, and automatically
in the case of Uncertificated Shares, and each Certificate and Uncertificated
Share formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock owned by Dissenting
Shareholders shall thereafter represent only the rights granted to Dissenting
Shareholders under Delaware Law.

 



 

(v) Maximum Merger Consideration. For the avoidance of doubt:

 



 

(A) Subject to Section 2.13, the Mixed Election Cash Consideration shall not
exceed fifty percent (50%) of the Per Share Price; and

 



 

(B) The aggregate amount of cash paid (not including cash paid pursuant to
Section 2.07), and the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock
issued, to all of the holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Section
2.02(a) shall not exceed the aggregate amount of cash that would have been
paid (not including cash that would have been paid pursuant to Section 2.07),
and the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock that would have been
issued, to all of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock had the Mixed
Election been made with respect to each share of Company Common Stock.

 



 

(vi) The term " **Available Cash Election Amount** " means the difference
between (1) the product of the Mixed Election Cash Consideration and the total
number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares) minus (2) the product
of the number of Mixed Consideration Electing Shares (including any Non-
Electing Shares and Dissenting Shares) and the Mixed Election Cash
Consideration.

 



 

(b) As used herein, the following terms have the following meanings:

 



 

" **Divested Revenues** " means the revenues generated during the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2017, as determined in accordance with Section 2.12, by any
title plants, rights to title plants, businesses or assets that are sold,
divested, disposed or held separate, or that are agreed to be sold, divested,
disposed or held separate, in a Triggering Divestiture, subject to the
following:

 



 

(i) for purposes of determining the amount of Divested Revenues, no title
insurance premium revenues arising from title plants or rights to title plants
that are required to be (A) licensed to a third party for which Parent will,
after such licensure, or conveyance or transfer of such title plant interest
(or copy thereof), continue to own the underlying title plants or rights to

 



      
 

 



 

title plants that are licensed will be included in Divested Revenues (
_provided_ that in the event that the Parent or Company is required to license
an interest in any such title plant or right to title plant that is a jointly
owned title plant whose governing documents would, after such licensure, or
conveyance or transfer of such title plant interest (or copy thereof),
prohibit Parent from using title plant data from such title plant to serve any
of the Companys existing brands, the lost title insurance premium revenues
arising therefrom shall not be deemed excluded from Divested Revenues by
virtue of this clause (A) (but subject to clause (B)), or (B) divested or
licensed to a third party will be included in Divested Revenues if Parent is
able, or would be able, through the use of commercially reasonable efforts, to
procure prior to the Closing an alternative, competitively comparable, title
plant or source of title plant data in such county (including, but not limited
to, the licensure of title plant or title plant data from a third party at
Parents reasonable expense) in order to prevent the loss of title insurance
premium revenues from such title plant license or divestiture;

 



 

(ii) if Parent is required to, or reasonably expected to be required to, sell,
divest, dispose of, license or hold separate any business, asset or title
plant in a county in which both the Company and/or one or more of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Parent and/or one or more of its
Subsidiaries, on the other, own a competing business, asset or title plant (as
applicable), whether in whole or in part, then the Divested Revenues that
shall be deemed to be generated from the business, asset or title plant to be
sold, divested, disposed of, licensed or held separate in such county shall be
the revenues generated in respect of the applicable business, asset or title
plant (as applicable) with the lower amount of consolidated revenue as between
the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Parent and its
Subsidiaries, on the other, irrespective of which business, asset or title
plant that Parent elects to sell, divest, dispose of, license or hold separate
in such county; __provided__ that if the FTC or any other Governmental
Authority requires that Parent sell, divest, dispose of, license or hold
separate the business, asset or title plant in such county with the higher
amount of consolidated revenues (as between the Company and Parent), then such
higher amount of consolidated revenues shall constitute the Divested Revenues
for such business, asset or title plant sold, divested, disposed or held
separate; and

 



 

(iii) if the FTC or any other Governmental Authority requires that Parent or
the Company sell, divest, dispose of, license or hold separate a title plant
within a given county in which one of the Company or Parent utilizes a wholly
owned title plant and the other utilizes a jointly owned title plant, Parent
shall have the right to determine whether to sell, divest, dispose of, license
or hold separate the jointly owned title plant or the wholly owned title
plant; _provided_ that the Divested Revenues that shall be deemed to be
generated from such title plant sold, divested, disposed or held separate
shall be the revenues generated in respect of the applicable title plant with
the lower amount of consolidated revenue as between the wholly owned and
jointly owned title plant, irrespective of which title plant Parent elects to
divest sell, divest, dispose of, license or hold separate; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that if the FTC or any other Governmental Authority requires that
Parent sell, divest, dispose of, license or hold separate the title plant in
such county with the higher amount of consolidated revenues (as between the
wholly owned and jointly owned title plant), then such higher amount of
consolidated revenues shall constitute the Divested Revenues for such title
plant sold, divested, disposed or held separate.

 



      
 

 



 

" **Exchange Ratio** " means the quotient (rounded to the nearest four decimal
places) obtained by dividing (a) the Per Share Price by (b) the Parent Share
Price, which, if the Per Share Price equals $50.00, the parties agree shall be
1.2850, subject to further adjustment pursuant to this Section 2.02.

 



 

" **Parent Share Price** " means an amount equal to the 20-Day VWAP of the
Parent Common Stock as of the date hereof, which the parties agree shall be
$38.91.

 



 

" **Per Share Price** " means an amount equal to the greater of (i) (x) $50.00
_minus_ (y) the Per Share Cash Reduction Amount and (ii) $45.50.

 



 

" **Per Share Cash Reduction Amount** " means an amount in cash equal to the
lesser of (i) $4.50, _multiplied by_ a fraction, (x) the numerator of which is
the amount by which the Divested Revenues exceeds $75,000,000 and (y) the
denominator of which is $150,000,000 and (ii) $4.50. For the avoidance of
doubt, if the Divested Revenues are $75,000,000 or less, the Per Share Cash
Reduction Amount shall be equal to zero.

 



 

" **20-Day** **VWAP** " means the average of the daily volume weighted average
prices of a share of Parent Common Stock for each of the twenty trading days
prior to the date hereof, on the NYSE, as reported by Bloomberg.

or held by any Subsidiary of the Company (other than shares in a Company
Employee Plan), or owned by Parent, the Merger Subs or any other Subsidiary of
Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time (each such share, an "
**Excluded Share** ") shall be cancelled, and no payment shall be made with
respect thereto.

 



 

(d) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub I outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of common
stock of the Initial Surviving Entity with the same rights, powers and
privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Initial Surviving Entity. Each
share of common stock of the Initial Surviving Entity outstanding immediately
prior to the Subsequent Effective Time shall be converted into and become a
membership interest in the Surviving Entity with the same rights, powers and
privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only
outstanding membership interests in the Surviving Entity.

 



 

Section 2.03. _Election Procedures._

 



 

(a) _Election_ Procedures. Subject to allocation and adjustment in accordance
with the provisions of this Article 2, each record holder of shares of Company
Common Stock (other than (i) any Dissenting Shares, all of which shall be
treated solely as provided in Section 2.05, (ii) any Company Equity Awards,
all of which shall be treated solely as provided in Section 2.06, and (iii)
Excluded Shares) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Election
Deadline shall be entitled to specify the number of such holders shares of
Company Common Stock with respect to which such holder makes a Mixed Election,
Cash Election or Stock Election by complying with the procedures set forth in
this Section 2.03.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Form of Election and Election Deadline_. Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall appoint an agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "
**Exchange Agent** ") for the purpose of tabulating elections pursuant to
Section 2.03(a) and exchanging for the Merger Consideration as promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time pursuant to Section 2.04 (i) certificates
representing shares of Company Common Stock (the " **Certificates** ") or (ii)
uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock (the " **Uncertificated Shares**
"). Holders of shares of Company Common Stock shall make a Mixed Election, a
Cash Election or a Stock Election on a form of election (a " **Form of
Election**"), prepared by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company and
filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement, which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the form of Election and such Certificates
to the Exchange Agent, and which shall have such other customary provisions as
Parent and the Company reasonably agree, to be provided by the Exchange Agent
for that purpose to holders of record of shares of Company Common Stock (other
than (i) any Dissenting Shares, all of which shall be treated solely as
provided in Section 2.05, (ii) any Company Equity Awards, all of which shall
be treated solely as provided in Section 2.06, and (iii) Excluded Shares),
together with customary transmittal materials. Elections shall be made by
mailing to the Exchange Agent a duly completed Form of Election. To be
effective, a Form of Election must be properly completed, signed and submitted
to the Exchange Agent at its designated office by 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on
the Business Day that is two (2) trading days prior to the Closing Date (which
date shall be publicly announced by Parent at least five (5) Business Days
prior to the anticipated Closing) or such other date and time as Parent may
publicly announce with the consent of the Company (the applicable date and
time described in this clause (x), the " **Election Deadline** "). The parties
shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Exchange Agent to make a Form of Election available to all Persons who become
holders of record of shares of Company Common Stock (other than (i) any
Dissenting Shares, all of which shall be treated solely as provided in Section
2.05, (ii) any Company Equity Awards, all of which shall be treated solely as
provided in Section 2.06 and (iii) Excluded Shares) between the date the Forms
of Election are mailed and the Election Deadline. Parent shall determine, in
its reasonable discretion (which discretion and authority it may delegate in
whole or in part to the Exchange Agent), whether Forms of Election (and where
applicable, appropriate transmittal materials) have been properly completed,
signed and submitted or revoked. The decision of Parent (or the Exchange
Agent, as the case may be) in such matters shall be conclusive and binding. In
the event that a holder fails to make a Mixed Election, a Cash Election or a
Stock Election with respect to any shares of Company Common Stock held or
beneficially owned by such holder, then such holder shall be deemed to have
made a Mixed Election with respect to those shares of Company Common Stock
(each such share of Company Common Stock, a " **Non-Electing Share** "). After
a Mixed Election, a Cash Election or a Stock Election is validly made with
respect to a holders shares of Company Common Stock, any further registration
of transfers of such shares made on the stock transfer books of the Company
following such election shall be deemed to be a revocation of such election.

 



 

(c) _Revocation of Election. _Any Mixed Election, Cash Election or Stock
Election may be revoked, but only (subject to the last sentence of Section
2.03(b)) by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the
Election Deadline. In addition, all Mixed Elections, Cash Elections and Stock
Elections shall automatically be revoked if this Agreement is terminated in

 



      
 

 



 

accordance with Article 10\. Any Certificate(s) representing shares of Company
Common Stock that have been submitted to the Exchange Agent in connection with
an election shall be returned without charge to the holder thereof in the
event such election is revoked as aforesaid and such holder requests in
writing the return of such Certificate(s) or Uncertificated Shares. Upon any
such revocation, unless a duly completed Form of Election is thereafter
submitted prior to the Election Deadline in accordance with Section 2.03(a)
and Section 2.03(b), the shares of Company Common Stock to which such election
previously applied shall be treated as Non-Electing Shares.

 



 

Section 2.04. _Surrender and Payment_ _. _(a) Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent the Merger Consideration to
be paid and/or issued in respect of the Certificates and the Uncertificated
Shares. In addition, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited with the
Exchange Agent, as necessary from time to time after the Effective Time, any
distributions or dividends payable pursuant to Section 2.04(h) with respect to
shares of Company Common Stock with a record and payment date after the
Effective Time and prior to the surrender of such shares of Company Common
Stock and cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to this
Section 2.04. All shares of Parent Common Stock and cash, together with the
amount of any dividends and distributions deposited with the Exchange Agent
pursuant to this Section 2.04, shall hereinafter be referred to as the "
**Exchange Fund** ". Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to deliver the
Merger Consideration and other payments contemplated by this Article 2 out of
the Exchange Fund.

 



 

(b) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time (but no later than two
(2) Business Days thereafter), Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange
Agent to send, to each holder of shares of Company Common Stock at the
Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares, Dissenting Shares or any holder of
a Certificate who properly made and did not revoke a Mixed Election, Cash
Election or a Stock Election) a letter of transmittal and instructions (which
shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company and shall specify that the
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares
to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange.

 



 

(c) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock who properly made and did
not revoke a Mixed Election, Cash Election or a Stock Election shall be
entitled to receive, upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a
Certificate, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or (ii)
receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence,
if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case
of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the applicable Merger
Consideration in respect of the Company Common Stock represented by a
Certificate or Uncertificated Share, any dividends or other distributions
payable pursuant to **** Section 2.04(h) and cash in lieu of any fractional
shares of Company Common Stock payable pursuant to **** Section 2.07, and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Until so surrendered
or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or Uncertificated
Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right
to receive the applicable Merger Consideration. Each holder of a Certificate
representing Non-Electing Shares, upon surrender of such Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 2.11) to the Exchange
Agent in accordance with the terms of such

 



      
 

 



 

transmittal materials, shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
Mixed Election Consideration for each Non-Electing Share formerly represented
by such Certificate, any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to
Section 2.04(h) and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Company Common
Stock pursuant to **** Section 2.07, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled.

 



 

(d) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred
Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment
that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise
be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly
transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the
Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 



 

(e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Company Common Stock. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Entity or
the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration and other payments provided for, and in accordance with the
procedures set forth, in this Article 2.

 



 

(f) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to Section 2.04(a) that remains unclaimed by the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock twelve (12) months after the Effective Time
shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not
exchanged shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in
accordance with this Section 2.04 prior to that time shall thereafter look
only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration, any dividends and
distributions with respect thereto pursuant to Section 2.04(h) and cash in
lieu of any fractional shares of Company Common Stock payable pursuant to ****
Section 2.07, in respect of such shares without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any holder of
shares of Company Common Stock for any amounts properly paid to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

 



 

(g) Subject to Section 2.04(d)(ii), the payment of any transfer, documentary,
sales, use, stamp, registration, value added and other Taxes and fees
(including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with the
Mergers, and the filing of any related Tax returns and other documentation
with respect to such Taxes and fees, shall be borne by the Parent or the
Surviving Entity.

 



 

(h) No dividends or other distributions with respect to securities of Parent
constituting part of the Merger Consideration, and no cash payment in lieu of
fractional shares as provided in **** Section 2.07, shall be paid to the
holder of any Certificates not surrendered or of any Uncertificated Shares not
transferred until such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are surrendered
or transferred, as the case may be, as provided in this Section 2.04.
Following such surrender or transfer, there shall be paid, without interest,
to the Person in whose name the securities of Parent have been registered, (i)
at the time of such surrender or transfer, the amount

 



      
 

 



 

of any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares to which such Person is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.06(a) and the amount of all dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time previously paid or
payable on the date of such surrender with respect to such securities, and
(ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and prior to
surrender or transfer and with a payment date subsequent to surrender or
transfer payable with respect to such securities.

 



 

Section 2.05. _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding Section 2.02, shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Mergers or consented
thereto in writing and who has demanded appraisal for such shares in
accordance with the DGCL (each, a " **Dissenting Share** ") shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless such
holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal.
If, after the Effective Time, such holder of a Dissenting Share fails to
perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal, such shares
shall be treated as if they had made a Mixed Election and shall represent the
right to receive the Mixed Election Consideration in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands
received by the Company for appraisal of shares, and Parent shall have the
right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall
not make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such
demands.

(e) Each restricted stock unit award with respect to shares of Company Common
Stock outstanding under any Company Stock Plan that vests based on the

Awards** "), other than the Rollover PSUs (as defined below), and which is
outstanding at the Effective Time shall immediately vest and shall be
converted into the right to receive, with respect to each share of Company
Common Stock underlying such Company PSU (determined assuming the achievement

Parent Common Stock (a " **Parent PSU** ") entitling the holder to receive,
determined assuming achievement of target level of performance and subject to
continued vesting based on the passage of time through the end of the
performance period, a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the
product of (i) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such Rollover PSU immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii)
the Exchange Ratio, with any fractional shares being rounded down to the
nearest whole share of Parent Common Stock.

 



 

(g) Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors shall take any and all
resolutions or actions necessary or required (under the Company Stock Plan,
Applicable Law, the applicable award agreements or otherwise) to give effect
to the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.06 and to ensure that, from
and after the Effective Time, each holder of Company Equity Awards shall have
no rights with respect to any cancelled Company Equity Awards, except the
right to receive the Mixed Election Consideration with respect thereto or,
with respect to a

 



      
 

 



 

Rollover PSU or a Rollover RSU, the right to receive a grant of a Parent PSU
or Parent RSU, respectively. Parent shall take all corporate action necessary
to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock
for delivery in accordance with Section 2.06(c) and Section 2.06(f). Parent
shall file with the SEC, as soon as practicable following the Effective Time,
a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form), to the extent
such form is available, relating to such Parent Common Stock.

 



 

Section 2.07. _Fractional Shares_ _. _No fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock shall be issued in the Mergers. All fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock that a holder of shares of Company Common Stock would otherwise be
entitled to receive as a result of the Mergers shall be aggregated and if a
fractional share results from such aggregation, such holder shall be entitled
to receive, in lieu thereof, an amount in cash without interest determined by
multiplying the closing sale price of a share of Parent Common Stock on the
NYSE on the trading day immediately preceding the Effective Time by the
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder would
otherwise have been entitled.

 



 

Section 2.08. _Withholding Rights_ _. _Notwithstanding any provision contained
herein to the contrary, each of the Exchange Agent, the Company, the Surviving
Entity and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article 2 such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax law.
If the Exchange Agent, the Company, the Surviving Entity or Parent, as the
case may be, so withholds and remits amounts to the applicable Taxing
Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of whom the Exchange Agent, the
Company, the Surviving Entity or Parent, as the case may be, made such
deduction and withholding. For the avoidance of doubt, any deductions or
withholdings made from Mixed Election Consideration pursuant to this Section
2.08 shall be made in cash and deducted or withheld from the Mixed Election
Cash Consideration portion payable upon such Mixed Election.

 



 

Section 2.09. _Payment of Company Equity Awards_. Parent shall take all
actions necessary so that, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (but no later than the later of five (5) Business Days after,
and the first regularly scheduled payroll date for the Company after, the
Effective Time), the Surviving Entity shall pay or cause to be paid to each
holder of a Company Equity Award the amounts to which such holder is entitled
as determined in accordance with Section 2.06 (less applicable tax
withholding), to the extent permitted thereby. In the event that the Surviving
Entity has insufficient cash to make such payment to each holder of Company
Equity Awards, Parent shall pay such amounts or provide to the Surviving
Entity sufficient cash to pay such amounts.

 



 

Section 2.10. _Lost Certificates_ _. _If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Entity, the posting by such Person of a bond, in
such reasonable amount as the Surviving Entity may direct, as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be

 



      
 

 



 

paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Certificate, as contemplated by this Article 2.

 



 

Section 2.11. _Determination of Divested Revenues._

 



 

(a) Prior to Closing and promptly following the final determination of the
businesses, assets, title plants or rights to title plants, if any, that are
required to be divested, Parent shall reasonably determine the Divested
Revenues and shall provide the Company with a " **Divested Revenues Notice** "
setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for calculation of the amount
representing Divested Revenues, together with a breakdown of Divested Revenues
that specifies (i) the amount of Divested Revenues generated by each such
business, asset, title plant or right to title plant that is to be divested
and (ii) the amount of revenues generated by each competitive business, asset,
title plant or right to title plant during the fiscal year ended December 31,
2017 (i.e., as between the Company and Parent) that is to be retained.

 



 

(b) In the event that the Company wishes to dispute any amount proposed by
Parent in the Divested Revenues Notice, the Company shall provide Parent with
written notice of such dispute (the " **Divested Revenues Dispute Notice** ")
no later than five (5) Business Days following receipt of the Divested
Revenues Notice.

 



 

(c) During the three (3) Business Days following receipt by Parent of the
Divested Revenues Dispute Notice, representatives of Parent and the Company
shall negotiate in good faith with a view to resolving any items in dispute so
raised by the Company pursuant to the Divested Revenues Dispute Notice.

 



 

(d) In the event that the Company and Parent cannot resolve all such
objections within such three (3) Business Day period set forth in Section
2.11(c), the parties shall jointly retain a mutually acceptable nationally
recognized accounting firm that is independent from, and has not been retained
as the principal audit firm in the prior three (3) years by, the Company,
Parent or any of their respective Affiliates (the " **Independent Accountant**
"), to resolve the remaining business- or county-level items in dispute in
accordance with this Agreement. The Independent Accountant shall only decide
the objections submitted to it, and with respect to each, shall not assign any
value for each line item that is greater than the highest value for such
amount claimed by either the Company or Parent or that is less than the lowest
value for such amount claimed by either the Company or Parent. The Independent
Accountant shall base its decision solely upon the presentations of the
parties to the Independent Accountant at a hearing held before the Independent
Accountant and upon any materials made available by either party and not upon
independent review. The Independent Accountants fees and expenses shall be
split evenly between the Company and Parent. The parties shall use their
reasonable best efforts to cause the Independent Accountant to make its
determination as promptly as possible and in any event within thirty (30) days
after the Independent Accountant has been retained, including by promptly
complying with all reasonable requests for information, books, records and
similar items. Each of the Company and Parent shall be afforded the
opportunity to present to the Independent Accountant any materials related to
the disputed objections and to discuss the determination thereof with the
Independent Accountant. The determination of the Independent Accountant shall
be conclusive and binding on the parties.

 



       
 

 



 

Section 2.12. _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be
no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the shares of
Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

 



 

Section 2.13. _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company
changes the number of shares of Company Common Stock or securities convertible
or exchangeable into or exercisable for any such shares of Company Common
Stock, or Parent changes the number of shares of Parent Common Stock or
securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for any such shares
of Parent Common Stock, in each case issued and outstanding prior to the
Effective Time as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization,
subdivision, or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be
equitably adjusted to eliminate the effects of such event on the Merger
Consideration.

 



 

Section 2.14. _Uncertificated Shares_. No holder of Uncertificated Shares
shall be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of
transmittal to the Exchange Agent to receive the applicable Merger
Consideration, any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to
Section 2.04(h) and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock payable pursuant to Section 2.07 that such holder is entitled to
receive. In lieu thereof, each registered holder of one or more Uncertificated
Shares shall automatically upon the Effective Time be entitled to receive, and
Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay and deliver as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event more than five (5)
Business Days thereafter), the applicable Merger Consideration, any dividends
or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.04(h) and cash in lieu of
any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable pursuant to Section 2.07
each Uncertificated Share.

the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. The proxy statement of the Company to be filed with the
SEC in connection with the Mergers (as amended or supplemented from time to
time, the " **Proxy Statement** ") will, when filed, comply as to form in all

Company Financial Statements or in the notes thereto; (ii) liabilities
incurred in the ordinary course of business since the Company Balance Sheet
Date; (iii) liabilities or obligations incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby; and (iv) liabilities that would not

or effect of such contract is to avoid disclosure in the Company SEC Documents

compliance with the applicable requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2016, and such assessment concluded

omissions included or incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement based
upon information supplied by the Company or any of its representatives or

S-K of the 1933 Act), where the result, purpose or effect of such contract is

expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

Section 6.02. _Company Stockholder Meeting_. The Company shall cause a meeting
of its stockholders (the " **Company Stockholder Meeting** ") to be duly
called and held as soon as reasonably practicable (but in no event later than
forty-five (45) days after the Registration Statement is declared effective
under the 1933 Act) for the purpose of voting on the approval and adoption of
this Agreement and the Mergers. Subject to Section 6.03, the Board of
Directors shall (i) recommend approval and adoption of this Agreement, the
Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby by the Companys
stockholders, (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company
Stockholder Approval and (iii) otherwise comply with all legal requirements
applicable to such meeting. The Company may, without the prior written consent
of Parent, adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholder Meeting, after
consultation with Parent, if the Company believes in good faith that such

additional time to (x) solicit additional proxies necessary to obtain the
Company Stockholder Approval, or (y) distribute any supplement or amendment to
the Proxy Statement that the Board of Directors has determined in good faith
after consultation with

 



      
 

 



 

outside legal counsel is necessary under Applicable Laws and for such
supplement or amendment to be reviewed by the Companys shareholders prior to
the Company Stockholder Meeting.

 



 

Section 6.03. _No Solicitation; Other Offers_. (a) _General Prohibitions_.
The Company and its Subsidiaries shall not, and the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts not to permit any of its or their officers, directors,
employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, consultants or other
agents or advisors (" **Representatives** ") to, directly or indirectly, (i)
solicit, initiate or knowingly take any action to knowingly facilitate or
knowingly encourage the submission of any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter
into or participate in any discussions or negotiations with, furnish any
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or afford
access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to, or otherwise knowingly cooperate in any way with
any Third Party that is seeking to make, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal,
(iii) withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to
Parent, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify in
a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation (or publicly
approve, publicly endorse or recommend an Acquisition Proposal) (any of the
foregoing in this clause (iii), an " **Adverse Recommendation Change** ") or
(iv) enter into any agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet,
merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or other similar
instrument relating to an Acquisition Proposal. Any breach of this Section
6.03 by the Companys officers or directors or any of the Companys or its
Subsidiaries Representatives acting at the direction of an officer or
director of the Company (and, for the avoidance of doubt, only a breach by
such persons) shall be deemed a breach by the Company.

 



 

(b) _Exceptions_.

 



 

(i) Notwithstanding Section 6.03(a), if after the date of this Agreement, but
prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders, the
Company receives a _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a
material breach by the Company of Section 6.03(a), which the Board of
Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys
financial advisors, constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in a
Superior Proposal, the Company may: (A) engage in negotiations or discussions
with such Third Party and its Representatives with respect to such Acquisition
Proposal and (B) furnish to such Third Party or its Representatives non-public
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to a
confidentiality agreement with confidentiality obligations no less favorable
to the Company than those contained in the confidentiality agreement dated
October 4, 2017 between the Company and Parent (the " **Confidentiality
Agreement** "); _provided_ that all such information (to the extent that such
information has not been previously provided or made available to Parent) is
provided or made available to Parent, as the case may be, prior to or
substantially concurrently with the time it is provided or made available to
such Third Party; _provided, however_ , that the Company shall provide written
notice to Parent as soon as reasonably practicable before taking any of the
actions described in clauses "(A)" and "(B)" above.

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) Notwithstanding Section 6.03(a), at any time after the date of this
Agreement but prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the Companys
stockholders, the Board of Directors may: (A) make an Adverse Recommendation
Change only in response to (I) the Company receiving a _bona fide_ written
Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal that did not arise
from a material breach by the Company of Section 6.03(a) of this Agreement or
(II) an Intervening Event; or (B) if the Company has complied in all material
respects with Section 6.03(c), cause the Company to terminate this Agreement
and, substantially concurrently with, and as a condition to such termination,
cause the Company to enter into a definitive written agreement providing for
such Superior Proposal, if and only if, in each case of clauses "(A)" and
"(B)" above, (x) the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
consulting with and receiving advice from outside counsel, that the failure to
(1) effect an Adverse Recommendation Change or (2) terminate this Agreement
and enter into a definitive written agreement providing for a Superior
Proposal, in each case, would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under the DGCL and (y) the Company complies with the
provisions of Section 6.03(c) in all material respects.

 



 

In addition, nothing contained herein shall prevent the Board of Directors
from (i) complying with Rule 14e-2(a) under the 1934 Act with regard to an
Acquisition Proposal or (ii) issuing a "stop, look and listen" disclosure or
similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the 1934
Act; _provided, however_ , that with respect to the foregoing clause (i), any
such action taken or statement or disclosure made that relates to an
Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change
unless the Board of Directors reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in
such statement or disclosure or in connection with such action.

 



 

(c) _Required Notices_.

 



 

(i) Subject to Section 6.03(c)(ii), no Adverse Recommendation Change may be
made in response to a Superior Proposal or Intervening Event and no
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 6.03(b)(ii) may be
made: (A) until the fourth (4th) Business Day following Parents receipt of
written notice from the Company advising Parent that the Board of Directors
intends to, as applicable, make such Adverse Recommendation Change or
terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 6.03(b)(ii) (each, a "
**Company Board Recommendation Notice** "), which notice shall specify (1) in
the case of such an action taken in connection with a Superior Proposal, the
terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the
Person making such Superior Proposal and a copy of the then-current forms of
all of the relevant proposed transaction documents related thereto, including
definitive agreements with respect to such Superior Proposal) or (2) if the
basis of the proposed action by the Board of Directors is an Intervening
Event, a reasonably detailed description of the Intervening Event (it being
understood and agreed that the delivery of a Company Board Recommendation
Notice shall not, in and of itself, constitute an Adverse Recommendation
Change); and (B) unless the Company shall have, (x) during the four (4)
Business Day period specified above (and any additional period related to a
revision

 



      
 

 



 

to the Superior Proposal, as provided in Section 6.03(c)(ii)), negotiated, and
directed the Companys financial advisors and legal counsel to negotiate, with
Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent indicates in writing to the Company
that Parent desires to negotiate) with respect to proposed adjustments to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement agreed to be made in writing by Parent
so that such Superior Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal (or,
in the case of a Company Board Recommendation Notice that is related to an
Intervening Event, so that the failure to make such Adverse Recommendation
Change would no longer be reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the
Board of Directors fiduciary duties under the DGCL) and no such agreement is
reached and (y) substantially concurrently with the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 6.03(b)(ii), pay the Termination Fee as forth in
Section 11.04(b)(i)(A).

 



 

(ii) The parties agree that, in the case of such actions taken in connection
with a Superior Proposal, any material amendment to the financial terms or
other material terms of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Company
Board Recommendation Notice and an additional two (2) Business Day period (the
period inclusive of all such days, the " **Notice Period** "). The Company
agrees that the Company shall take into account all changes to the terms of
this Agreement agreed to be made in writing by Parent in determining whether
such Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal. The
Company shall promptly keep Parent informed of all material developments
affecting the material terms of any such Superior Proposal (and the Company
shall provide Parent with copies of any additional relevant proposed
transaction documents related thereto).

 



 

(iii) The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in any event within twenty
four (24) hours) of the receipt of any written Acquisition Proposal and a
summary of the material terms and conditions thereof but excluding the
identity of the Third Party making such Acquisition Proposal. The Company
shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a prompt and timely basis of the
status and material details of any such Acquisition Proposal and with respect
to any material change to the terms of any such Acquisition Proposal within
twenty four (24) hours of such material change.

 



 

(d) _Definition of Superior Proposal_. For purposes of this Agreement, "
**Superior Proposal** " means a _bona fide_ , unsolicited Acquisition Proposal
for more than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock or all or substantially all of the consolidated assets of the Company
and its Subsidiaries on terms that the Board of Directors determines in good
faith by a majority vote, after consultation with the Companys financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, are more favorable to the Companys
stockholders from a financial point of view than as provided hereunder, taking
into account the relevant legal, financial and regulatory aspects of such
Acquisition Proposal and all other relevant factors, and any changes to the
terms of this Agreement that as of that time had been agreed to be made in
writing by Parent in response to such Acquisition Proposal as contemplated by
Section 6.03(c).

 



 

(e) _Obligation to Terminate Existing Discussions_. Subject to the other
provisions of this Section 6.03, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall, and
the Company shall use its

 



      
 

 



 

reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to, cease immediately and
cause to be terminated any and all existing activities, discussions or
negotiations, if any, with any Third Party and its Representatives conducted
prior to the date hereof with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

Section 6.04. _Access to Information_. From the date hereof until the
Effective Time and subject to Applicable Law and the Confidentiality
Agreement, the Company shall (i) give to Parent and its Representatives, upon
reasonable notice, reasonable access to the offices, properties, books and
records and the executive team (and an integration team of employees
designated by the executive team) of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii)
furnish to Parent and its Representatives such financial and operating data in
the Companys possession as such Persons may reasonably request, (iii)
instruct its Representatives to cooperate reasonably with Parent in its
investigation of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (iv) provide Parent with
reasonable notice of and the opportunity to participate jointly with the
Company in the employee/town hall meetings in connection with the Mergers set
forth on Section 6.04 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and (v) provide
Parent with reasonable notice of and the opportunity to participate jointly
with the Company in customer calls that are requested by the Companys
customers in connection with the Mergers. Any investigation pursuant to this
Section 6.04 shall be conducted in such manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. Nothing in this Section 6.04 shall require the Company to
provide any access, or to disclose any information (A) if providing such
access or disclosing such information would violate any Applicable Law
(including Antitrust Law and privacy laws) or binding agreement entered into
prior to the date of this Agreement or (B) protected by attorney-client
privilege to the extent such privilege cannot be protected by the Company
through exercise of its commercially reasonable efforts. In the event that the
Company does not provide access or information in reliance on the preceding
sentence, it shall use its reasonable best efforts to communicate the
applicable information to Parent in a way that would not violate the foregoing
restrictions, including by providing such information in redacted form as
necessary to preserve such a privilege or comply with such Law or otherwise
make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements, to the extent reasonably
practicable. All information exchanged pursuant to this Section 6.04 shall be
subject to the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.05. _Transaction Committee_. From the date hereof until the
Effective Time, a committee of the Board of Directors (the " **Transaction
Committee** ") initially comprised of those members of the Board of Directors
set forth on Section 6.05 of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be
responsible for overseeing (i) actions taken by the Company and its
Subsidiaries in connection with obtaining the Required Antitrust Regulatory
Filings/Approvals and the Required Insurance Regulatory Filings/Approvals,
(ii) the administration of the Retention Plan, (iii) the performance of the
Companys obligations under this Agreement and (iv) all other actions taken by
the Company and its Subsidiaries in furtherance of completing the Mergers
(collectively, the " **Specified Transaction Matters** "). The Transaction
Committee shall initially designate John Killea, Matthew Morris, David Hisey
and Ann Manal as the Company executives responsible for execution of the
Specified Transaction Matters, and Messrs. Killea, Morris and Hisey and Ms.
Manal shall report directly to the Transaction Committee with respect

 



      
 

 



 

to such Specified Transaction Matters. In the event that a senior executive of
Parent desires to discuss any issue or matter arising from or related to the
Specified Transaction Matters with the Company, they should consider Messrs.
Killea, Morris and Hisey and Ms. Manal to be the designated contact persons of
the Company for the purposes of discussing any such issues or matters;
provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall not relieve any
of Parent, the Merger Subs or the Company from any obligation to provide any
notice otherwise required by this Agreement in accordance with __ Section
11.01.

 



 

Section 6.06. _Retention Plan_. Within fifteen (15) days following the date
hereof, the Company shall develop, in consultation with Parent, a cash
retention plan with an aggregate value of $1215 million (the " **Retention
Plan** ") to be allocated to the Companys top business producers and other
key personnel (in each case, as selected by the Company in consultation with
Parent), such that fifty percent (50%) of the payments to be made to
individuals under the Retention Plan shall be paid as promptly as practicable
following the Closing Date and the remaining fifty percent (50%) shall be paid
on the date that is twelve (12) months from the Closing Date (or as promptly
as practicable thereafter).

repurchase or otherwise acquire or offer to redeem, repurchase, or otherwise
acquire any Parent Securities or any Parent Subsidiary Securities;

or in the aggregate, prevent, materially delay or materially impede the
ability of Parent and the Merger Subs to consummate the Mergers or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any financing thereof.

 



 

Section 7.02. _Obligations of the Merger Subs_. Parent shall take all action

respective obligations under any indemnification agreement with any
Indemnified Person and not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such

Companys existing fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, " **D
andO Insurance**"), in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of
at least six (6) years from and after the Subsequent Effective Time with
respect to any claim related to any period or time at or prior to the
Subsequent Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better
credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to DandO
Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are
no less favorable than the coverage provided under the Companys existing
policies. If the Company or the Surviving Entity for any reason fails to
obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Subsequent Effective Time, the
Surviving Entity shall continue to maintain in effect, for a period of at
least six (6) years from and after the Subsequent Effective Time, the DandO
Insurance in place as of the Subsequent Effective Time with the Companys
current insurance carrier or with an insurance carrier with the same or better
credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to DandO
Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are
no less favorable than the coverage provided under the Companys existing
policies as of the Subsequent Effective Time, or the Surviving Entity shall
purchase from the Companys current insurance carrier or from an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current
insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance comparable DandO Insurance for
such six (6)-year period with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of
liability that are no less favorable than as provided in the Companys
existing policies as of the Subsequent Effective Time; _provided_ that in no
event shall Parent or the Surviving Entity be required to expend for such
policies pursuant to this sentence an annual premium amount in excess of three
hundred percent (300%) of the premium amount per annum for the Companys
existing policies; and _provided, further_ , that if the aggregate premiums of
such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Entity shall be
obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available, with
respect to matters occurring prior to the Subsequent Effective Time, for a
cost not exceeding such amount.

 



       
 

 



 

(e) If Parent, the Surviving Entity or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or Surviving Entity or entity of such consolidation or merger, or
(ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or
the Surviving Entity, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 7.04.

 



 

(f) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.04 shall be in
addition to any rights such Person may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, under the
DGCL or any other Applicable Law or under any agreement of any Indemnified
Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. These rights shall survive
consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall be
enforceable by, each Indemnified Person.

 



 

Section 7.05. _Employee Matters_. (a) For the period beginning on the Closing
and ending on the first anniversary of the Closing (the " **Continuation
Period** "), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Entity to, provide
each Company Employee who continues to be employed by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries immediately after the Closing (each a " **Continuing
Employee** ") with (i) a base salary, wage or commission rate and cash bonus
opportunity, in each case, at least equal to the base salary, wage or
commission rate and cash bonus opportunity provided to such Continuing
Employee by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing;
(ii) employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to
those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent or its Affiliates
(excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, equity or equity-based awards) and
(iii) severance benefits, to Continuing Employees who do not have an
employment agreement that provides for post-termination severance benefits, no
less favorable than those for which the Continuing Employees would have been
eligible pursuant to the Companys severance plans and policies as in effect
immediately prior to the Closing and as set forth on Section 7.05(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule; provided that the foregoing obligation shall not
include change in control, transaction or retention or similar bonuses or
payments.

 



 

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plan or arrangement maintained by
Parent or its Affiliates (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, equity or
equity-based awards) in which any Continuing Employee is eligible to
participate on or after the Closing, for all purposes, including for purposes
of determining eligibility to participate, level of benefits, vesting and
benefit plan accruals (but not for the purposes of benefit accrual under any
defined benefit pension plan), each Continuing Employees service with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as well as service with any predecessor
employer) prior to the Closing shall be treated as service with Parent and its
Affiliates as of the Closing to the extent such services was recognized
immediately prior to Closing under a comparable Employee Plan; _provided_ that
the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that it would result in any
duplication of benefits for the same period of service.

 



 

(c) Unless otherwise requested by Parent not later than ten (10) Business Days
prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions, including
through resolutions of the Board of Directors (or a duly constituted and
authorized committee thereof or other appropriate governing body) that may be
necessary or appropriate to cause the Companys 401(k) plan to

 



      
 

 



 

terminate effective on the Business Day immediately preceding the Effective
Time, with such termination being contingent on the Closing. Such resolutions
shall be subject to Parents reasonable prior review and approval. As a
condition to the Companys obligation to terminate the Companys 401(k) plan
pursuant to the preceding sentence, each Continuing Employee shall become a
participant in the Parent 401(k) Plan immediately following the Effective Time
(giving effect to the service crediting provisions of Section 7.05(b)); it
being agreed that no Continuing Employee shall experience a gap in eligibility
to participate in a tax-qualified defined contribution plan as a result of the
transactions as contemplated by this Agreement. Parent agrees to cause the
Parent 401(k) Plan to accept, in accordance with applicable Law and the terms
of the Parent 401(k) Plan, a "direct rollover" (within the meaning of Section
401(a)(31) of the Code) of his or her account balances (including earnings
thereon through the date of transfer and promissory notes evidencing all
outstanding loans) under the Companys 401(k) plan, _provided_ that the
Company provides (or causes to be provided) such information as reasonably
requested by the administrator of the Parent 401(k) Plan to administer any
such rolled over loans.

 



 

(d) With respect to any health and welfare plan maintained by Parent or its
Affiliates in which any Continuing Employee is eligible to participate at or
after the Closing, Parent shall, or shall cause its Affiliates (including the
Surviving Entity) to, use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive, or
cause to be waived, preexisting conditions, limitations, exclusions, actively-
at-work requirements and waiting periods with respect to participation by and
coverage of each Continuing Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) and
(ii) recognize, or cause to be recognized, the dollar amount of all co-
payments, deductibles and similar expenses incurred by each Continuing
Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) during the calendar year in
which the Closing occurs for purposes of satisfying such years deductible and
co-payment limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which each
Continuing Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) will be eligible to
participate from and after the Closing.

 



 

(e) Nothing in this Section 7.05, express or implied, (i) is intended to or
shall confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns, including any current or former Company
Employee or any other consultant, independent contractor or other service
provider, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement (including, without limitation, any right to
employment or continued employment), (ii) shall establish or constitute an
amendment, termination or modification of, or an undertaking to establish,
amend, terminate or modify, any benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement, or (iii) shall alter or limit the ability of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (or, following the Subsequent Effective Time, the Surviving
Entity or any of its Subsidiaries) to amend, modify or terminate any benefit
plan, program, agreement or arrangement at any time assumed, established,
sponsored or maintained by any of them.

 



 

Section 7.06. _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in connection
with the Mergers to be listed on the NYSE, subject to official notice of
issuance.

things necessary or advisable under Applicable Law to consummate the

filing as promptly as practicable with any Governmental Authority or other
third party all documentation to effect all necessary filings, notices,
petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information, applications
and other documents and (y) obtaining and maintaining all approvals, consents,

reasonable best efforts to execute and deliver such other documents,
certificates and other writings as may be necessary or advisable in order to
consummate or implement expeditiously the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



 

(b) Subject to Applicable Law, each of the parties to this Agreement shall,
upon request, furnish to the other parties to this Agreement all information
concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and shareholders and
such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection
with the Registration Statement, the Proxy Statement or any statement, filing,
notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company, or any of
their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Authority in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each party hereto
agrees to (i) (A) make or cause to be made an appropriate filing of a
Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable after
the date hereof (and in any event within ten (10) Business Days unless
otherwise agreed in writing), and to make, or cause to be made, the filings
and authorizations, if any, required under any other Antitrust Laws as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof and to supply as

stock or assets or otherwise), directly or indirectly, any assets, securities,
properties, or businesses, enter into any licensing or similar arrangements or
enter into any other transaction if any such acquisition, licensing or similar
arrangement or other transaction, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect in any material respect the
likelihood that the waiting period (or any extension

 



      
 

 



 

thereof) under the HSR Act expires or is terminated or materially delayed or
that any other antitrust or insurance approval would not be obtained or
materially delayed and (ii) make appropriate applications or notices required
to obtain the Required Insurance Regulatory Filings/Approvals as promptly as

limitation of the foregoing, the parties shall request and shall use
reasonable best efforts to obtain early termination of the waiting period
under the HSR Act.

 



 

(d) Each of the parties hereto shall, in connection with the efforts
referenced in Section 8.01(c) to obtain all requisite approvals and
authorizations for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, use its
reasonable best efforts to (i) take the actions set forth on Section 8.01(c)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule, (ii) cooperate in all respects with each
other in connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any
investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a
private party; (iii) subject to applicable legal limitations and the
instructions of any Governmental Authority, keep the other party reasonably
informed of any communication received by such party (and provide a copy of
any such communication or, if such communication is oral, a summary of such
communication) from, or given by such party to, the FTC, the Antitrust
Division of the Department of Justice (the " **DOJ** ") or any other
Governmental Authority and of any communication received or given in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any
of the transactions contemplated hereby; and (iv) subject to applicable legal
limitations and the instructions of any Governmental Authority, provide a copy
of and permit the other party to review in advance any filing or notice to be
submitted in connection with a Required Insurance Regulatory Filing/Approval
or written communication (provided that the parties may redact references to
the value of this transaction or alternatives to this transaction) to be given
by it to, and consult with each other in advance of any in-person meeting or
conference with, the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Authority or, in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any other person, and
to the extent permitted by the FTC, the DOJ or such other applicable
Governmental Authority or other person, give the other party the opportunity
to attend and participate in such in-person meetings or conferences.

 



 

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in Section 8.01(c) and Section 8.01(d), if any objections are
asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under any
Applicable Law or if any suit is instituted (or threatened to be instituted)
by the FTC, the DOJ or any other applicable Governmental Authority or any
private party challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby as
violative of any Applicable Law or which would otherwise prevent, materially
impede or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, each of the parties hereto shall use their reasonable best efforts to
(x) take, or cause to be taken, all other actions and (y) do, or cause to be
done, all other things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated hereby, including taking all such
further action as may be necessary to resolve such objections, if any, as the
FTC, the DOJ, state antitrust enforcement authorities, competition authorities
of any other nation or other jurisdiction or Insurance Departments or
commissions

 



      
 

 



 

may assert under any Applicable Law with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby, and to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under
any Applicable Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement so as to enable the
Closing to occur as soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event no later
than the End Date), including in each case as may be required in order to
avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary
restraining order or other order in any suit or proceeding which would
otherwise have the effect of preventing the Closing or delaying the Closing
beyond the End Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
8.01 or elsewhere in this Agreement, the parties hereto understand and agree
that Parents reasonable best efforts shall include Parent (i) entering into
any settlement, undertaking, consent decree, stipulation or agreement with or
required by any Governmental Authority or other Person in connection with any
consent or approval required to complete or otherwise in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) proposing, negotiating,
committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order or
otherwise, the sale, divestiture, disposition or hold separate of businesses,
product lines or assets of Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries (each of the foregoing described in clauses (i) and (ii), a "
**Remedial Action** "); _provided, however_ that Parents obligations with
respect to Remedial Actions pursuant to the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii)
shall be limited to selling, divesting, disposing of, licensing or holding
separate (A) rights to title plants and (B) businesses, product lines or
assets of Parent, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries, as required
by any Governmental Authority; and _provided further, however_ , that Parents
obligations with respect to Remedial Actions pursuant to the foregoing clauses
(i) and (ii) shall not require Parent to sell, divest, dispose of, license or
hold separate: (1) title plants and rights to title plants, businesses,
product lines or assets to the extent that such title plants, rights to title
plants, businesses, product lines or assets generated Divested Revenues in
excess of $225,000,000 in the aggregate, or (2) any of its own brands in full.
Nothing in this Agreement shall require Parent or its Affiliates to (and
neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries shall without the express written
consent of Parent) defend through litigation any claim asserted in court or
administrative or other tribunal by any Person (including any Governmental
Authority) in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any
Legal Restraint that would prevent the Closing prior to the End Date.

 



 

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, if requested by Parent, the Company shall, and
shall cause any Insurance Subsidiary to, agree to or accept any Remedial
Action; _provided_ that nothing in this Agreement shall require any party
hereto to take or agree to take, or cause to be taken, any Remedial Action
unless the effectiveness of such Remedial Action is conditioned upon the
Closing.

 



 

(g) Each of the parties hereto shall:

 



 

(i) promptly advise the other upon receiving any communication from any
Governmental Authority the consent or approval of which is required for
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that causes
such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any requisite
Regulatory Approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such
approval may be materially delayed; and

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) inform the other parties to this Agreement of, and if in writing, furnish
the other parties with copies of (or, in the case of oral communications,
advise the other parties orally of), any substantive communication from or to
any Governmental Authority regarding the Mergers, and permit the other parties
to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the
other parties in connection with, any proposed communication or submission
with any such Governmental Authority; _provided, however,_ that Parent shall
have the principal responsibility for devising and implementing the strategy
for obtaining any necessary antitrust consents or approvals and shall lead and
direct all submissions to, meetings and communications with any Governmental
Authority or other party in connection with antitrust matters, including
litigation matters with respect to any Antitrust Law; _provided, however,_
that no party shall participate in any meeting or substantive communication
with any Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement and the
Mergers unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent
not prohibited by such Governmental Authority, gives the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate therein or thereat. Notwithstanding the
foregoing and subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, Parent and the Company
may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any
competitively sensitive material provided to the other under this Section
8.01(g)(ii) as "Outside Counsel Only Material." Such materials and the
information contained therein shall be given only to the outside counsel of
the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees,
officers or directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained
in advance from the source of the materials (Parent or the Company, as the
case may be) or its legal counsel. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Section 8.01, materials provided pursuant to this Section
8.01 may be redacted (A) to remove references concerning the valuation of the
Company and the Mergers, (B) as necessary to comply with contractual
arrangements and (C) as necessary to address reasonable privilege concerns.

 



 

(h) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in Section 8.01 (a), (e), (f), (g) or (h), the Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate with Parent to obtain
each of the consents set forth on Section 8.01(h) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule; _provided_ that the Company shall not be required to make payments
or incur any costs or expenses, grant any concession or incur any liability in
order to obtain any such consents, and the failure to obtain any such consent
shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement by the Company or relieve
Parent or the Merger Subs from any of their respective obligations hereunder
(including to consummate the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated
hereby).

 



 

Section 8.02. _Certain Filings_. (a) The Company and Parent shall reasonably
cooperate with one another (i) in connection with the preparation of the Proxy
Statement, which shall, subject to Section 6.03(b), include the Company Board
Recommendation, (ii) in determining whether any action by or in respect of, or
filing with, any Governmental Authority is required, or any actions, consents,
approvals or waivers are required to be obtained from parties to any material
contracts, in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (iii) in taking such actions or making any
such filings, furnishing information

 



      
 

 



 

required in connection therewith or with the Proxy Statement and seeking
timely to obtain any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers.

 



 

(b) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, Parent
shall prepare (with the Companys reasonable cooperation) and file with the
SEC the Registration Statement in connection with the registration under the
1933 Act of the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in Merger I. Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the Registration Statement
declared effective under the 1933 Act as promptly as practicable after such
filing and to keep the Registration Statement effective as long as is
necessary to consummate Merger I and the other transactions contemplated
hereby. Each of the Company and Parent shall furnish all information
concerning the Company and the holders of shares of Company Common Stock and
Parent and the holders of Parent Common Stock, as applicable, as may be
reasonably requested in connection with any such action.

 



 

(c) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement
to be mailed to the Companys shareholders and Parents stockholders, as
applicable, as promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement is
declared effective under the 1933 Act and in connection with the mailing of
the Form of Election.

 



 

(d) No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Registration Statement
will be made by Parent, and no filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the
Proxy Statement will be made by the Company or Parent, in each case without
providing the other party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
thereon (other than, in each case, any filing, amendment or supplement in
connection with an Adverse Change Recommendation), and each party shall
consider in good faith all comments reasonably proposed by the other party.
Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly provide the other with copies of
all such filings, amendments or supplements to the extent not readily publicly
available. Each of the Company and Parent shall furnish all information
concerning such Person and its Affiliates to the other and provide such other
assistance as may be reasonably requested by such other party to be included
therein and shall otherwise reasonably assist and cooperate with the other in
the preparation of the Registration Statement or Proxy Statement, as
applicable, and the resolution of any comments to either received from the
SEC. If at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval,
any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective
Affiliates, directors or officers, should be discovered by the Company or
Parent which is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to
either the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement, so that either such
document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other party and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent
required by Applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company or
the stockholders of Parent, as applicable. The parties shall notify each other
promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC
and of any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or
supplements to the Registration Statement or for additional information and
shall supply each other with copies of (i) all correspondence

 



      
 

 



 

between it or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the
staff of the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the Registration
Statement, Proxy Statement or the Mergers and (ii) all orders of the SEC
relating to the Registration Statement. No response to any comments from the
SEC or the staff of the SEC relating to the Proxy Statement will be made by
either party without providing the other a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment thereon unless pursuant to a telephone call initiated by the SEC,
and each party shall consider in good faith all comments reasonably proposed
by the other party. The parties will cause the Registration Statement and
Proxy Statement to comply as to form in all material respects with the
applicable provisions of the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act, as applicable, and the
rules and regulations thereunder.

 



 

Section 8.03. _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect
to the execution of this Agreement shall be a press release to be reasonably
agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Except in connection with press
releases or other public statements made in compliance with Section 6.03, none
of the Company, on the one hand, or Parent, on the other hand, shall issue any
public release or make any public announcement concerning this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written
consent of the other (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), except as such release or announcement may be
required by Applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable
United States securities exchange or Governmental Authority to which the
relevant party is subject or submits, wherever situated, in which case the
party required to make the release or announcement shall use its reasonable
best efforts to allow, to the extent practicable and permissible pursuant to
Applicable Law, the other party or parties hereto reasonable time to comment
on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance (it being
understood that the final form and content of any such release or
announcement, as well as the timing of any such release or announcement, shall
be at the final reasonable discretion of the disclosing party); provided,
however, that the restrictions set forth in this Section 8.03 shall not apply
to any release or announcement that is consistent in all material respects
with previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made by
a party hereto in accordance with this Agreement, in each case to the extent
such disclosure is still accurate.

 



 

Section 8.04. _Further Assurances_. At and after the Subsequent Effective
Time, the officers and directors of the Surviving Entity shall be authorized
to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or the Merger
Subs, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do,
in the name and on behalf of the Company or the Merger Subs, any other actions
and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Entity any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the
rights, properties or assets of the Company acquired or to be acquired by the
Surviving Entity as a result of, or in connection with, the Mergers.

 



 

Section 8.05. _Notices of Certain Events_. Each of the Company and Parent
shall promptly notify the other of:

 



 

(a) subject to Applicable Law, any written notice or other written
communication from any Governmental Authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

 



      
 

 



 

(b) any breach of this Agreement that would cause any of the closing
conditions of the other party set forth in Article 9 not to be satisfied.

 



 

Section 8.06. _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, each party
shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of
Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Company
Common Stock) or acquisitions of Parent Common Stock (including derivative
securities with respect to Parent Common Stock) resulting from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is subject
to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the 1934 Act with respect to
the Company and will become subject to such reporting requirements with
respect to Parent to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the 1934
Act.

 



 

Section 8.07. _Stock Exchange De-Listing_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall cooperate with Parent to, and Parent shall take such actions
reasonably required to, cause the shares of Company Common Stock to be de-
listed from the NYSE and de-registered under the 1934 Act as soon as
practicable following the Effective Time.

 



 

Section 8.08. _Tax-Free Reorganization Representation Letters_. (a) Prior to
the Effective Time, each of Parent, the Merger Subs and the Company shall not
take any action that it knows or would reasonably be expected to know would
cause the Mergers not to qualify as a 368 Reorganization.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Company shall deliver
to the Companys tax counsel letters containing representations of its
officers substantially in the form of _Exhibits A_ and _B_ hereto,
respectively, for the purposes of obtaining a tax opinion from Davis Polk and
Wardwell LLP to the effect that the Mergers will be treated for U.S. federal
income tax purposes as a reorganization qualifying under the provisions of
Section 368(a) of the Code and that each of Parent and the Company will be a
party to the reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code.

 



 

Section 8.09. _Transaction Litigation_. In the event that any stockholder
litigation related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
is brought against either party or any directors or executive officers of
either party after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time
(the " **Transaction Litigation** "), such party shall promptly notify the
other party of any such Transaction Litigation that such party is aware of and
shall keep such other party reasonably informed with respect to the status
thereof. The Company shall control the defense or settlement of any
Transaction Litigation brought against the Company or any of its directors or
executive officers; provided that the Company shall give Parent the
opportunity at Parents expense to participate in (but not control) the
defense of any such Transaction Litigation, and the Company shall not settle
or agree to settle any Transaction Litigation without Parents prior written
consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

 



 

Section 8.10. _Dividends_. Each of the Company and Parent shall coordinate
with the other regarding the declaration and payment of dividends in respect
of Company Common Stock and Parent Common Stock and the record dates and
payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the Company and

Common Stock shall receive two dividends, or fail to receive one dividend, for
any single calendar quarter with respect to its shares of Company Common
Stock, on the one hand, and shares of Parent Common Stock any holder of
Company Common Stock receives pursuant to the Mergers, on the other.

may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time (notwithstanding any
approval of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company):

 



 

(a) by mutual written agreement of the Company and Parent;

 



 

(b) by either the Company or Parent, if:

 



 

(i) the Mergers have not been consummated on or before the twelve (12)-month
anniversary of the date hereof (the " **End Date** "); _provided however_ that
if on the initial End Date the condition set forth in Section 9.01(c) or the
condition set forth in Section 9.01(d) (or, solely to the extent in relation
to the matters addressed by Section 9.01(c) or Section 9.01(d), the condition
set forth in Section 9.01(b)) is not satisfied but all the other conditions to
Closing set forth in Article 9 are satisfied or waived (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to those conditions being capable of being satisfied), then either of
Parent or the Company may, in its sole discretion, extend the End Date by
three (3) months on up to two (2) occasions

 



      
 

 



 

only by providing notice of such extension to the other Party, in which case
the End Date shall be deemed for all purposes to be such later date (which,
for the avoidance of doubt shall be no later than the eighteen (18) month
anniversary of the date hereof); _provided_ that the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.01(b)(i) shall not be available to any
party whose breach of any provision of this Agreement results in the failure
of the Mergers to be consummated by such time;

 



 

(ii) there shall be any Legal Restraint that shall have become final and
nonappealable; _provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this Section 10.01(b)(ii) shall not be available to any party whose breach
of any provision of this Agreement results in the existence of such Legal
Restraint; or

 



 

(iii) at the Company Stockholder Meeting (including any adjournment or
postponement thereof), the Company Stockholder Approval shall not have been
obtained; or

 



 

(c) by Parent, if:

 



 

(i) a Triggering Event shall have occurred; or

 



 

(ii) a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to perform any
covenant or agreement on the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement
shall have occurred that would cause the condition set forth in Section
9.02(a) or Section 9.02(b), as applicable, not to be satisfied, and such
breach or failure to perform is (A) incapable of being satisfied by the End
Date or (B) if capable of being cured before the End Date, is not cured within
thirty (30) Business Days following Parents delivery of written notice to the
Company stating Parents intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 10.01(c)(ii) and the basis for such termination; _provided_ that,
at the time of the delivery of such notice, neither Parent nor either of the
Merger Subs shall be in breach of its or their obligations under this
Agreement; or

 



 

(d) by the Company:

 



 

(i) in accordance with Section 6.03(b)(ii)(B); _provided_ that concurrently
with such termination, the Company pays the Termination Fee payable pursuant
to Section 11.04; or

 



 

(ii) if a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to perform any
covenant or agreement on the part of the Parent or the Merger Subs set forth
in this Agreement shall have occurred that would cause the condition set forth
in Section 9.03(a) or Section 9.03(b), as applicable, not to be satisfied, and
such breach or failure to perform is (A) incapable of being satisfied by the
End Date or (B) if capable of being cured before the End Date, is not cured
within thirty (30) Business Days following the Companys delivery of written
notice to Parent stating the Companys intention to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 10.01(d)(ii) and the basis for such termination;

 



       
 

 



 

 _provided_ that, at the time of the delivery of such notice, the Company
shall not be in breach of its obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.01
(other than pursuant to Section 10.01(a)) shall give notice of such
termination to the other party.

 



 

Section 10.02. _Effect of Termination_. Subject to Section 11.04(b), if this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10.01, this Agreement shall become
void and of no effect without liability of any party (or any stockholder,
director, officer, employee, agent, consultant or other Representative of such
party) to the other party hereto; provided that, subject to the first sentence
of Section 11.04(d), if such termination shall result from the Willful Breach
by a party, such party shall be fully liable for any and all liabilities and
damages (which the parties acknowledge and agree shall not be limited to
reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and may include the benefit
of the bargain lost by a partys stockholders (taking into consideration
relevant matters, including other combination opportunities and the time value
of money), which shall be deemed in such event to be damages of such party)
incurred or suffered by the other party as a result of such failure. The
provisions of this Section 10.02 and Sections 6.04, 11.01, 11.04, 11.07, 11.08
and 11.09 shall survive any termination hereof pursuant to Section 10.01.

(b) _Termination Fees_.

 



 

(i) _Termination Fee_.

 



 

(A) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 10.01(c)(i)
or by the Company pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(i), then the Company shall pay
to Parent in immediately available funds $33,000,000 (the " **Termination
Fee** "), in the case of a termination by Parent, within one Business Day
after such termination and, in the case of a termination by the Company,
immediately before and as a condition to such termination.

 



 

(B) If (1) this Agreement is terminated (A) by Parent or the Company pursuant
to Section 10.01(b)(i) or Section 10.01(b)(iii) or by (B) Parent pursuant to
Section 10.01(c)(ii) as a result of a Willful Breach by the Company, (2) after
the date of this Agreement and prior to such termination, an Acquisition
Proposal shall have been publicly announced or otherwise been communicated to
the Board of Directors or its stockholders and not withdrawn and (3) within
twelve (12) months following the date of such termination, (x) an Acquisition
Proposal shall have been consummated or (y) a definitive agreement with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal shall have been entered into and such
Acquisition Proposal is subsequently consummated ( _provided_ that for
purposes of this clause (B), each reference to "twenty-five percent (25%)" in
the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a reference to
"fifty percent (50%)"), then the Company shall pay to Parent in immediately
available funds, concurrently with the occurrence of the applicable event
described in clause (B), the Termination Fee. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if this Agreement is terminated in any circumstance where the Reverse
Termination Fee is payable pursuant to Section 11.04(b)(ii), no Termination
Fee shall be payable.

 



 

(ii) _Reverse Termination Fee_. If this Agreement is terminated (A) pursuant
to Section 10.01(b)(ii) and the Legal Restraint giving rise to such

have been, or are capable of being satisfied, then Parent shall pay to the
Company $50,000,000 in immediately available funds (the " **Reverse
Termination Fee** ") within five (5) Business Days after the date of the
termination of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) _Other Costs and Expenses_. Each of Parent, the Merger Subs and the
Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in Section 11.04(b) are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that,
without these agreements, Parent, the Merger Subs and the Company would not
enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if either Parent or the Company fails
promptly to pay any amount due to the other party pursuant to

 



      
 

 



 

Section 11.04(b), it shall also pay any costs and expenses incurred by such
other party in connection with a legal action to enforce this Agreement that
results in a judgment against the party that has failed to pay for such
amount, together with interest on the amount of any unpaid fee, cost or
expense at a rate of five percent (5%) compounded quarterly. Such interest
shall be payable at the same time as the payment to which it relates and shall
be calculated daily on the basis of a year of three hundred and sixty five
(365) days and the actual number of days elapsed.

 



 

(d) Parent and the Merger Subs agree that, upon any termination of this
Agreement under circumstances where the Termination Fee is payable by the
Company pursuant to this Section 11.04 and such Termination Fee is paid in
full, except in the case of a termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 10.01(c)(i) or Section 10.01(d)(i) resulting from a Willful Breach by
the Company (for the avoidance of doubt, only to the extent committed by or on
behalf of the Company by the Companys officers or directors or any of the
Companys or its Subsidiaries Representatives acting at the direction of an
officer or director of the Company), Parent and the Merger Subs shall be
precluded from any other remedy against the Company, at law or in equity or
otherwise, and neither Parent nor the Merger Subs shall seek to obtain any
recovery, judgment, or damages of any kind, including consequential, indirect,
or punitive damages, against the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries
or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, partners, managers,
members, shareholders or Affiliates or their respective Representatives in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. The
Company agrees that, upon any termination of this Agreement under
circumstances where the Reverse Termination Fee is payable by Parent pursuant
to this Section 11.04 and such Reverse Termination Fee is paid in full, except
in the case of Willful Breach by Parent or either Merger Sub of **** Section
8.01 (for the avoidance of doubt, only to the extent committed by or on behalf
of Parent or either of the Merger Subs by Parents or either Merger Subs
officers or directors or any of Parents or its Subsidiaries Representatives
acting at the direction of an officer or director of Parent or either Merger
Sub), the Company shall be precluded from any other remedy against Parent or
either Merger Sub, at law or in equity or otherwise, and the Company shall not
seek to obtain any recovery, judgment, or damages of any kind, including
consequential, indirect, or punitive damages, against Parent or either Merger
Sub or any of Parents or the Merger Subs Subsidiaries or any of their

shareholders or Affiliates or their respective Representatives in connection
with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 11.05. _Disclosure Schedule and SEC Document References_. The parties
hereto agree that any reference in a particular Section of either the Company

representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the relevant
party that are contained in the corresponding Section of this Agreement and
(b) any other representations and warranties of such party that is contained
in this Agreement, but only if the relevance of that reference as an exception
to (or a disclosure for purposes of) such representations and warranties is
reasonably apparent. The mere inclusion of an item in either the Company
Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a
representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission that such item
represents a material exception or material fact, event or circumstance or
that such item has had or would reasonably

 



      
 

 



 

be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material
Adverse Effect, as applicable.

 



 

Section 11.06. _Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment_. (a) Subject to Section
11.06(b), the provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns. Except as provided in Section 7.04 or Section 10.02, and other than
the right of any holder of Company Common Stock and Company Equity Awards to
receive Merger Consideration, Parent RSUs or Parent PSUs in respect of their
Company Common Stock or Company Equity Awards, as applicable, as contemplated
by Article 2, no provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any rights,
benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other
than the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

 



 

(b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each other party
hereto, except that Parent or either of the Merger Subs may transfer or assign
its respective rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from
time to time in part, to (i) one or more of their respective Affiliates at any
time and (ii) after the Effective Time, to any Person; _provided_ that such
transfer or assignment shall not relieve Parent or either of the Merger Subs
of its respective obligations hereunder or enlarge, alter or change any
obligation of any other party hereto or due to Parent or the Merger Subs. Any
purported assignment, delegation or other transfer without such consent shall
be void.

 



 

Section 11.07. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard
to the conflicts of law rules of such state.

 



 

Section 11.08. _Jurisdiction_. (a) The parties hereto agree that any suit,
action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any
matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (whether brought by any party or any of its
Affiliates or against any party or any of its Affiliates) shall be brought in
the Delaware Chancery Court or, if such court shall not have jurisdiction, any
federal court located in the State of Delaware or other Delaware state court,
and each of the parties hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of
such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such
suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by Applicable Law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have
to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such
court or that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court
has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or
proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or
without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing,
each party agrees that service of process on such party as provided in Section
11.01 shall be deemed effective service of process on such party.

 



 

(b) EACH OF PARENT, THE MERGER SUBS AND THE COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
DESIGNATES CORPORATION TRUST CENTER (IN SUCH CAPACITY, THE " **PROCESS AGENT**
"), WITH AN OFFICE AT 1209 ORANGE STREET, CITY OF

EFFECT OR TO APPOINT ANOTHER AGENT SO THAT SUCH PARTY SHALL AT ALL TIMES HAVE
AN AGENT FOR SERVICE OF PROCESS FOR THE ABOVE PURPOSES IN WILMINGTON,
DELAWARE. NOTHING HEREIN SHALL AFFECT THE RIGHT OF ANY PARTY TO SERVE PROCESS
IN ANY MANNER PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EACH PARTY EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT THE FOREGOING WAIVER IS INTENDED TO BE IRREVOCABLE UNDER THE LAWS OF THE
STATE OF DELAWARE AND OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

 



 

Section 11.09. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY.

 



 

Section 11.10. _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be signed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have

right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written
agreement or other communication).

 



 

Section 11.11. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the Confidentiality

the subject matter of this Agreement and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both oral and written, between the parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement.

of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of

 



      
 

 



 

the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to
the fullest extent possible.

 



 

Section 11.13. _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with its terms, and that monetary damages, even if
available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. Accordingly, the parties
hereto agree that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions, or any other appropriate form of equitable relief, to prevent
breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the
terms and provisions hereof in any court referred to in Section 11.08(a),
without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy
(and each party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of
any bond in connection with such remedy), in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, if, prior to the End Date, any party brings any suit, action
or proceeding to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions hereof by any other party, the End Date shall automatically be
extended by the amount of time during which such suit, action or proceeding is
pending, plus twenty (20) Business Days, or such longer time period
established by the court presiding over such suit, action or proceeding, if
any.
