**ARTICLE  IV**

 

**Merger  Consideration; Conversion or Cancellation of Shares in the

(a) Except  as  provided in subsection (e) of this Section 4.1, each share
of Common Stock  of  American (collectively, the "American Common Shares")
issued and outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall, by
virtue of the Merger and  without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, be converted automatically  into the right to receive one (1) share
of Common Stock of  Marwich (collectively, the "Marwich Common Shares"). All
American Common Shares  to be converted into Marwich Common Shares pursuant
to this Section 4.1 shall,  by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holders  thereof, cease to be outstanding, be canceled and
retired and cease to exist,  and each holder of a certificate representing
any such American Common Shares  shall thereafter cease to have any rights
with respect to such American Common  Shares, except the right to receive for
each of his/her American Common Shares,  upon the surrender of the
certificate therefor in accordance with Section 4.2,  the number of Marwich
Common Shares specified above. The ratio of American  Common Shares per share
of Marwich Common Shares is referred to as the "Common  Exchange Ratio." 
The  Common Exchange Ratio shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect any
stock  split, reverse stock split, stock dividend or other similar change in
the Common  and/or Preferred Stock of Marwich and/or American occurring on or
prior to  the  Closing Date.

 

 

(b) Each  share of Preferred Stock of American (collectively, the "American
Preferred  Shares") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall,  by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the holder  thereof, be converted automatically into the right to receive one
(1) Marwich  Common Share. All American Preferred Shares to be converted into
Marwich Common  Shares pursuant to this Section 4.1 shall, by virtue of the
Merger and without  any action on the part of the holders thereof, cease to
be outstanding, be  canceled and retired and cease to exist, and each holder
of a certificate  representing any such American Preferred Shares shall
thereafter cease to have  any rights with respect to such American Preferred
Shares, except the right  to  receive for each of his/her American Preferred
Shares, upon the surrender of  the  certificate therefor in accordance with
Section 4.2, the number of Marwich  Preferred Shares specified above. The
ratio of American Preferred Shares per  share of Marwich Preferred Shares is
referred to as the "Preferred Exchange  Ratio." The Preferred Exchange Ratio
shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect  any stock split, reverse stock
split, stock dividend or other similar change  in  the Common and/or
Preferred Stock of Marwich and/or American occurring on or  prior to the
Closing Date.

 

 

(c)  At the Effective Time, each warrant issued by  American to purchase
shares of American Preferred Shares (each, an "American  Preferred Warrant")
which is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior  therto, whether
vested of unvested, shall cease to represent a right to acquire  shares of
American Preferred Shares and shall be assumed and shall be converted  into a
warrant to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable  to
the original American Preferred Warrant, that number of Marwich Common 
Shares, as applicable, determined by multiplying the number of shares of 
American Preferred Shares, as applicable, subject to such American Preferred 
Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Preferred Exchange
Ratio,  rounded down to the nearest whole share of American Preferred Stock,
at a price  pre share (rounded up to the nearest one-hundredth of a cent)
equal to the  per  share exercise price specified in such American Preferred
Warrant divided by  the  Preferred Exchange Ratio.

 

 

(d)  At the Effective Time, each warrant issued by  American to purchase
shares of American Common Stock (each, an "American Common Warrant") which is
outstanding and unexercised immediately  prior thereto, whether vested or
unvested, shall cease to represent a right  to  acquire shares of American
Common Stock and shall be assumed and shall be  converted into a warrant to
acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were  applicable to the original
American Common Warrant, that number of Marwich  Common Shares determined by
multiplying the number of shares of American Common  Stock subject to such
American Common Warrant immediately prior to the Effective  Time by the
Common Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share  of  American
Common Stock, at a price per share (rounded up to the nearest  one-hundredth
of a cent) equal to the per share exercise price specified in  such 
American Common Warrant divided by the Common Exchange Ratio.

 

 

(e) All  shares of American owned by Marwich shall automatically cease to be
outstanding,  shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist.

 

 

(f) All  shares of Marwich owned by American shall automatically cease to be
outstanding,  shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist.

 

 

(g) Except  as  set forth in subsection (f) above, each stock certificate
representing any  shares of Marwich shall continue to represent ownership of
such shares of  capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

 

4.2. _Payment  for Shares in the Merger_.  The  manner of making payment
for American Common Shares and American Preferred  Shares (collectively,
"American Shares") in the Merger shall be as  follows:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(a) On  or  prior to the Closing Date, Marwich shall make available to
Corporation  Stock Transfer (the "Exchange Agent") for the benefit of the
holders of  American Shares, a sufficient number of certificates representing
the Marwich  Common Shares and Marwich Preferred Shares (collectively, the
"Marwich Shares")  required to effect the delivery of the aggregate
consideration in Marwich Shares  and cash for the Fractional Securities
Fund  (as  defined in Section 4.3) required to be issued pursuant to Section
4.1  (collectively, the "Share Consideration" and the certificates
representing the  Marwich Shares comprising such aggregate Share
Consideration being referred  to  hereinafter as the "Stock Merger Exchange
Fund"). The Exchange Agent shall,  pursuant to irrevocable instructions,
deliver the Marwich Shares contemplated  to  be issued pursuant to Section
4.1 and effect the sales provided for in Section  4.3 out of the Stock Merger
Exchange Fund. The Stock Merger Exchange Fund shall  not be used for any
other purpose than as set forth herein.

 

 

(b) Promptly  after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each
holder of record  of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to
the Effective Time  represented outstanding American Shares (the
"Certificates") (i) a form of  letter of transmittal (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected,  and  risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery  of the Certificates to
the Exchange Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in  effecting the surrender
of the Certificates for payment therefor. Upon surrender  of Certificates for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such  letter of transmittal
duly executed and any other required documents, the holder  of such
Certificates shall be entitled to receive for each of American Shares 
represented by such Certificates the Share Consideration, without interest, 
and  the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Until so 
surrendered, such Certificates shall represent solely the right to receive 
the  Share Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional Marwich Shares
as  contemplated by Section 4.3 with respect to each of the American Shares 
represented thereby.

 

 

(c) No  dividends or other distributions that are declared after the
Effective Time  on  Marwich Shares and payable to the holders of record
thereof after the Effective  Time will be paid to persons entitled by reason
of the Merger to receive Marwich  Shares until such persons surrender  their
Certificates as provided above. Upon such surrender, there shall be paid  to
the person in whose name the Marwich Shares are issued any dividends or 
other  distributions having a record date after the Effective Time and
payable with  respect to such Marwich Shares between the Effective Time and
the time of such  surrender. After such surrender there shall be paid to the
person in whose  name  the Marwich Shares are issued any dividends or other
distributions on such  Marwich Shares which shall have a record date after
the Effective Time. In  no  event shall the persons entitled to receive such
dividends or other  distributions be entitled to receive interest on such
dividends or other  distributions.

 

 

(d) If  any  certificate representing Marwich Shares is to be issued in a
name other than  that in which the Certificate surrendered in exchange
therefor is registered,  it  shall be a condition of such exchange that the
Certificate so surrendered shall  be properly endorsed and otherwise in
proper form for transfer and that the  person requesting such exchange shall
pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer  or  other taxes required by reason
of the issuance of certificates for such Marwich  Shares in a name other than
that of the registered holder of the Certificate  surrendered, or shall
establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that  such tax has been
paid or is not applicable.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(e) Notwithstanding  the foregoing, neither the Exchange Agent nor any of the
Parties shall be liable  to a holder of American Shares for any Marwich
Shares or dividends thereon,  or,  in accordance with Section 4.3, cash in
lieu of fractional Marwich Shares,  delivered to a public official pursuant
to applicable escheat law. The Exchange  Agent shall not be entitled to vote
or exercise  any rights of ownership with respect to the Marwich Shares held
by it from  time  to time hereunder, except that it shall receive and hold
all dividends or other  distributions paid or distributed with respect to
such Marwich Shares for the  account of the persons entitled thereto.

 

 

(f) Subject  to applicable law, any portion of the Stock Merger Exchange Fund
and the  Fractional Securities Fund (as defined in Section 4.3) which remains
unclaimed  by the former stockholders of American for one (1) year after the
Effective  Time  shall be delivered to Marwich, upon demand of Marwich, and
any former  stockholder of American shall thereafter look only to Marwich for
payment of  their applicable claim for the Share Consideration for their
American  Shares.

 

 

4.3. _Cash  For Fractional Marwich Shares_.  No  fractional Marwich Shares
shall be issued in the Merger. Each holder of Marwich  Shares shall be
entitled to receive in lieu of any fractional Marwich Shares  to  which such
holder otherwise would have been entitled pursuant to Section 4.2  (after
taking into account all Marwich Shares then held of record by such  holder) a
cash payment in an amount equal to the product of (i) the fractional 
interest of a Marwich Share to which such holder otherwise would have been 
entitled and (ii) the fair market value of one (1) Marwich Share as
determined  by Marwich's Board of Directors in good faith (the cash
comprising such  aggregate payments in lieu of fractional Marwich Shares
being hereinafter  referred to as the "Fractional Securities Fund").

 

 

4.4   _Dissenting  Shares._

 

 

(a)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event
that  the applicable requirements of Sections 92A.380-92A.400 of the NCL have
been  satisfied, shares of American which were outstanding on the date for
the  determination of shareholders entitled to vote on the Merger and (i)
which  were  not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in
writing (if such action  is taken by written consent), (ii) the holders of
which have demanded that  the  Company purchase such shares at their fair
market value in accordance with  Sections 92A.400-440 of the NCL and (iii)
have submitted such shares for  endorsement in accordance with Section
92A.440 of the NCL and have not otherwise  failed to perfect or shall not
have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights  to purchase for cash under
the NCL (the "American Dissenting Shares") shall  not  be converted into
Marwich Common Shares, but, instead, the holders thereof  shall  be entitled
to have their shares purchased by the Company for cash at the fair  market
value of such American Dissenting Shares as agreed upon or determined  in 
accordance with the provisions of Section 92A.460 et seq. of the NCL;
provided,  however, that if any such holder shall have failed to perfect or
shall have  effectively withdrawn or lost his, her or its right to payment
under the NCL,  such holder\'s shares of American Stock shall thereupon be
deemed to have been  converted, at the Effective Time of the Merger, into the
Marwich Common Shares  set forth in Section 4.1 hereof, without any interest
thereon. American shall  give Marwich prompt notice of any demands pursuant
to Section 92A.380 et seq.  of  the NCL received by American, withdrawals of
such demands and any other  instruments served pursuant to the NCL and
received by  American.

 

 

(b)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event
that  the applicable requirements of Sections 7-113-202-204 of the CCAA have
been  satisfied, shares of Marwich which were outstanding on the date for
the  determination of shareholders entitled to vote on the Merger and (i)
which  were  not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in
writing (if such action  is taken by written consent), (ii) the holders of
which have demanded that  Marwich purchase such shares at their fair market
value in accordance with  Sections 7-113-204 of the CCAA and (iii) have
submitted such shares for  endorsement in accordance with Section 7-113-204
or 205 of the CCAA and have  not  otherwise failed to perfect or shall not
have effectively withdrawn or lost  their rights to purchase for cash under
the CCAA (the "Marwich Dissenting  Shares") shall not remain outstanding,
but, instead, the holders thereof shall  be entitled to have their shares
purchased by Marwich for cash at the fair  market value of such Marwich
Dissenting Shares as agreed upon or determined  in  accordance with the
provisions of Section 7-113-101 et seq. of the CCAA;  provided, however, that
if any such holder shall have failed to perfect or  shall  have effectively
withdrawn or lost his, her or its right to payment under the  CCAA, such
holder\'s shares of Marwich Common shall thereupon remain issued  and 
outstanding. Marwich shall give American (i) prompt notice of any demands 
pursuant to Section 7-113-204 et seq. of the CCAA received by Marwich, 
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to 
the  CCAA and  received by Marwich and (ii) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and  proceedings with respect to demands under Section 7-113-204
and 209 of the  CCAA. Marwich  shall not, except with the prior written

appraisal or offer to settle or settle any  such demands.

American Shares shall be made on the stock transfer books of  American after

5.2. _Representations  and Warranties of American_.  American  hereby
represents and warrants to Marwich that the statements contained in  this 
Section 5.2 are true and correct, except to the extent set forth on the 
disclosure schedule previously delivered by American to Marwich (the
"American  Disclosure Schedule"). The American Disclosure Schedule shall be
initialed by  the Parties and shall be arranged in sections and paragraphs
corresponding  to  the letter and numbered paragraphs contained in this
Section 5.2.

 

 

(a) _Corporate  Organization and Qualification_.  American is a corporation
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing  under the laws of
Nevada and is qualified and in good standing as a foreign  corporation in
each jurisdiction where the properties owned, leased or operated,  or the
business conducted, by it require such qualification, except where  failure
to so qualify or be in good standing as a foreign corporation would  not 
have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in Section 9.10). American has
all  requisite power and authority (corporate or otherwise) to own its
properties  and  to carry on its business as it is now being conducted.
American has heretofore  made available to Marwich complete and correct
copies of its Articles of  Incorporation and By-Laws.

 

 

(b) _Capitalization_.  The  authorized capital stock of American consists of
(i) 200,000,000 shares of  Common Stock, of which 74,600,000 shares were
issued and outstanding on  June 23, 2006; and (ii) 25,000,000 shares of
Preferred Stock, of which 5,000,000  shares of Series A Convertible Preferred
Stock were issued and outstanding  on  June 23, 2006. All of the outstanding
shares of capital stock of American have  been duly authorized and validly
issued and are fully paid and nonassessable.  American has no outstanding
stock appreciation rights, phantom stock or similar  rights. Except for
Warrants exercisable for 800,000 shares of American Common  Stock and 200,000
shares of American Common Stock issuable pursuant to an option  agreement,
there are no outstanding or authorized options, warrants, calls,  rights
(including preemptive rights), commitments or any other agreements of  any 
character which American is a party to, or may be bound by, requiring it to 
issue, transfer, grant, sell, purchase, redeem or acquire any shares of
capital  stock or any securities or rights convertible into, exchangeable
for, or  evidencing the right to subscribe for, any shares of capital stock
of American.  There are not as of the date hereof any stockholder agreements,
voting trusts  or  other agreements or understandings to which American is a
party or to which  it  is bound relating to the voting of any shares of the
capital stock of American.  The American's assets do not include any capital
stock of, or any other equity  interest in, or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for any capital  stock or other equity interest in, any person,
or any direct or indirect equity  or ownership interest in any other
business.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) _Authority  Relative to this Agreement_.  The  Board of Directors of
American has declared the Merger advisable and American  has the requisite
corporate power and authority to approve, authorize, execute  and deliver
this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated  hereby
(subject to the approval of the Merger by the stockholders of American  in 
accordance with the NCL). This Agreement and the consummation by American of 
the  transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized
by the  Board of Directors of American and no other corporate proceedings on
the part  of  American are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to
consummate the  transactions contemplated hereby (other than the approval of
the Merger by  the  stockholders of American in accordance with the NCL).
This Agreement has been  duly and validly executed and delivered by American,
and, assuming this  Agreement constitutes the valid and binding agreement of
Marwich, constitutes  the valid and binding agreement of American,
enforceable against American in  accordance with its terms, subject, as to
enforceability, to bankruptcy,  insolvency, reorganization and other laws of
general applicability relating  to  or affecting creditors' rights and to
general principles of equity.

 

 

(d) _Present  Compliance with Obligations and Laws_.  American is not: (i)
in violation of its Articles of Incorporation or By-Laws;  (ii) in default in
the performance of any obligation, agreement or condition  of  any debt
instrument which (with or without the passage of time or the giving  of 
notice, or both) affords to any person the right to accelerate any
indebtedness  or terminate any right; (iii) in default under or breach of
(with or without  the  passage of time or the giving of notice) any other
contract to which it is  a  party or by which it or its assets are bound; or
(iv) in violation of any law,  regulation, administrative order or judicial
order, decree or judgment (domestic  or foreign) applicable to it or its
business or assets, except where any  violation, default or breach under
items (ii), (iii), or (iv) would not,  individually or in the aggregate, have
a Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

(e) _Consents  and Approvals, No Violation_.  Neither  the execution and
delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation by American  of  the
transactions contemplated hereby will (i) conflict with or result in any 
breach of any provision of its Articles of Incorporation (or other similar 
documents) or By-Laws (or other similar documents); (ii) require any
consent,  approval, authorization or permit of, or registration or filing
with or  notification to, any governmental or regulatory authority, except

the Certificate of Merger  pursuant to the NCL and the CCAA, and appropriate
documents with the relevant  authorities of other states in which American is
authorized to do business,  (C)  as may be required by any applicable state
securities or takeover laws, (D)  such  filings and consents as may be
required under any environmental, health or  safety law or regulation
pertaining to any notification, disclosure or required  approval triggered by
the Merger or the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement, as set forth
in Section 5.2(e) of the American Disclosure Schedule,  or (E) where the
failure to obtain such consent, approval, authorization or  permit, or to
make such filing or notification, would not in the aggregate  have  a
Material Adverse Effect or adversely affect the ability of American to 
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby; (iii) result in a violation 
or  breach of, or constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time or
both)  a  default (or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation or
acceleration  or lien or other charge or encumbrance) under any of the terms,
conditions  or  provisions of any indenture, note, license, lease, agreement
or other instrument  or obligation to which American or any of its assets may
be bound, except for  such violations, breaches and defaults (or rights of
termination, cancellation  or acceleration or lien or other charge or
encumbrance) as to which requisite  waivers or consents have been obtained or
which, in the aggregate, would not  have a Material Adverse Effect or
adversely affect the ability of American  to  consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby; (iv) cause the suspension  or  revocation of any
authorizations, consents, approvals or licenses currently  in  effect which
would have a Material Adverse Effect; or (v) assuming the consents, 
approvals, authorizations or permits and filings or notifications referred 
to in  this Section 5.2(e) are duly and timely obtained or made and the
approval of  the  Merger and the approval of this Agreement by American's
stockholders has been  obtained, violate any order, writ, injunction, decree,
statute, rule or  regulation applicable to American or to any of its assets,
except for violations  which would not in the aggregate have a Material
Adverse Effect or adversely  affect the ability of American to consummate the
transactions contemplated  hereby.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(f) _Litigation_.  There  are no actions, suits, investigations or
proceedings pending or, to the  knowledge of American, threatened against
American that, alone or in the  aggregate, (i) if adversely determined, would
be reasonably likely to result  in  any claims against or obligations or
liabilities of American that, alone or  in  the aggregate, would have a
Material Adverse Effect, (ii) question the validity  of this Agreement or any
action to be taken by American in connection with  the  consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or (iii) would prevent  American from
performing its obligations under this Agreement, or (iv) would  delay, limit
or enjoin the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement.

 

 

(g) _Financial  Statements_.

 

 

(i) The  balance sheet dated as of March 31, 2006 and the related statements
of  income, stockholders' equity (deficit) and cash flows (including the
related  notes thereto) of American previously delivered to Marwich
(collectively, "American Financial Statements") have been prepared in
accordance with generally  accepted accounting principles applied on a basis
consistent with prior periods  (except as otherwise noted therein), and
present fairly the financial position  of American as of their respective
dates, and the results of its operations  and  cash flows for the periods
presented therein (subject, in the case of the  unaudited interim financial
statements, to normal year-end adjustments). Since  its inception, there has
not been any material change, or any application or  request for any material
change, by American in accounting principles, methods  or policies for

(ii) The  books  of account of American are complete and correct in all
material respects and  have been maintained on a materially consistent basis.

 

 

(h) _No  Liabilities; Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.  American does
not have any material indebtedness, obligations or liabilities  of  any kind
(whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise, and whether due  or  to
become due or asserted or unasserted), and, to the knowledge of American, 
there is no basis for the assertion of any claim or liability of any nature 
against American, except for liabilities (i) which are fully reflected in, 
reserved against or otherwise described in the American Financial
Statements,  or  (ii) which have been incurred after [insert date of balance
sheet] in the  ordinary course of business. The business of American has been
carried on only  in the ordinary and usual course and there has not been any
material adverse  change in its business, properties, operations, financial
condition or prospects  and no event has occurred and no fact or set of
circumstances has arisen which  has resulted in or could reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse  Effect with respect to American. To
the knowledge of American, no material  customer or supplier of American
intends to or has threatened to alter  materially its relationship with
American.

 

 

(i) _Brokers  and Finders_.  American has not employed any investment
banker, broker, finder, consultant  or  intermediary in connection with the

investment banking, brokerage, finder's or  similar fee or commission in

(i) American  has timely filed all Federal, state, local and foreign returns,
information  statements and reports relating to Taxes ("Returns") required by
applicable Tax  law to be filed by American, except for any such failures to

aggregate, a Material  Adverse Effect on the American. All Taxes owed by
American to a taxing  authority, or for which American is liable, whether to
a taxing authority or  to  other persons or entities under a Significant Tax
Agreement, as of the date  hereof, have been paid and, as of the Effective
Time, will have been paid,  except for any such failure to pay that could not
reasonably be expected to  have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on American.  American has made (A) accruals for Taxes on the
American Financial Statements  and (B) with respect to periods after the date
of the American Financial  Statements, provisions on a periodic basis
consistent with past practice on  the  American's books and records or
financial statements, in each case which are  adequate to cover any Tax
liability of American determined in accordance with  generally accepted
accounting principles through the date of the American  Financial Statements
or the date of the provision, as the case may be, except  where failures to
make such accruals or provisions could not reasonably be  expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect  on  American.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) Except  to  the extent that any such failure to withhold could not
reasonably be expected  to  have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on American,  American has withheld with respect to
its employees all Federal and state income  taxes, FICA, FUTA and other Taxes
required to be withheld.

 

 

(iii) There  is  no Tax deficiency outstanding, proposed or assessed against
American, except  any  such deficiency that, if paid, could not reasonably
be expected to have,  individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on American.  American has not executed or requested any waiver of any
statute of limitations  on or extending the period for the assessment or
collection of any Federal  or  material state Tax.

 

 

(iv) No  Federal or state Tax audit or other examination of American is
presently in  progress, nor has American been notified in writing of any
request for such  Federal or material state Tax audit or other examination,
except in all cases  for Tax audits and other examinations which could not
reasonably be expected  to  have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on  American.

 

 

(v) American  has not filed any consent agreement under Section 341(f) of the
Code or agreed  to have Section 341(f)(2) of the Code apply to any
disposition of a subsection  (f) asset (as defined in Section 341(f)(4) of
the Code) owned by  American.

 

 

(vi) American  is not a party to (A) any agreement providing for the
allocation or payment  of  Tax liabilities or payment for Tax benefits with

or included American or (B)  any  Significant Tax Agreement other than any
Significant Tax Agreement described  in  (A).

program,  arrangement, agreement or contract, whether or not written or
terminated, with  respect to any employee, former employee, director,
independent contractor,  or  any beneficiary or dependent thereof (all such
plans, policies, programs,  arrangements, agreements and contracts, whether

material terms of any unwritten American  Scheduled Plan as comprehended to
the Closing Date. There are no negotiations,  demands or proposals which are

would result in the abandonment,  cancellation or unenforceability of any
item of the American Intangible  Property.

and  operations of American for all risks customarily insured against by a
person  or  entity engaged in a similar business as American.

 

 

(v) _Corporate  Books and Records_.  The  minute books and stock ledgers of

insurance comparable to the coverage afforded by such  policies.

 

 

6.6. _Representations  and Warranties_.  Neither  Marwich, on the one hand,

respects at and as of the Effective Time.

 

 

6.7. _Notification  of Certain Matters_.  Each of  American and Marwich
shall give prompt notice to the other of (a) any notice  of,  or other
communication relating to, a default or event which, with notice or  lapse of
time or both, would become a default, received by it subsequent to  the 
date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, under any contract 
material to its financial condition, properties, businesses or results of 
operations to which it is a party or is subject, (b) any notice or other 
communication from any third party alleging that the consent of such third 
party  is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this  Agreement, or (c) any material adverse change in their respective
financial  condition, properties, businesses or results of operations, taken
as a whole,  other than changes resulting from general economic conditions.

 

 

6.8. _Tax-Free  Reorganization Treatment_.  Prior  to the Effective Time,
the Parties shall use their best efforts to cause the  Merger to be treated
as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368  of  the Code and

failure to act would jeopardize the qualification of the Merger as a 
reorganization within Section 368 of the Code.

cause the individuals selected  by  American to be nominated and elected to
