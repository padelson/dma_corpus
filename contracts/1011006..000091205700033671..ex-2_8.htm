ARTICLE II

  

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

  

 Section 2.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of capital stock of Target or capital stock of Sub: 

  

  

 (a) _Capital Stock of Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of the capital stock of Sub shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of Common Stock, $0.001 par value, of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (b) _Cancellation of Acquiror-Owned and Target-Owned Stock_. Any shares of Series A Preferred Stock, $0.001 par value, Series B Preferred Stock, $0.001 par value, Series C Preferred Stock, $0.001 par value, and Series D Preferred Stock, $0.001 par value, of Target (taken together, the "Target Preferred Stock"), or shares of Common Stock, $0.001 par value, of Target ("Target Common Stock"), that are owned by Acquiror, Sub, Target or any other direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary (as defined below) of Acquiror or Target shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist and no stock of Acquiror or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange. As used in this Agreement, the word "Subsidiary" means, with respect to any other party, any corporation or other organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated, of which (i) such party or any other Subsidiary of such party is a general partner (excluding partnerships, the general partnership interests of which held by such party or any Subsidiary of such party do not have a majority of the voting interest in such partnership) or (ii) at least a majority of the securities or other interests having by their terms ordinary voting power to elect a majority of the Board of Directors or others performing similar functions with respect 

  

    

 to such corporation or other organization or a majority of the profit
interests in such other organization is directly or indirectly owned or
controlled by such party or by any one or more of its Subsidiaries, or by
such party and one or more of its Subsidiaries.

   

 (c) _Exchange Ratio_. 

    

 (i) Subject to Sections 2.2 and 2.4, each issued and outstanding share of Target Common Stock (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and any Dissenting Shares as defined in and to the extent provided in Section 2.3) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive a fraction of a fully paid and nonassessable share of Acquiror Common Stock (as defined in Section 4.2) equal to the "Exchange Ratio", as defined in and determined in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.1(c). All such shares of Target Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the shares of Acquiror Common Stock to be issued in consideration therefor upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.4. The number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock to be issued to each Target stockholder shall be determined by multiplying (1) the number of shares of Target Common Stock held by such stockholder (or which will be held by such stockholder upon the conversion of its shares of Target Preferred Stock into Target Common Stock in accordance with the Target Certificate of Incorporation immediately prior to the Effective Time) by (2) the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole share. 

  

 (ii) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Total Consideration Shares" shall be deemed to mean the quotient obtained by _dividing_ (x) the result obtained by subtracting from $450,000,000 (I) the Aggregate Transaction Expenses (as defined in Section 8.2(r) hereof), (II) any cash amounts or other value transfers in excess of $8,644,000 paid or payable by Target in connection with or as a result of the termination of lease agreement dated April 12, 2000 between Target and TST 555/575 Market, L.L.C. (the "Landlord") relating to Target\'s proposed premises at 555 Market Street in San Francisco, California (the "555 Market Street Lease Agreement") and (III) any cash amounts or other value transfers paid or payable by Target in connection with or as a result of Target\'s entering into a Qualified Sublease (as defined below) (other than the remitting to the Landlord of a portion of any net profits realized by Target in connection with the subleasing arrangement pursuant to the terms of the 555 Market Street Lease Agreement), by (y) $131.26667 (the "Average Stock Price"). The "Exchange Ratio" shall be equal to the quotient determined by _dividing_ (x) the Total Consideration Shares, by (y) the sum of (A) the number of shares of Target Common Stock issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time, _plus_ (B) the number of shares of Target Common Stock subject to issuance upon the exercise in full of all Target Options issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested,  _plus_ (C) the number of shares of Target Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of all issued and outstanding shares of Target Preferred Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time. In no event will the total number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock issuable by Acquiror pursuant to the Merger (including shares of Acquiror Common Stock issuable upon exercise of Target Options assumed by Acquiror in the Merger) exceed the Total Consideration Shares. A schedule setting forth the allocation of the Total Consideration Shares among each holder of Target Common Stock, Target Preferred Stock and Target Options based upon the capitalization of Target as of the Effective Time will be prepared by Target and delivered to Acquiror prior to the Closing Date. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Qualified Sublease" shall refer to one or more subleases covering, when taken together, the entire premises leased by Target under the 555 Market Street Lease Agreement that may be entered into by Target prior to the Effective Time with one or more subtenants, each of which shall be satisfactory to Acquiror in its reasonable discretion, on terms and conditions that shall be satisfactory to Acquiror in its reasonable discretion (which shall include a minimum lease term of 

   

     

 at least five years for each of the subleases and shall include terms to the
net effect that Target shall not be obligated to make any payments or other
value transfers to any party in connection with the subleasing arrangement
(other than the remitting to the Landlord of a portion of any net
profits realized by Target in connection with the subleasing arrangement
pursuant to the terms of the 555 Market Street Lease Agreement).

  

 (iii) If, on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Acquiror Common Stock or Target capital stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any reclassification, split-up, stock dividend or stock combination, then the Exchange Ratio shall be correspondingly adjusted. The Exchange Ratio shall not change as a result of fluctuations in the market price of Acquiror Common Stock between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time. 

    

 (d) _Target Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, all then outstanding options, whether vested or unvested ("Target Options"), to purchase Target Common Stock issued under Target\'s stock option plans identified in Section 3.2(a) will be assumed by Acquiror in accordance with Section 6.4. 

  

 (e) _Restricted Shares_. Any shares of Target Common Stock that are subject to repurchase by Target in the event the holder thereof ceases to be employed by Target ("Target Restricted Shares") shall be converted into Acquiror Common Stock on the same basis as provided in subsection (c) above and shall be registered in such holder\'s name, but shall be held by the Surviving Corporation or Acquiror pursuant to the existing agreements in effect on the date of this Agreement. At the Effective Time, Target shall assign all of its rights under such existing agreements to Acquiror. Holders of the Target Restricted Shares, together with a summary of the vesting schedules for such shares, are identified on Schedule 2.1(e) of the Target Disclosure Schedule. 

  

  

 Section 2.2 _Escrow Agreement_. At the Effective Time or such later time as determined in accordance with Section 2.3(b), Acquiror will, on behalf of the holders of Target Common Stock and Target Preferred Stock, deposit in escrow certificates representing ten percent (10%) of the Total Consideration Shares allocable to Target Common Stock and Target Preferred Stock in the Merger. Such shares shall be held in escrow on behalf of the persons who are the holders of Target Common Stock or Target Preferred Stock in the Merger immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Former Target Stockholders"), in accordance with the portion of Total Consideration Shares allocable to each such Former Target Stockholder based upon the Exchange Ratios ("Pro Rata Portion"). Such shares (collectively, the "Escrow Shares") shall be held and applied pursuant to the provisions of an escrow agreement (the "Escrow Agreement") to be executed pursuant to Section 7.6. All calculations to determine the number of Escrow Shares to be delivered by each stockholder of the Company into escrow as aforesaid shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share. 

  

 Section 2.3 _Dissenting Shares_. 

  

  

 (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any shares of Target Common Stock or Target Preferred Stock held by a holder who has exercised such holder\'s appraisal rights in accordance with Section 262 of Delaware Law or, to the extent applicable, Chapter 13 of the California General Corporation Law (the "California Law"), and who, as of the Effective Time, has not effectively withdrawn or lost such appraisal rights ("Dissenting Shares"), shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive Acquiror Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1, but the holder of the Dissenting Shares shall only be entitled to such rights as are granted by Delaware Law or California Law, as the case may be. 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.3(a), if any holder of shares of Target Common Stock or Target Preferred Stock who demands his appraisal rights with respect to such shares under Section 2.1 shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) his rights to receive payment for the fair market value of such shares under Delaware Law or California Law, as the case may be, then, as of the later of the Effective Time or the occurrence of such event, such holder\'s shares shall automatically be converted into and represent only the right to receive Acquiror 

  

    

 Common Stock as provided in Section 2.1(c) upon surrender of the certificate
or certificates representing such shares; _provided_ that if such holder
effectively withdraws or loses his right to receive payment for the fair
market value of such shares after the Effective Time, then, at such time
Acquiror will deposit in the escrow created pursuant to the Escrow Agreement
additional certificates representing such holder\'s Pro Rata Portion of the
Escrow Shares.

  

 (c) Target shall give Acquiror (i) prompt notice of any written demands for payment with respect to any shares of capital stock of Target pursuant to Section 262 of Delaware Law or Chapter 13 of California Law, as the case may be, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to Delaware Law or California Law, as the case may be, and received by the Target and (ii) the opportunity to participate at its own expense in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal rights under Delaware Law or California Law, as the case may be. Target shall not, except with the prior written consent of Acquiror, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal rights with respect to Target Common Stock or Target Preferred Stock or offer to settle or compromise any such demands. 

  

   

 Section 2.4 _Exchange of Certificates_. 

  

  

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, each holder of an outstanding certificate or certificates ("Certificates") which represented shares of Target Common Stock or Target Preferred Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall have the right to surrender each Certificate to Acquiror (or at Acquiror\'s option, an exchange agent to be appointed by Acquiror), and receive promptly in exchange for all Certificates held by such holder a certificate representing the number of whole shares of Acquiror Common Stock (other than the Escrow Shares) into which the Target Common Stock or Target Preferred Stock evidenced by the Certificates so surrendered shall have been converted pursuant to the provisions of Article II of this Agreement. The surrender of Certificates shall be accompanied by duly completed and executed Letters of Transmittal in such form as may be reasonably specified by Acquiror. Until surrendered, each outstanding Certificate, which prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Target Common Stock or Target Preferred Stock, shall be deemed for all corporate purposes to evidence ownership of the number of whole shares of Acquiror Common Stock into which the shares of Target Common Stock have been converted but shall, subject to applicable appraisal rights under Delaware Law and Section 2.3, have no other rights. Subject to applicable appraisal rights under Delaware Law and Section 2.3, from and after the Effective Time, the holders of shares of Target Common Stock and Target Preferred Stock shall cease to have any rights in respect of such shares and their rights shall be solely in respect of the Acquiror Common Stock into which such shares of Target Common Stock or Target Preferred Stock have been converted. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of Target of shares of Target Common Stock and Target Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (b) If any shares of Acquiror Common Stock are to be issued in the name of a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate(s) surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition to the issuance of such shares that (i) the Certificate(s) so surrendered shall be transferable, and shall be properly assigned, endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock powers, (ii) such transfer shall otherwise be proper and (iii) the person requesting such transfer shall pay Acquiror, or its exchange agent, any transfer or other taxes payable by reason of the foregoing or establish to the satisfaction of Acquiror that such taxes have been paid or are not required to be paid. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Acquiror nor Target shall be liable to a holder of shares of Target Common Stock or Target Preferred Stock for shares of Acquiror Common Stock issuable to such holder pursuant to the provisions of Article II of this Agreement that are delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. 

  

 (c) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, Acquiror shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of Acquiror Common 

  

    

 Stock issuable in exchange therefor pursuant to the provisions of Article II
of the Agreement. The Board of Directors of Acquiror may in its discretion and

or entity\'s privacy, personal or confidentiality rights. Target knows of no
valid basis for any claim of the type specified in the immediately preceding
sentence which could in any material way relate to or interfere with the
continued enhancement and exploitation by Target of any of the Target
Products. None of the Target Products nor the use or exploitation of any
Target Proprietary Rights in Target\'s current business infringes on the
rights of or constitutes misappropriation of any proprietary information or
intangible property right of any third person or entity, including without
limitation any patent, trade secret, copyright, trademark or trade name, and
Target has not been sued or named in any suit, action or proceeding which
involves a claim of such infringement, misappropriation or unfair competition.

  

 (b) Target has not granted any third party any right to reproduce, distribute, market or exploit any of the Target Products or any adaptations, translations, or derivative works based on the Target Products or any portion thereof. Except with respect to the rights of third parties to the Third Party Technology and no third party has any express right to reproduce, distribute, market or exploit any works or materials of which any of the Target Products are a "derivative work" as that term is defined in the United States Copyright Act, Title 17, U.S.C. Section 101\. 

  

 (c) All material designs, drawings, specifications, source code, object code, scripts, documentation, flow charts, diagrams, data lists, databases, compilations and information incorporating, embodying or reflecting any of the Target Products at any stage of their development (the "Target Components") were written, developed and created solely and exclusively by employees of Target without the assistance of any third party or entity or were created by third parties who assigned ownership of their rights to Target by means of valid and enforceable confidentiality and invention assignment agreements, copies of which have been delivered to Acquiror. Target has at all times used commercially reasonable efforts customary in its industry to treat the Target Proprietary Rights related to Target Products and Target Components as containing trade secrets and has not disclosed or otherwise dealt with such items in a manner intended or reasonably likely to cause the loss of such trade secrets by release into the public domain. 

  

 (d) To Target\'s knowledge, no employee, contractor or consultant of Target is in violation in any material respect of any term of any written employment contract, patent disclosure agreement or any other written contract or agreement relating to the relationship of any such employee, consultant or contractor with Target or, to Target\'s knowledge, any other party because of the nature of the business conducted by Target or proposed to be conducted by Target. The Target Disclosure Schedule lists all employees, contractors and consultants who have participated in any way in the development of any material portion of the Target Products or the Target Proprietary Rights. 

  

 (e) Each person presently or previously employed by Target (including independent contractors, if any) has executed a confidentiality, non-disclosure and proprietary inventions assignment agreement pursuant to the form of agreement previously provided to Acquiror or its representatives. 

  

    

  (f) No product liability or warranty claims have been communicated in
writing to or threatened against Target.

  

 (g) To Target\'s knowledge, there is no material unauthorized use, disclosure, infringement or misappropriation of any Target Proprietary Rights, or any Third Party Technology to the extent licensed by or through Target, by any third party, including any employee, former employee or independent contractor of Target. Target has not entered into any agreement to indemnify any other person against any charge of infringement of any Target Proprietary Rights. 

  

 (h) Target has taken all steps customary and reasonable in its industry to protect and preserve the confidentiality and proprietary nature of all Intellectual Property and other confidential information not otherwise protected by patents, patent applications or copyright ("Confidential Information"). All use, disclosure or appropriation by Target or, to the best knowledge of Target, by another party pursuant to rights granted to it by Target, of Confidential Information owned by Target to a third party has been pursuant to the terms of a written agreement between Target and such third party. All use, disclosure or appropriation by Target of Confidential Information not owned by Target has been pursuant to the terms of a written agreement between Target and the owner of such Confidential Information, or is otherwise lawful. 

  

  

 Section 3.9 _Employee Benefit Plans_. 

  

  

 (a) The Target Disclosure Schedule lists, with respect to Target and any trade or business (whether or not incorporated) which is treated as a single employer with Target (an "ERISA Affiliate") within the meaning of Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code, (i) all employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), (ii) each loan to a non-officer employee, loans to officers and directors and any stock option, stock purchase, phantom stock, stock appreciation right, supplemental retirement, severance, sabbatical, medical, dental, vision care, disability, employee relocation, cafeteria benefit (Code Section 125) or dependent care (Code Section 129), life insurance or accident insurance plans, programs or arrangements, (iii) all bonus, pension, profit sharing, savings, deferred compensation or incentive plans, programs or arrangements, (iv) other fringe or employee benefit plans, programs or arrangements that apply to senior management of Target and that do not generally apply to all employees, and (v) any current or former employment or executive compensation or severance agreements, written or otherwise, for the benefit of, or relating to, any present or former employee, consultant or director of Target as to which (with respect to any of items (i) through (v) above) any potential liability is borne by Target (together, the "Target Employee Plans"). 

  

 (b) Target has delivered to Acquiror or its representatives a copy of each of the Target Employee Plans and related plan documents (including trust documents, insurance policies or contracts, employee booklets, summary plan descriptions and other authorizing documents, and, to the extent still in its possession, any material employee communications relating thereto) and has, with respect to each Target Employee Plan which is subject to ERISA reporting requirements, provided copies of any Form 5500 reports filed for the last three plan years. Any Target Employee Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has either obtained from the Internal Revenue Service a favorable determination letter as to its qualified status under the Code, including all amendments to the Code effected by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and subsequent legislation, or has applied to the Internal Revenue Service for such a determination letter prior to the expiration of the requisite period under applicable Treasury Regulations or Internal Revenue Service pronouncements in which to apply for such determination letter and to make any amendments necessary to obtain a favorable determination. Target has also furnished Acquiror with the most recent Internal Revenue Service determination letter issued with respect to each such Target Employee Plan, and nothing has occurred since the issuance of each such letter which could reasonably be expected to cause the loss of the tax-qualified status of any Target Employee Plan subject to Code Section 401(a). 

  

 (c) (i) None of the Target Employee Plans promises or provides retiree medical or other retiree welfare benefits to any person; (ii) there has been no "prohibited transaction," as such term is defined 

  

    

 in Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, with respect to any
Target Employee Plan; (iii) each Target Employee Plan has been administered in
accordance with its terms and in compliance with the requirements prescribed
by any and all statutes, rules and regulations (including ERISA and the Code),
and Target and each subsidiary or ERISA Affiliate have performed all material
obligations required to be performed by them under, are not in any material
respect in default, under or violation of, and have no knowledge of any
material default or violation by any other party to, any of the Target
Employee Plans; (iv) neither Target nor any subsidiary or ERISA Affiliate is
subject to any liability or penalty under Sections 4976 through 4980 of the
Code or Title I of ERISA with respect to any of the Target Employee Plans;
(v) all contributions required to be made by Target or any subsidiary or ERISA
Affiliate to any Target Employee Plan have been made on or before their due
dates and a reasonable amount has been accrued for contributions to each
Target Employee Plan for the current plan years; (vi) with respect to each
Target Employee Plan, no "reportable event" within the meaning of Section
4043 of ERISA (excluding any such event for which the thirty (30) day notice
requirement has been waived under the regulations to Section 4043 of ERISA)
nor any event described in Section 4062, 4063 or 4041 of ERISA has occurred;
and (vii) no Target Employee Plan is covered by, and neither Target nor
any subsidiary or ERISA Affiliate has incurred or expects to incur any
material liability under Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. With
respect to each Target Employee Plan subject to ERISA as either an employee
pension plan within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA or an employee
welfare benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA, Target has
prepared in good faith and timely filed all requisite governmental reports
(which were true and correct as of the date filed) and has properly and timely
filed and distributed or posted all notices and reports to employees required
to be filed, distributed or posted with respect to each such Target Employee
Plan. No suit, administrative proceeding, action or other litigation has
been brought, or to the knowledge of Target is threatened, against or with
respect to any such Target Employee Plan, including any audit or inquiry by
the IRS or United States Department of Labor. Neither Target nor any ERISA
Affiliate is a party to, or has made any contribution to or otherwise incurred
any obligation under, any "multi-employer plan" as defined in Section 3(37) of
ERISA.

  

 (d) With respect to each Target Employee Plan, Target has complied with (i) the applicable health care continuation and notice provisions of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 ("COBRA") and the proposed regulations thereunder, (ii) the applicable requirements of the Family Leave Act of 1993 and the regulations thereunder, and (iii) the applicable requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA") and the temporary regulations thereunder. 

  

 (e) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not (i) entitle any current or former employee or other service provider of Target or any other ERISA Affiliate to severance benefits or any other payment (including, without limitation, unemployment compensation, golden parachute or bonus), except as expressly provided in this Agreement, or (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting of any such benefits, or (iii) increase or accelerate any benefits or the amount of compensation due any such employee or service provider. 

  

 (f) There has been no amendment to, written interpretation or announcement (whether or not written) by Target or other ERISA Affiliate relating to, or change in participation or coverage under, any Target Employee Plan which would materially increase the expense of maintaining such Plan above the level of expense incurred with respect to that Plan for the most recent fiscal year included in the Target Financial Statements.

party to seek early termination of any such waiting period under
the Antitrust Laws.

  

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 7.3(a) or (b), (i) neither Acquiror nor any of it subsidiaries shall be required to divest any of their respective businesses, product lines or assets, or to take or agree to take any other action or agree to any limitation that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Acquiror or of Acquiror combined with the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time or (ii) Target shall not be required to divest any of its respective businesses, product lines or assets, or to take or agree to take any other action or agree to any limitation that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Target.

 Section 7.4 _Pooling Accounting_. Target and Acquiror shall each use reasonable good faith efforts, and shall each use its reasonable good faith efforts to cause its respective Affiliates, to cause the business combination to be effected by the Merger to be accounted for as a pooling of interests and to cause such treatment to be accepted by the SEC. Neither Target nor Acquiror shall take any action that would adversely affect the ability of Acquiror to account for the business combination to be effected by the Merger as a pooling of interests. Consistent with the foregoing, Target agrees that, to the extent it is determined that any of its employees, directors or stockholders will receive payments in connection with the Merger that would result in an excise tax to the recipient pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code and result in a nondeductible expense to Target pursuant to Section 280G of the Code, it will not seek the approval of its stockholders to exempt the payments from such excise tax. Schedule 7.4 sets forth those persons who, in Target\'s reasonable judgment are or may, at any time prior to the Closing Date, be "affiliates" of Target within the meaning of the SEC\'s Accounting Releases Nos. 130 and 135 (the "Target Affiliates"). Target shall provide Acquiror such information and documents as Acquiror shall reasonably request for purposes of reviewing such list. Target shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to deliver or cause to be delivered to Acquiror on or prior to the Closing from each of the Target Affiliates an executed Affiliate Agreement. 

  

 Section 7.5 _Further Assurances_. Prior to and following the Closing, each party agrees to cooperate fully with the other parties and to execute such further instruments, documents and agreements and to give such further written assurances, as may be reasonably requested by any other party to better evidence and reflect the transactions described herein and contemplated hereby and to carry into effect the intents and purposes of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 7.6 _Escrow Agreement_. On or before the Effective Time, Acquiror shall, and the parties hereto shall exercise their reasonable good faith efforts to cause the Escrow Agent (as defined in 

    Section 10.2) and the Stockholders\' Agents (as defined in Section 10.9), to
enter into an Escrow Agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as 
_Exhibit E_.

  

 Section 7.7 _FIRPTA_. Target shall, prior to the Closing Date, provide Acquiror with a properly executed Foreign Investment and Real Property Tax Act of 1980 ("FIRPTA") FIRPTA Notification Letter which states that shares of capital stock of Target do not constitute "United States real property interests" under Section 897(c) of the Code, for purposes of satisfying Acquiror\'s obligations under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2(c)(3). In addition, simultaneously with delivery of such FIRPTA Notification Letter, Target shall provide to Acquiror, as agent for Target, a form of notice to the Internal Revenue Service in accordance with the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.897-2(h)(2), along with written authorization for Acquiror to deliver such notice form to the Internal Revenue Service on behalf of Target upon the Closing of the Merger. 

  

 Section 7.8 _Blue Sky Laws_. Acquiror shall take such steps as may be necessary to comply with the securities and blue sky laws of all jurisdictions which are applicable to the issuance of the Acquiror Common Stock in connection with the Merger. Target shall use its reasonable good faith efforts to assist Acquiror as may be necessary to comply with the securities and blue sky laws of all jurisdictions which are applicable in connection with the issuance of Acquiror Common Stock in connection with the Merger. 

   

 Section 7.9 _Other Filings_. As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, Target and Acquiror will prepare and file any other filings required under the Exchange Act, the Securities Act or any other Federal, foreign or state securities or blue sky laws relating to the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Other Filings"). The Other Filings will comply in all material respects with all applicable requirements of law and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Whenever any event occurs which is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Other Filings, Target or Acquiror, as the case may be, will promptly inform the other of such occurrence and cooperate in making any appropriate amendment or supplement, and/or mailing to stockholders of Target, such amendment or supplement. 

   

 Section 7.10 _Qualification of Merger as a Reorganization_. It is the intent of the parties to this Agreement that the Merger qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code, and each of Acquiror, Sub, the Target and the Surviving Corporation covenants and agrees not to take any position on any Return or report relating to Taxes inconsistent with such intent. Each of Acquiror, Sub, the Target and the Surviving Corporation agrees not to take any action either before or after the Effective Time that could reasonably be expected to cause the Merger not to be treated as a "reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the Code.

If after such thirty (30) day period there remains a dispute as to any claims, the Stockholders\' Agents and Acquiror shall attempt in good faith for thirty (30) days to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims. If the Stockholders\' Agents and Acquiror should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties and shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and shall distribute the Escrow Shares from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms of the memorandum. 

  

   

    

 (b) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation, either Acquiror or the Stockholders\' Agents may, by written notice to the other, demand arbitration of the matter unless the amount of the damage or loss is at issue in pending litigation with a third party, in which event arbitration shall not be commenced until such amount is ascertained or both parties agree to arbitration; and in either such event the matter shall be settled by arbitration conducted by three arbitrators. Within fifteen (15) days after such written notice is sent, Acquiror (on the one hand) and the Stockholders\' Agents (on the other hand) shall each select one arbitrator, and the two arbitrators so selected shall select a third arbitrator. The decision of the arbitrators as to the validity and amount of any claim in such Officer\'s Certificate shall be binding and conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement, and notwithstanding anything in Section 10.4, the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to act in accordance with such decision and make or withhold payments out of the Escrow Fund in accordance with such decision. 

  

 (c) Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Any such arbitration shall be held in Santa Clara or San Mateo County, California under the commercial rules then in effect of the American Arbitration Association.

Such agency may be changed by the holders of a majority in interest of the Escrow Shares from time to time upon not less than ten (10) days\' prior written notice to Acquiror. No bond shall be required of the Stockholders\' Agents, and the Stockholders\' Agents shall receive no compensation for services. Notices or communications to or from the Stockholders\' Agents shall constitute notice to or from each of the Former Target Stockholders. 

   

 (b) The Stockholders\' Agents shall not be liable for any act done or omitted hereunder as Stockholders\' Agent while acting in good faith, and any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith. The Former Target Stockholders shall severally and pro rata, in accordance with their Pro Rata Portion, indemnify the Stockholders\' Agents and hold them harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the Stockholders\' Agents and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of their duties hereunder under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. 

  

 (c) The Stockholders\' Agents shall have reasonable access to information about Target and Acquiror and the reasonable assistance of Target\'s and Acquiror\'s officers and employees for purposes of performing their duties and exercising their rights under this Article X, _provided_ that the Stockholders\' Agents shall treat confidentially and not disclose any nonpublic information from or about Target or Acquiror to anyone (except on a need to know basis to individuals who agree to treat such information confidentially). 

  

  

 Section 10.10 _Actions of the Stockholders\' Agents_. A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholders\' Agents shall constitute a decision of all of the Former Target Stockholders for whom shares of Acquiror Common Stock otherwise issuable to them are deposited in the Escrow Fund and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each such Former Target Stockholder, and the Escrow Agent and Acquiror may rely upon any decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholders\' Agents as being the 

    decision, act, consent or instruction of each and every such Former Target
Stockholder. The Escrow Agent and Acquiror are hereby relieved from any
liability to any person for any acts done by them in accordance with such
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholders\' Agents.

  

 Section 10.11 _Claims_. In the event Acquiror becomes aware of a third-party claim which Acquiror believes may result in a demand against the Escrow Fund, Acquiror shall promptly notify the Stockholders\' Agents of such claim, and the Stockholders\' Agents and the Former Target Stockholders for whom shares of Acquiror Common Stock otherwise issuable to them are deposited in the Escrow Fund shall be entitled, at their expense, to participate in any defense of such claim. Acquiror shall have the right in its sole discretion to settle any such claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that Acquiror may not effect the settlement of any such claim without the consent of the Stockholders\' Agents, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. In the event that the Stockholders\' Agents have consented to any such settlement, the Stockholders\' Agents shall have no power or authority to object to the amount of any claim by Acquiror against the Escrow Fund for indemnity with respect to such settlement in the amount agreed to.

 Section 11.5 _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement (including the documents and the instruments referred to herein), the Confidentiality Agreement, and the Transaction Documents (a) constitute the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and (b) are not intended to confer upon any person other than the parties hereto (including without limitation any Target employees) any rights or remedies hereunder.

This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to any applicable conflicts of law; _provided_ that all matters related to the Merger and all matters of corporate governance of each party hereto shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware..

of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and

 Section 11.11 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or future law or regulation, and if the rights or obligations of any party hereto under this Agreement will not be materially and adversely affected thereby, (a) such provision will be fully severable, (b) this Agreement will be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof, (c) the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect and will not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or by its severance from this Agreement and (d) in lieu of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision, there will be added automatically as a part of this Agreement a legal, valid and enforceable provision as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible.
