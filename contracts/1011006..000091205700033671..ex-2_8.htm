Returns required to be filed prior to the date hereof by or on behalf of Target have been duly filed on a timely basis, and such Returns are true, complete and

date hereof by or on behalf of Target under Section&nbsp;6655 of the Code or comparable provisions of state, local or foreign law, have been paid in full on a timely basis or have been accrued on
the Most Recent Balance Sheet, and no other Taxes are payable by Target with respect to items or periods covered by such Returns (whether or not shown on or reportable on such Returns). Target has
withheld and paid over all Taxes required to have been withheld and paid over prior to the date hereof, and complied with all information reporting and backup withholding requirements, including
maintenance of required records with respect thereto, in connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee, creditor, independent contractor, or other third party. There are no liens on any of the

generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis consistent with prior periods of all liabilities for Taxes payable after the date of the Most Recent Balance Sheet attributable to

Target for all periods since the inception of Target.
Target does not do business in or derive income from any state other than states for which Returns have been duly filed and furnished to Acquiror. </FONT></P>

Returns of or including Target have never been audited by a government or taxing authority, nor is any such audit in process, pending or, to Target's knowledge,

notice (either in writing or verbally, formally or informally) that it has not filed a Return or paid Taxes required to be filed or paid. Target is neither a party to any action or proceeding for
assessment or collection of Taxes, nor has such event been asserted or threatened (either in writing or orally, formally or informally) against Target or any of its assets. No waiver or extension of
any statute of limitations is in effect with respect to Taxes or Returns of Target. Target has disclosed on its federal and state income and franchise tax Returns all positions taken therein that
could give rise to a substantial understatement penalty within the meaning of Code Section&nbsp;6662 or comparable provisions of applicable state, local, foreign or other tax laws. </FONT></P>

policies or contracts, employee booklets, summary plan descriptions and other authorizing documents, and, to the extent still in its possession, any material employee communications relating thereto)
and has, with respect to each Target Employee Plan which is subject to ERISA reporting requirements, provided copies of any Form&nbsp;5500 reports filed for the last three plan years. Any Target
Employee Plan intended to be qualified under Section&nbsp;401(a) of the Code has either obtained from the Internal Revenue Service a favorable determination letter as to its qualified status under
the Code, including all amendments to the Code effected by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and subsequent legislation, or has applied to the Internal Revenue Service for such a determination letter prior
to the expiration of the requisite period under applicable Treasury Regulations or Internal Revenue Service pronouncements in which to apply for such determination letter and to make any amendments
necessary to obtain a favorable determination. Target has also furnished Acquiror with the most recent Internal Revenue Service determination letter issued with respect to each such Target Employee
Plan, and nothing has occurred since the issuance of each such letter which could reasonably be expected to cause the loss of the tax-qualified status of any Target Employee Plan subject
to Code Section&nbsp;401(a). </FONT></P>

Notwithstanding the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence, it is expressly understood and agreed that neither Acquiror nor Target shall be obligated to litigate or contest any
administrative or judicial action or proceeding or any Order beyond September&nbsp;30, 2000. Each of Acquiror and Target shall use all reasonable efforts to take such action as may be required to

the Merger that would result in an excise tax to the recipient pursuant to Section&nbsp;4999 of the Code and result in a nondeductible expense to Target pursuant to Section&nbsp;280G of the Code,
it will not seek the approval of its stockholders to exempt the payments from such excise tax. Schedule&nbsp;7.4 sets forth those persons who, in Target's reasonable judgment are or may, at any time

necessary to comply with the securities and blue sky laws of all jurisdictions which are applicable in connection with the issuance of Acquiror Common Stock in connection with the Merger. </FONT></P>
