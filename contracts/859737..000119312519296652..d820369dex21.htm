may be positive or negative, if any, of Net Indebtedness set forth in the

" _Closing Working Capital and Net Indebtedness Adjustments_ ") (the aggregate
amount determined pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 2.2_, the " _Closing
Purchase Price_ ").

 

Section 2.3 _Closing_.

 

(a) The Closing shall take place (i) at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton,
Rosen and Katz, 51 West 52nd Street, New York, New York 10019, at 10:00 a.m.,
New York time, on the date that is three (3) Business Days after the date on
which all of the conditions set forth in _Article_ __ _ VIII_ (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or waived on the
Closing Date, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions)
are satisfied or waived, or (ii) at such other place, time or date as may be
mutually agreed upon in writing by Parent and Purchaser; _provided_ that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, the Closing shall not occur prior to December

date on which the Closing occurs is referred to as the " _Closing Date_."

(b) At the Closing:

forth in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code, a "United States real property
holding corporation" within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code;
_provided_ , that, in the event the Sellers fails to deliver such

recipient of the Purchase Price does not deliver an acceptable alternative
certification exempting such recipient from withholding; and

(a) Not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Parent
shall provide Purchaser with its good faith estimate of each of (i) Working
Capital, (ii) Cash and (iii) Indebtedness as of immediately prior to the
Closing (collectively, the " _Estimated Closing Statement_ "), which shall
be accompanied by a notice that sets forth (i) Parents determination of the
Closing Working Capital and Net Indebtedness Adjustments and the Closing
Purchase Price after giving effect to the Closing Working Capital and Net
Indebtedness Adjustments and (ii) the account or accounts to which Purchaser
shall transfer the Closing Purchase Price pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3_.
The Estimated Closing Statement shall set forth the calculations of such
amounts in accordance with the Accounting Principles. Parent shall consider
in good faith any reasonable revisions to the Estimated Closing Statement
proposed by Purchaser prior to the Closing; _provided_ , _howeve_ r, that if
Parent does not incorporate such comments, the statement delivered by Parent
in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.4(a)_ shall be the Estimated Closing
Statement used for all purposes under this Agreement.

 

(b) The Estimated Closing Statement shall be prepared in good faith in
accordance with the Accounting Principles attached as _Schedule I_ hereto
(the " _Accounting_ _Principles_ "). For illustrative purposes only, Annex A
of _Schedule I_ sets forth a sample calculation of Working Capital and Net
Indebtedness.

 

Section 2.5 _Post-Closing Statements_.

 

(a) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare
in good faith and deliver to Parent a statement of (i) Working Capital, (ii)
Cash and (iii) Indebtedness as of immediately prior to the Closing
(collectively, the " _Initial Closing Statement_ "). The Initial Closing
Statement shall be prepared in good faith and shall set forth the
calculations of such amounts in accordance with the Accounting Principles.

(b) Following the delivery of the Initial Closing Statement to the Parent
and up to the end of the Resolution Period, Parent and its Affiliates and
representatives shall be permitted to access and review the books, records and
work papers of the Transferred Entities

 



-18- 

    

 and Purchaser that are reasonably related to the calculations of Working
Capital and Net Indebtedness, and Purchaser shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries (including the Transferred Entities) and its and their
respective employees, accountants and other representatives (subject to the
prior delivery of customary release letters) to, reasonably cooperate with and
assist Parent and its Affiliates and representatives in connection with
such review, including by providing access to such books, records and work
papers and making available personnel to the extent requested, in each case,
upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours.

 

(c) Purchaser agrees that, following the Closing through the date that the
Initial Closing Statement becomes final and binding in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 2.6(c)_, it will not take or permit to be taken any actions
with respect to any accounting books, records, policies or procedures that
would reasonably be expected to impede or delay the final determination of
the amount of Working Capital or Net Indebtedness.

Section 2.6 _Reconciliation of Initial Closing Statement_.

(a) Parent shall notify Purchaser in writing no later than sixty (60)
days after Parents receipt of the Initial Closing Statement if Parent
disagrees with any aspects of the Initial Closing Statement, which notice
shall reasonably describe the basis for any such disagreements and shall
include Parents proposed calculation of Working Capital, Cash and
Indebtedness as of the Closing (the " _Notice of Disagreement_ "). If no
Notice of Disagreement is delivered to Purchaser within such sixty (60) day
period, then the Initial Closing Statement shall become final and binding
upon the parties in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.6(c)_. If a Notice of
Disagreement is delivered to Purchaser within such sixty (60) day period, then
only such portions of the Initial Closing Statement that Parent does not
identify or disagree with in the Notice of Disagreement shall become final and
binding upon the parties in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.6(c)_.

 

(b) During the thirty (30) days immediately following the delivery of a
Notice of Disagreement (the " _Resolution Period_ "), Parent and Purchaser
shall seek in good faith to resolve any differences that they may have with
respect to the matters identified in the Notice of Disagreement.

 

(c) If, at the end of the Resolution Period, Parent and Purchaser have been
unable to resolve any differences that they may have with respect to any of
the matters identified in the Notice of Disagreement, Parent and Purchaser
shall submit all such matters to KPMG LLP or, if such firm is unwilling or
unable to fulfill such role, (i) another independent certified public
accounting firm in the United States mutually acceptable to Parent and
Purchaser or (ii) if Parent and Purchaser are unable to agree upon another
such firm within ten (10) Business Days after the end of the Resolution
Period, then within an additional ten (10) Business Days, Parent and
Purchaser shall each select one such firm and those two firms shall, within
ten (10) Business Days after their selection, select a third (3rd) such firm
(KPMG LLP, the firm selected in accordance with clause (i) or the third firm
selected in accordance with clause (ii), as applicable, the " _Independent
Accounting Firm_ "). Within thirty (30) days after the Independent Accounting
Firms selection, the Independent Accounting Firm shall make a final
determination in accordance with the Accounting Principles and the other terms
of this Agreement and based solely on the written submissions of the parties,
binding on the parties to this Agreement, of the appropriate amount of each
of the matters that remain in dispute solely to the extent indicated in

 



-19- 

    

 the Notice of Disagreement that Parent and Purchaser have submitted to the
Independent Accounting Firm. With respect to each disputed matter, such
determination, if not in accordance with the position of either Parent or
Purchaser, shall not be in excess of the higher, or less than the lower, of
the amounts advocated by Parent in the Notice of Disagreement or by Purchaser
in the Initial Closing Statement with respect to such disputed matter. For
the avoidance of doubt, the Independent Accounting Firm shall not review or
make any determination with respect to any matter other than the matters that
remain in dispute to the extent indicated in the Notice of Disagreement and
shall not consider any events or developments that occurred after the
Closing, except to the extent required by GAAP. The Initial Closing Statement
as finally determined either through agreement of the parties pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 2.6(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 2.6(b)_ or through the action of
the Independent Accounting Firm pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.6(c)_,
shall be the " _Final Closing Statement_."

(d) All fees and expenses relating to the work, if any, performed by the
Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne by Parent and Purchaser in inverse
proportion as they may prevail on the matters resolved by the Independent
Accounting Firm, which proportionate allocation shall be calculated on an
aggregate basis based on the relative amounts in dispute and shall be
determined by the Independent Accounting Firm at the time its final
determination is rendered. During the review by the Independent Accounting
Firm, each of Purchaser and Parent shall, and shall cause its respective
Subsidiaries (including, in the case of Purchaser, the Transferred Entities)
and its and their respective employees, accountants and other representatives
to reasonably cooperate with the Independent Accounting Firm.

 

(e) The process set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.5_ and this _Section_ __ _
2.6_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of any of the parties and their
respective Affiliates for any disputes related to the Closing Working Capital
and Net Indebtedness Adjustments and the Post-Closing Adjustment.

 

Section 2.7 _Post-Closing Adjustment_. The " _Post-Closing Adjustment_ "
shall be equal to (a) (i) the amount of Working Capital set forth in the
Final Closing Statement _less_ (ii) the amount of Working Capital set forth in
the Estimated Closing Statement, _plus_ (b) (x) the amount of Net Indebtedness
set forth in the Estimated Closing Statement _minus_ (y) the amount of Net
Indebtedness set forth in the Final Closing Statement. For the avoidance of
doubt, any of the amounts set forth in the preceding sentence may be either a
positive or a negative amount. If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a positive
amount, then Purchaser shall pay such positive amount in cash to Parent (or
one or more Affiliates designated by Parent). If the Post-Closing Adjustment
is a negative amount, then Parent (or an Affiliate designated by Parent)
shall pay in cash to Purchaser the absolute value of such negative amount. The
Closing Purchase Price, as adjusted by the Post-Closing Adjustment, shall be
the " _Final Purchase Price_." Any such payment pursuant to this _Section_ __
_ 2.7_ shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds within
five (5) Business Days after the determination of the Final Closing Statement
to an account designated in writing by the party entitled to the payment
within three (3) Business Days after the determination of the Final Closing
Statement.

 

Section 2.8 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. Promptly following the date of
this Agreement, Purchaser and Parent shall consult in good faith regarding
the valuation of the IP Contracts to be used in allocating the Purchase Price
amongst the acquired Units and the IP

 



-20- 

    

 Contracts (the " _Allocation_ "). Purchaser and Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to agree on an Allocation. In the event
Purchaser and Parent agree upon an Allocation, such Allocation shall be
binding upon the parties, and each of the parties will report and file, and
cause their respective Affiliates to report and file, all Tax Returns
(including any amended Tax Returns and claims for refund) in a manner that is
consistent with the Allocation and the parties shall not, and shall cause
their respective Affiliates not to, take any position inconsistent with the
Allocation unless required by applicable Law. In the event Purchaser and
Parent are not able to agree upon an Allocation, each of the parties and
their respective Affiliates shall be permitted to report and file their Tax
Returns (including any amended Tax Returns and claims for refund) using any
allocation they determine in their sole discretion.

Section 2.9 _Withholding_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, and for the avoidance of doubt, (a) each payment to the Sellers
made pursuant to this Agreement shall be made net of any Taxes required by
applicable Law to be deducted or withheld from such payment and (b) any
amounts deducted or withheld from any such payment shall be remitted to the
applicable taxing authority and shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Sellers. Each of Sellers and Purchaser
acknowledges that, to the best of its knowledge, under current law no
withholding is required on any payment to Sellers in its capacity as a seller
of Shares hereunder provided that each Seller timely and properly provides the
certification and required notice described in  _Section_ __ _ 2.3(b)(i)(C)_
and Purchaser has no actual knowledge that such statements are false. In the
event that Purchaser determines that withholding is required, Purchaser will
use commercially reasonable efforts to notify the Sellers in advance and
cooperate in good faith to reduce or minimize such withholding.

ARTICLE III

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLERS

 

Except as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered to Purchaser prior to
the execution of this Agreement (the " _Seller Disclosure Schedule_ "), it
being agreed that disclosure of any item in any section or subsection of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule shall also be deemed disclosure with respect to any
other section or subsection of this Agreement to which the relevance of such
item is reasonably apparent, Sellers, jointly and severally hereby represent
and warrant to Purchaser as of the date of this Agreement and as of the
Closing Date as follows:

 

Section 3.1 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_. Each of the
Sellers and each Transferred Entity is a corporation or other legal entity
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of its
jurisdiction of its organization, except as would not reasonably be expected
to be material to the Transferred Entities and the Business, taken as a
whole. Each Transferred Entity has all requisite corporate or other
organizational power and authority to carry on its businesses as now being
conducted and is qualified to do business and is in good standing as a
foreign corporation or other legal entity in each jurisdiction where the
conduct of its business requires such qualification, in each case except as
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Business Material Adverse Effect. _Section_ __ _ 3.1 of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule_ sets forth a list of all Transferred Entities.

 



-21- 

    

Section 3.2 _Capitalization of the Transferred _ _Entities_. The Units
are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and owned by
the Sellers, free and clear of all Liens, except Liens created under federal,
state or foreign securities Laws. Except for the Units and any interest held
by a Transferred Entity, there are no shares of common stock, preferred stock
or other equity interests of any Transferred Entity issued or outstanding, and
there are no preemptive or other outstanding rights, subscriptions, options,
warrants, stock appreciation rights, redemption rights, repurchase rights,
convertible, exercisable, or exchangeable securities or other ownership
interest in any Transferred Entity or any other securities or obligations
convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for, or giving any Person a
right to subscribe for or acquire, any securities of any Transferred Entity,
and no securities evidencing such rights are issued or outstanding. None of
the Transferred Entities has any outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or
other obligations that provide the holders thereof the right to vote (or are
convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for securities having the
right to vote) with the stockholders of such Transferred Entity on any
matter.

Section 3.3 _Authority Relative to this Agreement_. Each of the Sellers
has all necessary corporate or similar power and authority to execute,
deliver and perform this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof. This
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by each of the
Sellers, and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Purchaser, constitutes a valid, legal and binding agreement of
the Sellers, enforceable against Sellers in accordance with its terms,
subject to the effect of any applicable Laws relating to bankruptcy,
reorganization, insolvency, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or preferential
transfers, or similar Laws relating to or affecting creditors rights
generally and subject, as to enforceability, to the effect of general
principles of equity (the " _Enforceability Exceptions_ "). Parent or its
applicable Subsidiary has all necessary corporate or similar power and
authority to execute, deliver and perform the Ancillary Agreements in
accordance with the terms thereof. At the Closing, the Ancillary Agreements
executed and delivered by Parent or its applicable Subsidiary will be duly and
validly executed and delivered by Parent or its applicable Subsidiary, and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of the Ancillary
Agreements by Purchaser or its applicable Subsidiaries, will constitute,
valid, legal and binding agreements of Parent or its applicable
Subsidiary, enforceable against it in accordance with the terms thereof,
subject to the Enforceability Exceptions.

 

Section 3.4 _Consents and Approvals; No Violations_. Except as set forth
on _Section_ __ _ 3.4 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_, no filing with or
notice to, and no permit, authorization, registration, consent, waiver or
approval of, any Governmental Entity is required on the part of the Sellers
for the execution, delivery and performance by the Sellers of this Agreement
or by Parent or any Subsidiary thereof of the Ancillary Agreements to which it
is a party or the consummation by Parent or any Subsidiary (including any
Transferred Entity) thereof of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, except (a) compliance with any applicable requirements of the HSR Act
and any other applicable Competition Laws or (b) any such filings, notices,
permits, authorizations, registrations, consents or approvals, the failure to
make or obtain would not reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the
aggregate, materially adverse to the Business or the Transferred Entities,
taken as a whole, or have a Seller Material Adverse Effect.
Assuming compliance with the items described in clause (a) of the preceding
sentence, neither the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by
the

 



-22- 

    

 Sellers or the Ancillary Agreements by Parent or any applicable Subsidiary
(including the Transferred Entities) thereof, nor the consummation by the
Sellers or any Subsidiary thereof of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, will (i) conflict with or result in any breach, violation or
infringement of any provision of the respective articles of incorporation or
by-laws (or similar governing documents) of the Sellers or any Transferred
Entity, (ii) result in a breach, violation or infringement of, or constitute
(with or without due notice or lapse of time or both) a default (or give rise
to the creation of any Lien, except for Permitted Liens, or any right of
termination, amendment, cancellation or acceleration, whether after the filing
of notice or the lapse of time or both, of any right or obligation of any
Transferred Entity) under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any
Business Material Contract or (iii) violate or result in a breach of or
constitute a default under any Law or Permit applicable to any Transferred
Entity or any of their respective properties or assets, except, in the case
of clause (ii) or clause (iii), as would not reasonably be expected to be,
individually or in the aggregate, materially adverse to the Business or the
Transferred Entities, taken as a whole, or have a Seller Material
Adverse Effect.

Section 3.5 _Financial Statements; Liabilities_.

 

(a) _Section_ __ _ 3.5 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_ sets forth: (i)
the audited combined statements of operations, statements of comprehensive
(loss) income, cash flows and stockholders equity and net parent equity of
the Business for the period from March 22, 2017 to December 30, 2017, the year
ended December 29, 2018 and the predecessor period from January 1, 2017 to
March 21, 2017, and the audited combined balance sheets of the Business as of
December 30, 2017 and December 29, 2018, and (ii) the unaudited
combined interim statement of operations of the Business for the nine months
ended September 28, 2019, and the unaudited combined balance sheet of the
Business as of September 28, 2019 (together with any notes thereto, the "
_Business Financial Statements_ "). The Business Financial Statements (x)
were prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied throughout the
periods involved, except as otherwise noted therein or as set forth in 
_Section_ __ _ 3.5 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_, and (y) present
fairly, in all material respects, the combined financial position and the
combined results of operations of the Transferred Entities and the Business,
as of the respective dates thereof or the periods then ended, in each case
except as may be noted therein and, with respect to the unaudited financial
statements as of September 28, 2019, subject to normal and recurring year-end
adjustments none of which would be material, whether individually or in the
aggregate, and the absence of footnote disclosures, none of which if presented
would materially differ from those presented in the audited Business
Financial Statements; _provided_ , that the Business Financial Statements and
the foregoing representations and warranties are qualified by the fact that
(A) the Business has not operated on a separate standalone basis
and historically has not been separately reported within Parents combined
financial statements, (B) the Business Financial Statements assume certain
allocated charges which do not necessarily reflect amounts that would have
resulted from arms-length transactions or that the Business would incur on a
standalone basis, and (C) the Business Financial Statements are not
necessarily indicative of what the results of operations, financial position
and cash flows of the Business or the Transferred Entities will be in the
future.

 



-23- 

    

(b) There are no material Liabilities of the Business or the Transferred
Entities other than those that (i) are specifically reflected and reserved
against in the Business Financial Statements; (ii) have been incurred in the
ordinary course of business since September 28, 2019; (iii) have been
discharged or paid off in full; (iv) constitute Excluded Liabilities; or (v)
are disclosed in the Seller Disclosure Schedule.

 

(c) Parent, with respect to the Transferred Entities, maintains books and
records reflecting their assets and Liabilities that are accurate in all
material respects, and systems of internal accounting controls that are
designed to provide reasonable assurance in all material respects that: (i)
transactions are executed with managements general or specific
authorization; (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of their financial statements; and (iii) access to their assets is
permitted only in accordance with managements general or
specific authorization, it being understood that Parents policies and
procedures are designed and implemented giving effect to Parents entire
business and therefore levels of materiality and other determinations made
with respect to Parent may not be the same as if the Business were operated
on a standalone basis.

Section 3.6 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Except as
contemplated by this Agreement (a) since December 29, 2018, the Business has
been operated in the ordinary course consistent with past practice in all
material respects and no action has been taken or failed to be taken that, if
taken or failed to be taken after the date hereof without Purchasers consent,

are no conditions precedent to the obligations of the Equity Investor to
provide the Equity Financing or any contingencies that would permit the Equity
Investor to reduce the total amount of the Equity Financing. Purchaser does
not have any reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely
basis all terms and conditions to be satisfied by it in the Equity Commitment
Letters on or prior to the Closing Date, nor does Purchaser have knowledge
that any Equity Investor will not perform its obligations thereunder. There
are no side letters, understandings or other agreements, contracts or
arrangements of any kind relating to the Equity Commitment Letter that could
affect the availability, conditionality, enforceability or amount of the
Financing.

satisfy a condition by Purchaser or any other party thereto under the terms
and conditions of the Equity Commitment Letter. The Equity Commitment Letter
has not been modified, amended or altered and none of the respective
commitments thereunder has been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect, and,
to the knowledge of Purchaser, no withdrawal, modification, amendment,
alteration or rescission thereof is contemplated.

 

(f) In no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing

any of its affiliates or any other financing or other transactions be a
condition to any of Purchasers obligations under this Agreement.

assets of Purchaser and the Transferred Entities, on a consolidated basis, at
a fair valuation, will exceed its probable liabilities (including the probable
amount of all contingent liabilities) and indebtedness and (z) Purchaser and
the Transferred Entities, on a consolidated basis, will not have unreasonably
small capital to carry on its businesses as presently conducted or as proposed

consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither the
Sellers nor any of their Affiliates shall be required to provide access to or
disclose information if, upon the advice of counsel, such access or disclosure

any Governmental Entity necessary to be obtained at or prior to the Closing.

 

(b) Prior to the Closing, to the extent not prohibited by applicable Law,

matters relating to the completion of the Sale and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and work cooperatively in connection with

Confidentiality Agreement and _Section_ __ _ 5.2_, to the extent not
prohibited by applicable Law, each party shall promptly consult with the other
party to this Agreement to provide any necessary information with respect to
(and, in the case of correspondence, provide the other party (or their

the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement and _Section_ __ _ 5.2_, to the extent not

Sale or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and permit the
other party to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the

an appropriate response in compliance with such request. Neither Sellers nor
Purchaser shall participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity in
connection with this Agreement or the Sale, or with any other Person in
connection with any proceeding or Action by a private party relating to the
HSR Act or any other applicable Competition Laws or Required Approvals
in connection with this Agreement or the Sale, or make oral submissions at

 or other such Person. Purchaser and the Sellers may, as each deems advisable
and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material
provided to the other party under this Agreement as "outside
counsel/corporate in-house antitrust counsel only." Such designated materials
and any materials provided by Purchaser to the Sellers or by the Sellers to
Purchaser pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, and the information
contained therein, shall be given only to the outside legal counsel and
corporate in-house antitrust counsel of the recipient and shall not
be disclosed by such outside counsel and corporate in-house antitrust counsel
to employees (other than corporate in-house antitrust counsel), officers or
directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance
from the source of the materials (Purchaser or the Sellers, as the case may
be) or its legal counsel; it being understood that materials provided pursuant
to this Agreement may be redacted (i) to remove references concerning the
valuation of the Business, (ii) as necessary to comply with contractual
arrangements and (iii) as necessary to address reasonable privilege concerns.

 

(c) Purchaser and the Sellers shall file or cause to be filed, (i) the
required notifications under the HSR Act and with respect to the Required
Approval as promptly as practicable, but in any event no later than five (5)
Business Days after the date of this Agreement, and (ii) any other filings
and/or notifications required under any applicable Competition Laws, whether
in draft or final form, as promptly as practicable. In the event that the
parties receive a request for additional information or documentary materials
after an initial notification pursuant to the HSR Act or any other applicable
Competition Laws, the parties shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to comply with such requests, as applicable, as promptly as possible
and produce documents, responses to interrogatories, or other information on a
rolling basis, and counsel for both parties will closely cooperate during the
entirety of any such investigatory or review process.

 

(d) Purchaser and the Sellers shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Sale and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act and any other applicable
Competition Laws. In connection therewith, if any Action is instituted
(or threatened to be instituted) challenging the Sale or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as violative of the HSR Act or any
other applicable Competition Laws, Purchaser and the Sellers shall jointly (to
the extent practicable) use their reasonable best efforts to initiate and/or
participate in any proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, in order
to (i) oppose or defend against any Action by any Governmental Entity to
prevent or enjoin the consummation of the Sale or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and/or (ii) take such action as necessary to
overturn any regulatory Action by any Governmental Entity to block
consummation of the Sale or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including by defending any such Action brought by any Governmental
Entity in order to avoid the entry of, or to have vacated, overturned or
terminated, including by appeal if necessary, any Order that makes illegal or
prohibits the consummation of the Sale or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement resulting from any such Action.

 

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Purchaser shall
take all actions necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment
under the HSR Act or any other applicable Competition Laws so as to enable the
Closing to occur as promptly as practicable (and in any event no later than
the Outside Date), including (i) proposing, 

 



-48- 

    

 negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate
Order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of any businesses,
product lines or assets of the Transferred Entities, Purchaser, and their
respective Subsidiaries, and (ii) otherwise taking or committing to take
actions that after the Closing would limit Purchasers, the Transferred
Entities or their respective Subsidiaries freedom of action with respect to,
or its or their ability to retain, any businesses, product lines or assets of
the Transferred Entities, Purchaser, and their respective Subsidiaries. In
that regard Purchaser shall and, if requested by Purchaser, the Sellers shall
(but, subject to Purchasers obligations under this Agreement, including this
_Section_ __ _ 5.3_, if not so requested by Purchaser, the Sellers shall
not), agree to divest, sell, dispose of, hold separate, or otherwise take or
commit to take any action that limits its freedom of action with respect to,
or Purchasers or the Sellers respective Subsidiaries ability to retain, any
of the businesses, product lines or assets of the Transferred Entities,
Purchaser, or any of their respective Subsidiaries. All such efforts by
Purchaser shall be unconditional, and no actions taken pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 5.3(e)_ shall be considered for purposes of
determining whether a Business Material Adverse Effect has occurred or may
occur. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, neither the Purchasers
nor the Sellers shall be obligated to take or agree or commit to take any
action (A) that is not conditioned on the Closing or (B) that relates to the
Retained Businesses.

(f) Purchaser agrees to provide such security and assurances as to
financial capability, resources and creditworthiness as may be reasonably
requested by any Governmental Entity or other third party whose consent or
approval is sought in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.
Whether or not the Sale is consummated, Purchaser shall be responsible for all
fees and payments (including filing fees and legal, economist and other
professional fees) to any third party or any Governmental Entity in order
to obtain any consent, clearance, expiration or termination of a waiting
period, authorization, Order or approval pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
5.3_, other than the fees of and payments to the Sellers respective legal
and professional advisors.

Sellers and its Affiliates from the obligations of the Transferred Entities
arising after the Closing Date under the portion of the Commingled Contract
apportioned to the Transferred Entities. From and after the date hereof, the
Parties shall take actions reasonably necessary to allocate rights and
obligations under such Commingled Contracts in accordance with the foregoing.
To the extent that the Sellers and their Affiliates are unable to separate
any Commingled Contract that relates primarily to the Business prior to the
Closing, Sellers and their Affiliates shall use their reasonable best efforts
to assign such Commingled Contract and all of the rights and obligations under
such Comingled Contract to the Transferred Entities at and prior to the
Closing. If any Commingled Contract is not separated or assigned prior to the
Closing Date, then the Sellers, the Transferred Entities and the Purchaser
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to establish arrangements under
which the Transferred Entities shall continue to receive the benefits and
assume the obligations, in each case, that it received or assumed prior to the
Closing Date, until such Commingled Contract expires in accordance with its
terms. From and after the Closing, (y) Purchaser and its Affiliates shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers and its Affiliates for all Losses
arising from or relating to the portion of any Commingled
Contract apportioned to the Transferred Entities and (z) the Sellers shall
indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the
Transferred Entities) for all Losses arising from or relating to the portion
of any Commingled Contract apportioned to the Sellers and their Affiliates.
For the avoidance of doubt, no Commingled Contracts that relate to Overhead
and Shared Services shall be subject to the requirements of this _Section_ __
_ 5.5_ and Parent shall be under no obligation to separate or provide
replacement contracts for any such Contracts and, from and after Closing,
Purchaser and the Transferred Entities shall have no obligations under any
such Contract.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, including
_Section_ __ _ 5.3_, to the extent that transfers of Transferred Company
Permits issued by any Governmental Entity are required to be made to or from a
Transferred Entity in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the parties hereto shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to effect such transfers at or prior to the Closing.

 



-53- 

    

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, but subject
to compliance with the foregoing obligations in this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, the
failure to receive any such consents or to effect any such transfer or
arrangements shall not be taken into account with respect to whether
any condition to the Closing set forth in _Article_ __ _ VIII_ has been
obtained.

 

Section 5.6 _Public Announcements_. No party to this Agreement nor any
Affiliate or representative of such party shall issue or cause the
publication of any press release or public announcement in respect of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior
written consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), except (a) as may be required by Law or
stock exchange rules, in which case the party required to publish such press
release or public announcement shall use reasonable efforts to provide
the other party a reasonable opportunity to comment on such press release or
public announcement in advance of such publication or (b) to the extent the
contents of such release or announcement have previously been released
publicly by a party hereto or are consistent in all material respects with
materials or disclosures that have previously been released publicly without
violation of this _Section_ __ _ 5.6_. The parties hereto agree that the
initial press release to be issued with respect to the execution of this
Agreement shall be in the form heretofore agreed to by Parent and Purchaser.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each of Purchaser,
the Equity Investor and Clayton, Dubilier and Rice, LLC and its Affiliates and
managed funds may disclose any information with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to their respective representatives,
Affiliates, direct and indirect potential investors and financing sources (so
long as, in each case, such disclosure has a valid business purpose, is
subject to customary confidentiality restrictions and is effected in a manner
consistent with its customary practices).

 

Section 5.7 _Intercompany Accounts_ _; Cash_. At or prior to the Closing,
(a) all intercompany accounts between any member of the Parent Group, on the
one hand, and any Transferred Entity, on the other hand, shall be settled or
otherwise eliminated and (b) any and all cash or cash equivalents of the
Transferred Entities may be extracted from the Transferred Entities by the
Sellers, in the case of each of clauses (a) and (b), in such a manner as the
Sellers shall determine in its sole discretion, _provided_ that the Sellers
may not cause the Transferred Entities to make any such distribution if such
distribution, individually or in the aggregate with other distributions, would
or would reasonably be expected to violate any applicable Laws. For the
avoidance of doubt, intercompany accounts between and among any of the
Transferred Entities shall not be required to have been eliminated at the
Closing.

 

Section 5.8 _Termination of Intercompany Arrangements_. Effective at the
Closing, all arrangements, understandings or Contracts, including all
obligations to provide goods, services or other benefits, by any member of the
Parent Group other than a Transferred Entity, on the one hand, and any
Transferred Entity on the other hand, shall be terminated without any party
having any continuing obligations or Liability to the other, except for this
Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and any Commingled Contract (excluding,
for the avoidance of doubt, any Contracts related to Overhead and Shared
Services) to which both a member of the Parent Group and a Transferred Entity
are party.

Section 5.9 _Guarantees; Commitments_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing, Purchaser and the Transferred Entities,
jointly and severally, shall forever indemnify and hold harmless Parent and
any of its Affiliates against any Liabilities that Parent or any of its
Affiliates suffer, incur or are liable for by reason of or arising out of or
in consequence of (i) Parent or any of its Affiliates issuing, making payment
under, being required to pay or reimburse the issuer of, or being a party to
or maintaining, any guarantee, indemnity, surety bond, letter of credit,
letter of comfort, commitments or other similar obligation to the extent
relating to the Business or the Transferred Entities and listed on _Section_
__ _ 5.9(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_ or entered into after the date
hereof and before the Closing in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice (excluding any security provided by Parent or its
Affiliates under the Parent Group Policies) (collectively, but solely to the
extent related to the Business or the Transferred Entities, the " _Parent
Guarantees_ "), (ii) any claim or demand for payment made on Parent or any of
its Affiliates with respect to any of the Parent Guarantees or (iii) any
Action by any Person who is or claims to be entitled to the benefit of or
claims to be entitled to payment, reimbursement or indemnity with respect to
any Parent Guarantees, and shall reimburse Parent for any fees or expenses
incurred in connection with any of the foregoing clauses (i) through (iii).
Parent and its Affiliates shall not terminate any Parent Guarantees until the
earlier of (x) such time as they have been replaced by Purchaser in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 5.9(b)_ and (y) the date on which the underlying Contract
has been terminated. With respect to any Parent Guarantee, Parent and each of
its Affiliates is referred to as an "Indemnified Party" for purposes of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.9_.

 

(b) Without limiting _Section_ __ _ 5.9(a)_ in any respect, Purchaser
shall use its best efforts, at its sole expense, to cause itself or its
Affiliates to be substituted in all respects for the Indemnified Party and any
of its Affiliates, and for the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates to be
released, effective as of the Closing, in respect of, or otherwise terminate
(and in each case cause the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates to be
released in respect of), all obligations of the Indemnified Party and any of
its Affiliates under each Parent Guarantee listed on  _Section_ __ _ 5.9(b)
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_ (including, in each case, by delivering at
the Closing (i) executed agreements to assume reimbursement obligations for
such Parent Guarantees, (ii) executed instruments of guaranty, letters of
credit or other documents as reasonably requested by any banks, customers or
other counterparties with respect to such Parent Guarantees, and (iii) any
other documents reasonably requested by Parent in connection with such
Purchasers obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 5.9_). In furtherance and
not in limitation of the foregoing, at the request of an Indemnified Party, if
commercially reasonable, Purchaser shall and shall cause its Affiliates to
assign or cause to be assigned any Contract or lease underlying such Guarantee
to a Subsidiary of Purchaser meeting the applicable net worth and other
requirements in such Contract or lease to give effect to the provisions
of the preceding sentence. For any Parent Guarantees for which Purchaser or
any Transferred Entity, as applicable, is not substituted in all respects for
the Indemnified Party (or for which the Indemnified Party is not released)
effective as of the Closing and that cannot otherwise be terminated effective
as of the Closing (with the Indemnified Party to be released in respect
thereof), Purchaser shall continue to use its reasonable best efforts and
shall cause its Affiliates to use their best efforts to effect such
substitution or termination and release after the Closing. Without limiting
the foregoing, Purchaser shall not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates
to, extend or renew any Contract containing or underlying a Parent Guarantee
unless, prior to or concurrently with such extension

 



-55- 

    

 or renewal, Purchaser or the Transferred Entities are substituted in all
respects for the Indemnified Party, and the Indemnified Party is released, in
respect of all obligations of the Indemnified Party under such Parent
Guarantee.

Section 5.10 _Insurance_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_, from and
after the Closing, (i) the Transferred Entities shall cease to be insured by,
entitled to any benefits or coverage under, or entitled to seek benefits or
coverage from or under any insurance policies or self-insurance programs of
the Parent Group (collectively, the " _Parent Group Policies_ "), (ii) Parent
and its applicable Affiliates shall retain all rights to control such Parent
Group Policies, including the right to exhaust, settle, release, commute, buy
back or otherwise resolve disputes with respect to such Parent Group
Policies, regardless of whether such Parent Group Policies apply to any
Liabilities of the Transferred Entities ( _provided_ that Parent and its
applicable Affiliates shall not take any such action unless such action would
apply generally to coverage of claims of the Transferred Entities and claims
by the other members of the Parent Group) and (iii) neither Purchaser nor the
Transferred Entities shall have any access, right, title or interest to or in
any such Parent Group Policies. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Transferred
Entities may, in accordance with and subject to the provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.10_, make claims against Parents (x) occurrence-based
insurance policies, insurance programs or self-insured programs (including all
claims and rights to make claims and all rights to proceeds) covering acts,
omissions, events, circumstances, occurrences or Losses relating to the
Transferred Entities or the Business that occurred or existed prior to the
Closing and (y) claims-made policies solely with respect to claims relating to
the Transferred Entities or the Business that were made prior to the
Closing;  _provided_ , _however_ , that such claims by the Transferred
Entities shall only be permitted to the extent that such policies permit the
applicable claims and coverage is available under such policies; and,
_provided_ , _further_ , that Purchaser or the applicable Transferred Entity
shall notify Parent in writing of all such claims and shall exclusively bear
and shall (if applicable) promptly repay or reimburse Parent and its
Affiliates for any fees, costs or expenses (including any retro-premium
adjustments and any deductibles or self-insured retentions associated with any
claims under the insurance policies) incurred by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries as a result of any claim by or on behalf of the Transferred
Entities (including any unsuccessful claims). Parent shall submit invoices to
Purchaser for any amounts payable to the insurer in respect of such claims,
which Purchaser shall promptly (and in any event within ten (10)
calendar days) pay or reimburse to Parent.

(b) Parent will keep each of the workers compensation insurance policies
set forth on _Section_ __ _ 5.10(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_ ("
_Workers Compensation Policies_ "), or suitable replacements therefor, in full
force and effect through the Closing. Notwithstanding the last sentence of
_Section_ __ _ 5.10(a)_, with respect to claims relating to acts, omissions,
events or circumstances relating to Business Employees that occurred or
existed prior to the Closing that are covered by Workers
Compensation Policies (" _Pre-Closing WC Claims_"), Parent hereby authorizes
Purchaser to report Pre-Closing WC Claims directly to the provider of such
Workers Compensation Policies (the " _WC Insurer_ ") and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to assist Purchasers efforts to obtain the
benefit of such insurance coverage; _provided_ , that Purchaser shall keep
Parent reasonably informed and shall exclusively bear and shall promptly
repay or reimburse Parent and its Affiliates for the amount of each Pre-
Closing WC Claim (if

 



-56- 

    

 applicable) including any deductibles or self-insured retentions associated
with any claims under the Workers Compensation Policies and shall be liable
for and indemnify Parent and its Affiliates against all uninsured, uncovered,
unavailable or uncollectible amounts of such claims. Parent shall submit
invoices to Purchaser for any amounts payable to the WC Insurer in respect of
such claims, which Purchaser shall promptly (and in any event within ten (10)
calendar days) pay or reimburse to Parent.

(c) Parent and its applicable Affiliates shall not settle or adjudicate
any claim submitted by the Transferred Entities in accordance with _Sections
5.10(a)_ or _(b)_ without the prior written approval of Purchaser.

 

Section 5.11 _Litigation Support_. In the event and for so long as either
Parent or Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates is prosecuting,
contesting or defending any Action, investigation, charge, claim, or demand by
or against a third party or otherwise addressing, negotiating, disputing,
investigating, complying with, mitigating, discharging or otherwise
performing or managing any obligation, Liability or Loss (in each case, other
than any such matter between Parent or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand,
and Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, on the other) in connection with (a)
any transactions contemplated under this Agreement or (b) any fact, situation,
circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event,
incident, action, failure to act, or transaction relating to, in
connection with or arising from the Business or the Transferred Entities
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Excluded Liabilities), Parent or
Purchaser, as the case may be, shall, and shall cause their other Subsidiaries
(including the Transferred Entities) and Affiliates (and its and their
officers and employees, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its
and their other representatives) to, cooperate with Parent or Purchaser, as
the case may be, and their counsel in such prosecution, contest or defense,
including making available its personnel, participating in meetings, providing
such testimony and access to their books and records and taking such other
actions as shall be reasonably necessary in connection with such prosecution,
contest or defense, at the sole cost and expense of the prosecuting,
contesting or defending party.

 

Section 5.12 _Misallocated Assets and Misdirected Payments_.

 

(a) If, following the Closing, any right, property or asset that is part of
the Retained Businesses is found to have been transferred to or retained by
Purchaser, the Transferred Entities or their Affiliates in error, Purchaser
shall use reasonable best efforts to transfer, or cause its applicable
Affiliate to transfer, such right, property or asset to the applicable member
of the Parent Group as soon as practicable. If, following the Closing, any
right, property or asset that is part of the Business (excluding, for the
avoidance of doubt, any Excluded Asset) is found to have been transferred to
or retained by a member of the Parent Group in error, either directly or
indirectly, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to transfer, or cause the
applicable member of the Parent Group to transfer, such right, property or
asset to Purchaser or its applicable Affiliate as soon as practicable.

(b) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements, following the Closing, (i) if any payments due with
respect to the Business are paid to any member of the Parent Group, Parent
shall, or shall cause the applicable member of the Parent Group to, promptly
remit by wire or draft such payment to an account designated in

 



-57- 

    

 writing by Purchaser and (ii) if any payments due with respect to the
Retained Businesses are paid to Purchaser, the Transferred Entities or their
Affiliates, Purchaser shall transfer, or cause its Affiliates to, promptly
remit by wire or draft such payment to an account designated in writing by
Parent.

 

Section 5.13 _Use of Marks_.

 

(a) Except as expressly provided in this _Section_ __ _ 5.13_, neither
Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall use, or have or acquire the right
to use or any other rights in, any marks of Parent or any of its Affiliates,
including "Hologic" or "Science of Sure" or any variations or derivatives
thereof or any names, trademarks, service marks or logos of Parent or any of
its Affiliates, or any name, trademark, service mark or logo that, in the
reasonable judgment of Parent, is similar to any of the foregoing (the "
_Parent_ _Names_ ").

 

(b) The Transferred Entities may continue temporarily to use the Parent
Names following the Closing, in the manner in which such Parent Names were
used in the Business in the twelve (12) months prior to the Closing, so long
as Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates, to (i) promptly following
the Closing cease to hold itself and themselves out as having any affiliation
with Parent or any of its Affiliates and (ii) use commercially reasonable
efforts to minimize and eliminate use of the Parent Names by the Transferred
Entities. In any event, as soon as practicable after the Closing Date (and in
any event within one hundred eighty (180) days thereafter) Purchaser shall and
shall cause each of the Transferred Entities to (A) cease and discontinue use
of all Parent Names and (B) complete the removal of the Parent Names from all
products, signage, vehicles, properties, technical information, stationery and
promotional or other marketing materials and other assets; _provided_ that
nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 5.13_ shall preclude the Transferred Entities
from making, at any time, any reference to the Parent Names in internal or
archived historical, tax, employment or similar records or reasonably
necessary or appropriate to describe the historical relationship of the Parent
and its Affiliates with the Transferred Entities or as otherwise required by
applicable Laws.

(c) Parent, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, hereby agrees not to
(i) use, register, or attempt to register, any Marks that incorporate the word
"Cynosure" (the " _Cynosure Mark_ "); (ii) contest or deny the validity or
enforceability of the Cynosure Mark or Parents and its Affiliates (or their
(sub)licensees) ownership of, or interests or rights in, the Cynosure Mark;
or (iii) oppose, object to, or seek to cancel any registration for the
Cynosure Mark. 

(d) Parent and its Affiliates may continue temporarily to use the Cynosure
Mark following the Closing, in the manner in which such Cynosure Marks were
used by the Retained Businesses prior to Closing, so long as Parent shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates, to (i) promptly following the Closing, cease to
hold itself out as having any affiliation with Cynosure or any of its
Affiliates and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize and
eliminate use of the Cynosure Mark by members of the Parent Group as promptly
as practicable. In any event, as soon as practicable after the Closing Date
(and in any event within ninety (90) days thereafter) Parent shall and shall
cause each of its Affiliates to (A) cease and discontinue use of the Cynosure
Mark and (B) complete the removal of the Cynosure Mark from all
products, signage, vehicles, properties, technical information, stationery
and promotional or other marketing materials and other assets.

Section 5.14 _Shared Intellectual Property_. If, after the Closing, it is
discovered that Parent (or an Affiliate thereof) owned any Intellectual
Property (other than the Parent Names) at Closing that was used in the
Business prior to the Closing, Parent shall (or shall cause the applicable
Affiliate to), at the Transferred Entities request, grant to the Transferred
Entities a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free license to
continue using such Intellectual Property consistent with the use thereof in
the Business prior to the Closing. If, after the Closing, it is discovered
that the Transferred Entities owned any Intellectual Property (other than
Marks) at Closing that was used in the retained businesses of Parent or its
Affiliates prior to the Closing, the Transferred Entities shall, at Parents
request, grant to Parent and its Affiliates a non-exclusive, perpetual,
irrevocable, royalty-free license to continue using such Intellectual
Property consistent with the use thereof in such retained businesses prior to
the Closing.

 

Section 5.15 _Non-Solicitation_ _;  Non-Compete_.

(a) For a period of two (2) years from the Closing Date, none of Parent or
its Subsidiaries shall directly or indirectly solicit for employment (whether
as an employee, consultant or otherwise) or hire any Business Employee (other
than any administrative, clerical or similar staff); _provided_ , that the
foregoing shall not restrict (x) any general or public solicitations not
specifically targeted at employees of the Business (including searches by any
bona fide search firm that is not directed to solicit such employees) (but
shall restrict any hiring of any Business Employee in response thereto) or
(y) any solicitations, hiring or other actions with respect to any such Person
whose employment is terminated due to such Persons voluntary resignation or
is terminated by Purchaser or the Transferred Entities more than six (6)
months prior to the commencement of employment discussions between such Person
and Parent and its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that if a Business
Employee requests that Purchaser waive the restrictions set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 5.15(a)_ with respect to that Business Employee, Purchaser
shall consider such request in good faith.

 

(b) For a period of three (3) years from the Closing Date, Parent and its
Subsidiaries agree not to directly or indirectly engage in or own any
interest in any business that competes with the Business (a " _Competing
Business_ "); _provided_ , that nothing in this Agreement shall restrict
Parent or its Subsidiaries at any time from: 

(i) owning five percent (5%) or less of the outstanding stock or other
securities of any publicly traded Person or any fund in which Parent and its
Subsidiaries have no discretion with respect to the investment strategy of
such fund;

 

(ii) acquiring and, after such acquisition, owning any interest in a Person
that is engaged in a Competing Business and operating such Competing Business
if (A) such Competing Business generated twenty-five percent (25%) or less of
such Persons consolidated annual revenues in the last completed fiscal year
of such Person and (B) Parent or its applicable Subsidiary uses its
reasonable best efforts to enter into a binding agreement to divest the
Competing Business or otherwise cause the Competing Business to cease
operations within six (6) months after the consummation of such acquisition
and in any case within twelve (12) months after the consummation of such
acquisition (irrespective of whether or not the end of the three-year non-
competition period would occur within the twelve (12) months after the
consummation of such acquisition);

 



-59- 

    

(iii) complying with its express obligations under this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements; or

(iv) engaging in any of the activities set forth on  _Section_ __ _
5.15(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, this  _Section_ __ _ 5.15_ shall not restrain
or prohibit the consummation of any transaction or series of related
transactions that results in a Change of Control of Parent or a majority of
the assets of the Parent Group,  _provided_ that none of the assets of the
Parent Group as of immediately before such Change of Control shall be used in
connection with any Competing Business for the period contemplated by this
_Section_ __ _ 5.15_.

 

(c) Parent recognizes and affirms that in the event of breach by any Parent
or its Affiliates of any of the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.15_,
money damages would be inadequate and Purchaser would not have an adequate
remedy at law. Accordingly, Parent agrees that Purchaser shall have the right,
in addition to any other rights and remedies existing in its favor, to
enforce its rights and Parents obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 5.15_
not only by an action or actions for damages, but also by an action or actions
for specific performance, injunction and/or other equitable relief in order
to enforce or prevent any violations (whether anticipatory, continuing or
future) of the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.15_. Parent agrees that
Purchaser would not be required to post a bond in order for it to seek or
secure an injunction for Parents breach of this _Section_ __ _ 5.15_.

 

(d) If at any time any of the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.15_
shall be determined to be invalid or unenforceable by reason of being vague
or unreasonable as to duration, area or scope of activity, or otherwise, then
this _Section_ __ _ 5.15_ shall be considered divisible (with the other
provisions to remain in full force and effect) and the invalid or
unenforceable provisions shall become and be deemed to be immediately amended
to include only such time, area, scope of activity and other restrictions as
shall be determined to be reasonable and enforceable by the court or other
body having jurisdiction over the matter, and Parent and Purchaser expressly
agree that this Agreement, as so amended, shall be valid and binding as though
any invalid or unenforceable provision had not been included herein. Without
limiting the foregoing, if the length of the period of non-competition under
_Section_ __ _ 5.15(b)_ is determined to be unacceptable under applicable
Law, such period shall be modified as determined by a court or other agency
of competent jurisdiction or statute, as applicable, to be of the maximum
length permitted under applicable Law.

 

Section 5.16 _Financing_.

 

(a) Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
advisable or proper to cause the Equity Financing to be funded to Purchaser on
or prior to the Closing on the terms, and subject to the conditions, described
in the Equity Commitment Letter, including by (i) maintaining in effect the
Equity Commitment Letter, (ii) satisfying on a timely basis all conditions in
the Equity

 



-60- 

    

 Commitment Letter within its control and (iii) complying with its
obligations under and enforcing its rights under the Equity Commitment Letter
in a timely and diligent manner. Purchaser shall not, without the prior
written consent of Parent: (A) permit any amendment or modification to, or any
waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Equity Commitment Letter if such
amendment, modification or waiver (1) adds new (or adversely modifies any
existing) conditions to the consummation of all or any portion of the Equity
Financing, (2) reduces the amount of the Equity Financing, (3) adversely
affects the ability of Purchaser to enforce its rights against other parties
to the Equity Commitment Letter as so amended, modified or waived, relative to
the ability of Purchaser to enforce its rights against the other parties to
the Equity Commitment Letters as in effect on the date hereof or (4)
could otherwise reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or (B)
terminate the Equity Commitment Letter. Purchaser shall promptly deliver to
Parent copies of any such amendment, modification or waiver.

(b) _Cooperation_. Following the date of this Agreement and prior to
the Closing, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts, and shall cause
each of the Transferred Entities and any of its other Subsidiaries that holds
any portion of the Business to use their respective reasonable best efforts,
and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective
representatives to use their reasonable best efforts, in each case, to provide
Purchaser with all cooperation reasonably requested by Purchaser for the
arrangement, syndication, negotiation and execution of a senior secured
asset-based revolving credit facility (the " _Credit Facility_ ")
substantially consistent with the terms described in the Commitment Letter,
dated as of the date hereof (as in effect as of the date hereof, the " _Debt
Commitment Letter_ "), by and between Purchaser, UBS AG, Stanford Branch and
UBS Securities LLC, including using reasonable best efforts in:

 

(i) causing management of the Transferred Entities with appropriate
seniority and expertise to prepare for and participate in a reasonable number
of meetings at mutually agreed times and with reasonable advanced notice
(including providing reasonable cooperation with the due diligence efforts of
the lenders providing the Credit Facility (the " _Financing Sources_ ")), in
connection with arranging, syndicating, negotiating and entering into the
Credit Facility;

 

(ii) assisting Purchaser and the Financing Sources with the preparation of
a customary bank information memorandum and other customary marketing
materials in connection with the arrangement and syndication of the Credit

letter, authorizing the distribution of information relating to the
Transferred Entities and the Business and including representations with
respect to the absence of material non-public information in the public side
version of documents distributed to potential lenders and the absence of
material misstatements and omissions therein);

 

(iii) cooperating to facilitate the pledging of, granting of security
interests in and obtaining perfection of any liens on, collateral related to
the Business (including delivering original copies of all certificated
securities of the Transferred Entities (or affidavits of loss in respect
thereof) as may be reasonably requested by 

 



-61- 

    

 Purchaser and the Financing Sources and cooperating with Purchasers efforts
to obtain consents and landlord waivers), it being understood that no such
pledges, grants or perfection shall, and no such documents relating to the
foregoing shall take effect until the Closing;

 

(iv) furnishing Purchaser and the Financing Sources as promptly as
reasonably practicable with any amendments or restatements of the Business
Financial Statements (to the extent such amendments or restatements exist);

 

(v) furnishing, at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
Purchaser and the Financing Sources with all necessary documentation and
other information reasonably requested by the Financing Sources pursuant to
applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules

(including delivery of a certificate of the chief financial officer or
treasurer (or other comparable officer) of the Business certifying the
solvency, after giving effect to the transactions contemplated hereby, of the
Business on a consolidated basis, in substantially the form set forth as Annex
I to Exhibit C to the Debt Commitment Letter as in effect as of the date
hereof) and otherwise facilitating the pledging of collateral and release

each case, effective no earlier than the Closing; and

 

(vii) taking all actions reasonably necessary to ( _A_ ) permit the

(d) _Reimbursement_. Promptly upon request by Parent, the Purchaser shall
reimburse Parent for any reasonable, documented and invoiced out-of-pocket
costs and expenses incurred by Parent, the Transferred Entities, any

connection with the entry into the Credit Facility or (ii) the bad faith,
gross negligence, fraud or willful misconduct, or material breach of this
Agreement, by Parent, the Transferred Entities or any other Subsidiary of
Parent holding any portion of the Business or any of their respective
representatives).

 

(f) _Financing, generally_. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that the provisions contained in this Section 5.16,
represent the sole obligation of Parent, the Transferred Entities, any other
Subsidiary of Parent holding any portion of the Business or any of their
respective representatives with respect to cooperation in connection with the
arrangement of any debt financing to be obtained by Purchaser with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and no other provision of this
Agreement (including the Exhibits and Schedules hereto) shall be deemed to
expand or modify such obligations. In no event shall the receipt or
availability of any funds or debt financing (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, the Credit Facility) by Purchaser or any other debt financing be a
condition to any of Purchasers obligations under this Agreement.

Section 5.17 _Resignations_. Except as otherwise requested by Purchaser,
Parent shall deliver the resignations (effective as of the Closing) of the
directors, managers and officers of the Transferred Entities who will be
employees of the Parent Group after the Closing.

 

Section 5.18 _Separation and Migration._ As promptly as possible following
the date hereof, but not more than ten (10) Business Days after the date
hereof, Sellers and Purchaser shall each appoint such representatives as each
of them deems appropriate (a " _Joint Steering Committee_ " ), all of whom
will be subject to confidentiality and other restrictions necessary or
appropriate to ensure compliance with any applicable Laws. As soon as
practicable following the appointment of the Joint Steering Committee, it will
meet and confer to discuss and agree upon (i) the plan to separate the
Business from the other businesses of Sellers and the Parent

 



-64- 

    

 Group and to transfer the Business to Purchaser as of the Closing Date
pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements, and in a manner designed to minimize any adverse impact
of such separation on each partys businesses, which plan shall include
separation and migration of the Businesss IT assets from the IT systems of
Sellers and the Parent Group (other than the Transferred Subsidiaries) and
relevant data, preparing and reviewing communications to customers, vendors,
suppliers and employees to the extent related to the transactions contemplated
thereby, and discussing in good faith all technical and operational
matters (the " _Migration Plan_ " ), (ii) a plan to transfer to Purchaser and
the Transferred Entities knowledge with respect to the Business to permit
Purchaser to operate the Business as operated prior to the Closing Date
upon completion of the Migration Plan, (iii) a plan to transfer to the
recipient of any Services such knowledge with respect to the Services as is
reasonably necessary to permit such recipient to be able to provide to itself
or engage third parties to provide the Services following the termination of
expiration of such Services or either Transition Services Agreement (the plans
described in clauses (ii) and (iii), together, the " _Knowledge Transfer Plan_
") and (iv) the addition of any Omitted Services (as defined in the
Transition Services Agreement) identified as part of the plans developed in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 5.18_ to the services to be provided
pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement (the " _Services_ "). Sellers
shall bear all costs and expenses associated with the separation and migration
of the Businesss data which is held by a member of the Parent Group;
_provided_ that Sellers out-of-pocket costs and expenses shall not exceed
$250,000. The Migration Plan and the Knowledge Transfer Plan, when completed,
shall each take into account the goal of minimizing both the cost of the
migration and knowledge transfer and the disruption to the Business. Purchaser
and Sellers shall allocate sufficient personnel and other resources,
reasonably cooperate, and negotiate in good faith to permit the Joint
Steering Committee to carry out its responsibilities as set out in this
_Section_ __ _ 5.18_.

 

Section 5.19 _R andW Policy_. Purchaser agrees that, other than in the case
of fraud, the RandW Policy will expressly exclude any right of subrogation
against Sellers and their Affiliates. The subrogation provisions of the RandW
Policy may not be amended in any manner that is adverse to either Seller or
any of its Affiliates without Parents prior written consent (which consent
shall be in the sole and absolute discretion of Parent).

 

Section 5.20 _Specified Contract_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, Parent and Purchaser agree that (i) at any time prior to the
Closing, Parent may cause the Transferred Entities to enter into an amendment
to the Specified Contract solely to eliminate, modify or restructure any
Liabilities of the Transferred Entities in respect of the obligations in
Section 2.1 thereof, without the consent of the Purchaser, (ii) at any time
after Closing, if Parent requests that the Transferred Entities execute an
amendment to Section 2.1 of the Specified Contract solely to eliminate,
modify or restructure any Liabilities of the Transferred Entities in respect
of the obligations in Section 2.1 thereof, Purchaser shall cause the
Transferred Entities to, and the Transferred Entities shall, enter into such
amendment, (iii) the Transferred Entities shall not, and Purchaser shall not
permit the Transferred Entities to, amend Section 2.1 of the Specified
Contract in any manner after the Closing without the written consent of
Parent, (iv) Parent agrees that it shall make, or cause to be made, the
payments required by Section 2.1 of the Specified Contract (as it may be
amended in a manner permitted by this _Section_ __ _ 5.20)_ and (v) Purchaser
and the Transferred Entities shall be responsible for any liabilities arising
under any section of the Specified Contract, as it may be amended, except for
Section 2.1; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of each of clause (i)
and (ii) above, no such modification or restructuring shall increase the
Liabilities of the Transferred Entities.

 



-65- 

     

Section 5.21 _Pre-Closing __Redemption_. Prior to the Closing, Sellers
shall cause the Redemption to be effected. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, including anything to the contrary in this
_Article V_ , the Transferred Company shall be permitted to effect the
Redemption by way of a redemption of all or a portion of either or both of
the Sellers Units in the Transferred Company (but not all of the Units of
both Sellers). The Parties agree that, except as otherwise required by
applicable Law, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Redemption and the
sale of the Transferred Company shall be treated as a single integrated
transaction under by the principles of Zenz v. Quinlivan, 213 F.2d 914 (6th
Cir. 1954). The Parties agree to file all Tax Returns consistent with such
treatment set forth in the preceding sentence.

ARTICLE VI

 

EMPLOYEE MATTERS COVENANTS

 

Section 6.1 _Transfer of Business Employees_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall take all actions necessary to
cause the employment of all Business Employees (other than any Leased
Employees) employed by Parent or an Affiliate (other than a Transferred
Entity) to transfer to a Transferred Entity, in compliance with applicable
Law, such that, as of the Closing, all Business Employees (other than
any Leased Employees) shall be Transferred Entity Employees. As of the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause each of the Transferred Entities to
continue to employ on the Closing Date its respective Transferred Entity
Employees.

 

(b) As promptly as practicable following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
offer, or cause its applicable Affiliate to offer, employment to each Leased
Employee on the terms and conditions described in Section 6.2(a), with such
employment to take effect on the date that the ELA Term ends.

 

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, "Transferred Business Employee" shall
mean each Transferred Entity Employee and each Leased Employee who accepts
Purchasers offer of employment and commences employment with Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates.

 

(d) At least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Parent
shall have provided Purchaser a revised version of the Employee List that
reflects information that is current as of ten (10) or fewer Business Days
prior to the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may anonymize
or aggregate the foregoing data to the extent that Parent reasonably
determines is necessary to comply with any applicable Laws relating to data
privacy and/or Parents or the Transferred Entities internal employee data
privacy policies.

 

(e) If either Parent or Purchaser reasonably determines that an employee
lease arrangement with respect to Business Employees located in Canada
("Canadian Business Employees") is inadvisable for either such party from a
legal standpoint, then the Parent and

 



-66- 

    

 Purchaser shall cooperate to (1) revise the Employee Lease Agreement to
remove from the scope of that agreement the Canadian Business Employees, (2)
enter into a substitute arrangement prior to Closing that replicates as
nearly as possible the economics and substance of the treatment of Canadian
Business Employees under the Employee Lease Agreement and (3) amend this
Section 6.1 solely to the extent necessary to reflect the impact of any such
substitute arrangement on the transfer to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
of the Canadian Business Employees.

 

Section 6.2 _Terms and Conditions of Employment_.

 

(a) With respect to each Transferred Business Employee who is employed by
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities)
following the Closing, Purchaser shall provide or cause to be provided, for
the one-year period commencing on the Closing Date (the " _Continuation
Period_ ") or if shorter, the duration of such Transferred Business
Employees employment with Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the
Transferred Entities) after the Closing, (i) the same wage rate or cash salary
level in effect for such Transferred Business Employee immediately prior to
the Closing, (ii) the same target annual cash incentive compensation
opportunities in effect for such Transferred Business Employee immediately
prior to the Closing (excluding equity compensation, retention, change in
control or other non-recurring compensation) and (iii) employee benefits
(excluding equity compensation, retention, change in control or other non-
recurring compensation) that are substantially similar, in the aggregate, as
those in effect with respect to such Transferred Business Employee immediately
prior to the Closing (subject to the preceding exclusions). Additionally,
Purchaser agrees that each Transferred Business Employee shall, during the
Continuation Period, be provided with severance benefits that are
substantially no less favorable than the severance benefits provided by
the Transferred Entities or the Parent (or any applicable Affiliate thereof)
to such Transferred Business Employee immediately prior to the Closing to the
extent set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.2(a) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall not be prohibited
by this _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ from changing other terms and conditions of
employment, terminating the employment of any Transferred Business Employee,
or terminating or amending any Transferred Entity Benefit Plan in accordance
with its terms, following the Closing Date. Purchaser and its Affiliates
shall, in addition to meeting the applicable requirements of this _Article_ __
_ VI_, comply with any additional obligations or standards arising under
applicable Laws or Contracts governing the terms and conditions of employment
or termination of employment of the Transferred Business Employees.

 

(b) Parent and its Affiliates shall, reasonably in advance of the Closing
Date, take all commercially reasonable actions to ensure that the employment
of any Retained Parent Employees shall not be transferred to any Transferred
Entity, and to the extent any such individual is employed by a Transferred
Entity as of the date hereof, cause such Retained Parent Employees
employment to be transferred to Parent or its Affiliate (other than any
Transferred Entity) on or prior to the Closing at Parents sole expense.

 

Section 6.3 _Service Credit_. As of and after the Closing, Purchaser
shall, or shall cause the applicable Transferred Entity to, give each
Transferred Business Employee full credit for purposes of eligibility, vesting
and benefit accrual under (i) each employee benefit plan, policy or
arrangement, and (ii) any other service-based or seniority-based entitlement,
in each case maintained or made available for the benefit of Transferred
Business Employees as of and after

 



-67- 

    

 the Closing by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, for such Transferred
Business Employees service prior to the Closing with Parent and its
applicable Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities) and their
respective predecessors, to the same extent such service is recognized by
Parent and its applicable Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities)
under the analogous Parent Benefit Plans in which such Transferred
Business Employee participated immediately prior to the Closing; _provided_ ,
that such credit shall not be given (x) to the extent that it would result in
a duplication of benefits for the same period of service or (y) for purposes
of any defined benefit pension or retiree health coverage.

Section 6.4 _Health Coverages_. Purchaser shall cause each Transferred
Business Employee whose primary work location is in the United States (and his
or her eligible dependents) to be covered by a group health plan or plans that
(a) comply with the provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 6.2(a)_, and (b) do not
limit or exclude coverage on the basis of any pre-existing condition of such
Transferred Business Employee or dependent (other than any limitation already
in effect under the corresponding group health Parent Benefit Plan or
Transferred Entity Benefit Plan) or on the basis of any other exclusion or
waiting period not in effect under the applicable group health Parent Benefit
Plan or Transferred Entity Benefit Plan. To the extent that such plans are
Purchaser group health plans in which such Transferred Business Employee
becomes eligible to participate for the first time following the Closing,
Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Transferred
Entities to provide such Transferred Business Employee full credit, for the
first year of eligibility, for any deductible, co-payment or out-of-pocket
expenses already incurred by the Transferred Business Employee under the
applicable group health Parent Benefit Plan or Transferred Entity Benefit Plan
during such year for purposes of any deductible, co-payment or maximum out-
of-pocket expense provisions, as applicable, of such Purchaser group health
plans, in each case to the extent as would have been honored under the
analogous Parent Benefit Plan in which such Transferred Business Employee
participated immediately prior to the Closing.

 

Section 6.5 _Severance_ _Indemnity_.

 

(a) In the event that a Business Employee does not continue employment with
Purchaser or its Affiliates (including a Transferred Entity) at or after the
Closing as a result of Purchasers (or the Transferred Entities) failure to
continue employment or to make an offer of employment to the extent required
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ or _6.2(b)_ which results in any obligation,
contingent or otherwise, of Parent or its Affiliates (other than a Transferred
Entity) to pay any severance to such Business Employee under applicable Law
and any Benefit Plan set forth in Section 6.5 of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, reimburse and
otherwise hold harmless Parent and its Affiliates for all such severance.

 

(b) In the event that a Leased Employee does not commence employment with
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including a Transferred Entity) as of the
date that the ELA Term ends and Parent terminates the employment of such
Leased Employee within ninety days following the date that the ELA Term ends,
and such employment termination results in any obligation, contingent or
otherwise, of Parent or its Affiliates (other than a Transferred Entity) to
pay any severance to such Leased Employee under applicable Law and any Benefit
Plan set forth in Section 6.5 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,
Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, reimburse and otherwise
hold harmless Parent and its Affiliates for all such severance.

 



-68- 

    

Section 6.6 _Accrued Vacation, Sick Leave and Personal Time_. Purchaser
will recognize and assume all Liabilities with respect to accrued but unused
vacation time as of the Closing (including, without limitation, any
Liabilities to Transferred Business Employees for payments in respect of
earned but unused vacation time that arise as a result of the transfer of
employment contemplated by this _Article_ __ _ VI_) to the extent such
Liabilities are included in the Closing Working Capital. Subject to compliance
with applicable Law, for at least one year following the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall allow Transferred Business Employees to use the vacation, sick
leave and personal time recognized or established in accordance with the first
sentence of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ in accordance with the terms of the
Parent Group programs in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date (in
addition to, and not in lieu of, any vacation earned and accrued under the
applicable vacation plans or policies of Purchaser or its Affiliates for
services on or following the Closing).

Section 6.7 _Cash Incentive Compensation_. Prior to the Closing, Parent
shall (or shall cause the Transferred Entities) to pay and fully satisfy any
unpaid portion of any annual cash incentive compensation (including sales
commissions) (the " _Cash Incentive Compensation_ ") payable in respect of
any Company fiscal year that has been completed prior to the Closing, such
that from and after the Closing, neither Purchaser nor the Transferred
Entities shall have any Liability in respect thereof. All Cash Incentive
Compensation for any period after the Closing shall be governed by plans,
programs or arrangements maintained by Purchaser and its Affiliates (including
the Transferred Entities) in their discretion, subject to
Purchasers obligations under _Section_ __ _ 6.2(a)_.

Section 6.8 _Parent Benefit Plans; Transferred Entity Benefit Plans_.

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this _Article_ __ _
VI_, Purchaser shall not assume any obligations under, or Liabilities with
respect to, or receive any right or interest in any trusts relating to, any
assets of or any insurance, administration or other contracts, or related
obligations pertaining to, 

(i) any Retained Parent Employee or Parent Benefit Plan (including for the
avoidance of doubt (x) Parent equity awards thereunder and (y) the Parent
retention awards set forth on _Section_ __ _ 6.8(a)(i) __of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule_ ),

 

(ii) any ERISA Affiliate Liability,

 

(iii) any Liability in respect of deferred compensation entitlements with
respect to any Transferred Business Employees; and

(iv) any pension obligations, to the extent unfunded or
underfunded, arising prior to the Closing with respect to service prior to
the Closing.

 



-69- 

    

The items described in clauses (i) through (iv) shall be
Excluded Liabilities.

(b) As of the Closing, to the extent legally permissible, Parent (or its
Affiliate) shall assign, and the Transferred Entities shall assume and inure
to the benefit of, all confidentiality, non-competition, non-solicitation and
similar restrictive covenants between any Business Employee and Parent and
its Affiliates (other than the Transferred Entities).

Section 6.9 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Without limiting the
generality of _Section_ __ _ 11.5_, nothing in this Agreement is intended to
or shall (a) be treated as an amendment to, or be construed as amending, any
Parent Benefit Plan, Transferred Entity Benefit Plan or other benefit plan,
program or agreement sponsored, maintained or contributed to by Parent, any
Transferred Entity, the Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates, (b)
prevent Purchaser or its Affiliates from terminating any Transferred Entity
Benefit Plan or any other benefit plan in accordance with its terms, (c)
prevent Purchaser or its Affiliates, on or after the Closing Date, from
terminating the employment of any Business Employee, or (d) confer any rights
or remedies (including third-party beneficiary rights) on any current or
former director, employee, consultant or independent contractor of Parent, any
Transferred Entity, Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates or any
beneficiary or dependent thereof or any other Person.

except as otherwise required by applicable Law or a change in facts. 

(b) Each party to this Agreement shall, and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause its Affiliates to, provide to the other party to

them reasonably may request in (i) preparing or filing any Tax Return, amended
Tax Return or claim for refund, (ii) determining a Liability for Taxes, an
indemnity obligation under this Agreement or a right to refund of Taxes or
(iii) participating in any Tax Proceeding. Such cooperation and information
shall include providing necessary powers of attorney, copies of all relevant
portions of relevant Tax Returns, together with all relevant portions of
relevant accompanying schedules and relevant work papers, relevant documents
relating to rulings or other determinations by taxing authorities and relevant

shall Purchaser or any of its Affiliates be entitled to receive or view (i)
any Tax Return of Parent or any of its Affiliates (other than the Transferred
Entities) or (ii) any consolidated, affiliated, fiscal, loss sharing, combined

it relates to a Transferred Entity.

law for any Pre-Closing Period as a result of such Transferred Entity having
been a member of an affiliated, consolidated, unitary, combined or other

Taxes to the extent such Taxes were reflected as a reserve or Liability in
Working Capital or Indebtedness on the Final Closing Statement, (B) any Taxes
for which Purchaser is responsible pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)_ or (C)
that can be offset or reduced by the utilization of any net operating loss,
credit or similar Tax Asset of the Transferred Entities existing as of
immediately after Closing or could have been so offset or reduced but for

 



-71- 

    

 the utilization of such net operating loss, credit or similar Tax Asset to
set off or reduce Taxes of Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the
Transferred Entities) for which Parent is not responsible under this
_Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)_ (collectively, the " _Parent Indemnified Taxes_ ").

in _Section_ __ _ 7.2(a))_, or (ii) any Taxes arising in whole or in part
from or otherwise as a result of any action taken or transaction entered into
by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities)
after the Closing (outside of any action taken or transaction entered into by

Date, other than any action or transaction (A) initiated by any Seller or

Closing Separate Tax Return with respect to Taxes that are due (taking into

in clauses (i) through (iii) hereof shall be prepared in a manner consistent
with most recent past practices, elections and methods of the Transferred
Entities (or Parent or its relevant Affiliates, as applicable), except to the
extent otherwise required by applicable Law or a change in facts. Parent
shall provide Purchaser with the information relating to the Transferred
Entities that is included in any such Combined Tax Returns and provide
Purchaser with any supporting documents reasonably requested by Purchaser
for Purchasers review. Parent shall timely file or cause to be timely filed
any Combined Tax Return and any Pre-Closing Separate Tax Return that is
required to be filed on or before the Closing Date (taking into account any
extensions). With respect to all Income Tax Returns and other material Pre-
Closing Separate Tax Returns with respect to Taxes that are required to be

-72- 

    

 shall in good faith consider revising such Tax Returns to reflect any
reasonable comments received from Purchaser not later than ten (10) calendar
days prior to the due date therefor (taking into account any extensions) and
(C) such Tax Return shall be filed by Purchaser; _provided_ that such Tax
Return shall not be filed without the prior written consent of Parent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), and
which consent shall be deemed to have been provided in the event that
Purchaser files such Tax Return as prepared by Parent.

 

(b) In the case of Tax Returns with respect to the Transferred Entities for
a Straddle Period (other than any Combined Tax Return), Parent shall prepare
and timely file or cause to be prepared and timely filed all such Tax Returns
_provided_ that (i) such Tax Returns shall be prepared and timely filed in a
manner consistent with most recent past practices, elections and methods of
the Transferred Entities, except to the extent otherwise required by
applicable Law or a change in facts, (ii) Parent shall deliver any such Tax
Return to Purchaser for its review and comment at least twenty (20) calendar
days prior to the due date therefor, (iii) Parent shall in good faith consider

not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

 

(c) Except for any Tax Return that Parent has the right to prepare pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 7.3(a)_ and _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)_ (which shall include,
for the avoidance of doubt, all Combined Tax Returns and all Tax Returns with
respect to a Straddle Period), Purchaser shall prepare and timely file (or
cause to be prepared and timely filed) all Tax Returns required to be filed
by or with respect to the Transferred Entities and pay all Taxes due with

taxable year of the Transferred Entities as closing on the Closing Date as of
the end of the Closing Date.

Section 7.4 _A_ _mendment of Tax Returns; Similar Items_. Purchaser shall
not amend, or permit any of its Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities
after the Closing) to amend any Tax Return of the Transferred Entities, or
agree to any waiver or extension of the statute of limitations relating to
Taxes, with respect to the Transferred Entities for a taxable period ending on
or before the Closing Date or a Straddle Period that would give rise to a
claim for indemnification against Parent under this Agreement, in each case,
without the prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. Without the prior consent of Parent,
Purchaser shall not, and shall not permit its Affiliates (including the
Transferred Entities after the Closing) to take any action on or after the
Closing Date that would reasonably be expected to materially affect the Tax
liability of Parent or any of its Affiliates (including the Transferred
Entities, in the case of any Pre-Closing Period) for any Pre-Closing Period,
including the making of any Tax election, except as contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



-73- 

    

Section 7.5 _Allocation of Straddle Period Taxes_. For purposes of this
Agreement, in the case of any Straddle Period, all Property Taxes shall be
apportioned between the Pre-Closing Period and the Post-Closing Period based
on the number of days in such Straddle Period included in the Pre-Closing
Period and the number of days in such Straddle Period included in the Post-
Closing Period. All other Taxes shall be apportioned between the Pre-Closing
Period and the Post-Closing Period as though such taxable period terminated as
of the close of business on the Closing Date; _provided_ that exemptions,
allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (including
depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be allocated between the Pre-
Closing Period, on the one hand, and the Post-Closing Period, on the other
hand, in proportion to the number of days in such Straddle Period included in
the Pre-Closing Period and the number of days in such Straddle Period included
in the Post-Closing Period, unless otherwise required by Law. 

Section 7.6 _T_ _ax Audits_.

 

(a) If a party is responsible for, or would reasonably be expected to be
responsible for, the payment of or indemnification in respect of Taxes
pursuant to this _Article_ __ _ VII_ (the " _Tax Indemnifying Party_ "), and
the other party to this Agreement (the " _Tax Indemnified Party_ ") receives a
notice of a Tax Proceeding with respect to such Taxes, the Tax Indemnified
Party shall promptly (and in any event within ten (10) Business Days) notify
the Tax Indemnifying Party in writing of such Tax Proceeding. Such notice
shall specify in reasonable detail the basis for such Tax Proceeding and
shall include a copy of the relevant portion of any correspondence received
from the taxing authority.

 

(b) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 7.6(d)_, in the case of any Tax Proceeding
of or with respect to the Company for Taxes for any taxable period ending on
or before the Closing Date, Parent shall have the exclusive right to control,
at its own expense, such Tax Proceeding; _provided_ that if any such Tax
Proceeding could reasonably be expected to result in an increase in the Tax
liability of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Transferred
Entities) for any Post-Closing Period, (i) Parent shall keep Purchaser
informed in a timely manner of all actions proposed to be taken, (ii)
Purchaser shall be entitled to participate in such Tax Proceeding and attend
any meetings or conferences with the relevant Taxing Authority to the extent
that they relate to the Transferred Entities and (iii) Parent shall
not settle, compromise or abandon any such Tax Proceeding without obtaining
the prior written consent of Purchaser (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

(c) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 7.6(d)_, in the case of a Tax Proceeding (i)
of or with respect to the Transferred Entities for any Straddle Period or
(ii) involving both Taxes that are Parent Indemnified Taxes and Taxes that are
not Parent Indemnified Taxes (and such Tax Proceeding for Taxes that are
Parent Indemnified Taxes is not separable from such Tax Proceeding for Taxes
that are not Parent Indemnified Taxes), Purchaser shall have the right and
obligation to conduct, at its own expense, such Tax Proceeding; _provided_
that (A) Purchaser shall keep Parent reasonably informed of such Tax
Proceeding, (B) Purchaser shall consult with Parent before taking any
significant action in connection with such Tax Proceeding, (C) Purchaser shall
consult with Parent and offer Parent an opportunity to comment before
submitting any written materials prepared or furnished in connection with such
Tax Proceeding, (D) Purchaser shall defend such Tax Proceeding diligently and
in a commercially reasonable manner, (E) at its own expense, Parent shall be
entitled to participate in such Tax Proceeding and attend any meetings or
conferences with the relevant Taxing Authority and (F) Purchaser shall

 



-74- 

    

 not settle, compromise or abandon any such Tax Proceeding that could
reasonably result in an increase in the Tax liability to Parent without
obtaining the prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(d) In the case of any Tax Proceeding with respect to (i) any Tax Return
of Parent or any of its Affiliates (other than the Transferred Entities) or
(ii) any Tax return of a consolidated, combined or unitary group that includes
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including any Combined Tax Return), in
each case, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, including
_Section_ __ _ 7.6(c)_, such Tax Proceeding shall be subject to the
provisions of _Section_ __ _ 7.6(b)_ and the provisions of _Section_ __ _
7.6(b)(ii)_ shall not apply. The intention of this _Section_ __ _ 7.6(d)_ is,
and this Agreement shall be interpreted in a manner that effects the
intention, that Parent shall have the exclusive right to control, in all
respects, and neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall be entitled to
participate in (except as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.6(b)(i)_ and _(iii)_
), any Tax Proceeding described in the prior sentence..

Section 7.7 _T_ _ax Refunds and Credits_. Parent shall be entitled to
any refund or credit (net of reasonable and documented out-of-pocket third-
party expenses of Purchaser) of Taxes for which Parent is responsible under 
_Section_ __ _ 7.1_ (other than to the extent such Tax refund or credit
results from the carryback of a Tax attribute of any of the Transferred
Entities relating to a Post-Closing Period). Purchaser shall be entitled to
any refund or credit of Taxes of the Transferred Entities other than refunds
and credits to which Parent is entitled pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence. Any refunds or credits of Taxes of the Transferred Entities for any
Straddle Period shall be equitably apportioned between Parent and Purchaser
in accordance with the principles set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.5_. Except to
the extent Purchaser determines in good faith that any such request would be
unduly burdensome on Purchaser or its Affiliates, Purchaser shall, if Parent
reasonably requests and at Parents expense, file for and obtain or cause its
relevant Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities) to file for and
obtain any refunds or credits for which Parent is entitled pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 7.7_. Parent shall have the right to control the conduct of
any such claim, provided that Parent shall keep Purchaser informed in a timely
manner of all actions proposed to be taken and shall permit Purchaser to
participate and attend any meetings or conferences with the relevant taxing
authority. If Parent pays (or if the Transferred Entities pay prior to the
Closing) estimated Taxes for any Straddle Period in excess of the amount
ultimately determined to be due for the portion of such Straddle Period ending
on the Closing Date, and Purchaser or its Affiliates (including the
Transferred Entities) obtains the benefit of such excess payment, Purchaser
shall promptly refund such excess to Parent. Payments pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 7.7_ shall be made in immediately available funds within 15
days of the actual receipt or realization of the applicable refund or credit
(and shall include, for the avoidance of doubt, any interest paid thereon,
but shall be net of any reasonable and documented out-of-pocket third-party
expenses of Purchaser and Taxes to the Party receiving such refund or credit
in respect of the receipt or accrual of such refund or credit).

 

Section 7.8 _Tax Sharing Agreements_ _; Powers of Attorney_. On or before
the Closing Date, the rights and obligations of the Transferred Entities
pursuant to all Tax sharing agreements or arrangements (whether written or
otherwise and other than this Agreement), if any, to which any of the
Transferred Entities, on the one hand, and any member of the Parent Group, on
the other hand, are parties, shall terminate, and neither any member of the
Parent Group, on the one hand, nor any of the Transferred Entities, on the
other hand, shall have any

 



-75- 

    

 rights or obligations to each other after the Closing in respect of such
agreements or arrangements. Sellers shall cause any and all existing powers of
attorney with respect to Taxes or Tax Returns to which any of the Transferred
Entities is a party to be terminated as of the Closing.

 

Section 7.9 _Tax Treatment of Payments_. Except to the extent otherwise
required by applicable Law, Parent, Purchaser, the Transferred Entities and
their respective Affiliates shall treat any and all payments under this
_Article_ __ _ VII_, _Section_ __ _ 2.7_, _Section_ __ _ 6.2(b)_, 
_Section_ __ _ 6.5_ and _Article_ __ _ X_ as an adjustment to the purchase
price for Tax purposes.

 

Section 7.10 _Certain Tax Elections_. Except as requested by Parent,
Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the
Transferred Entities) not to, (a) make any election under Sections 338 or
336(e) of the Code (or any comparable election under state, local or non-U.S.
Law) with respect to the acquisition of any Transferred Entity, (b) make any
election with respect to any Transferred Entity (including any entity
classification election pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 301.7701-3),
which election would be effective on or prior to the Closing Date, (c) take
any action or enter into any transaction after the Closing on the Closing Date
that is outside the ordinary course of business with respect to the
Transferred Entities and their Subsidiaries, (d) amend or revoke any Tax
Return related in whole or in part to any Pre-Closing Period or (e) fail
to file, or cause to be filed, any amended Tax Return related in whole or in
part to any Pre-Closing Period, in each case, without Parents prior written
consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). Parent shall make or cause to be made (and shall refrain from making
or causing to be made, as applicable) Tax elections (including on a protective
basis) so that none of the Transferred Entities shall suffer any reduction in
Tax basis or other attributes pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-36; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent
shall not be required to make or cause to be made (and shall not be required
to refrain from making or causing to be made, as applicable) Tax elections
(including on a protective basis) pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-36 to the extent that Parent reasonably determines in good faith that
the Target Companies that are incorporated in the United States (or are
otherwise treated as U.S. persons for U.S. federal income tax purposes)
should, after the making (or failure to make) such elections pursuant to
Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-36, have a "net inside attribute amount"
(as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-36(c)(5)) at least equal to
the basis that Purchaser takes in the Units in the Transferred Company
acquired pursuant to this Agreement, as determined for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. 

Section 7.11 _Transfer Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, Purchaser shall pay, when due, and be responsible for, any
sales, use, transfer, real property transfer, registration, documentary,
stamp, value added or similar Taxes and related fees and costs imposed on or
payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement ("
_Transfer Taxes_ "). The party responsible under applicable Law for filing the
Tax Returns with respect to any such Transfer Taxes shall prepare and timely
file such Tax Returns and promptly provide a copy of such Tax Return to the
other party. Parent and Purchaser shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to, cooperate to timely prepare and file any Tax Returns or other
filings relating to such Transfer Taxes, including any claim for exemption or
exclusion from the application or imposition of any Transfer Taxes; _provided_
, that, notwithstanding any of the foregoing, neither Parent nor any of its
Affiliates shall be required to 

 



-76- 

    

 file any claim for exemption or exclusion from the application or imposition
of any Transfer Taxes, or any claim for any reduction thereof, if Parent
determines in good faith that the filing of such claim or any related action
would have an adverse effect on Parent or any of its Affiliates.

 

Section 7.12 _Tax Matters Coordination; Survival_ _; Limitation_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
indemnification with respect to Taxes and the procedures relating thereto
shall be governed exclusively by this _Article_ __ _ VII_, _Section_ __ _
10.6_, _Section_ __ _ 10.7_ and _Section_ __ _ 10.8_ and the provisions of 
_Article_ __ _ X_ (other than _Section_ __ _ 10.6_, _Section_ __ _ 10.7_
and _Section_ __ _ 10.8_) shall not apply. The indemnification obligations
contained in this  _Article_ __ _ VII_ shall survive the Closing Date until
the expiration of the applicable statutory periods of limitations. The
representations and warranties made pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.13_ (Taxes)
shall not survive the Closing.

(b) The cumulative indemnification obligation of Parent under this 
_Article_ __ _ VII_ and _Article_ __ _ XI_ shall in no event exceed, in the
aggregate, the Final Purchase Price. The cumulative indemnification of
Purchaser under this _Article_ __ _ VII_ and  _Article_ __ _ X_ shall in no

Closing, other than in connection with any fraud, Purchaser (on behalf of the
Purchaser Parties) hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any
and all rights, claims and causes of action against, and shall have no
recourse of any kind to, the Seller Parties under any theory of law or equity,
including under any control person liability theory, for any action
or inaction of any of the Transferred Entities or the Business, or their
respective Affiliates, officers, directors, equityholders, managers,
employees, agents, or representatives, in each case prior to the Closing.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 10.1(b)_,
nothing in the foregoing provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 10.1(b)_ shall
limit or modify the indemnification obligations of Parent set forth in this 
_Article_ __ _ X_.

Section 10.2 _Indemnification by the_ _Parent_. Subject to the provisions
of this _Article_ __ _ X_ and except with respect to indemnification for
Taxes (which shall be governed exclusively by _Article_ __ _ VII)_, effective
as of and after the Closing, Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Purchaser Parties, from and against any and all Losses incurred or suffered by
any of the Purchaser Parties, to the extent arising out of, relating to or
resulting from (a) any breach of any covenant or agreement of the Sellers
contained in this Agreement that are to be performed at or after the Closing;
(b) any of the matters set forth on _Section_ __ _ 10.2(b) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule_; (c) any Excluded Liabilities (including any failure to
satisfy the Excluded Liabilities when due); (d) the Retained Businesses; or
(e) the matters described on _Section_ __ _ 10.2(e) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule_.

 

Section 10.3 _Indemnification by Purchaser_. Subject to the provisions of
this  _Article_ __ _ X_ and except with respect to indemnification for Taxes
(which shall be governed exclusively by _Article_ __ _ VII_), effective as of
and after the Closing, Purchaser and the Transferred Entities shall indemnify
and hold harmless the Seller Parties from and against any and all Losses
actually incurred or suffered by any of the Seller Parties, to the extent
arising out of or resulting from (a) any breach of any covenant or agreement
of Purchaser contained in this Agreement to be performed at or after the
Closing; (b) the operations of the Transferred Entities and the Business,
whether any such Liability arises before or after the Closing, other than any
Loss subject to indemnification pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.2_; or (c)
without duplication of any Liability described in the foregoing clause (b),
the failure to pay any Liability when due to the extent reflected in, reserved
for or taken into account in the determination of Working Capital or
Indebtedness on the Final Closing Statement.

 

Section 10.4 _Indemnification Procedures_.

 

(a) A Person that may be entitled to be indemnified under this Agreement
(the " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall promptly notify the party liable for such
indemnification (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing of any pending or
threatened claim or demand asserted, or any other matter or circumstance that
arises, that has given or could reasonably be expected to give rise to a
right of indemnification under this Agreement (including a pending or
threatened claim or demand asserted by a third party against the Indemnified
Party, such claim being a " _Third Party Claim_ "); _provided_ , that the
failure to provide such notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party from
any of its obligations under this _Article_ __ _ X_ except to the extent the
Indemnifying Party 

 



-81- 

    

 is prejudiced by such failure, it being agreed that any such notice must
describe in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances with respect to the
subject matter of such claim, demand, matter or circumstance, the provisions
of this Agreement pursuant to which indemnification may be sought and an
estimate of the Indemnified Partys Losses and must be delivered prior to the
expiration of any applicable survival period specified in  _Section_ __ _
10.1_ for such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, as applicable.

 

(b) Upon receipt of a notice of a Third Party Claim for indemnity from an
Indemnified Party pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 10.2_ or _Section_ __ _
10.3_, the Indemnifying Party will be entitled, by notice to the Indemnified
Party delivered within twenty (20) Business Days of the receipt of notice of
such Third Party Claim or such shorter period as set forth in the notice of a
Third Party Claim as may be required by court proceeding in the event of a
litigated matter, to assume the defense and control of such Third Party Claim
(at the expense of such Indemnifying Party). If the Indemnifying Party does
not assume the defense and control of any Third Party Claim pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 10.4(b)_, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to assume
and control such defense (it being understood that the Indemnified Partys
right to indemnification for a Third Party Claim shall not be adversely
affected by assuming the defense of such Third Party Claim), but the
Indemnifying Party may nonetheless participate in the defense of such Third
Party Claim with its own counsel and at its own expense. If the Indemnifying
Party assumes the defense and control of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying
Party shall be entitled to select counsel, contractors and consultants at its
expense and shall be responsible (with no reservation of any rights) for all
Losses and Liability relating to such Third Party Claim or the defense
thereof, it being understood that, to the greatest extent possible, the
Indemnifying Party shall satisfy and pay any such Losses and Liabilities
(including defense and settlement costs) directly to the applicable third
party or parties, without requiring the Indemnified Party to make any payment
in respect thereof. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third
Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party agrees to keep the Indemnified Party
informed regarding the defense or settlement of such Third-Party Claim and to
consider in good faith any suggestions made by the Indemnified Party
regarding the defense or settlement of such Third Party Claim. The Indemnified
Party may participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim with its own
counsel and at its own expense. Purchaser or Parent, as the case may
be, shall, and shall cause each of their Affiliates and representatives to,
reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in the defense of any Third
Party Claim, including by furnishing books and records, personnel and
witnesses, as appropriate for any defense of such Third Party Claim. If the
Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense and control of a Third Party Claim,
it shall be authorized to consent to a settlement of, or the entry of any
judgment arising from, any Third Party Claim, in its sole discretion and
without the consent of any Indemnified Party; _provided_ , that such
settlement or judgment does not involve finding or admission of any violation
of Law or admission of any wrongdoing by any Indemnified Party or impose any
obligation on the Indemnified Party other than the payment of money damages
and the Indemnifying Party shall pay or cause to be paid all amounts in such
settlement or judgment (net of any Tax Benefits described in  _Section_ __ _
10.6_). No Indemnified Party will consent to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any settlement or compromise with respect to a Third Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall, subject to the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party, not to be unreasonably withheld, retain
control of the defense of any Third Party Claim if such Third Party Claim
solely seeks non-monetary, equitable or injunctive relief against the
Indemnified Party.

 



-82- 

    

 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section_ __ _ 10.4(a)_ or the
other provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 10.4(b)_, in respect of the matters
set forth on _Section_ __ _ 10.2 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_, the
Purchaser Parties shall not be required to give any notice of Third Party
Claim with respect to any such matter and Parent shall be deemed to have given
notice assuming the defense and control of each such matter in accordance
with the first sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 10.4(b)_.

 

(c) If the Indemnified Party receives any payment from an Indemnifying
Party in respect of any Losses pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 10.2_ or
_Section_ __ _ 10.3_ and the Indemnified Party has a basis to seek recovery
of all or a part of such Losses from a third party (a " _Potential
Contributor_ ") based on facts, events and circumstances giving rise to the
right of indemnification, the Indemnified Party shall assign its rights to
proceed against the Potential Contributor as necessary to permit the
Indemnifying Party to recover from the Potential Contributor the amount of
such payment or, where such assignment is not permitted, use commercially
reasonable efforts to recover in respect of such claim on behalf of the
Indemnifying Party.

 

Section 10.5 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except with respect to (a) the matters
covered by Sections _2.5_  through _2.7_ , and _Section_ __ _ 5.9_, (b) any
matter relating to Taxes (which shall be governed exclusively by _Article_ __
_ VII_), (c) the parties right to seek and obtain any equitable relief
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 11.11_ and (d) fraud, Purchaser and the Sellers
acknowledge and agree that, following the Closing, the indemnification
provisions of _Section_ __ _ 10.2_ or _10.3_ shall be the sole and exclusive
remedies of the Sellers and Purchaser for any Liabilities or Losses (including
any Liabilities or Losses from claims for breach of contract, tortious conduct
(including negligence) or otherwise and whether predicated on common law,
statute, strict liability, or otherwise) that each party may at any time
suffer or incur, or become subject to, as a result of, or in connection with
the Sale or the other transactions contemplated hereby, including any failure
by any party to perform or comply with any covenant or agreement that, by its
terms, was to have been performed, or complied with, under this Agreement (but
excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the Ancillary Agreements and the
Confidentiality Agreement). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Purchaser hereby irrevocably waives any right of rescission it may otherwise
have or to which it may become entitled. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees
that it is relying exclusively on, and its sole recourse for any actual
alleged breach of any representation or warranty will be, the RandW Policy
(other than with respect to fraud).

 

Section 10.6 _Additional Indemnification Provisions_. With respect to each
indemnification obligation contained in this Agreement, all Losses shall be
reduced by (a) any net Tax Benefit actually realized by the Indemnified Party
or its Affiliates in connection with the incurrence of such Loss with respect
to Tax Returns for the year such Losses were incurred (determined on a "with
and without" basis), net of costs reasonably incurred by the Indemnified Party
in connection therewith and (b) the amount of any third-party insurance, or
other indemnity or reimbursement proceeds that have been recovered by the
Indemnified Party in connection with the facts giving rise to the right of
indemnification (it being agreed that if such proceeds in respect of such
facts are recovered by the Indemnified Party subsequent to the Indemnifying
Partys making of an indemnification payment in satisfaction of its applicable
indemnification obligation, such proceeds shall be promptly remitted to the
Indemnifying Party to the extent such reduction of the Losses would
have reduced the Indemnifying Partys indemnification

 



-83- 

    

 obligations) net of the cost of recovery (including any increased premiums).
Upon making any payment to the Indemnified Party for any indemnification claim
pursuant to this  _Article_ __ _ X_, the Indemnifying Party shall be
subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to any rights which the Indemnified
Party may have against any third parties with respect to the subject matter
underlying such indemnification claim, and the Indemnified Party shall assign
any such rights to the Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement, in no event shall any Indemnified Party be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this  _Article_ __ _ X_ to the extent any Losses
were attributable to such Indemnified Partys own fraud.

 

Section 10.7 _Limitation of Liability_. In no event shall any Indemnifying
Party have Liability to any Indemnified Party for, and Losses shall not be
deemed to include, any punitive or similar damages or any damages that are not
reasonably foreseeable, except for any such damages to the extent actually
awarded and paid to a third party. Neither the Purchaser Parties, on the one
hand, nor the Seller Parties, on the other hand, shall be entitled to recover
more than once in respect of any Loss.

 

Section 10.8 _Mitigation_. Each of the parties agrees to use, and to cause
its Affiliates to use, its reasonable best efforts to mitigate its respective
Losses upon and after becoming aware of any event or condition that would
reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses that are indemnifiable
hereunder.

material or would reasonably be expected to have a Business Material Adverse
Effect or Purchaser Material Adverse Effect, and no party shall use the fact
of the setting of such amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any such item
in the Seller Disclosure Schedule or Purchaser Disclosure Schedule in any
dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation, item
or matter not described in this Agreement or included in the Seller Disclosure
Schedule or Purchaser Disclosure Schedule is or is not material or would
reasonably be expected to have a Business Material Adverse Effect or Purchaser
Material Adverse Effect for purposes of this Agreement.

this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements; (ix) references to any statute
shall be deemed to refer to such statute as amended through the date hereof
and to any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder as amended through the

value of such negative number and the subtraction of a negative number shall
mean the addition of the absolute value of such negative number. If the
Closing shall occur, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, any payment obligation of Purchaser hereunder shall be a joint and
several obligation of Purchaser and the Transferred Entities. In the event of
any conflict or inconsistency between the terms of this Agreement and any
Ancillary Agreement, this Agreement will control. Net Indebtedness and Working
Capital shall be determined after giving effect to the

Section 11.8 _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the parties to this Agreement and their
respective successors and assigns; _provided_ , that no party to this
Agreement may directly or indirectly assign any or all of its rights or
delegate any or all of its obligations under this Agreement without the
express prior written consent of each other party to this Agreement, except
that (a) each of the Sellers may transfer or assign, in whole or from time to
time in part, their rights under this Agreement to any of their Affiliates,
but any such transfer or assignment will not relieve such Seller of any of
its obligations hereunder, (b) each of the parties may make any pledge or
collateral assignment of this Agreement or any of their rights hereunder to
any of their collateral agents, administrative agents and/or lenders and (c)
Purchaser may transfer or assign, in whole or from time to time in part, to
one or more of its direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries, its rights
under this Agreement, but any such transfer or assignment will not relieve
Purchaser of any of its obligations hereunder.

 

Section 11.9 _Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement may not be modified
or amended except by an instrument or instruments in writing signed by the
party against whom enforcement of any such modification or amendment is
sought. Any party to this Agreement may, only by an instrument in writing,
waive compliance by the other party to this Agreement with any term or
provision of this Agreement on the part of such other party to this Agreement
to be performed or complied with. The waiver by any party to this Agreement of
a breach of any term or provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as
a waiver of any subsequent breach. No failure or delay by any party in
exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege.

 



-88- 

    

Section 11.10 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the
terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain
in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party hereto. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that
the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

Section 11.11 _Specific Performance_.

(a) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage, for which monetary
damages (even if available) would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in
the event that the parties hereto do not perform any provision of this
Agreement in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such
provisions. Accordingly, the parties acknowledge and agree that the parties
shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable
relief to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled in Law or in equity. Each of the
parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief on the basis that any other party has
an adequate remedy at Law or that any award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or in equity. Any party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required
to provide any bond or other security in connection with such order or
injunction. The parties acknowledge and agree that the Sellers are entitled to
seek specific performance under this Agreement and under the Equity
Commitment Letter to cause the Equity Investor to fund the Purchase Price. If,
prior to the Outside Date, any party brings any Action in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 11.3_ to enforce specifically the performance of the terms
and provisions hereof by any other party, the Outside Date shall automatically
be extended by (x) the amount of time during which such Action is pending,
plus twenty (20) Business Days or (y) such other time period established by
the court presiding over such Action.

Section 11.12 _Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representation; Nonassertion
of Attorney-Client Privilege_.

(a) Purchaser waives and will not assert, and agrees to cause its
Subsidiaries, including the Transferred Entities, to waive and not to assert,
any conflict of interest arising out of or relating to the representation,
after the Closing (the " _Post-Closing Representation_ "), of Parent, any of
its Affiliates or any shareholder, officer, employee or director of Parent or
any of its Affiliates (any such Person, a " _Designated Person_ ") in any
matter involving this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or any other
agreements or transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, by any legal
counsel currently representing Parent or any of its Affiliates in connection

 



-89- 

    

 with this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or any other agreements or
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen
and Katz and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP (the " _Current
Representation_ ").

(b) Purchaser waives and will not assert, and agrees to cause its
Subsidiaries, including the Transferred Entities, to waive and not to assert,
any attorney-client or other applicable legal privilege or protection with
respect to any communication between any legal counsel and any Designated
Person occurring during the Current Representation in connection with any
Post-Closing Representation, including in connection with a dispute with
Purchaser or its Subsidiaries, and following the Closing, with any Transferred
Entity (including in respect of any claim for indemnification by Purchaser),
it being the intention of the parties hereto that all such rights to such
attorney-client and other applicable legal privilege or protection and to
control such attorney-client and other applicable legal privilege or
protection shall be retained by Parent and that Parent, and not Purchaser, its
Subsidiaries or the Transferred Entities, shall have the sole right to decide
whether or not to waive any attorney-client or other applicable legal
privilege or protection. Accordingly, from and after Closing, none of
Purchaser, its Subsidiaries or the Transferred Entities shall have any access
to any such communications or to the files of the Current Representation, all
of which shall be and remain the property of Parent and not of Purchaser, its
Subsidiaries or the Transferred Entities, or to internal counsel relating to
such engagement, and none of Purchaser, its Subsidiaries, the Transferred
Entities or any Person acting or purporting to act on their behalf shall seek
