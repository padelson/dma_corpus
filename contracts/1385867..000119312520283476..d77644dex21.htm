AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION

 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION (the "Agreement") is made
and entered into as of November 2, 2020 by and among Coupa Software
Incorporated, a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), Lloyd Merger Sub, Inc., a
Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger
Sub I"), Lloyd Merger Sub, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a
direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub II" and, together with
Merger Sub I, the "Merger Subs"), Laurel Parent Holdings, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the "Company"), and TPG VII Laurel Holdings, L.P. as stockholder
representative (the "Stockholder Representative"). All capitalized terms that
are used but not defined herein shall have the respective meanings ascribed
thereto in Annex A.

W I T N E S S E T H:

 

WHEREAS, the boards of directors or managers (as applicable) of each of
Parent, the Merger Subs and the Company have determined that it would be
advisable and in the best interests of each corporation or limited liability
company (as applicable) and their respective stockholders or members (as
applicable) that Parent acquire the Company through the statutory merger of
Merger Sub I with and into the Company (the "First Merger"), and, as part of
the same overall transaction, the Surviving Corporation in the First Merger
would merge with and into Merger Sub II (the "Second Merger", and
together with the First Merger, the "Mergers"), pursuant to which Merger Sub
II would become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, in each case upon the
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the
applicable provisions of Delaware Law, and in furtherance thereof, have
approved this Agreement, the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the Related Agreements (the "Transactions").

 

WHEREAS, concurrent with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a
material inducement to Parent to enter into this Agreement: each Key Employee
is accepting an offer letter from Parent (collectively, the "Key Employee
Offer Letters") and is entering into a Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation
Agreement with Parent, substantially in the form attached hereto as  _Exhibit
C_, all of which Key Employee Offer Letters and Non-Competition and Non-
Solicitation Agreements will be effective at and as of the First Effective
Time.

 

WHEREAS, concurrent with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as
a condition and inducement to Parents and the Merger Subs willingness to
enter into this Agreement, the Persons listed on Schedule A have entered into
that certain Vesting Agreement with the Company and Parent, in a form mutual
agreed upon, effective at and as of immediately prior to the First Effective
Time.

WHEREAS, the Company has solicited the requisite approval of Stockholders in
accordance with the terms of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code so as to
render the adverse tax consequences imposed under the provisions of Sections
280G and 4999 of the Code inapplicable to any and all accelerated vesting,
payments, benefits, options, and/or stock that might otherwise result from
the Mergers or the other Transactions and were subject to the requisite
waivers (the "280G Stockholder Vote"), and, prior to the initiation of the
280G Stockholder Vote, the Company obtained a parachute payment waiver
agreement from each "disqualified individual" (within the meaning of Section
280G(c) of the Code), who might otherwise have, received or had the right or
entitlement to receive any payments or benefits from the Mergers or the other
Transactions that would be subject to treatment as parachute payments within
the meaning of Section 280G of the Code.

   

WHEREAS, Parent, the Merger Subs and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements, as more fully set
forth herein, in connection with the Mergers and the other Transactions.

WHEREAS, it is intended that for U.S. federal income Tax purposes, the
Mergers contemplated herein shall qualified as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code (as hereinafter defined).

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements, covenants and other

4

    

(b) _Company Capital Stock_.

 

(i) _Generally_. At the First Effective Time, by virtue of the First Merger
and without further action on the part of Parent, Merger Subs, the Company or
the respective stockholders or members, as applicable, thereof each share of
Company Capital Stock (excluding (A) Cancelled Shares, which shall be treated
in the manner set forth in Section 1.6(b)(iii), and (B) Dissenting Shares,
which shall be treated in the manner set forth in Section 1.6(b)(iv)) issued
and outstanding as of immediately prior to the First Effective Time shall be
cancelled, extinguished and converted automatically into the right to
receive, upon the terms set forth in this Section 1.6 and throughout this
Agreement (including Section 1.9 and the indemnification and escrow provisions
of this Agreement), and subject to the provisions of Section 1.6(e) and
Section 1.8(b) and the valid surrender of the certificate representing such
shares of Company Capital Stock in the manner provided in Section 1.8: (X) if
the former holder of such share of Company Capital Stock is an Unaccredited
Investor, the Unaccredited Investor Per Share Cash Amount and the applicable
portion of any Deferred Amounts pursuant to Section 1.6(f), and (Y) if the
former holder of such share of Company Capital Stock is an Accredited
Investor, (I) the Per Share Stock Consideration, (II) the Accredited Investor
Per Share Cash Amount, (III) cash for any fractional interests pursuant to
Section 1.6(b)(ii), and (IV) the applicable portion of any Deferred Amounts
pursuant to Section 1.6(f).

(ii) _Fractional Interests_. For purposes of calculating the aggregate amount
of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to any each Equityholder pursuant to
Section 1.6(b)(i), Section 1.6(c)(i), and Section 1.6(d), (x) all shares of
Company Capital Stock, Company RSUs or Company Options held by each such
Equityholder shall be aggregated and (y) the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock to be issued each Equityholder in exchange for such Company Capital
Stock, Company RSUs and Company Options held by such Equityholder shall be
rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock. No
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will be issued by virtue of the
First Merger. Any Equityholder who would otherwise be entitled to receive a
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock, shall receive an amount of cash
equal to the product obtained by _multiplying_ (A) such fraction _by_ (B) the
Parent Trading Price, rounded down to the nearest whole cent.

(iii) _Cancelled Shares_. At the First Effective Time, by virtue of the First
Merger and without further action on the part of Parent, Merger Subs, the
Company or the respective stockholders or members, as applicable, thereof,
each share of Company Capital Stock that is issued and outstanding and held by
the Company or Parent as of immediately prior to the First Effective Time
("Cancelled Shares") shall be cancelled without any consideration paid
therefor.

 



5

    

(iv) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provisions of
this Agreement to the contrary, any shares of Company Capital Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time and which are held
by Stockholders who shall have, in all respects, properly exercised and
perfected a demand for and are entitled to appraisal for such shares in
accordance with Section 262 of Delaware Law and shall not have effectively
withdrawn or lost such Persons rights to such appraisal and payment under
Delaware Law with respect to such shares (collectively, the "Dissenting
Shares"), shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive the
applicable consideration for Company Capital Stock set forth in Section
1.6(b)(i) but the holder thereof shall only be entitled to such rights as are
provided by Delaware Law. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section
1.6(b)(iv), if any holder of Dissenting Shares shall effectively withdraw or
lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) such holders appraisal rights
under Delaware Law, then, as of the later of the First Effective Time and the
occurrence of such event, such holders shares shall automatically be
converted into and represent only the right to receive, upon surrender of the
certificate representing such shares, upon the terms set forth in this Section
1.6 and throughout this Agreement (including the indemnification and escrow
provisions of this Agreement), the consideration for Company Capital Stock
set forth in Section 1.6(b)(i), without interest thereon. The Company shall
give (A) Parent prompt notice of any written demand for appraisal received by
the Company pursuant to the applicable provisions of Delaware Law and (B) the
opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to any such demands or offer to settle
or settle any such demands. Any communication to be made by the Company to any
Stockholder with respect to such demands shall be submitted to Parent in
advance and shall not be presented to any Stockholder prior to the Company
receiving Parents written consent.

(c) _Company Options_.

 

(i) _Vested, In-the-Money Company Options_. Prior to the Closing, the Company
shall take all necessary action so that each Vested Company Option that is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the First Effective Time shall be
cancelled and extinguished at the First Effective Time without any further
action on the part of Parent, Merger Subs or the Company, and (contingent
upon such former holder of such Company Option executing and delivering an
Option Cancellation Agreement, in substantially the form attached as _Exhibit
G_ hereto (an "Option Cancellation Agreement"), to the Company as a condition
to payment) the former holder of such Vested Company Option shall be entitled
to receive (without interest and subject to applicable Tax withholding
pursuant to Section 1.10) for each such Vested Company Option: (A) if
the former holder of such Vested Company Option is an Unaccredited Investor,
the Unaccredited Investor Option Payment Cash Amount and the applicable
portion of any Deferred Amounts pursuant to Section 1.6(f), and (B) if the
former holder of such Vested Company Option is an Accredited Investor, (I)
the Accredited Investor Option Payment Stock Consideration, (II) the
Accredited Investor Option Payment Cash Amount, and (III) cash for any
fractional interests pursuant to Section 1.6(b)(ii). The cash portion of the
Option Payment Amount (if any) payable under this Section 1.6(c)(i) to each
former holder of a Vested Company Option that was outstanding immediately
prior to the First Effective Time shall be paid through the Companys payroll
to such former holder in connection with the Closing, net of any applicable
withholding Taxes pursuant to Section 1.10, which deduction from the cash
portion of the Option Payment Amount shall reflect any withholding Taxes that
may be applicable to the entire Option Payment Amount.

(ii) _Vested Company Options Not In-the-Money; Unvested Company Options_.
Prior to the Closing, the Company shall take all necessary action so that
each Company Option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the First
Effective Time and that either (A) is vested and has an exercise price equal
to or greater than the Per Share Merger Consideration Amount ( _i.e._ , a
Company Option that is not an In-the-Money Company Option) or (B) is unvested
(whether or not it is an In-the-Money Company Option) in each case of (A) or
(B) shall be cancelled at the First Effective Time for no consideration and
shall thereafter be of no further force and effect.

(d) _Company RSUs_. Each Company RSU outstanding as of immediately prior to
the First Effective Time with respect to which the service-based vesting
requirement has been satisfied shall be cancelled, extinguished and converted
automatically into the right to receive (without interest and subject to any
applicable Tax withholding pursuant to Section 1.10): (i) if the former holder
of such Company RSU is an Unaccredited Investor, the Unaccredited Investor Per
Share Cash Amount and the applicable portion of any Deferred Amounts pursuant
to Section 1.6(f), and (ii) if the former holder of such Company RSU is an
Accredited Investor, (A) the Per Share Stock Consideration, (B) the Accredited
Investor Per Share Cash Amount and (C) cash for any fractional interests

prior to the First Effective Time with respect to which the service-based
vesting requirement has not been satisfied shall be cancelled at the First
Effective Time for no consideration and shall thereafter be of no further
force and effect.

(e)  _Securities Law Compliance_. Prior to the date hereof, the Company
delivered documentation with respect to each Equityholder to allow Parent to
determine whether such Equityholder is an Accredited Investor or otherwise
deemed to be an "Unaccredited Investor" for purposes of this Agreement. Any
Equityholder may, in the reasonable, good faith discretion of Parent, be
deemed an "Unaccredited Investor" or not an Unaccredited Investor for purposes
of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, Parent shall be entitled in its reasonable, good faith discretion
to not issue any shares of Parent Common Stock to which an Unaccredited
Investor would otherwise be entitled under this Agreement, and in lieu
thereof to deliver or cause to be delivered an amount in cash to such
Unaccredited Investor equal to the number of such shares of Parent Common
Stock that such Unaccredited Investor would otherwise be entitled to under
this Agreement multiplied by the Parent Trading Price.

(f) _Deferred Payments_. At the First Effective Time, each Stockholder shall
be deemed to have contributed such Stockholders Per Holder Escrow
Contribution to the Indemnity Escrow Fund, Adjustment Escrow Fund and
Stockholder Representative Expense Fund, as applicable, and such
Stockholders Per Holder Escrow Contribution shall reduce the cash payments
otherwise payable to such Stockholder in connection with Section 1.6(b)(i). In
addition to any cash payments to which a Stockholder may be entitled to at the
First Effective Time pursuant to Section 1.6(b)(i), Section 1.6(c)(i), and
Section 1.6(d), each Stockholder shall be entitled to its Pro Rata Portion of
any Excess Amount pursuant to Section 1.9(d), any Remaining Indemnity Escrow
Amount pursuant to Section 1.8(b), any Remaining Adjustment Escrow Amount
pursuant to Section 1.9(e), and any portion of the Stockholder Representative
Expense Fund released by the Stockholder Representative pursuant to Section
7.6 (such amounts, collectively, the "Deferred Amounts"), in each case, as and
when payable.

_1.7 _Effect of the Second Merger on Capital Stock of Constituent Entities__.
At the Second Effective Time, by virtue of the Second Merger and without any
action on the part of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, Merger Sub II, the
Company or the respective stockholders or member as applicable, thereof, (a)
each share of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Second Effective Time shall, by virtue of
the Second Merger and without further action on the part of the sole
stockholder of the Surviving Corporation, be cancelled and extinguished for
no consideration (b) each membership interest of Merger Sub II that is issued

such Indemnifying Party on the Closing Date under Section 1.6(b). To the

case of Stockholders who have completed and delivered Exchange Documents to

 following the Closing, Parent shall cause its transfer agent to issue to
such Stockholder who is an Accredited Investor the portion of the Total Stock
Consideration issuable in respect thereto pursuant to Section 1.6(b)(i) and
the Spreadsheet, and (iii) the Company Stock Certificate, if applicable, so
surrendered shall be marked as "cancelled". Until so surrendered, each Company
Stock Certificate outstanding after the First Effective Time will be deemed,
for all corporate purposes thereafter, to evidence only the right to receive
that portion of the Total Merger Consideration (without interest) issuable in
exchange for the Company Capital Stock represented by such Company Stock
Certificate. No portion of the Total Merger Consideration will be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate with respect to shares
of Company Capital Stock formerly represented thereby until the holder of
record of such Company Stock Certificate shall surrender such Company Stock
Certificate and validly executed Exchange Documents pursuant hereto. For all
purposes of this Agreement and for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in
accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.358-2(a)(2)(ii), each
Stockholder shall be treated as having surrendered shares of Company Capital
Stock, in the order set forth in the Letter of Transmittal, in exchange for
the cash consideration payable to such Stockholder, and the portion of such
shares treated as exchanged for such cash consideration shall be equal to the
product of (x) the total number of shares of Company Capital Stock to be
surrendered by such Stockholder, multiplied by (y) the percentage of the
total value of the aggregate consideration payable to such Stockholder in
cash.

(d) _Issuance of Parent Common Stock to Holders Company Options and Company
RSUs_. On the Closing Date, Parent shall cause its transfer agent to issue to
each former holder of Vested Company Options and Company RSUs who is an
Accredited Investor such holders portion of the Total Stock Consideration
issuable in respect thereto pursuant to Section 1.6(c)(i), Section 1.6(d) and
the Spreadsheet.

 

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Company Stock
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent or
Parent shall pay and/or issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate, the portion of the Total Merger Consideration, if any, payable
and/or issuable in respect thereto pursuant to Sections 1.6(b) upon the
making of a customary affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof; _provided_
, _however_ , that if the aggregate value of Company Stock Certificates being
claimed by a Stockholder as lost, stolen or destroyed exceeds $500,000,
Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance
thereof, require the Stockholder who is the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed certificates to either (i) deliver a bond in such amount as it
may reasonably direct (not to exceed the value of such Company Stock
Certificates) or (ii) provide a customary indemnification agreement in form
and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent against any claim that may be
made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving LLC or the
Paying Agent with respect to the certificates alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed.

 

(f) _Transfers of Ownership_. If any cash payments are to be made or any
shares of Parent Common Stock are to be issued pursuant to Section 1.6 and
this Section 1.8 to a Person other than the Person whose name is reflected on
the Company Stock Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor, it will be a
condition of the issuance or delivery thereof that the certificate so
surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for
transfer and that the person requesting such exchange will have paid to Parent
or any agent designated by it any transfer or other Taxes required by reason
of the payment of any portion of the Total Merger Consideration in any name
other than that of the registered holder of the certificate surrendered, or
established to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it that
such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 



10

    

(g) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock_. The amounts paid
in respect of the surrender for exchange of shares of Company Capital Stock in
accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to be in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Capital Stock, and there shall
be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving
Corporation or the Surviving LLC of shares of Company Capital Stock which were
outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time or Second Effective
Time. If, after the First Effective Time, Company Stock Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation or Surviving LLC for any reason, they
shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article I.

 

(h) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, none of Parent, Merger Subs, the Paying Agent, the Surviving
Corporation, the Surviving LLC, the Stockholder Representative or any party
hereto shall be liable to a Stockholder for any amount paid to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Legal Requirement.

_1.9 _Closing Date Adjustment_. _

 

(a) The Company has delivered to Parent a statement (the "Estimated Closing
Statement") setting forth the Companys good faith estimate of (A) the
Adjustment Amount (the "Estimated Adjustment Amount"), (B) Closing Cash (the
"Estimated Closing Cash"), (C) Closing Indebtedness (the "Estimated
Closing Indebtedness"), (D) Third Party Expenses (the "Estimated Third Party
Expenses"), and (E) Net Working Capital (the "Estimated Net Working Capital").
The Estimated Closing Statement shall have been prepared in accordance with
the definitions provided in this Agreement.

(b) Parent, the Company and the Stockholder Representative acknowledge and
agree that the Adjustment Amount may not be known as of the Closing Date and
that the Estimated Adjustment Amount determined on the Closing Date may need
to be adjusted subsequent to the Closing Date on the basis set forth
herein. Accordingly, as soon as reasonably practicable, but not later than 90
days after the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare in good faith and deliver to
the Stockholder Representative (i) Parents determination of the Closing Cash,
Closing Indebtedness, Third Party Expenses and Net Working Capital, and (ii)
a statement setting forth Parents resulting calculation of the Adjustment
Amount (the "Parent Closing Statement"). Such estimates shall have been
based on the Companys books and records and have been prepared in accordance
with the Accounting Principles and the definitions provided in this Agreement.
The Parent Closing Statement shall include a reconciliation of such amounts
with the amounts set forth in the Estimated Closing Statement and shall set
forth in reasonable detail (and be accompanied by reasonable supporting
documentation) the basis for any discrepancy or disagreement.

 



11

    

(c) The Stockholder Representative and Parent will have the right to review
all records, work papers and calculations, and shall have access to such
personnel and advisors of the Surviving LLC and Parent on reasonable advance
notice and during regular working hours, that are reasonably necessary for the
purpose of reviewing the Estimated Closing Statement, the Parent Closing
Statement; _provided_ that Parent will be entitled to withhold portions of any
such books, records, documents or other information or access from the
Stockholder Representative the provision of which would, or would reasonably
be likely to, (i) cause the attorney-client privilege thereof to be waived,
(ii) result in the breach of any confidentiality agreement to which Parent or
any of its Affiliates are bound, or (iii) unreasonably interfere with the
operation of Parent, the Surviving LLC or their respective businesses. The
Stockholder Representative will have 30 days after Parent delivers the Parent
Closing Statement in which to notify Parent in writing (such notice, a
"Closing Statement Dispute Notice") of any discrepancy in, or disagreement
with, any calculations supporting, or any items reflected on, the Parent
Closing Statement (and specifying the amount in dispute and setting forth in
reasonable detail the basis for such discrepancy or disagreement), and Parent
and the Stockholder Representative shall negotiate in good faith to resolve
such disputed items and, upon mutual agreement by Parent and the
Stockholder Representative in writing, an appropriate adjustment will be made
thereto. If the Stockholder Representative does not deliver a Closing
Statement Dispute Notice to Parent during such 30 day period, the Parent
Closing Statement will be deemed to be accepted in the form presented to the
Stockholder Representative. If the Stockholder Representative timely delivers
a Closing Statement Dispute Notice and Parent and the Stockholder
Representative do not resolve, within 15 days after timely delivery of the
Closing Statement Dispute Notice, any discrepancy or disagreement therein, the
discrepancy or disagreement may be submitted by either party for review and
final determination by the Designated Accounting Firm. The review by the
Designated Accounting Firm will be limited to the discrepancies and
disagreements set forth in the Closing Statement Dispute Notice, and the
resolution of such discrepancies and disagreements and the determination of
Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness, Third Party Expenses and the Net Working
Capital and the resulting calculation of the Adjustment Amount by the
Designated Accounting Firm must be (A) in writing, (B) made in accordance with
the Accounting Principles, (C) with respect to any specific discrepancy or
disagreement, no greater than the higher amount calculated by Parent or the
Stockholder Representative, as the case may be, and no lower than the lower
amount calculated by Parent or the Stockholder Representative as the case may
be, (D) made as promptly as practical after the submission of such
discrepancies and disagreements to the Designated Accounting Firm (but in no
event later than 30 days after the date of submission), and (E) final and
binding upon, and non-appealable by, the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns for all purposes hereof, and not subject to collateral
attack for any reason absent manifest error or fraud. The parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that the Federal Rules of Evidence Rule 408 shall apply
to Parent, the Surviving LLC and the Stockholder Representative during such
thirty (30)-day period of negotiations and any subsequent dispute arising
therefrom. The fees, costs and expenses of retaining the Designated
Accounting Firm will be allocated between (x) the Stockholders and (y) Parent
in inverse proportion as they may prevail on matters resolved by the
Designated Accounting Firm, which proportion will be based on the
amounts proposed by the Stockholder Representative and Parent. Following the
resolution of all objections of the Stockholder Representative regarding the
manner in which any item or items are treated on the Parent Closing Statement,
by mutual agreement or as determined by the Designated Accounting Firm,
Parent will prepare the final statement reflecting such agreement or
determination of the Adjustment Amount, including the Closing Cash, Closing
Indebtedness, Third Party Expenses and Net Working Capital and will deliver
copies thereof to the Stockholder Representative and such final statement will
be the "Final Closing Statement," and, for the avoidance of doubt, the final
Adjustment Amount set forth in the Final Closing Statement will be the
"Adjustment Amount."

 



12

    

(d) If the Adjustment Amount exceeds the Estimated Adjustment Amount used for
the calculation of the Estimated Merger Consideration on the Closing Date
(such excess amount, the "Excess Amount"), then, within five (5) Business Days
of the final determination of the Adjustment Amount, Parent shall deposit the
Excess Amount, and Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall issue
joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to release the Adjustment
Escrow Fund, in each case in accordance with the Spreadsheet, to the Paying
Agent for further distribution to the Stockholders and to the Surviving LLC
(or Parent, if the Surviving LLC no longer exists or does not have a payroll
system at the time of payment) for further distribution to holders of Vested
Company Options and holders of Company RSUs through the Surviving LLCs
payroll system (or Parents payroll system, as applicable), less any
applicable income and employment withholding Taxes.

 

(e) If the Adjustment Amount is less than the Estimated Adjustment Amount used
for the calculation of the Estimated Merger Consideration on the Closing Date
(such deficit amount, the "Shortfall Amount"), then Parent and the Stockholder
Representative shall issue joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to
release the lesser of such Shortfall Amount and the balance of the Adjustment
Escrow Fund from the Adjustment Escrow Fund to Parent, and to release any
remaining balance, if any, of the Adjustment Escrow Fund (such amount, the
"Remaining Adjustment Escrow Amount") to the Paying Agent for
further distribution to the Stockholders in accordance with the Spreadsheet;
_provided, however_ , to the extent the Adjustment Escrow Fund is insufficient
to satisfy the Shortfall Amount, in such joint written instructions, Parent
and the Stockholder Representative shall direct the Escrow Agent to release
the balance of the Shortfall Amount from the Indemnity Escrow Fund to Parent.
For the avoidance of doubt, recovery from the Escrow Funds shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy available to Parent, the Surviving LLC and any of their
respective Affiliates with respect to any Shortfall Amount.

___1.10  _Withholding__ __. The Company, the Paying Agent, Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and the Surviving LLC, shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold, or cause to be deducted and withheld, from any consideration payable
or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are
required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under any provision of Tax law
or under any Legal Requirements or applicable Orders, and to be provided any
necessary Tax forms, including a valid IRS Form W-9; _provided, however_ ,
that, except with respect to any deductions or withholdings with respect to
payments to Employees, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (a)
notify any Person receiving any payment subject to deduction or withholding
under this Section 1.10 in writing, prior to deducting or withholding any
amounts or permitting any such deduction or withholding, that such deduction
or withholding is required and (b) cooperate and cause its Affiliates to
cooperate with the Stockholder Representative in order to permit such amounts
to be paid without deduction or withholding or at a reduced rate of deduction
and withholding. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld and
duly paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person to which such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

 



13

    

___1.11_ _ _Tax Consequences__ __ __. The Mergers are intended to be treated
as integrated steps in a single transaction and together to qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and this
Agreement is intended to constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the
meaning of Treasury Regulations Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, none of Parent or any of its Affiliates makes any representations
or warranties to the Company or to any securityholder of the Company regarding
the Tax treatment of the Mergers, or any of the Tax consequences to the
Company or any securityholder of the Company of this Agreement, the Mergers or
any of the other transactions or agreements contemplated hereby, and the
Company acknowledges that the Company and the securityholders of the Company
are relying solely on their own Tax advisors in connection with this
Agreement, the Mergers and the other transactions and agreements contemplated
hereby.

___1.12_ _ __ _Registration Rights_ ___ __ _._ In consideration for the
cancellation of Company Capital Stock, Company Options and Company RSUs, each
Equityholder shall be an express third party beneficiary and shall have the
right to enforce Parents obligations to the Equityholders under that certain
Registration Rights Agreement in substantially the form attached as _Exhibit
H_ , executed by Parent, the Key Equityholders (as defined therein) and the
Stockholder Representative (on behalf of the Equityholders) and effective as
of the First Effective Time.

___1.13 _Taking of Further Action__ __. If at any time after the First
Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement, to vest the Surviving LLC with full right, title
and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company or to vest Parent with full right, title and
possession to all of the Company Capital Stock, then each of the Company,
Parent and the officers and directors of each of the Company and Parent are
fully authorized in the name of their respective corporations or otherwise to
take, and will take, all such lawful and necessary action.

of each representation and warranty set forth in this Article II, or (ii) any
other section, subsection or subclause of the Disclosure Schedule solely if
and to the extent that it is readily apparent on the face of such disclosure

knowledge of the matters addressed thereby, as of the date hereof (except to
the extent such representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier
date), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Subs as
follows:

 



14

    

_2.1 _Organization and Good Standing_._

 

(a) The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Company has the
requisite corporate power to own, lease and operate its assets and properties
and to carry on its business as currently conducted and as currently
contemplated to be conducted, except where the failure to have such power
would not be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
The Company is duly qualified or licensed to do business and in good standing
as a foreign corporation in Michigan and each other jurisdiction in which the
character or location of its assets or properties (whether owned, leased or
licensed) or the nature of its business make such qualification or license
necessary to the Companys business as currently conducted, except where the
failure to be so qualified or licensed would not be material to the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. There are no material outstanding
powers of attorney executed by or on behalf of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

 

(b) The Company has Made Available true, correct and complete copies of its
certificate of incorporation, as amended to date (the "Certificate of
Incorporation") and bylaws, as amended to date, each in full force and effect
on the date hereof (collectively, the "Charter Documents"). The Board of
Directors of the Company has not approved or proposed any amendment to any of
the Charter Documents that has not been Made Available. Section 2.1 of the
Disclosure Schedule lists the directors and officers of the Company and every

other name.

_2.2 _Authority and Enforceability__. The Company has all requisite power and
authority to enter into this Agreement and any Related Agreements to which it
is a party and, subject to receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval, to
consummate the First Merger and the other Transactions. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement and any Related Agreements to which the Company is
a party and the consummation of the Mergers and the other Transactions have
been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the
Company and no further corporate or other action is required on the part of
the Company to authorize this Agreement and any Related Agreements to which
the Company is a party or to consummate the Mergers or any other Transactions,
other than the adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Mergers by at
least a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Company Voting Common
Stock (the "Requisite Stockholder Approval"). The Stockholder Written Consent
shall constitute the Requisite Stockholder Approval. The Board of Directors
of the Company has unanimously approved this Agreement, the Mergers and the
other Transactions, and recommended to the Stockholders to vote in favor of
adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Mergers and the other
Transactions. This Agreement and each of the Related Agreements to which the
Company is a party have been duly executed and delivered by the Company and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the other parties
hereto and thereto, constitute the valid and binding obligations of the
Company enforceable against it in accordance with their respective terms,
subject to (x) Legal Requirements of general application relating to
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, the relief of debtors and enforcement of
creditors rights in general, and (y) rules of law governing specific
performance, injunctive relief, other equitable remedies and other general
principles of equity (clauses (x) and (y) collectively, the "Enforceability
Limitations").

___2.3 _Governmental Approvals and Consents__ __. No consent, notice, waiver,
approval, Order or authorization of, or registration, declaration or filing
with any Governmental Entity, is required by, or with respect to, the Company

Orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings as may be
required under applicable securities laws and state "blue sky" laws, (b) the
filing of the Certificates of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware, and (c) for which the absence of, or failure to provide, obtain
or otherwise address, would not be material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 

 __ _2.4 _No Conflicts__ __. Assuming compliance with the other regulatory
measures, if any, described in Section 2.3 hereto, the execution and
delivery by the Company of this Agreement and any Related Agreement to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, and the consummation of the
Mergers or any other Transactions, will not conflict with or result in any
violation of or default under (with or without notice or lapse of time, or
both) or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation, material

timely filing of such election statements with the appropriate Internal
Revenue Service Center, with respect to any unvested securities or other
property issued by the Company, or any Subsidiary to any of their respective
employees, non-employee directors, consultants and other service providers.

 

(q) _Section 409A_. Each Company Employee Plan and Contract, agreement or
arrangement between the Company or any Subsidiary and any Employee that is a
"nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as such term is defined in Section
409A(d)(1) of the Code), including without limitation the Phantom Plan, has
been at all times since the Companys incorporation in material operational
compliance with Section 409A of the Code (or any state law equivalent) and the
regulations and guidance thereunder ("Section 409A") and at all times since
the Companys incorporation in material documentary compliance with Section
409A. No nonqualified deferred compensation plan that was originally exempt
from application of Section 409A has been "materially modified" (within the
meaning of IRS Notice 2005-1) at any time since the Companys incorporation.
No compensation will, or could reasonably be expected to be includable, in the
gross income of any Employee as a result of the operation of Section 409A with
respect to any Company Employee Plan or other arrangements or agreements that
is or has been in effect at any time prior to the First Effective Time. To the
extent required, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries have properly
reported and/or withheld and remitted on amounts deferred under any
nonqualified deferred compensation plan subject to Section 409A. There is no
Contract, agreement, plan or arrangement to which the Company or any
Subsidiary is a party covering any Employee of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, which individually or collectively obligates the Company or
any of its Affiliates to pay a Tax gross-up payment to, or otherwise indemnify
or reimburse, any Employee for Tax-related payments under Section 409A.

 

(r) _Section 280G_. There is no agreement, plan, arrangement or other

agreements, plans, arrangements or other Contracts, will, or could
reasonably be expected to, as a result of the Transactions and other
agreements contemplated by this Agreement (whether alone or upon the
occurrence of any additional or subsequent events), be characterized as an
"excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code (or
any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or foreign Tax law). No
stock of the Company or any Stockholders is readily tradable on an established
securities market or otherwise (within the meaning of Section 280G and the
regulations promulgated thereunder) such that the Company is ineligible to
seek stockholder approval in a manner that complies with Code Section
280G(b)(5).

 

(s) _Section 4999_. There is no agreement, plan, arrangement or other Company
Contract by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound to
compensate any Employee for excise taxes paid pursuant to Section 4999 of the
Code.

(t) The representations and warranties set forth in this Section 2.10 (other
than the final sentence of Section 2.10(a), Sections 2.10(f) through (h) and
Section 2.10(m)) are made only with respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods and
shall not be construed as a representation or warranty with respect to Tax
positions that Parent or any of its Affiliates (including the Company and its
Subsidiaries) may take in or in respect of a Tax period (or portion
thereof) beginning after the Closing Date.

4.7 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 4.7 and shall
be entitled to enforce the covenants contained herein and (ii) the rights set

Mergers or the other Transactions, the Company, at the direction of the Board
of Directors of the Company, shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure
that the Mergers and the other Transactions may be consummated as promptly as

Agreement shall be paid 50% by Parent and 50% by the Stockholder

period for such representation and warranty, in which case such representation
and warranty shall survive as to such claim until such claim has been finally
resolved. The representations and warranties of Parent and the Merger Subs

(and not jointly or severally), indemnify, defend and hold harmless Parent and
its officers, directors, Affiliates, employees, agents and representatives,
including the Surviving LLC (each, an "Indemnified Party" and collectively,
the "Indemnified Parties"), from and against all claims, losses, liabilities,
damages, costs, interest, awards, judgments, settlements, Taxes, penalties or
expenses, (including reasonable attorneys and consultants fees and expenses
and including any such reasonable expenses incurred in connection with
investigating, defending against or settling any of the foregoing)
(hereinafter individually a "Loss" and collectively "Losses") paid, incurred,
suffered or sustained by any Indemnified Party (including the Surviving LLC)
(regardless of whether or not such Losses relate to any third party claims),
resulting from, arising out of, or relating to any of the following:

(i) any breach of or inaccuracy in, as of the First Effective Time,
a representation or warranty of the Company set forth in this Agreement;

(ii) any failure by the Company to perform or comply with any of its
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement at or prior to the
Closing;

(iii) any Pre-Closing Taxes;

 

(iv) any Fraud by such Indemnifying Party in the making of the representations
and warranties in Article II of this Agreement; and 

(v) any of the matters described on Schedule 7.2(a).

 

(b) For the purpose of this Article VII, for purposes of both determining
whether a breach of or inaccuracy in a representation or warranty or any
failure to perform or comply with any covenant or agreement has occurred and
determining the amount of Losses paid, incurred, suffered or sustained by an
Indemnified Party as a result of any breach of or inaccuracy in a
representation or warranty or any failure to perform or comply with any
covenant or agreement that is qualified or limited in scope as to materiality
or Company Material Adverse Effect, such representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement shall be deemed to be made without such qualification or
limitation; _provided_ that such qualification or limitation shall not be
disregarded (i) to the extent used in Section 2.9(a) or Section 2.7, (ii) to
the extent used with respect to a defined term (e.g., "Material Contract",
etc.), (iii) to the extent used to determine the enumerated items on a list,
or (iv) to the extent applicable pursuant to GAAP.

 

(c) The obligation of the Indemnified Parties to provide indemnity pursuant to
Section 7.2(a)(i) through 7.2(a)(v) shall survive until 11:59 p.m. California
time on the Expiration Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that all such
obligations shall survive with respect to any good faith claim made in writing
made prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period, in which case
such obligation shall survive as to such claim until such claim has been
finally resolved.

 



55

    

(d) The Indemnifying Parties (including any officer or director of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries) shall not have any right of contribution,
indemnification or right of advancement from the Surviving LLC or Parent with
respect to any Loss claimed by an Indemnified Party.

 

(e) Any payments made to an Indemnified Party pursuant to any indemnification
obligations under this Article VII will be treated as adjustments to the
Total Merger Consideration for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by
applicable Legal Requirements.

(f) Subject to Section 7.3(f), the indemnification rights set forth in this
Article VII shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Indemnified Parties
from and after the First Effective Time for any claims for monetary damages
arising out of the matters set forth in Section 7.2(a); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) this Section 7.2(f) shall not be deemed a waiver by any
party of any right to specific performance or injunctive relief and (ii)
nothing in this Agreement shall limit the liability of an Indemnifying Party
(and this Article VII shall not be the sole and exclusive remedy in respect of
such Indemnifying Party) in connection with a claim based on Fraud committed
by such Indemnifying Party.

(g) Nothing in this Agreement shall limit the right of Parent or any other
Indemnified Party to pursue remedies under any Related Agreement against the
parties thereto.

_7.3 _Limitations on Indemnification_. _

 

(a) _Deductible_. Except in the case of (i) Fraud by or on behalf of the
Company and (ii) indemnification claims for breaches of or inaccuracies in
the Fundamental Representations, the Indemnified Parties, as a group, may not
recover any Losses pursuant to an indemnification claim under Section
7.2(a)(i) relating to breaches of or inaccuracies in the representations or
warranties of the Company unless and until the Indemnified Parties, as a
group, shall have paid, incurred, suffered or sustained at least $1,000,000 in
Losses (the "Deductible") in the aggregate for all claims, in which event the
Indemnified Parties may recover only the excess of such Losses above the
Deductible. For the avoidance of doubt, the limitations set forth in this
Section 7.3(a) shall not apply to indemnification claims under clauses (ii)
or (iii) of Section 7.2(a).

(b) Recovery from Indemnity Escrow Fund and RandW Insurance Policy.

(i) Except in the case of Fraud by or on behalf of the Company, the
Indemnified Parties sole and exclusive source of recovery for
indemnification claims under this Article VII shall be recourse against the
RandW Insurance Policy and the cash, if any, held in the Indemnity Escrow Fund.

 



56

    

(ii) Except in the case of Fraud by an Indemnifying Party, in no event shall
such Indemnifying Party be liable for Losses under Section 7.2 in excess of
the Indemnity Escrow Fund.

(c) Subject to the terms of Section 7.3(f), in the case of any
indemnification claim under Section 7.2(a)(iv) that is not limited to the
recovery of assets from the Indemnity Escrow Fund pursuant to Section 7.3(b),
subject to the limitations set forth in Section 7.3(b), the Indemnified
Parties shall be entitled to bring an indemnification claim under Section
7.2(a)(iv) solely against the Indemnifying Party that committed such Fraud for
such Losses, and such Indemnifying Party shall be liable for Losses in
respect of such indemnification claim. For the avoidance of doubt, a claim
based on Fraud may only be made against the Indemnifying Party that committed
such Fraud;  _provided, however_ , such limitation shall not apply to claims
based on Fraud made solely against the Indemnity Escrow Fund.

 

 __(d) The amount of any Losses recoverable by any Indemnified Party against
any Indemnifying Party under this  __Section 7.2(a) __shall be calculated
net of any insurance proceeds actually received by, and/or any indemnification
or contribution payments actually paid by any third party to, such Indemnified
Party in respect of such Losses in, each case net of all costs directly
incurred in such recovery; _provided_ that the Indemnified Party shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to seek or obtain any such insurance proceeds
and shall be required to seek or obtain such proceeds with respect to the RandW
Insurance Policy (to the extent available); _provided, further_ that the
Indemnified Parties shall have no obligations to seek any third party
indemnification or contribution. In the event that an insurance recovery is
received by any Indemnified Party with respect to any Losses for which any
such Person has been indemnified and which Losses such Person had received
from the Indemnifying Parties hereunder, then a refund equal to the
aggregate amount of the recovery (net of reasonable costs and expenses
incurred in recovering such amounts) shall be promptly made to the Stockholder
Representative for distribution to the Indemnifying Parties in accordance with
their Pro Rata Portions. Each Indemnified Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts within their control (including incurring such reasonable
costs or expenses) to mitigate any Loss or potential Loss upon acquiring
actual knowledge of any event or occurrence that would reasonably be expected
to, or that in fact does, give rise to such Loss. __

(e) No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification for punitive
damages, unless such damages are actually paid to a third party in respect of
a Third Party Claim for which such Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification under this Article VII.

 

(f) Other than the limitations set forth in Section 7.3(b)(ii), nothing in
this Agreement shall limit the liability of an Indemnifying Party in
connection with a claim based on Fraud.

(g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Indemnifying
Parties shall not have any liability or indemnification obligation for (i) any
Taxes of the Company resulting from any election made under Section 338 of the
Code with respect to the Mergers, or (ii) any Losses related to or arising
from the amount, value or condition of any Tax asset or attribute (e.g., net
operating loss carryforward or Tax credit carryforward) or the ability of
Parent, the Surviving LLC or any of their Affiliates to utilize any such Tax
asset or attribute in any Tax period or portion thereof (including any
Straddle Period) beginning on or after the Closing Date.

 



57

    

_7.4 _Indemnification Claim Procedures_. _

 

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 7.1, if an Indemnified
Party wishes to make an indemnification claim under this Article VII, such
Indemnified Party shall deliver a written notice (an "Indemnification Claim
Notice") to the Stockholder Representative (or in the event an Indemnified
Party elects to pursue such indemnification claim directly against an
Indemnifying Party, to such Indemnifying Party directly) (i) stating that an
Indemnified Party has paid, incurred, suffered or sustained, or reasonably
anticipates that it may pay, incur, suffer or sustain Losses, and (ii)
specifying in reasonable detail the individual items of such Losses, the date
each such item was paid, incurred, suffered or sustained, or the basis for
such anticipated liability, and, if applicable, the nature of the
misrepresentation, breach of warranty or covenant to which such item is
related. Parent may update an Indemnification Claim Notice from time to time
to reflect any new information discovered with respect to the claim set forth
in such Indemnification Claim Notice. 

(b) If the Stockholder Representative on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties
(or the Indemnifying Party in the event that indemnification is being sought
hereunder directly from such Indemnifying Party) shall not object in writing
within the thirty (30)-day period after receipt of an Indemnification Claim
Notice by delivery of a written notice of objection containing a
reasonably detailed description of the facts and circumstances supporting an
objection to the applicable indemnification claim (an "Indemnification Claim
Objection Notice"), such failure to so object shall be an irrevocable
acknowledgment by the Stockholder Representative on behalf of the
Indemnifying Parties (or the applicable Indemnifying Party) that the
Indemnified Party is entitled to the full amount of the claim for Losses set
forth in such Indemnification Claim Notice subject to the limitations set
forth in Section 7.3. In such event, Parent and the Stockholder Representative
shall promptly execute and deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow
Agent to release to the applicable Indemnified Party from the Indemnity
Escrow Fund the amount of Losses set forth in such Indemnification Claim
Notice. Only with respect to an indemnification claims made pursuant to
Section 7.2(a)(iv), should the amount held in the Indemnity Escrow Fund, if
any, be insufficient to satisfy in whole the amount to be paid to an
Indemnified Party by the Indemnifying Parties in accordance with the
applicable Indemnification Claim Notice, then each Indemnifying Party shall,
within ten (10) Business Days following the expiration date of the right of
the Stockholder Representative on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties (or the
applicable Indemnifying Party) to make an Indemnification Claim Objection
Notice, pay to the Indemnified Party, such Indemnifying Parties Pro Rata
Portion of such shortfall.

(c) In the event that the Stockholder Representative (or in the event
that indemnification is being sought hereunder directly from an Indemnifying
Party, such Indemnifying Party) shall deliver an Indemnification Claim
Objection Notice in accordance with Section 7.4(b) within thirty (30) days
after delivery of such Indemnification Claim Notice, the Stockholder
Representative (or such objecting Indemnifying Party) and Parent shall attempt
in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect
to each of such claims, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 7.3.
In such event, Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall promptly
execute and deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to release
from the Indemnity Escrow Fund the amount of Losses set forth in such
Indemnification Claim Notice. Should the amount held in the Indemnity Escrow
Fund, if any, be insufficient to satisfy in whole the amount owed to an
Indemnified Party in accordance with such memorandum and this Agreement, then
each Indemnifying Party shall, within ten (10) Business Days following the
date of such memorandum, pay to the Indemnified Party such Indemnifying
Partys Pro Rata Portion of such shortfall.

 



58

    

(d) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation and prior
to thirty (30) days after delivery of an Indemnification Claim Objection
Notice, either Parent or the Stockholder Representative (or the objecting
Indemnifying Party) may demand arbitration of the matter, unless the amount of
the Loss that is at issue is the subject of a pending litigation with a third
party, in which event arbitration shall not be commenced until such amount is
ascertained or both parties agree to arbitration, and in either such event the
matter shall be settled by arbitration conducted in San Francisco County,
California, under the rules then in effect of the American Arbitration
Association. Subject to Section 7.5 with respect to Third Party Claims, the
arbitrator shall determine how all expenses relating to the arbitration shall
be paid, including the respective expenses of each party, the fees of the
arbitrator and the administrative fee of the American Arbitration Association.
The arbitrator shall set a limited time period and establish
procedures designed to reduce the cost and time for discovery while allowing
the parties an opportunity, adequate in the sole judgment of the arbitrator,
to discover relevant information from the opposing parties about the subject
matter of the dispute. The arbitrator shall rule upon motions to compel or
limit discovery and shall have the authority to impose sanctions, including
attorneys fees and costs, to the same extent as a competent court of law or
equity, should the arbitrator determine that discovery was sought without
substantial justification or that discovery was refused or objected to without
substantial justification. The decision of the arbitrator as to the validity
and amount of any claim shall be final, conclusive and binding upon the
parties to this Agreement and the Indemnifying Parties, subject to the
limitations set forth in Section 7.3. Such decision shall be written and shall
be supported by written findings of fact and conclusions which shall set
forth the award, judgment, decree or order awarded by the arbitrator, and the
Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on, and make distributions from the
Indemnity Escrow Fund in accordance with, the terms of such award, judgment,
decree or order as applicable. In such event, following written receipt of
the arbitrators decision, Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall
promptly execute and deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to
release from the Indemnity Escrow Fund to the Indemnifying Parties the amount
of Losses determined indemnifiable by the arbitrator. Should the amount held
in the Indemnity Escrow Fund, if any, be insufficient to satisfy in whole the
amount owed to an Indemnified Party in accordance with such decision and this
Agreement, then each Indemnifying Party shall, within ten (10) Business Days
following the date of such memorandum, pay to the Indemnified Party such
Indemnifying Partys Pro Rata Portion of such shortfall subject to the
limitations set forth in Section 7.3. From and after the time that an
Indemnification Claim Notice is received and until such claim is finally
resolved, the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party, Parent,
the Surviving LLC, and the Stockholder Representative shall cooperate in good
faith.

 



59

    

_7.5 _Third Party Claims_. _

 

(a) In the event Parent becomes aware of a third party claim (a "Third Party
Claim") which Parent reasonably believes would result in a demand against the
Indemnity Escrow Fund or for other indemnification pursuant to this Article
VII, Parent shall notify the Stockholder Representative of such Third Party
Claim (it being understood that no delay in providing such notice shall
prejudice Parents rights under this Article VII except to the extent that the
applicable Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by reason of such
failure), and the Stockholder Representative shall be entitled on behalf of
the Stockholders, at its expense and only to the extent it does not affect any
privilege relating to any Indemnified Party, to consult with Parent with
respect to, but not to determine or conduct, the defense of such Third Party
Claim. Parent shall have the right in its sole discretion to conduct the
defense of, and to settle, any such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , however,
that except with the consent of the Stockholder Representative, no settlement
or resolution of any such Third Party Claim shall be determinative of the
existence or the amount of Losses resulting from, arising out of or relating
to such Third Party Claim. The Indemnified Parties reasonable attorneys and
consultants fees and expenses incurred in connection with investigating,
defending against or settling such Third Party Claims shall be included in the
Losses for which the Indemnified Parties may seek indemnification hereunder
and such costs and expenses shall constitute Losses subject to
indemnification under Section 7.2(a) (but subject to the other limitations
under this Article VII) whether or not it is ultimately determined that the
Third Party Claim itself is indemnifiable under Section 7.2(a).

(b) In the event that the Stockholder Representative has consented to any
settlement or resolution of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Parties and
the Stockholders shall have no power or authority to object under any
provision of this Article VII to the amount of Losses resulting from, arising
out of or relating to such Third Party Claim, and the Indemnified Parties
shall be entitled to indemnification for the entire amount of such Losses,
subject to the applicable limitations contained in Section 7.3. In the event
that the Stockholder Representative does not, in accordance with the terms of
this Section 7.5(b), consent to any such settlement or resolution, then the
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to submit the dispute with the
Stockholder Representative with respect to the existence or amount of Losses
resulting from, arising out of or relating to such Third Party Claim to an
arbitrator pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 7.4, with the
arbitrators fees being borne 100% by the non-prevailing party. 

(c) For the avoidance of doubt and subject to the other terms of this
Agreement, the Stockholder Representative and the Indemnifying Parties shall
keep any information obtained in connection with any Third Party Claim
confidential in accordance with Section 9.6 hereof as though such information
was subject to the terms of Non-Disclosure Agreement, and in no event shall
the Stockholder Representative or any Indemnifying Party disclose such
information to any third party unless and until such party has executed a
confidentiality agreement with respect to such information, or is otherwise
subject to applicable confidentiality obligations, containing confidentiality
terms no less favorable to the Company than those contained in the Non-
Disclosure Agreement.

_7.6 _Stockholder Representative_. _

 

(a) By virtue of the execution and delivery of a Joinder Agreement, and the
adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Mergers by the Stockholders,
each of the Indemnifying Parties shall be deemed to have agreed to appoint TPG
VII Laurel Holdings, L.P. as its agent and attorney-in-fact and as the
Stockholder Representative with full power and authority to act for and on
behalf of the Equityholders to pay each such Equityholders expenses (whether
incurred on or after the date hereof) incurred in connection with the
negotiation and performance of this Agreement receive, give receipt and
disburse any funds received hereunder or on behalf of or to each such
Equityholder, to negotiate, settle, compromise and make any required payments
from the Adjustment Escrow Amount on behalf of all Equityholders, to give and
receive notices and communications on behalf of any Equityholder or all
Equityholder collectively, both generally with respect to matters contemplated
by this Agreement or more specifically in respect of indemnification claims
under this Agreement, to authorize payment from the Escrow Funds
in satisfaction of any indemnification claims hereunder, to object to such
payments, to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of,
and demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of
arbitrators with respect to any such indemnification or other claims, to
assert, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand
arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with
respect to, any such indemnification claim by any Indemnified Party hereunder
against any Indemnifying Party or by any such Indemnifying Party against any
Indemnified Party or any dispute between any Indemnified Party and any such
Indemnifying Party, in each case relating to this Agreement or
the Transactions, and to take all other actions that are either (i) necessary
or appropriate in the judgment of the Stockholder Representative for the
accomplishment of the foregoing or (ii) specifically mandated by the terms of
this Agreement. Such agency may be changed by the Stockholders from time to
time upon not less than thirty (30) days prior written notice to Parent;
_provided, however_ , that the Stockholder Representative may not be removed
unless holders of a two-thirds interest of the Escrow Funds agree to such
removal and to the identity of the substituted agent. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event of a resignation of the Stockholder Representative or
other vacancy in the position of Stockholder Representative, such vacancy may
be filled by the holders of a majority in interest of the Escrow Funds. No
bond shall be required of the Stockholder Representative, and the Stockholder
Representative shall not receive any compensation for its services. Notices
or communications to or from the Stockholder Representative shall constitute
notice to or from the Indemnifying Parties. The agency and proxy granted to
the Stockholder Representative pursuant to this Section 7.6(a) are coupled
with an interest, and are therefore irrevocable without the consent of holder,
unless otherwise agreed to between the Stockholder Representative and any such
Person in writing.

 

(b) A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative,
including an amendment of any provision of this Agreement pursuant to Section
9.2 hereof, shall constitute a decision of the Equityholders and shall be
final, binding and conclusive upon the Equityholders, and Parent may rely upon
any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder
Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Equityholders. Parent is hereby relieved from any liability to any person for
any acts done by Parent in accordance with such decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Stockholder Representative. The Stockholder Representative
shall not have by reason of this Agreement a fiduciary relationship in respect
of any Equityholder, except in respect of amounts actually received on behalf
of such Equityholder. The Stockholder Representative shall not be required to
make any inquiry concerning either the performance or observance of any of the
terms, provisions or conditions of this Agreement.

 



61

    

(c) The Stockholder Representative shall not be, nor shall any person employed
by or otherwise affiliated with the Stockholder Representative be, liable for
any act done or omitted hereunder as Stockholder Representative except for
actions or omissions constituting willful misconduct or gross negligence of
the Stockholder Representative in connection therewith. The Equityholders
shall severally (and not jointly and severally) on a pro rata basis (based on
the aggregate amount of gross proceeds received by such Equityholder, as
applicable, pursuant to this Agreement as of the time of determination) pay
for all reasonable and documented fees, costs and expenses incurred by the
Stockholder Representative in connection with the acceptance and
administration of its duties hereunder and shall indemnify the Stockholder
Representative and hold the Stockholder Representative harmless against any
and all Losses arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of the Stockholder Representatives duties hereunder, including
all reasonable fees and expenses of defending the Stockholder Representative
against any claim of liability ("Stockholder Representative Expenses"). From
time to time in its sole discretion, the Stockholder Representative may pay
or cause to be paid or reimburse itself for the any Stockholder
Representative Expenses from the Stockholder Representative Expense Fund or,
if such funds are depleted, from the Escrow Funds (only to the extent that
such reimbursement is paid from payments that would otherwise have been made
to the Stockholders (i.e. after the release of any escrowed amounts)), and
prior to any such payment or reimbursement, shall deliver to the Parent a
certificate setting forth the Stockholder Representative Expenses to be so
paid. For the avoidance of doubt, while this section allows the Stockholder
Representative to be paid from the Stockholder Representative Expense Funds
and the Escrow Funds, this Section 7.6(c) shall not limit the obligation of
any Equityholders to promptly pay such Stockholder Representative Expenses as
they are incurred. A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder
Representative, including an amendment, extension or waiver of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 9.2 or Section 9.3, shall constitute a decision of the
Equityholders and shall be final, conclusive and binding upon the
Equityholders; and the Parent may rely upon any such decision, act, consent
or instruction of the Stockholder Representative as being the decision, act,
consent or instruction of the Equityholders. The Parent is hereby relieved
from any liability to any person for any acts done by it in accordance with
such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative.
The Stockholder Representative shall notify the Equityholders if additional
funds are required to cover any Stockholder Representative Expenses and such
Equityholders shall be required to deposit additional funds on a pro rata
basis (based on the aggregate amount of gross proceeds received by such
Equityholder, as applicable, pursuant to this Agreement as of the time of
determination) into an account designated by the Stockholder Representative.
The Stockholder Representative may release at any time, in its sole
discretion, all or any portion of the Stockholder Representative Expense Funds
for distribution to the Equityholders pursuant to Section 1.6(f).

_7.7_ __ _ _Exclusive Remedies__ __. __Subject to Section 9.10, except with
respect to a claim pursued against a perpetrator of Fraud, the parties
acknowledge and agree that their sole and exclusive remedy with respect to
any and all claims for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant,
agreement or obligation set forth herein or otherwise relating to the subject

 



62

    

 matter of this Agreement, shall be pursuant to the indemnification
provisions set forth in this Article VII. In furtherance of the foregoing,
each party hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted under Legal
Requirements, any and all rights, claims and causes of action for any breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set forth
herein or otherwise relating to the subject matter of this Agreement it may
have against the other parties hereto and their Affiliates and each of their
respective representatives arising under or based upon any Legal Requirements,
except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article
VII. Nothing in this Section 7.7 shall limit any Persons right to seek and
obtain any equitable relief to which any Person shall be entitled pursuant to
Section 9.10.

_9.8 _Entire Agreement_._ This Agreement, Annex A hereto, the Exhibits
and Schedules hereto, the Disclosure Schedule, the Related Agreements, and
the documents and instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto
referenced herein constitute the entire agreement among the parties hereto
with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements
and understandings both written and oral, among the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof, and are not intended to confer upon any other
person any rights or remedies hereunder.

 

 _9.9 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_._ Nothing in this Agreement is intended
to, or shall be construed to, confer upon any other person any rights or
remedies hereunder, except for the Indemnified DandOs under Section 4.7 and the
Indemnified Parties under Article VII.

 

 _9.10 _Specific Performance and Other Remedies_. _

 

(a) The parties to this Agreement agree that, in the event of any breach or
threatened breach by the other party or parties hereto, any Stockholder or
the Stockholder Representative of any covenant, obligation or other agreement
set forth in this Agreement, (i) each party shall be entitled, without any
proof of actual damages (and in addition to any other remedy that may
be available to it), to a decree or order of specific performance or mandamus
to enforce the observance and performance of such covenant, obligation or
other agreement and an injunction preventing or restraining such breach or
threatened breach, and (ii) no party hereto shall be required to provide or
post any bond or other security or collateral in connection with any such
decree, order or injunction or in connection with any related action or legal
proceeding.

 

(b) Other than as set forth herein, any and all remedies herein expressly
conferred herein upon a party hereto shall be deemed to be cumulative with,
and not exclusive of, any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or in
equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party hereto of any one remedy
will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

 

 _9.11 _Severability__. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or
the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so
as reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

_9.12 _Governing Law__. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware regardless of the laws that
might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws
thereof.

 

 _9.13 _Exclusive Jurisdiction__. Subject to Section 7.4(d), each of the
parties hereto irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue

Transactions or any other matters contemplated herein (or, only if the Court
of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular

 



66

    

 matter, any federal court within the State of Delaware). Subject to Section
7.4(d), each party agrees not to commence any legal proceedings related hereto
except in such court (or, only if the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, in any
federal court within federal court within the State of Delaware). By execution
and delivery of this Agreement, subject to Section 7.4(d), each party hereto
and the Stockholders irrevocably and unconditionally submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction of such courts and to the appellate courts therefrom solely for
the purposes of disputes arising under the this Agreement and not as a
general submission to such jurisdiction or with respect to any other dispute,
matter or claim whatsoever. The parties hereto and the Stockholders
irrevocably consent to the service of process out of any of the
aforementioned courts in any such action or proceeding by the delivery of
copies thereof by overnight courier to the address for such party to which
notices are deliverable hereunder. Any such service of process shall be
effective upon delivery. Nothing herein shall affect the right to serve
process in any other manner permitted by applicable Legal Requirements. The
parties hereto and the Stockholders hereby waive any right to stay or dismiss
any action or proceeding under or in connection with this Agreement brought
before the foregoing courts on the basis of (i) any claim that it is not
personally subject to the jurisdiction of

the above-named courts for any reason, or that it or any of its property is
immune from the above-described legal process, (ii) that such action or
proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, that venue for the action or
proceeding is improper or that this Agreement may not be enforced in or by
such courts, or (iii) any other defense that would hinder or delay the levy,
execution or collection of any amount to which any party hereto is entitled
pursuant to any final judgment of any court having jurisdiction.

_9.14 _Waiver of Jury Trial__. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AND ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

 

 _9.15 _Counterparts__. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that all
parties need not sign the same counterpart. The exchange of a fully executed
Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by electronic transmission in PDF
format or by facsimile shall be sufficient to bind the parties to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement.

 

 _9.16 _Non-Recourse__. All claims or causes of action (whether in contract or
in tort, at law or in equity) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate
to this Agreement or the Related Agreements, or the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement or the Related Agreements (including any
representation or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement or
the Related Agreements or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement or the
Related Agreements) may be made only against the entities that are expressly
identified as parties hereto and thereto. Except to the extent named as a
party to this Agreement or any Related Agreements (then only to the extent of
the specific obligations of such parties set forth in this Agreement or such
Related Agreements), no Related Party of Parent, the Stockholder
Representative, the Equityholders or the Company shall have any liability
(whether in contract or

 



67

    

 in tort, in law or in equity, or based upon any theory that seeks to impose
liability of an entity party against its owners or affiliates) for any
obligations or liabilities arising under, in connection with or related to
this Agreement or such other Related Agreement or any transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by
reason of this Agreement or such other Related Agreement (as the case
may be), the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or the negotiation
or execution hereof or thereof; and each party hereto waives and releases all
such liabilities, claims and obligations against any Related Party of the
Company, the Equityholders, the Stockholder Representative or Parent. The
Related Parties of the Company, the Equityholders, the Stockholder
Representative and Parent are expressly intended as third party beneficiaries
of this provision of this  _Section 9.16_.

_9.17 _Waiver of Conflicts__. Recognizing that Kirkland and Ellis LLP has
acted as legal counsel to the Company and certain of the Equityholders and
certain of their respective Affiliates prior to the Closing in connection with
the Transactions (the "Prior Representation"), and that Kirkland and Ellis LLP
intends to act as legal counsel to certain of the Equityholders and certain of
their respective Affiliates (which will no longer include the Surviving LLC)
after the Closing, each of Parent and the Company hereby waives and agrees not
to assert, on its own behalf and agrees to cause its Affiliates to waive and
not to assert, any conflicts that may arise as a consequence of the Prior
Representation in connection with Kirkland and Ellis LLP representing the
Equityholders and certain of their respective Affiliates after the Closing in
connection with a representation relating to Parent, the Company or the
Transactions. In addition, all communications involving attorney-client
confidences between the Equityholders, their Affiliates or the Company and
Kirkland and Ellis LLP in the course of the negotiation, documentation and
consummation of the Transactions (the "Privileged Deal Materials") shall be
deemed to be attorney-client confidences that belong solely to the
Equityholders and their Affiliates (and not the Company). Accordingly, the
Company and Parent shall not be entitled to request access to any such
communications, or to the files of Kirkland and Ellis LLP relating to
its engagement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon and
after the Closing, (a) the Equityholders and their Affiliates (and not the
Surviving LLC) shall be the sole holders of the attorney-client privilege with
respect to such engagement, and none of Parent or the Surviving LLC shall be
a holder thereof, (b) to the extent that files of Kirkland and Ellis LLP in
respect of such engagement constitute property of the client, only the
Equityholders and their Affiliates (and not the Surviving LLC) shall hold
such property rights and (c) Kirkland and Ellis LLP shall have no duty
whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such attorney-client communications or
files to Parent or the Surviving LLC by reason of any attorney-client
relationship between Kirkland and Ellis LLP and the Surviving LLC or otherwise.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between
Parent, the Merger Subs, and the Company, on the one hand, and a Person other
than a party to this Agreement, on the other hand, after the Closing, the
Company may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure to such
third-party of confidential communications by Kirkland and Ellis LLP to the
Company. Except as to the Privileged Deal Materials, any other pre-Closing
privileged communications maintained by the Company shall be the sole property
of the Surviving LLC.
