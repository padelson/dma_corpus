books and records related thereto, as Buyer reasonably deems necessary or
advisable, and each Seller shall instruct its employees to cooperate in any such
investigation; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such investigation shall not unreasonably
interfere with the business or operations of each Seller; PROVIDED FURTHER,
HOWEVER, that no Seller shall be required to take any action which would
constitute a waiver of the attorney-client privilege; PROVIDED FURTHER, HOWEVER,
that Sellers shall provide Buyer with an explanation of the basis for the
assertion of any such privilege (without Sellers being required to waive such
privilege in providing such explanation). From and after the Closing Date until

Buyer, to inspect and make copies of the same, and to have access to, and use
of, all personnel at any time during regular business hours to assist with the
wind-down of Sellers' estates and Cases, including assistance with the
reconciliation of any third-party Claim in respect of which Seller may have
Liability hereunder; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such inspection and access shall
not materially interfere with the business or operations of Buyer. After such
two (2)-year time period, should Buyer plan or otherwise intend to destroy or
remove such books and records from their present location, Buyer must provide
written notice to Sellers at least three (3) weeks prior to the date that such
books and records are to be destroyed to allow Sellers to make copies or
otherwise obtain such books and records. In addition, Buyer shall provide
Sellers with reasonable office space, and use of office equipment, in accordance
with SCHEDULE 6.2 hereof, at no cost to Sellers, to use in connection with the
wind-down of Sellers' estates and Cases from and after the Closing Date until
the closure of Sellers' Cases, but in no event later than two (2) years from the
Closing Date.

          Section 6.3 PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. No party shall issue a press release

contemplated hereby, except as may be required by Law, by obligations pursuant
to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange or
over-the-counter market or with respect to filings to be made with the
Bankruptcy Court in connection with this Agreement (in which case the party
required to make such public statement shall notify the other party and shall
consult with such other party prior to making such public statement), without
the prior consent of the other, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld.

          Section 6.4 REASONABLE EFFORTS. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions herein provided, each of the parties hereto shall use its respective

their service with Sellers for all purposes under Buyer's employee benefit
plans, including eligibility and vesting, and shall ensure that Continued
Employees are credited for all deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by the Continued Employees during the calendar year in which the Closing Date
occurs. Buyer shall not during the 90-day period beginning on the Closing Date
terminate the employment of Continued Employees of the Business so as to cause
any "plant closing" or "mass layoff" (as those terms are defined in the WARN
Act) such that Sellers have any obligation under the WARN Act that Sellers
otherwise would not have had absent such terminations. Sellers and Buyer shall
cooperate in sending a mutually acceptable communication to Employees prior to
the Closing Date regarding continued employment and other employment related
matters.

Employees who actually commence such employment with Buyer and (iii) Buyer will
undertake to file (or cause to be filed) a Form W-2 for each such Continued
Employee for the year that includes the Closing Date (including the

                                      -26-
<Page>

portion of such year that such employee was employed by Sellers). Each Seller
shall provide Buyer on a timely basis with all payroll and employment-related
information with respect to each employee of a Seller who accepts employment
with Buyer.

          Section 6.7 FURTHER ASSURANCES. On and after the Closing Date, the

Seller after the Closing Date pertaining to the Assets, the Business or the
Assumed Liabilities. Buyer shall promptly deliver to the applicable Seller any
mail or other communication received by it after the Closing Date pertaining to
the Excluded Assets or any Excluded Liabilities and any cash, checks or other
instruments of payment in respect thereof. From and after the Closing Date, each
Seller shall refer all inquiries with respect to the Business, the Assets and
the Assumed Liabilities to Buyer, and Buyer shall refer all inquiries with

Seller.

Section 1146(c) of the Bankruptcy Code, all Transfer Taxes arising out of the
transfer of the Assets and the other transactions contemplated hereby and any
Transfer Taxes required to effect any recording or filing with respect thereto
shall be borne by Buyer. The Transfer Taxes shall be calculated assuming that no
exemption from Transfer Taxes is available, unless otherwise indicated in the
Approval Order or, on or before the due date for such Transfer Taxes, Buyer
shall provide an appropriate resale exemption certificate or other evidence
acceptable to Sellers of exemption from such Transfer Taxes. Sellers and Buyer
shall cooperate to timely prepare and file any returns or other filings relating
to such Transfer Taxes, including any claim for exemption or exclusion from the
application or imposition of any Transfer Taxes. Buyer shall timely pay such
Transfer Taxes and shall file all necessary documentation and returns with
respect to such Transfer Taxes when due, and shall promptly following the filing
thereof furnish a copy of such return or other filing and a copy of a receipt
showing payment of any such Transfer Tax to Sellers.

          (b) Each party shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the others,
upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information and assistance
relating to the Assets and the Business as is reasonably necessary for filing of
all Tax Returns, including any claim for exemption or exclusion from the

items that accrue or are due after the Closing Date may be calculated as each
item to be prorated accrues or comes due, provided that each such proration
shall be calculated not later than five (5) Business Days after the party
requesting proration of any item obtains the information required to prorate the
item.

          Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, after the
Closing, neither Buyer nor any Seller shall assert any claim against the other
in respect of any credit, offset, adjustment or reimbursement for underpayment

                                   TERMINATION

          Section 8.1 TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT. This Agreement may be terminated
and the transactions contemplated hereby abandoned at any time prior to the
Closing:

          (a) By mutual written consent of Buyer and Sellers;

          (b) By Sellers or Buyer if the Closing shall not have occurred on or
before May 30, 2002 (the "OUTSIDE DATE"); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(b) shall not be available to any
party whose failure to fulfill any material obligation under this Agreement has
been the cause of, or resulted in, or contributed to, the failure of the Closing
to occur before such date;

          (c) [Reserved];

          (d) By Sellers, if Buyer shall have breached in any material respect
any of its representations and warranties or failed to perform in any material
respect any of its covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement,
which breach or failure to perform (1) is incapable of being cured by Buyer
prior to the Outside Date and (2) renders any condition under Sections 7.1 and
7.3 hereof incapable of being satisfied prior to the Outside Date;

          (e) By Buyer, (i) if any Seller or Sellers collectively shall have
breached in any material respect any of their respective representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement or (ii) if any Seller or Sellers
collectively failed to perform in any material respect any of their covenants or
other agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform
(1) is incapable of being cured by Sellers prior to the Outside Date and (2)
renders any condition under Sections 7.1 and 7.2 hereof incapable of being
satisfied prior to the Outside Date;

          (f) By Sellers or Buyer, upon written notice to the other party, if
the Bankruptcy Court or any other Governmental Authority of competent
jurisdiction shall have issued an Order or taken any other action (which Order
or other action the party seeking to terminate shall have used all of its
reasonable efforts to resist, resolve or lift, as applicable, subject to the
provisions of Section 6.4 hereof) enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and such Order
shall have become final and non-appealable; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the party
seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(f) has
fulfilled its obligations under Section 6.4 hereof;

          (g) [Reserved]; or

          (h) By Sellers or Buyer, if any event occurs which renders
satisfaction of one or more conditions set forth in Article VII impossible;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Sellers or Buyer, as the case may be, shall not be
entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(h) if the
impossibility results primarily from such party itself breaching any
representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement.

                                      -34-
<Page>

          Section 8.2 NO LIABILITIES IN EVENT OF TERMINATION. In the event of
any termination of the Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, (i) written notice
thereof shall forthwith be given to the other party specifying the provision
hereof pursuant to which such termination is made, (ii) this Agreement shall
forthwith become wholly void and of no further force and effect, (iii) if
applicable, the Cash Deposit shall be returned to Buyer pursuant to Section 8.3
hereof, and (iv) there shall be no liability on the part of Buyer or Sellers,
except that the obligations of Sellers and Buyer under Section 10.1 shall remain
in full force and effect and except that if this Agreement shall be terminated
pursuant to Sections 8.1(d) or (e) hereof, the breaching party shall remain
liable to the non-breaching party for costs, expenses and damages incurred by
its breach.

          Section 8.3 TREATMENT OF CASH DEPOSIT UPON TERMINATION.

          (a) If Buyer terminates this Agreement in breach of Section 8.1 hereof
or if Sellers terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(b) (provided the
failure to have a Closing on the date specified is due to a breach by Buyer),
Section 8.1(d), Section 8.1(f) (provided Buyer has not fulfilled its obligations
under Section 6.4) or Section 8.1(h) (provided the impossibility has resulted
from the breach of a representation, warranty or covenant by Buyer) or if Buyer
otherwise refuses or is incapable of closing the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, then Sellers shall be entitled to retain the Cash Deposit and
shall have no further obligations to Buyer.

          (b) Provided that Buyer is not in breach of this Agreement, if Sellers
terminate this Agreement in breach of Section 8.1 hereof or if Buyer terminates
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(a) (unless otherwise mutually agreed by
the parties), Section 8.1(b) (provided the failure to have a Closing on the date
specified is not due to a breach by Buyer), Section 8.1(e), Section 8.1(f)
(provided Buyer has fulfilled its obligations under Section 6.4) or Section
8.1(h) (provided the impossibility has not resulted from the breach of a
representation, warranty or covenant by Buyer), then Sellers shall return the
Cash Deposit to Buyer by wire transfer in immediately available funds within two
(2) Business Days as required by Section 3.5 hereof.

          Section 8.4 [RESERVED.]

          Section 8.5 ABANDONMENT. If this Agreement is terminated and the
transactions contemplated hereby are abandoned as described in Section 8.1, this
Agreement shall become void and of no further force or effect, except for the
provisions of Section 6.3 relating to publicity. Nothing in this Section 8.5
shall be deemed to release any party from any liability for any breach by such
party of the terms and provisions of this Agreement or to impair the right of
any party to compel specific performance by any other party of its obligations
under this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                                 INDEMNIFICATION

          Section 9.1 NO SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. The parties
hereto agree that the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement
shall not survive the

                                      -35-
<Page>

Closing hereunder, and neither party shall have any liability to the other after
the Closing for any breach thereof. The representations and warranties set forth
in this Agreement constitute the only representations and warranties made by
Sellers and Buyer with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, and the
property transferred pursuant hereto, and such representations and warranties
supersede all representations and warranties, written or oral, previously made
by Sellers or Buyer. WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, BUYER
AGREES THAT THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED HEREIN ARE IN LIEU OF
ALL OTHER WARRANTIES WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
SUCH OTHER WARRANTIES BEING SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMED BY SELLERS. Buyer further
agrees that, to the extent the Closing occurs the Assets being sold hereunder
will be sold AS IS, WHERE IS and WITH ALL FAULTS and without any warranty or
representation whatsoever, except as specifically stated herein. The parties
hereto agree that the covenants contained in this Agreement to be performed at
or after the Closing shall survive the Closing hereunder (including the covenant
contained in Section 6.22 hereof whether or not such covenant is performed
before or after the Closing), and each party hereto shall be liable to the other
after the Closing for any breach thereof.

          Section 9.2 INDEMNIFICATION.

          (a) Each Seller shall, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold Buyer
and its Affiliates harmless against and in respect of loss, damage, claim,
Liability, judgment or settlement of any nature or kind, including all costs and
expenses relating thereto, including interest, penalties and reasonable
attorneys' fees (collectively, the "DAMAGES"), arising out of, resulting from or
relating to all Excluded Liabilities.

          (b) Buyer shall indemnify and shall hold Sellers and their Affiliates
harmless against and in respect of any Damages, arising out of, resulting from
or relating to:

          (i) all Liabilities of Buyer under this Agreement, including without
     limitation, all Assumed Liabilities and Liabilities under Section 6.16;

          (ii) the termination of employment of a Continued Employee; and

          (iii) any Liability to Sellers as a result of a breach by Buyer under
     Section 6.6 hereof.

          (c) In the event that any Person shall incur or suffer any Damages in
respect of which indemnification may be sought hereunder, such Person (the
"INDEMNIFIED PARTY") may assert a claim for indemnification by providing written
notice to the party from whom indemnification is being sought (the "INDEMNIFYING
PARTY"), stating the amount of Damages, if known, and the nature and basis of
such claim (the "NOTICE"). In the case of Damages that arise or may arise by
reason of any third-party claim, promptly after receipt by an Indemnified Party
of written notice of the assertion of any claim or the commencement of any
action with respect to any matter in respect of which indemnification may be
sought hereunder, the Indemnified Party shall give Notice to the Indemnifying
Party and shall thereafter keep the Indemnifying Party

                                      -36-
<Page>

reasonably informed with respect thereto, provided that failure of the
Indemnified Party to give the Indemnifying Party prompt notice as provided
herein shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any of its obligations
hereunder, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially
prejudiced by such failure. In case any such claim is made or action is brought
against any Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to
assume the defense thereof, by written notice of its intention to do so to the
Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Notice. If the
Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense of such claim or action, it shall
have the right to settle such claim or action; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that it shall
not settle such claim or action without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed)
if such settlement (i) does not include as an unconditional term thereof the
giving by the claimant or the plaintiff of a release of the Indemnified Party
from all Liability with respect to such claim or action or (ii) involves the
imposition of equitable remedies or the imposition of any material obligations
on such Indemnified Party other than financial obligations for which such
Indemnified Party will be indemnified hereunder. As long as the Indemnifying
Party is contesting any such claim or action in good faith, the Indemnified
Party shall not pay or settle such claim or action. Following delivery of notice
of its intention to assume the defense of any claim or action hereunder, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable hereunder for any legal or other expenses
subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense
thereof; PROVIDED, FURTHER, HOWEVER, that if the defendants in any action shall
include both an Indemnifying Party and any Indemnified Party and such
Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded that counsel selected by the
Indemnifying Party has a conflict of interest because of the availability of
different or additional defenses to such Indemnified Party, such Indemnified
Party shall have the right to separate counsel to participate in the defense of
such action on its behalf, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party; PROVIDED,
FURTHER, HOWEVER, that the Indemnifying Party shall not be obligated to pay the
expenses of more than one separate counsel for all Indemnified Parties, taken
together.

          (d) If the Indemnifying Party shall fail to notify the Indemnified
Party of its desire to assume the defense of any claim or action within the
prescribed period of time, or shall notify the Indemnified Party that it will
not assume the defense hereof, then the Indemnified Party may assume the defense
of such claim or action, in which event it may do so acting in good faith, and
the Indemnifying Party shall be bound by any determination made in any such
action, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Indemnified Party shall not be permitted to
settle any such action without the consent of the Indemnifying Party, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. No such determination or
settlement shall affect the right of the Indemnifying Party to dispute the
Indemnified Party's claim for indemnification hereunder. The Indemnifying Party
shall be permitted to participate in the defense of such claim or action and to
employ counsel at its own expense. If the Indemnifying Party chooses to assume
the defense of any claim or action pursuant hereto, the Indemnified Party shall
cooperate in such defense, which cooperation shall include the retention and the
provision to the Indemnifying Party of records and information which are
reasonably relevant to such defense, and making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any materials provided hereunder, including providing such employees to serve as
witnesses.

          (e) The right to indemnification pursuant to this Article IX shall not
be affected by any investigation conducted with respect to, or any knowledge
acquired (or capable

                                      -37-
<Page>

of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the date the Closing occurs, with respect to the
accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any covenant or obligation. The
waiver of any condition to the obligation of a party to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, where such condition is based on
the performance of or compliance with any covenant or obligation, shall not
affect the right of an Indemnified Party to indemnification, payment of an
Indemnified Party's Damages, or other remedy based on such covenant or
obligation.

          (f) Any indemnification payments made pursuant to this Agreement shall
be treated for Tax purposes as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, unless
otherwise required by applicable Law.

                                   ARTICLE X

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

          Section 10.1 EXPENSES.

          (a) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement including
this Section 10.1, whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated, each party shall bear all costs and expenses incurred or to be
incurred by such party in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby.

          (b) [Reserved.]

          (c) Sellers and Buyer shall share equally in the cost of the filing
fee required under the HSR Act.

          Section 10.2 ASSIGNMENT. This Agreement and the rights and obligations
of the parties hereunder shall not be assigned, delegated or otherwise
transferred, by Buyer or by any Seller; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Buyer may assign
its rights and obligations hereunder to one or more entities formed by Buyer or
an Affiliate of Buyer solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions
contemplated hereby and that has not engaged in any other business activity;
PROVIDED FURTHER, HOWEVER, that no such assignment shall relieve Buyer of its
liabilities and obligations hereunder if such assignee does not perform such
obligations, including satisfying the requirements of adequate assurance of
future performance; and PROVIDED FURTHER, HOWEVER, that this Agreement may be
assigned to one or more trustees appointed by the Bankruptcy Court to succeed to
the rights of any Seller. Sellers agree to enter into such amendments to, or
restatements of, this Agreement and the exhibits hereto as may be reasonably
required to give effect to this Section 10.2, so long as such amendments or
restatements do not adversely affect the rights of Sellers hereunder or
thereunder in Sellers' reasonable judgment. Subject to the foregoing, this
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns, and except as otherwise expressly
provided herein, no other Person shall have any right, benefit or obligation
hereunder.

          Section 10.3 PARTIES IN INTEREST. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure solely to the benefit of Sellers and Buyer, or their respective
successors or permitted

                                      -38-

assigns and, except as provided in Section 10.13, nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other person any
rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, no direct or indirect holder of any
equity interests or securities of any Seller or Buyer (whether such holder is a
limited or general partner, member, stockholder or otherwise), nor any Affiliate
of any Seller or Buyer, nor any director, officer, employee, representative,
agent or other controlling person of each of the parties hereto and their
respective Affiliates shall have any liability or obligation arising under this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby.

          Section 10.4 NOTICES. Unless otherwise provided herein, any notice,
request, instruction or other document to be given hereunder by any party to any
other party shall be in writing and shall be delivered in person, by nationally

          Section 10.14 SCHEDULES. Each of the parties hereto shall (a) give

representation or warranty, and (b) give prompt notice to the other party of any

hereunder to the party receiving such notice. No notification under this Section
10.14 shall be deemed to cure any breach or default or event of default or
render any representation or warranty incomplete or inaccurate.
