3.2(a)   vii     AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF
MERGER, dated as of March 12, 2006 (this "AGREEMENT"), by and between NORTH
FORK BANCORPORATION, INC., a Delaware corporation ("NORTH FORK"), and CAPITAL
ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation ("CAPITAL ONE").   W I T
N E S S E T H:   WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of North Fork and Capital
One have determined that it is in the best interests of their respective
companies and their stockholders to consummate the strategic business
combination transaction provided for in this Agreement in which North Fork
will, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
merge with and into Capital One (the "MERGER"), so that Capital One is the
surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes referred to in such capacity
as the "SURVIVING CORPORATION"); and   WHEREAS, for federal income Tax
purposes, it is intended that the Merger shall qualify as a reorganization
under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the "CODE"), and this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted
as a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the
Code; and   WHEREAS, as an inducement and condition to the entrance of
Capital One into this Agreement, North Fork is granting to Capital One an
option pursuant to a stock option agreement in the form set forth in Exhibit
A (the "NORTH FORK OPTION AGREEMENT"); and   WHEREAS, as an inducement and
condition to the entrance of North Fork into this Agreement, Capital One is
granting to North Fork an option pursuant to a stock option agreement in the
form set forth in Exhibit B (the "CAPITAL ONE OPTION AGREEMENT" and, together
with the North Fork Option Agreement, the "OPTION AGREEMENTS"); and  
WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain
conditions to the Merger.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual
covenants, representations, warranties and agreements contained in this
Agreement, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally
bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:   ARTICLE I   THE
MERGER  1.1 THE MERGER. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the
"DGCL"), at the Effective Time, North Fork shall merge with and into Capital
One. Capital One shall be the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, and shall
continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State of Delaware. As
of the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of North Fork shall
cease.   1     (b) Capital One may at any time change the method of
effecting the combination (including by providing for the merger of North
Fork and a wholly owned subsidiary of Capital One) if and to the extent
requested by Capital One and consented to by North Fork (such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no such change shall (i)
alter or change the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration provided for
in this Agreement, (ii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of the Merger with
respect to North Fork\'s stockholders or (iii) materially impede or delay
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  1.2
EFFECTIVE TIME. The Merger shall become effective as set forth in
the certificate of merger (the "CERTIFICATE OF MERGER") that shall be filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on the Closing Date. The
term "EFFECTIVE TIME" shall be the date and time when the Merger becomes
effective as set forth in the Certificate of Merger, which, if the Closing
Date is September 29, 2006 or October 31, 2006, shall be 12:01 a.m. on the
first day of the month immediately following the Closing Date.  1.3 EFFECTS
OF THE MERGER. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the
effects set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL.  1.4 CONVERSION OF NORTH FORK
COMMON STOCK. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Capital One, North Fork or the holder of any of the
following securities:   (a) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of Capital One (the "CAPITAL ONE COMMON STOCK") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding
and shall not be affected by the Merger.   (b) All shares of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of North Fork issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (the "NORTH FORK COMMON STOCK") that are owned by
North Fork or Capital One (other than shares of North Fork Common Stock held
in trust accounts, managed accounts and the like, or otherwise held in a
fiduciary or agency capacity, that are beneficially owned by third parties
(any such shares, "TRUST ACCOUNT COMMON SHARES") and other than shares of
North Fork Common Stock held, directly or indirectly, by North Fork or
Capital One in respect of a debt previously contracted (any such shares, "DPC
COMMON SHARES")) shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no stock of
Capital One or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.   (c) Subject to Sections 1.4(e) and 1.5, each share of North
Fork Common Stock, except for shares of North Fork Common Stock owned by
North Fork or Capital One (other than Trust Account Common Shares and DPC
Common Shares), shall be converted, at the election of the holder thereof, in
accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.1, into the right to
receive the following, without interest:   (i) for each share of North Fork
Common Stock with respect to which an election to receive cash has been
effectively made and not revoked or deemed revoked pursuant to Article II (a
"CASH ELECTION"), the right to receive in cash from Capital One an amount
(the "CASH CONSIDERATION") equal to the Per Share Amount (collectively, the
"CASH ELECTION SHARES");   2     (ii) for each share of North Fork
Common Stock with respect to which an election to receive Capital One Common
Stock has been effectively made and not revoked or deemed revoked pursuant to
Article II (a "STOCK ELECTION"), the right to receive from Capital One the
fraction of a share of Capital One Common Stock (the "STOCK CONSIDERATION")
as is equal to the Exchange Ratio (collectively, the "STOCK ELECTION
SHARES"); and   (iii) for each share of North Fork Common Stock other than
shares as to which a Cash Election or a Stock Election has been effectively
made and not revoked or deemed revoked pursuant to Article II (collectively,
the "NON-ELECTION SHARES"), the right to receive from Capital One such
Stock Consideration and/or Cash Consideration as is determined in accordance
with Section 1.5(b).   "EXCHANGE RATIO" shall mean the quotient, rounded to
the nearest one ten thousandth, of (A) the Per Share Amount divided by (B)
the Capital One Closing Price.   "PER SHARE AMOUNT" shall mean the sum,
rounded to the nearest one-tenth of a cent, of (A) $11.25 plus (B) the
product, rounded to the nearest one tenth of a cent, of 0.2216 (the "SHARE
RATIO") times the Capital One Closing Price.   "CAPITAL ONE CLOSING PRICE"
shall mean the average, rounded to the nearest one tenth of a cent, of the
closing sale prices of Capital One Common Stock on the New York Stock
Exchange (the "NYSE") as reported by The Wall Street Journal for the five
trading days immediately preceding the date of the Effective Time.   "CASH
COMPONENT" shall mean $5.2 billion.   The Cash Consideration and the Stock
Consideration are sometimes referred to herein collectively as the "MERGER
CONSIDERATION."   (d) All of the shares of North Fork Common Stock converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article I
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall
cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and each certificate previously
representing any such shares of North Fork Common Stock (each, a
"CERTIFICATE") shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration and/or cash in lieu of fractional shares, into which the
shares of North Fork Common Stock represented by such Certificate have been
converted pursuant to this Section 1.4 and Section 2.3(f), as well as any
dividends to which holders of North Fork Common Stock become entitled in
accordance with Section 2.3(c).   (e) If, between the date of this Agreement
and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Capital One Common Stock
shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a
different number or kind of shares or securities as a result of a
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock
split, reverse stock split, or other similar change in capitalization, an
appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Share
Ratio.   (f) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this
Agreement, no shares of North Fork Common Stock that are issued and
outstanding as of the Effective Time and that are held by a stockholder who
has properly exercised such stockholder\'s appraisal rights   3    (any
such shares being referred to herein as "DISSENTING SHARES") under
Section 262 of the DGCL shall be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as provided in Section 1.4(c) and instead shall be
entitled to such rights (but only such rights) as are granted by Section 262
of the DGCL (unless and until such stockholder shall have failed to perfect,
or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost, such stockholder\'s right to
dissent from the Merger under the DGCL) and to receive such consideration as
may be determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant
to and subject to the requirements of the DGCL. If any such stockholder shall
have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right
prior to the Election Deadline, each of such holder\'s shares of North Fork
Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to be Non-Election Shares for all
purposes of this Agreement, unless such stockholder shall thereafter
otherwise make a timely Election under this Agreement. If any holder of
Dissenting Shares shall have so failed to perfect or has effectively
withdrawn or lost such stockholder\'s right to dissent from the Merger after
the Election Deadline, each of such holder\'s shares of North Fork Common
Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have
become, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Stock
Consideration or the Cash Consideration, or a combination thereof, as
determined by Capital One in its sole discretion. North Fork shall give
Capital One (i) prompt notice of any notice or demand for appraisal
or payment for shares of North Fork Common Stock received by North Fork and
(ii) the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to any such demand or notices. North Fork shall not,
without the prior written consent of Capital One, make any payment with
respect to, or settle, offer for settle or otherwise negotiate any such
demands.  1.5 PRORATION.   (a) Notwithstanding any other provision
contained in this Agreement, the total number of shares of North Fork Common
Stock (including North Fork Restricted Shares) to be converted into Cash
Consideration pursuant to Section 1.4 (which, for this purpose, shall be
deemed to include the Dissenting Shares determined as of the Effective Time)
(the "CASH CONVERSION NUMBER") shall be equal to the quotient obtained by
dividing (x) the Cash Component by (y) the Per Share Amount. All other shares
of North Fork Common Stock shall be converted into Stock Consideration (other
than shares of North Fork Common Stock to be cancelled as provided in Section
1.4(b)).   (b) Within five business days after the Effective Time, Capital
One shall cause the Exchange Agent (as defined below) to effect the
allocation among holders of North Fork Common Stock of rights to receive the
Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration as follows:   (i) If the
aggregate number of shares of North Fork Common Stock with respect to which
Cash Elections shall have been made (which, for this purpose, shall be deemed
to include the Dissenting Shares determined as of the Effective Time) (the
"CASH ELECTION NUMBER") exceeds the Cash Conversion Number, then all Stock
Election Shares and all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right
to receive the Stock Consideration, and Cash Election Shares of each holder
thereof will be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration in
respect of that number of Cash Election Shares equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (x) the number of Cash Election Shares held by such holder by
(y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Cash Conversion Number and the
denominator of which is the Cash   4    Election Number (with the
Exchange Agent to determine, consistent with Section 1.5(a), whether
fractions of Cash Election Shares shall be rounded up or down), with the
remaining number of such holder\'s Cash Election Shares being converted into
the right to receive the Stock Consideration; and   (ii) If the Cash
Election Number is less than the Cash Conversion Number (the amount by which
the Cash Conversion Number exceeds the Cash Election Number being referred to
herein as the "SHORTFALL NUMBER"), then all Cash Election Shares shall be
converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration and the Non-
Election Shares and Stock Election Shares shall be treated in the following
manner:   (A) If the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the number 
of Non-Election Shares, then all Stock Election Shares shall be  converted
into the right to receive the Stock Consideration, and the  Non-Election
Shares of each holder thereof shall convert into the  right to receive the
Cash Consideration in respect of that number of  Non-Election Shares equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (x)  the number of Non-Election Shares
held by such holder by (y) a  fraction, the numerator of which is the
Shortfall Number and the  denominator of which is the total number of Non-
Election Shares (with  the Exchange Agent to determine, consistent with
Section 1.5(a),  whether fractions of Non-Election Shares shall be rounded up
or down),  with the remaining number of such holder\'s Non-Election Shares
being  converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration; or  
(B) If the Shortfall Number exceeds the number of Non-Election  Shares, then
all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right  to receive the
Cash Consideration, and Stock Election Shares of each  holder thereof shall
convert into the right to receive the Cash  Consideration in respect of that
number of Stock Election Shares equal  to the product obtained by multiplying
(x) the number of Stock  Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a
fraction, the numerator  of which is the amount by which (1) the Shortfall
Number exceeds (2)  the total number of Non-Election Shares, and the
denominator of which  is the total number of Stock Election Shares (with the
Exchange Agent  to determine, consistent with Section 1.5(a), whether
fractions of  Stock Election Shares shall be rounded up or down), with the
remaining  number of such holder\'s Stock Election Shares being converted
into the  right to receive the Stock Consideration.  1.6 STOCK OPTIONS AND
OTHER STOCK-BASED AWARDS.   (a) As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each option
to purchase shares of North Fork Common Stock granted to employees or

(an "ADJUSTED OPTION") to purchase, on the same terms and conditions as
applied to each such North Fork Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time (taking into account any accelerated vesting of such North Fork Options
in accordance with the terms thereof), the number of whole shares of Capital
One Common Stock that is equal to the number of shares of North Fork Common
Stock subject to such North Fork Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole
share), at an exercise price per share of Capital One Common Stock (rounded
up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the exercise price for each such share
of North Fork Common Stock subject to such North Fork Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio.  
(b) As of the Effective Time, each restricted share of North Fork Common
Stock granted to any employee or director of North Fork or any of
its Subsidiaries under a North Fork Stock Plan that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the "NORTH FORK
RESTRICTED Shares") shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive (the "CAPITAL ONE RESTRICTED SHARE RIGHT"), on the same terms and
conditions as applied to each such North Fork Restricted Share immediately
prior to the Effective Time (including the same transfer restrictions taking
into account any accelerated vesting of such North Fork Restricted Shares),
the Merger Consideration determined in accordance with Sections 1.4 and 1.5
of this Agreement based on the holder\'s election in accordance with Section
2.1 of this Agreement, and treating such North Fork Restricted Shares in the
same manner as all other shares of North Fork Common Stock for such purposes;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, upon the lapsing of restrictions with respect to
each such Capital One Restricted Share Right in accordance with the terms
applicable to the corresponding North Fork Restricted Share immediately prior
to the Effective Time, Capital One shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld under the Code
and any applicable state or local tax law with respect to the lapsing of such
restrictions.   (c) As of the Effective Time, each deferred share with
respect to shares of North Fork Common Stock granted to any employee or
director of North Fork or any of its Subsidiaries under a North Fork Stock
Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(collectively, the "NORTH FORK DEFERRED SHARES") shall, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted
into a deferred share unit, on the same terms and conditions as applied to
each such North Fork Deferred Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time
(taking into account any accelerated vesting of such North Fork Deferred
Shares in accordance with the terms thereof), with respect to the number of
shares of Capital One Common Stock that is equal to the number of shares of
North Fork Common Stock subject to the North Fork Deferred Shares immediately
prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (rounded down to
the nearest whole share) (a "CAPITAL ONE SHARE UNIT").   6     (d) As
of the Effective Time, Capital One shall assume the obligations and succeed
to the rights of North Fork under the North Fork Stock Plans with respect to
the Adjusted Options, the Capital One Restricted Share Rights and the Capital
One Share Units. North Fork and Capital One agree that prior to the Effective
Time each of the North Fork Stock Plans shall be amended, to the extent
possible without requiring stockholder approval of such amendments, (i) if
and to the extent necessary and practicable, to reflect the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, but not limited to,
the conversion of North Fork Options, North Fork Restricted Shares, North
Fork Deferred Shares and each restricted share unit with respect to shares of
North Fork Common Stock granted to any employee or director of North Fork or
any of its Subsidiaries under a North Fork Stock Plan that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time pursuant to paragraphs (a), (b) and
(c) above and the substitution of Capital One for North Fork thereunder to
the extent appropriate to effectuate the assumption of such North Fork Stock
Plans by Capital One and (ii) to preclude any automatic or formulaic grant of
options, restricted shares or other awards thereunder on or after the date
hereof. From and after the Effective Time, all references to North Fork
(other than any references relating to a "change in control" of North Fork)
in each North Fork Stock Plan and in each agreement evidencing any award of
North Fork Options or North Fork Restricted Shares shall be deemed to refer
to Capital One, unless Capital One determines otherwise.   (e) Capital One
shall take all action reasonably necessary or appropriate to have available
for issuance or transfer a sufficient number of shares of Capital One Common
Stock for delivery upon exercise of the Adjusted Options or settlement of the
Capital One Share Units. Promptly after the Effective Time, Capital One shall
prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 (or other
appropriate form) registering a number of shares of Capital One Common Stock
necessary to fulfill Capital One\'s obligations under this paragraph
(e).  1.7 CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION OF CAPITAL ONE. At the Effective
Time, the Capital One Certificate (as defined in Section 4.1) shall be the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended in accordance with applicable law.  1.8 BYLAWS OF CAPITAL ONE. At
the Effective Time, the Capital One By-laws (as defined in Section 4.1) shall
be the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in
accordance with applicable law.  1.9 TAX CONSEQUENCES. It is intended that
the Merger shall constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code, and that this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of
reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.   ARTICLE
II   DELIVERY OF MERGER CONSIDERATION  2.1 ELECTION PROCEDURES. Each
holder of record of shares of North Fork Common Stock ("HOLDER") shall have
the right, subject to the limitations set forth in this Article II, to submit
an election in accordance with the following procedures:   7     (a)
Each Holder may specify in a request made in accordance with the provisions
of this Section 2.1 (herein called an "ELECTION") (i) the number of shares of
North Fork Common Stock owned by such Holder with respect to which such
Holder desires to make a Stock Election and (ii) the number of shares
of North Fork Common Stock owned by such Holder with respect to which such
Holder desires to make a Cash Election.   (b) Capital One shall prepare a
form reasonably acceptable to North Fork (the "FORM OF ELECTION") which shall
be mailed to record holders of North Fork Common Stock so as to permit those
holders to exercise their right to make an Election prior to the Election
Deadline.   (c) Capital One shall make the Form of Election initially
available not less than twenty (20) business days prior to the anticipated
Election Deadline and shall use all reasonable efforts to make available as
promptly as possible a Form of Election to any stockholder of North Fork who
requests such Form of Election following the initial mailing of the Forms of
Election and prior to the Election Deadline.   (d) Any Election shall have
been made properly only if the person authorized to receive Elections and to
act as exchange agent under this Agreement, which person shall be a bank or
trust company selected by Capital One and reasonably acceptable to North Fork
(the "EXCHANGE AGENT"), pursuant to an agreement (the "EXCHANGE AGENT
AGREEMENT") entered into prior to the mailing of the Form of Election to
North Fork stockholders, shall have received, by the Election Deadline, a
Form of Election properly completed and signed and accompanied by
Certificates to which such Form of Election relates or by an appropriate
customary guarantee of delivery of such certificates, as set forth in such
Form of Election, from a member of any registered national
securities exchange or a commercial bank or trust company in the United
States; provided, that such Certificates are in fact delivered to the
Exchange Agent by the time required in such guarantee of delivery. Failure to
deliver shares of North Fork Common Stock covered by such a guarantee of
delivery within the time set forth on such guarantee shall be deemed to
invalidate any otherwise properly made Election, unless otherwise determined
by Capital One, in its sole discretion. As used herein, unless otherwise
agreed in advance by the parties, "ELECTION DEADLINE" means 5:00 p.m. local
time (in the city in which the principal office of the Exchange Agent is
located) on the later of (1) the date of the meeting of North Fork
stockholders pursuant to Section 6.3 and (2) the earlier of (i) the date that
Capital One and North Fork shall agree is as near as practicable to five (5)
business days prior to the expected Closing Date taking into account Capital
One\'s intention to minimize the impact of limitations under applicable law
that might apply during the period from the initial mailing of the Forms
of Election until the Election Deadline and (ii) September 1, 2006; PROVIDED
that if it appears that the Closing Date will not take place on or prior to
October 13, 2006, the parties shall in good faith discuss whether such
September 1, 2006 date should be deferred to an appropriate later date. North
Fork and Capital One shall cooperate to issue a press release reasonably
satisfactory to each of them announcing the date of the Election Deadline not
more than fifteen (15) business days before, and at least five (5) business
days prior to, the Election Deadline.   (e) Any North Fork stockholder may,
at any time prior to the Election Deadline, change or revoke his or her
Election by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the
Election Deadline accompanied by a properly completed and signed revised Form
of Election. Subject to the terms of the Exchange Agent Agreement, if Capital
One shall determine in its reasonable discretion that any Election is not
properly made with respect to any shares of   8    North Fork Common
Stock (neither Capital One nor North Fork nor the Exchange Agent being under
any duty to notify any stockholder of any such defect), such Election shall
be deemed to be not in effect, and the shares of North Fork Common Stock
covered by such Election shall, for purposes hereof, be deemed to be Non-
Election Shares, unless a proper Election is thereafter timely made.   (f)
Any North Fork stockholder may, at any time prior to the Election Deadline,
revoke his or her Election by written notice received by the Exchange Agent
prior to the Election Deadline or by withdrawal prior to the
Election Deadline of his or her Certificates, or of the guarantee of delivery
of such Certificates, previously deposited with the Exchange Agent. All
Elections shall be automatically deemed revoked upon receipt by the Exchange
Agent of written notification from Capital One or North Fork that this
Agreement has been terminated in accordance with Article VIII.   (g)
Subject to the terms of the Exchange Agent Agreement, Capital One, in the
exercise of its reasonable discretion, shall have the right to make
all determinations, not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement,
governing (i) the validity of the Forms of Election and compliance by any
North Fork stockholder with the Election procedures set forth herein, (ii)
the manner and extent to which Elections are to be taken into account in
making the determinations prescribed by Section 1.5, (iii) the issuance and
delivery of certificates representing the whole number of shares of Capital
One Common Stock into which shares of North Fork Common Stock are converted
in the Merger and (iv) the method of payment of cash for shares of North Fork
Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration and
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Capital One Common Stock.  2.2 DEPOSIT
OF MERGER CONSIDERATION. At or prior to the Effective Time, Capital One shall
deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent,
(i) certificates representing the number of shares of Capital One Common
Stock sufficient to deliver, and Capital One shall instruct the Exchange
Agent to timely deliver, the aggregate Stock Consideration, and (ii)
immediately available funds equal to the aggregate Cash Consideration
(together with, to the extent then determinable, any cash payable in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.3(f)) (collectively, the "EXCHANGE
FUND") and Capital One shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely pay the
Cash Consideration, and such cash in lieu of fractional shares, in accordance
with this Agreement.  2.3 DELIVERY OF MERGER CONSIDERATION.   (a) As soon
as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall
mail to each holder of record of Certificate(s) which immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of North Fork Common Stock
whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 1.4 and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Capital One Common Stock to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor who did not properly complete and submit an Election
Form, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificate(s) shall pass, only upon
delivery of Certificate(s) (or affidavits of loss in lieu of such
Certificate(s))) (the "LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL") to the Exchange Agent and
shall be substantially in such form and have such other provisions as shall
be prescribed by the Exchange Agent Agreement and (ii) instructions for use
in surrendering Certificate(s) in exchange for the Merger Consideration
and   9    any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Capital One Common
Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor in accordance with
Section 2.3(f) upon surrender of such Certificate and any dividends or
distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.3(c).   (b) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of its
Certificate(s), accompanied by a properly completed Form of Election or a
properly completed Letter of Transmittal, a holder of North Fork Common Stock
will be entitled to receive, promptly after the Effective Time, the Merger
Consideration (elected or deemed elected by it, subject to, and in accordance
with Sections 1.4 and 1.5) and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Capital One Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor in
respect of the shares of North Fork Common Stock represented by its
Certificate(s). Until so surrendered, each such Certificate shall represent
after the Effective Time, for all purposes, only the right to receive,
without interest, the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Capital One Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration
therefor upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with, and any
dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to, this
Article II.   (c) No dividends or other distributions with respect to
Capital One Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to the shares of Capital One Common Stock
represented thereby, in each case unless and until the surrender of such
Certificate in accordance with this Article II. Subject to the effect of
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws, following surrender
of any such Certificate in accordance with this Article II the record holder
thereof shall be entitled to receive, without interest, (i) the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore payable with respect to the whole shares of Capital One Common
Stock represented by such Certificate and not paid and/or (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions
payable with respect to shares of Capital One Common Stock represented by
such Certificate with a record date after the Effective Time (but before such
surrender date) and with a payment date subsequent to the issuance of the
Capital One Common Stock issuable with respect to such Certificate.   (d) In
the event of a transfer of ownership of a Certificate representing North Fork
Common Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer records of North
Fork, the proper amount of cash and/or shares of Capital One Common Stock
shall be paid or issued in exchange therefor to a person other than the
person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if the
Certificate formerly representing such North Fork Common Stock shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person
requesting such payment or issuance shall pay any transfer or other similar
Taxes required by reason of the payment or issuance to a person other than
the registered holder of the Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of
Capital One that the Tax has been paid or is not applicable. The
Exchange Agent (or, subsequent to the first anniversary of the Effective
Time, Capital One) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any cash
portion of the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Capital One Common Stock, cash dividends or distributions payable pursuant to
Section 2.3(c) hereof and any other cash amounts otherwise payable pursuant
to this Agreement to any holder of North Fork Common Stock such amounts as
the Exchange Agent or Capital One, as the case may be, is required to deduct
and withhold under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax
law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent the amounts
are so withheld by the Exchange Agent or Capital One, as the case may be,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to    10    the holder of shares of North Fork Common
Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by the
Exchange Agent or Capital One, as the case may be.   (e) After the
Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of
North Fork of any shares of North Fork Common Stock that were issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than to settle
transfers of North Fork Common Stock that occurred prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such
shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Capital One Common Stock to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor in accordance with Section 1.5 and the procedures set
forth in this Article II.   (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, no certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of Capital One Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender of
Certificates for exchange, no dividend or distribution with respect to
Capital One Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any
fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Capital One.
In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, Capital One shall pay
to each former stockholder of North Fork who otherwise would be entitled to
receive such fractional share, an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest
whole cent) determined by multiplying (i) the Capital One Closing Price by
(ii) the fraction of a share (after taking into account all shares of North
Fork Common Stock held by such holder at the Effective Time and rounded to
the nearest one thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Capital One
Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive
pursuant to Section 1.4.   (g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains
unclaimed by the stockholders of North Fork as of the first anniversary of
the Effective Time shall be paid to Capital One. Any former stockholders of
North Fork who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall
thereafter look only to Capital One with respect to the Merger Consideration,
any cash in lieu of any fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and
distributions on the Capital One Common Stock deliverable in respect of each
share of North Fork Common Stock such stockholder holds as determined
pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Capital One, North Fork, the Exchange
Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of
North Fork Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
laws.   (h) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably
required by Capital One or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of
a bond in such amount as Capital One may determine is reasonably necessary as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect
thereof pursuant to this Agreement.   ARTICLE III   REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES OF NORTH FORK   11     Subject to Section 9.2 and except as
disclosed in the disclosure schedule (the "NORTH FORK DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE")
delivered by North Fork to Capital One prior to the execution of this
Agreement (which schedule sets forth, among other things, items, the
disclosure of which is necessary or appropriate, either in response to an
express disclosure requirement contained in a provision hereof or as an
exception to one or more representations or warranties contained in this
Article III, or to one or more of North Fork\'s covenants, provided, however,
that disclosure in any section of such North Fork Disclosure Schedule shall
apply only to the indicated Section of this Agreement except to the
extent that it is reasonably apparent that such disclosure is relevant to
another section of this Agreement, and provided further that notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no item is required to be set
forth in such schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty if its
absence would not result in the related representation or warranty being
deemed untrue or incorrect under the standard established by Section 9.2),
North Fork hereby represents and warrants to Capital One as follows:  3.1
CORPORATE ORGANIZATION.   (a) North Fork is a corporation duly incorporated,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of
Delaware. North Fork has the corporate power and authority to own or lease
all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now

securities of North Fork or any securities representing the right to purchase
or otherwise receive any shares of North Fork Common Stock, Voting Debt or
any other equity securities of North Fork or any North Fork Subsidiary. As of
the date of this Agreement, there are no contractual obligations of North
Fork or any North Fork Subsidiary (x) to repurchase, redeem or otherwise

by North Fork, directly or indirectly, free and clear of any material liens,
pledges, charges and security interests and similar encumbrances ("LIENS"),
and all of such shares or equity ownership interests are duly authorized and
validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable (subject to 12 U.S.C. ss.
55) and free of preemptive rights. No such North Fork Subsidiary has or is
bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments
or agreements of any character calling for the purchase or issuance of any
shares of capital stock or any other equity security of such Subsidiary or
any securities representing the right to purchase or otherwise receive
any shares of capital stock or any other equity security of such
Subsidiary.  3.3 AUTHORITY; NO VIOLATION. (a) North Fork has full corporate

a "GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY") are necessary in connection with the consummation by
North Fork of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Option Agreements. No consents or approvals of or filings or
registrations with any Governmental Entity are necessary in connection with
the execution and delivery by North Fork of this Agreement or the Option
Agreements.  3.5 REPORTS; REGULATORY MATTERS.   (a) North Fork and each
North Fork Subsidiary has timely filed all reports, registrations and
statements, together with any amendments required to be made with respect
thereto, that it was required to file since January 1, 2003 with (i) the
Federal Reserve Board, (ii) the FDIC, (iii) the Office of the Comptroller of
the Currency, (iv) the NASD, (v) any state insurance commission or other
state regulatory authority, including the NYSBD, (vi) the SEC, (vii) any
foreign regulatory authority and (viii) any SRO (collectively,
"REGULATORY AGENCIES") and with each other applicable Governmental Entity,
and all other reports and statements   15    required to be filed by
them since January 1, 2003, including any report or statement required to be
filed pursuant to the laws, rules or regulations of the United States, any
state, any foreign entity, or any Regulatory Agency or Governmental Entity,
and have paid all fees and assessments due and payable in connection
therewith. Except for normal examinations conducted by a Regulatory Agency or
Governmental Entity in the ordinary course of the business of North Fork and
its Subsidiaries, no Regulatory Agency or Governmental Entity has initiated
since January 1, 2003 or has pending any proceeding, enforcement action or,
to the knowledge of North Fork, investigation into the business, disclosures
or operations of North Fork or any North Fork Subsidiary. Since January 1,
2003, no Regulatory Agency or Governmental Entity has resolved
any proceeding, enforcement action or, to the knowledge of North Fork,
investigation into the business, disclosures or operations of North Fork or
any North Fork Subsidiary. There is no unresolved violation, criticism or
exception by any Regulatory Agency or Governmental Entity with respect to any
report or statement relating to any examinations or inspections of North Fork
or any North Fork Subsidiary. Since January 1, 2003, there has been no formal
or informal inquiries by, or disagreements or disputes with, any Regulatory
Agency or Governmental Entity with respect to the business, operations,
policies or procedures of North Fork or any North Fork Subsidiary.   (b)
Neither North Fork nor any North Fork Subsidiary is subject to any cease-and-
desist or other order or enforcement action issued by, or is a party to any
written agreement, consent agreement or memorandum of understanding with, or
is a party to any commitment letter or similar undertaking to, or is
subject to any order or directive by, or has been since January 1, 2003, a
recipient of any supervisory letter from, or has been ordered to pay any
civil money penalty by, or since January 1, 2003, has adopted any policies,
procedures or board resolutions at the request or suggestion of any,
Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity that currently restricts in
any material respect the conduct of its business or that in any material
manner relates to its capital adequacy, its ability to pay dividends, its
credit, risk management or compliance policies, its internal controls, its
management or its business, other than those of general application that
apply to similarly situated bank holding companies or their Subsidiaries
(each, a "NORTH FORK REGULATORY AGREEMENT"), nor has North Fork or any of its
Subsidiaries been advised since January 1, 2003 by any Regulatory Agency or
other Governmental Entity that it is considering issuing, initiating,
ordering, or requesting any such North Fork Regulatory Agreement. To the
knowledge of North Fork, as of the date hereof, there has not been any event
or occurrence since January 1, 2004 that would result in a determination that
either North Fork Bank or Superior Savings of New England, N.A. is not "well
capitalized" and "well managed" as a matter of U.S. federal banking law.  
(c) North Fork has previously made available to Capital One an accurate and
complete copy of (i) each final registration statement, prospectus, report,
schedule and definitive proxy statement filed with or furnished to the SEC by
North Fork since January 1, 2003 pursuant to the Securities Act or
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "EXCHANGE ACT"), and
prior to the date of this Agreement (the "NORTH FORK SEC REPORTS"), (ii)
each communication mailed by North Fork to its stockholders, in each case
since January 1, 2003 and prior to the date of this Agreement, and (iii) a
draft, dated March 7, 2006, of North Fork\'s Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the period ended December 31, 2005 (the "DRAFT 10-K"). North Fork will timely
file with the SEC its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended
December 31, 2005 (the "2005 10-K") and the 2005 10-K will not vary in any
material respect from the Draft 10-K provided to Capital One by North Fork,
except to the extent necessary to reflect this Agreement   16    and
the Option Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby. Neither any North Fork SEC Report or communication, at the time
filed, furnished or communicated (in the case of registration statements and
proxy statements, on the dates of effectiveness and the dates of the relevant
meetings, respectively), contained, nor will the 2005 10-K when filed
contain, any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were
made, not misleading, except that information as of a later date (but before
the date of this Agreement) shall be deemed to modify information as of an
earlier date. As of their respective dates, all North Fork SEC Reports
complied (and the 2005 10-K, when filed, will comply) as to form in all
material respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto. No executive officer of North Fork has failed in any respect
to make the certifications required of him or her under Section 302 or 906 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "SARBANES-OXLEY ACT") and all required
certifications under such sections will be made with respect to the 2005
10-K.  3.6 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.   (a) The financial statements of North
Fork and its Subsidiaries included (or incorporated by reference) in North
Fork SEC Reports (including the related notes, where applicable, and
including any preliminary financial results furnished to the SEC on Form 8-K)
(and the 2005 10-K, when filed will) (i) have been prepared from, and are (in
the case of the 2005 10-K, will be) in accordance with, the books and records
of North Fork and its Subsidiaries, (ii) fairly present in all material
respects the consolidated results of operations, cash flows, changes in
stockholders\' equity and consolidated financial position of North Fork and
its Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal periods or as of the respective
dates therein set forth (subject in the case of unaudited statements to
recurring year-end audit adjustments normal in nature and amount), (iii)
complied (in the case of the 2005 10-K, will comply) as to form, as of their
respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all material respects
with applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, and (iv) have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved,
except, in each case, as indicated in such statements or in the notes
thereto. The financial statements contained in the 2005 10-K will not vary in
any material respect from the financial statements included in the Draft
10-K, except for the inclusion of a subsequent events footnote with respect
to this Agreement, the Option Agreements and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby. The books and records of North Fork and its Subsidiaries
have been, and are being, maintained in all material respects in accordance
with GAAP and any other applicable legal and accounting requirements and
reflect only actual transactions. KPMG LLP has not resigned or been dismissed
as independent public accountants of North Fork as a result of or in
connection with any disagreements with North Fork on a matter of accounting
principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or
procedure.   (b) Neither North Fork nor any North Fork Subsidiary has any
material liability of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued,
contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due), except for those
liabilities that are reflected or reserved against on the consolidated
balance sheet of North Fork included in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for
the period ended September 30, 2005 (including any notes thereto) and for
liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice since September 30, 2005 or in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby.   17     (c) The records,
systems, controls, data and information of North Fork and its Subsidiaries
are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means (including any
electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether computerized or not)
that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control of North Fork or
its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access thereto and
therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control
that would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on
the system of internal accounting controls described below in this
Section 3.6(c). North Fork (x) has implemented and maintains disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to
ensure that material information relating to North Fork, including its
consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive officer and
the chief financial officer of North Fork by others within those entities,
and (y) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date
hereof, to North Fork\'s outside auditors and the audit committee of North
Fork\'s Board of Directors (i) any significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect North Fork\'s ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and (ii) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in North Fork\'s internal controls over financial
reporting. These disclosures were made in writing by management to North
Fork\'s auditors and audit committee and a copy has previously been made
available to Capital One. As of the date hereof, there is no reason to
believe that its outside auditors and its chief executive officer and chief
financial officer will not be able to give the certifications and
attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted
pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification,
when next due.   (d) Since December 31, 2004, (i) through the date hereof,
neither North Fork nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the knowledge of the
officers of North Fork, any director, officer, employee, auditor, accountant
or representative of North Fork or any of its Subsidiaries has received
or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the
accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of
North Fork or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting
controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim
that North Fork or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable
accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney representing North
Fork or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by North Fork or any
of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of
securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by North Fork
or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents to the Board of
Directors of North Fork or any committee thereof or to any director or
officer of North Fork.  3.7 BROKER\'S FEES. Neither North Fork nor any North
Fork Subsidiary nor any of their respective officers or directors has
employed any broker or finder or incurred any liability for any broker\'s
fees, commissions or finder\'s fees in connection with the Merger or related
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other than Sandler O\'Neill and
Partners, L.P. and Keefe, Bruyette and Woods, Inc. pursuant to the letter
agreements between North Fork and Sandler O\'Neill and Partners, L.P. and North
Fork and Keefe, Bruyette and Woods, Inc, true, complete and correct copies of

CERTAIN CHANGES OR EVENTS. (a) Since December 31, 2005, except as publicly
disclosed by North Fork in the North Fork SEC Reports filed or furnished
prior to the date hereof    18   or as disclosed in the Draft 10-K, no
event or events have occurred that have had or are reasonably likely to have,
either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on North
Fork. As used in this Agreement, the term "MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT" means,
with respect to Capital One, North Fork or the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, a material adverse effect on (i) the business, results of
operations or financial condition of such party and its Subsidiaries taken as
a whole (provided, however, that, with respect to this clause (i), Material
Adverse Effect shall not be deemed to include effects to the extent resulting
from (A) changes, after the date hereof, in generally accepted accounting
principles or regulatory accounting requirements applicable to banks or
savings associations and their holding companies generally, (B) changes,
after the date hereof, in laws, rules or regulations of general applicability
or interpretations thereof by courts or Governmental Entities, (C) changes,
after the date hereof, in global or national political conditions (including
the outbreak of war or acts of terrorism) or in general economic or market
conditions affecting banks or their holding companies generally except to the
extent that any such changes have a materially disproportionate
adverse effect on such party or (D) public disclosure of the transactions
contemplated hereby), or (ii) the ability of such party to timely consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (b) Since December 31,
2004, through and including the date of this Agreement, except as publicly
disclosed by North Fork in the North Fork SEC Reports filed or furnished
prior to the date hereof or as disclosed in the Draft 10-K, North Fork and
its Subsidiaries have carried on their respective businesses in all material
respects in the ordinary course of business consistent with their past
practice.   (c) Since December 31, 2004, neither North Fork nor any North
Fork Subsidiary has (i) except for (A) normal increases for employees (other

Exchange Act) made in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice, (B) as publicly disclosed by North Fork in North Fork SEC Reports

other than the customary year-end bonuses in amounts consistent with past
practice, (ii) granted any options to purchase shares of North Fork Common
Stock, any restricted shares of North Fork Common Stock or any right

the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice under North
Fork Stock Plans, (iii) changed any accounting methods, principles or
practices of North Fork or its Subsidiaries affecting, its assets,
liabilities or businesses, including any reserving, renewal or residual
method, practice or policy or (iv) suffered any strike, work stoppage, slow-

Fork nor any North Fork Subsidiary is a party to any, and there are no
pending or, to the best of North Fork\'s knowledge, threatened, material  
19    legal, administrative, arbitral or other material proceedings,
claims, actions or governmental or regulatory investigations of any nature
against North Fork or any of its Subsidiaries.   (b) There is no
Injunction, judgment, or regulatory restriction (other than those of general
application that apply to similarly situated bank holding companies or their
Subsidiaries) imposed upon North Fork, any of its Subsidiaries or the assets
of North Fork or any of its Subsidiaries.  3.10 TAXES AND TAX RETURNS. (a)
Each of North Fork and its Subsidiaries has duly and timely filed (including
all applicable extensions) all material Tax Returns required to be filed by
it on or prior to the date of this Agreement (all such returns being accurate
and complete in all material respects), has paid all Taxes shown thereon as
arising and has duly paid or made provision for the payment of all material
Taxes that have been incurred or are due or claimed to be due from it by
federal, state, foreign or local taxing authorities other than Taxes that are
not yet delinquent or are being contested in good faith, have not been
finally determined and have been adequately reserved against. The
federal, state and local income Tax returns of North Fork and its
Subsidiaries have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS")
and any applicable state and local tax authorities for all years to and
including 2000 and any liability with respect thereto has been satisfied or
any liability with respect to deficiencies asserted as a result of such
examination is covered by reserves that are adequate under GAAP. There are no
material disputes pending, or claims asserted, for Taxes or assessments upon
North Fork or any of its Subsidiaries for which North Fork does not have
reserves that are adequate under GAAP. Neither North Fork nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to or is bound by any Tax sharing, allocation or
indemnification agreement or arrangement (other than such an agreement or
arrangement exclusively between or among North Fork and its Subsidiaries).
Within the past five years, neither North Fork nor any of its Subsidiaries
has been a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" in a
distribution intended to qualify under Section 355(a) of the Code.
Neither North Fork nor any of its Subsidiaries is required to include in
income any adjustment pursuant to Section 481(a) of the Code, no such
adjustment has been proposed by the IRS and no pending request for permission
to change any accounting method has been submitted by North Fork or any of
its Subsidiaries. Section 3.10(a) of the North Fork Disclosure Schedule sets
forth the aggregate balance of the reserve for bad debts described in Section
593(g)(A)(ii) of the Code and any similar provision under state or local laws
and regulations of North Fork and its Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005.

receipts, gross income, ad valorem, profits, gains, property, capital, sales,
transfer, use, payroll, employment, severance, withholding, duties,
intangibles, franchise, backup withholding, and other taxes, charges, levies
or like assessments together with all penalties and additions to tax and
interest thereon and (ii) any liability for Taxes described in clause (i)
above under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of
state, local or foreign law).   (c) As used in this Agreement, the term "TAX
RETURN" means a report, return or other information (including any
amendments) required to be supplied to a governmental   20    entity

the North Fork Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true, complete and correct
list of each "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"),
whether or not subject to ERISA, and each employment, consulting, bonus,
incentive or deferred compensation, vacation, stock option or other equity-
based, severance, termination, retention, change of control, profit-sharing,
fringe benefit or other similar plan, program, agreement or commitment for
the benefit of any employee, former employee, director or former director of
North Fork or any North Fork Subsidiary entered into, maintained
or contributed to by North Fork or any North Fork Subsidiary or to which
North Fork or any North Fork Subsidiary may have any liability with respect
to current or former employees or directors of North Fork or any North Fork
Subsidiary (such plans, programs, agreements and commitments, herein referred
to as the "NORTH FORK BENEFIT PLANS").   (b) With respect to each North
Fork Benefit Plan, North Fork has made available to Capital One true,
complete and correct copies of the following (as applicable): (i) the written
document evidencing such North Fork Benefit Plan or, with respect to any such
plan that is not in writing, a written description thereof, (ii) the summary
plan description; (iii) the most recent annual report, financial statement
and/or actuarial report; (iv) the most recent determination letter from the
IRS; (v) the most recent Form 5500 required to have been filed with the IRS,
including all schedules thereto; (vi) any related trust agreements, insurance

Subsidiary has operated and administered each North Fork Benefit Plan in
compliance with all applicable laws and the terms of each such plan. The
terms of each North Fork Benefit Plan are in compliance with all applicable
laws. Each North Fork Benefit Plan that is intended to be "qualified" under
Section 401 and/or 409 of the Code has received a favorable determination
letter from the IRS to such effect and, to the knowledge of North Fork, no
fact, circumstance or event has occurred or exists since the date of such
determination letter that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect
the qualified status of any such North Fork Benefit Plan. There are no
pending or, to the knowledge of North Fork, threatened or anticipated claims
by, on behalf of or against any of the North Fork Benefit Plans or any assets
thereof (other than routine claims for benefits). All contributions, premiums
and other payments required to be made with respect to any North Fork Benefit
Plan have been made on or before their due dates under applicable law and the
terms of such North Fork Benefit Plan, and with respect to any
such contributions, premiums or other payments required to be made with
respect to any North Fork Benefit Plan that are not yet due, to the extent
required by GAAP, adequate reserves are reflected on the consolidated balance
sheet of North Fork included in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
quarter ended September 30, 2005 (including any notes thereto) or liability
therefor was incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice since September 30, 2005.   21     (d) With respect to the
North Fork Benefits Plans, neither North Fork nor any North Fork Subsidiary
has incurred or reasonably expects to incur, either directly or indirectly
(including as a result of an indemnification or joint and several liability
obligation), any liability under Title I or IV of ERISA or the penalty,
excise tax or joint and several liability provisions of the Code or any
foreign law or regulation relating to employee benefit plans, and, to the
knowledge of North Fork, no event, transaction or condition has occurred,
exists or is reasonably expected to occur which could reasonably be expected
to result in any such liability to North Fork, any North Fork Subsidiary or,
after the Closing, to Capital One. With respect to each North Fork Benefit
Plan which is an "employee pension benefit plan" (within the meaning of
Section 3(2) of ERISA): (i) no such plan is a "multiemployer plan" (within
the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA) or a "multiple employer plan" (within
the meaning of Section 413(c) of the Code), and (ii) no "reportable event"
(as defined in Section 4043 of ERISA) has occurred with respect to any such
plan within the past 12 months.   (e) Neither the execution or delivery of
this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will, either alone or in conjunction with any other event, (i)
result in any payment or benefit becoming due or payable, or required to be
provided, to any director, employee or independent contractor of North Fork
or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) increase the amount or value of any benefit
or compensation otherwise payable or required to be provided to any such
director, employee or independent contractor, (iii) result in the
acceleration of the time of payment, vesting or funding of any such benefit
or compensation or (iv) result in any amount failing to be deductible by
reason of Section 280G of the Code.   (f) No payment made or to be made in
respect of any employee or former employee of North Fork or any of its
Subsidiaries is or will be nondeductible by reason of Section 162(m) of the
Code.   (g) Neither North Fork nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to
or bound by any labor or collective bargaining agreement and there are
no organizational campaigns, petitions or other unionization activities
seeking recognition of a collective bargaining unit with respect to, or
otherwise attempting to represent, any of the employees of North Fork or any
of its Subsidiaries. There are no labor related controversies, strikes,
slowdowns, walkouts or other work stoppages pending or, to the knowledge of
North Fork, threatened and neither North Fork nor any of its Subsidiaries has
experienced any such labor related controversy, strike, slowdown, walkout or
other work stoppage within the past three years. Neither North Fork nor any
of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or otherwise bound by, any consent decree
with, or citation by, any Governmental Entity relating to employees or
employment practices. Each of North Fork and its Subsidiaries are in
compliance with all applicable laws, statutes, orders, rules, regulations,
policies or guidelines of any Governmental Entity relating to labor,
employment, termination of employment or similar matters and have not engaged
in any unfair labor practices or similar prohibited practices.   (h) On or
prior to the date hereof, North Fork has taken all necessary steps to ensure
that (a) the maximum amount payable under or with respect to the North Fork
Performance Plan (the "PERFORMANCE PLAN") (inclusive of all tax gross-ups) is
$50,000,000, and (b) none of John Kanas, John Bohlsen or Daniel Healy will
receive any payments or awards under or in connection with the Performance
Plan.   22    3.12 COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAW. (a) North Fork and
each North Fork Subsidiary holds all material licenses, franchises, permits
and authorizations necessary for the lawful conduct of their respective
businesses under and pursuant to each, and have complied in all respects with
and are not in default in any material respect under any, applicable law,
statute, order, rule, regulation, policy or guideline of any Governmental
Entity relating to North Fork or any of its Subsidiaries.   (b) North Fork
and each North Fork Subsidiary has properly administered all accounts for
which it acts as a fiduciary, including accounts for which it serves as a
trustee, agent, custodian, personal representative, guardian, conservator or
investment advisor, in accordance with the terms of the governing documents,
applicable state and federal law and regulation and common law. None of North
Fork, any North Fork Subsidiary, or any director, officer or employee of
North Fork or of any North Fork Subsidiary has committed any breach of trust
or fiduciary duty with respect to any such fiduciary account and
the accountings for each such fiduciary account are true and correct and
accurately reflect the assets of such fiduciary account.   (c) Since the
enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, North Fork has been and is in compliance
in all material respects with (i) the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act and (ii) the applicable listing and corporate governance rules and
regulations of the NYSE. Section 3.12(c) of North Fork Disclosure Schedule
sets forth, as of December 30, 2005, a schedule of all officers and directors
of North Fork who have outstanding loans from North Fork, and there has been
no default on, or forgiveness or waiver of, in whole or in part, any such
loan during the two years immediately preceding the date hereof.  3.13
CERTAIN CONTRACTS. (a) Neither North Fork nor any North Fork Subsidiary is a
party to or bound by any contract, arrangement, commitment or
understanding (whether written or oral) (i) with respect to the employment of
any directors, officers, employees or consultants, other than in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice, (ii) which, upon execution
of this Agreement or consummation or stockholder approval of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will (either alone or upon the
occurrence of any additional acts or events) result in any payment or
benefits (whether of severance pay or otherwise) becoming due from Capital
One, North Fork, the Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to any officer or employee of North Fork or any Subsidiary
thereof, (iii) that is a "material contract" (as such term is defined in Item

this Agreement that has not been filed or incorporated by reference in North
Fork SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof or (iv) that materially
restricts the conduct of any line of business by North Fork or, to the
knowledge of North Fork, upon consummation of the Merger will materially
restrict the ability of the Surviving Corporation to engage in any line of
business in which a bank holding company may lawfully engage. Each contract,
arrangement, commitment or understanding of the type described in
this Section 3.13, whether or not set forth in North Fork Disclosure
Schedule, is referred to as a "NORTH FORK CONTRACT," and neither North Fork
nor any of its Subsidiaries knows of, or has received notice of, any

(b) (i) Each North Fork Contract is valid and binding on North Fork or its
applicable Subsidiary and is in full force and effect, (ii) North Fork
and each North Fork Subsidiary has in all material respects performed
all obligations required to be performed by it to   23   date under each

rules, regulations and policies of any Regulatory Authority and in accordance
with the investment, securities, commodities, risk management and other
policies, practices and procedures employed by North Fork and its
Subsidiaries, and with counterparties believed at the time to be financially
responsible and able to understand (either alone or in consultation with
their advisers) and to bear the risks of such Derivative Transactions. All of
such Derivative Transactions are legal, valid and binding obligations of
North Fork or a North Fork Subsidiary enforceable against it in accordance
with their terms (except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
moratorium, reorganization or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors
generally and subject to general principles of equity), and are in full force
and effect. North Fork and each applicable North Fork Subsidiary have duly
performed their obligations under the Derivative Transactions to the extent
that such obligations to perform have accrued and, to North Fork\'s
knowledge, there are no breaches, violations or defaults or allegations or
assertions of such by any party thereunder.   (c) Except as set forth in
Section 3.14(c) of the North Fork Disclosure Schedule, as of January 1, 2003,
no Derivative Transaction, were it to be a Loan held by North Fork or any
North Fork Subsidiary, would be classified as "Other Loans Specially
Mentioned", "Special Mention", "Substandard", "Doubtful", "Loss", or words of
similar import ("NORTH FORK CRITICIZED ASSETS"). The financial position of
North Fork and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis under or with respect
to such Derivative Transaction has been reflected in the books and records of
North Fork and such North Fork Subsidiary in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied, and as of the date hereof, no open exposure of North
Fork and of any North Fork Subsidiary with respect to any such instrument (or
with respect to multiple instruments with respect to any single counterparty)
exceeds $500,000.  3.15 INVESTMENT SECURITIES AND COMMODITIES. (a) Each of
North Fork and each North Fork Subsidiary has good title to all securities
and commodities owned by it (except those sold under repurchase agreements or
held in any fiduciary or agency capacity), free and clear of any Lien, except
to the extent such securities or commodities are pledged in the ordinary
course of   24    business to secure obligations of North Fork or its
Subsidiaries. Such securities and commodities are valued on the books of
North Fork in accordance with GAAP in all material respects.   (b) North
Fork and its Subsidiaries and their respective businesses employ investment,
securities, commodities, risk management and other policies, practices and
procedures (the "POLICIES, PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES") which North Fork
believes are prudent and reasonable in the context of such businesses. Prior
to the date hereof, North Fork has made available to Capital One in writing
the material Policies, Practices and Procedures.  3.16 LOAN PORTFOLIO. (a)
Section 3.16(a) of the North Fork Disclosure Schedule sets forth (i) the
aggregate outstanding principal amount, as of December 31, 2005, of all
written or oral loan agreements, notes or borrowing arrangements (including
leases, credit enhancements, commitments, guarantees and interest-bearing
assets) payable to North Fork or its Subsidiaries (collectively, "LOANS"),
other than "non-accrual" Loans, and (ii) the aggregate outstanding principal
amount, as of December 31, 2005, of all "non-accrual" Loans. As of December
31, 2005, North Fork and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, did not have
outstanding Loans and assets classified as "Other Real Estate Owned" with an
aggregate then outstanding, fully committed principal amount in excess of
that amount set forth on Section 3.16(a) of the North Fork Disclosure
Schedule, net of specific reserves with respect to such Loans and assets,
that were designated as of such date by North Fork as North Fork Criticized
Assets. Section 3.16(a) of the North Fork Disclosure Schedule sets forth (A)
a summary of North Fork Criticized Assets as of December 31, 2005,
by category of Loan (e.g., commercial, consumer, etc.), together with the
aggregate principal amount of such Loans by category and the amount of
specific reserves with respect to each such category of Loan and the amount
of reserves with respect to each such category of Loans and (B) each asset of
North Fork or any of its Subsidiaries that, as of December 31, 2005, is
classified as "Other Real Estate Owned" and the book value thereof.   (b)
Each Loan (i) is evidenced by notes, agreements or other evidences of
indebtedness which are true, genuine and what they purport to be, (ii) to
the extent secured, has been secured by valid liens and security interests
which have been perfected and (iii) is the legal, valid and binding
obligation of the obligor named therein, enforceable in accordance with its
terms (except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium,
reorganization or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally
and subject to general principles of equity). All Loans originated by North
Fork or its Subsidiaries, and all such Loans purchased, administered or
serviced by North Fork or its Subsidiaries (including Loans held for resale
to investors), were made or purchased and are administered or serviced, as
applicable, in accordance with customary lending standards of North Fork or
its Subsidiaries, as applicable (and in the case of Loans held for resale to
investors, the lending standards, if any, of such investors) and in
accordance with applicable federal, state and local laws, regulations and
rules. All such Loans (and any related guarantees) and payments due
thereunder are, and on the Closing Date will be, free and clear of any
Lien, and North Fork or its Subsidiaries has complied in all material
respects, and on the Closing Date will have complied in all material
respects, with all laws and regulations relating to such Loans.   (c) None
of the agreements pursuant to which North Fork or any of its Subsidiaries has
sold Loans or pools of Loans or participations in Loans or pools of Loans  
25    contains any obligation to repurchase such Loans or interests
therein solely on account of a payment default by the obligor on any such
Loan.   (d) Each of North Fork and each North Fork Subsidiary, as
applicable, is approved by and is in good standing (i) as a supervised
mortgagee by the Department of Housing and Urban Development to originate and
service Title I FHA mortgage loans; (ii) as a GNMA I and II Issuer by the
Government National Mortgage Association; (iii) by the Department of
Veteran\'s Affairs to originate and service VA loans; and (iv) as a
seller/servicer by the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal
Home Loan Mortgage Corporation to originate and service conventional
residential mortgage Loans (each such entity being referred to herein as an
"AGENCY" and, collectively, the "AGENCIES").   (e) None of North Fork or any
of its Subsidiaries is now nor has it ever been since December 31, 2003
subject to any fine, suspension, settlement or other agreement or other
administrative agreement or sanction by, or any reduction in any loan
purchase commitment from any Agency or any federal or state agency relating
to the origination, sale or servicing of mortgage or consumer Loans. Neither
North Fork nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any notice, nor does it
have any reason to believe, that any Agency proposes to limit or terminate
the underwriting authority of North Fork or any of its Subsidiaries or to
increase the guarantee fees payable to any such Agency.   (f) Each of North
Fork and its Subsidiaries is in compliance in all material respects with all
applicable federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations, including
the Truth-In-Lending Act and Regulation Z, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act
and Regulation B, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and Regulation X,
the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and all
Agency and other investor and mortgage insurance company requirements
relating to the origination, sale and servicing of mortgage and consumer
Loans.   (g) To the knowledge of North Fork, each Loan included in a pool
of Loans originated, acquired or serviced by North Fork or any of its
Subsidiaries (a "POOL") meets all eligibility requirements (including all
applicable requirements for obtaining mortgage insurance certificates and
loan guaranty certificates) for inclusion in such Pool. All such Pools have
been finally certified or, if required, recertified in accordance with all
applicable laws, rules and regulations, except where the time for
certification or recertification has not yet expired. To the knowledge of
North Fork, no Pools have been improperly certified, and no Loan has been
bought out of a Pool without all required approvals of the applicable
investors.  3.17 PROPERTY. North Fork or a North Fork Subsidiary (a) has
good and marketable title to all the properties and assets reflected in the

infringe on or otherwise violate the rights of any person and is in
accordance with any applicable license pursuant to which North Fork or any
North Fork Subsidiary acquired the right to use any Intellectual Property. No
person is challenging, infringing on or otherwise violating any right of
North Fork or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any Intellectual
Property owned by and/or licensed to North Fork or its Subsidiaries. Neither
North Fork nor any North Fork Subsidiary has received any written notice of
any pending claim with respect to any Intellectual Property used by North
Fork or any North Fork Subsidiary and no Intellectual Property owned and/or

in a manner that would be expected to result in the abandonment, cancellation
or unenforceability of such Intellectual Property. For purposes of this
Agreement, "INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY" means trademarks, service marks, brand

Subsidiaries arising under common law or   27    under any local, state
or federal environmental, health or safety statute, regulation or ordinance,
including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and

any Governmental Entity or any third party that would give rise to
any liability or obligation on the part of North Fork or any of its

general application that apply to similarly situated bank holding companies
or their Subsidiaries (each, a "CAPITAL ONE REGULATORY AGREEMENT"), nor has
Capital One or any of its Subsidiaries been advised since January 1, 2003, by
any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity that it is considering

an accurate and complete copy of each (i) final registration statement,
prospectus, report, schedule and definitive proxy statement filed with or
furnished to the SEC by Capital One pursuant to the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act and prior to the date of this Agreement (the "CAPITAL ONE SEC
REPORTS") and (ii) communication mailed by Capital One to its stockholders,
in each case since January 1, 2003 and prior to the date of this Agreement.
No such Capital One SEC Report or communication, at the time filed, furnished
or communicated (and, in the case of registration statements and proxy
statements, on the dates of effectiveness and the dates of the relevant
meetings, respectively), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances
in which they were made, not misleading, except that  
34    information as of a later date (but before the date of this
Agreement) shall be deemed to modify information as of an earlier date. As of
their respective dates, all Capital One SEC Reports complied as to form in
all material respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC
with respect thereto. No executive officer of Capital One has failed in any
respect to make the certifications required of him or her under Section 302
or 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.  4.6 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.   (a) The
financial statements of Capital One and its Subsidiaries included (or
incorporated by reference) in the Capital One SEC Reports (including the
related notes, where applicable, and including any preliminary financial
results furnished to the SEC on Form 8-K) (i) have been prepared from, and
are in accordance with, the books and records of Capital One and
its Subsidiaries; (ii) fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated results of operations, cash flows, changes in stockholders\'
equity and consolidated financial position of Capital One and its
Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal periods or as of the respective dates
therein set forth (subject in the case of unaudited statements to recurring
year-end audit adjustments normal in nature and amount); (iii) complied as to
form, as of their respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules
and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto; and (iv) have been prepared

except, in each case, as indicated in such statements or in the notes
thereto. The books and records of Capital One and its Subsidiaries have been,
and are being, maintained in all material respects in accordance with GAAP
and any other applicable legal and accounting requirements and reflect only
actual transactions. Ernst and Young LLP has not resigned or been dismissed as
independent public accountants of Capital One as a result of or in connection
with any disagreements with Capital One on a matter of accounting principles
or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or
procedure.   (b) Neither Capital One nor any Capital One Subsidiary has
any material liability of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute,
accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due), except
for those liabilities that are reflected or reserved against on the
consolidated balance sheet of Capital One included in its Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2005 (including any notes
thereto) and for liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice since December 31, 2005 or in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.   (c) The records,
systems, controls, data and information of Capital One and its Subsidiaries
are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means (including any
electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether computerized or not)
that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control of Capital One or
its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access thereto and
therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control
that would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on
the system of internal accounting controls described below in this
Section 4.6(c). Capital One (x) has implemented and maintains disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to
ensure that material information relating to Capital One, including its
consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive officer and
the chief financial officer of Capital One by others within those entities,

hereof, to Capital One\'s outside auditors and the audit   
35    committee of Capital One\'s Board of Directors (i) any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect Capital One\'s
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and
(ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in Capital One\'s internal controls
over financial reporting. These disclosures were made in writing by
management to Capital One\'s auditors and audit committee and a copy has
previously been made available to North Fork. As of the date hereof, there is
no reason to believe that its outside auditors and its chief executive
officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give the
certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules
and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,
without qualification, when next due.   (d) Since December 31, 2005, (x)
through the date hereof, neither Capital One nor any of its Subsidiaries nor,
to the knowledge of the officers of Capital One, any director, officer,
employee, auditor, accountant or representative of Capital One or any of its
Subsidiaries has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any
material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral,
regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or
methods of Capital One or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective
internal accounting controls, including any material complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim that Capital One or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in
questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (y) no attorney
representing Capital One or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed
by Capital One or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a
material violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar
violation by Capital One or any of its officers, directors, employees or
agents to the Board of Directors of Capital One or any committee thereof or
to any director or officer of Capital One.  4.7 BROKER\'S FEES. Neither
Capital One nor any Capital One Subsidiary nor any of their respective

have had or are reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Capital One.   (b) Since December 31, 2005 through and including the date of

One SEC Reports filed or furnished prior to the date hereof, Capital One and
its Subsidiaries have carried on their respective businesses in all
material respects in the ordinary course of business consistent with their
past practice.  4.9 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. (a) Neither Capital One nor any
Capital One Subsidiary is a party to any, and there are no pending or, to the
best of Capital One\'s knowledge, threatened, material legal, administrative,
arbitral or other material proceedings, claims, actions or governmental or
regulatory investigations of any nature against Capital One or any of its
Subsidiaries.   36     (b) There is no Injunction, judgment, or
regulatory restriction (other than those of general application that apply to
similarly situated bank holding companies or their Subsidiaries) imposed upon
Capital One, any of its Subsidiaries or the assets of Capital One or any of
its Subsidiaries.  4.10 TAXES AND TAX RETURNS. Each of Capital One and its

incurred or are due or claimed to be due from it by federal, state, foreign
or local taxing authorities other than Taxes that are not yet delinquent or

been adequately reserved against. There are no material disputes pending, or
claims asserted, for Taxes or assessments upon Capital One or any of its
Subsidiaries for which Capital One does not have reserves that are adequate
under GAAP.  4.11 COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAW. (a) Capital One and each
Capital One Subsidiary hold all material licenses, franchises, permits and
authorizations necessary for the lawful conduct of their respective
businesses under and pursuant to each, and have complied in all respects with
and are not in default in any material respect under any, applicable law,
statute, order, rule, regulation, policy or guideline of any Governmental
Entity relating to Capital One or any of its Subsidiaries.   (b) Capital
One and each Capital One Subsidiary has properly administered all accounts
for which it acts as a fiduciary, including accounts for which it serves as a
trustee, agent, custodian, personal representative, guardian, conservator or
investment advisor, in accordance with the terms of the governing documents,
applicable state and federal law and regulation and common law. None of
Capital One, any Capital One Subsidiary, or any director, officer or employee
of Capital One or of any Capital One Subsidiary has committed any breach of
trust or fiduciary duty with respect to any such fiduciary account and the
accountings for each such fiduciary account are true and correct
and accurately reflect the assets of such fiduciary account.   (c) Since
the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Capital One has been and is in
compliance in all material respects with (i) the applicable provisions of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) the applicable listing and corporate governance
rules and regulations of the NYSE. Section 4.11(c) of the Capital One
Disclosure Schedule sets forth, as of the date hereof, a schedule of all
officers and directors of Capital One who have outstanding loans from Capital
One, and there has been no default on, or forgiveness or waiver of, in whole
or in part, any such loan during the two years immediately preceding the date
hereof.  4.12 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. Capital One and each of Capital One
Subsidiary owns, or is licensed to use (in each case, free and clear of any
Liens), all Intellectual Property used in or necessary for the conduct of its
business as currently conducted. The use of any Intellectual Property by
Capital One and each Capital One Subsidiary does not, to the knowledge of
Capital One, infringe on or otherwise violate the rights of any person and is
in accordance with any applicable license pursuant to which Capital One or
any Capital One Subsidiary acquired the right to use any Intellectual
Property. No person is challenging, infringing on or otherwise  
37    violating any right of Capital One or any Capital One Subsidiary
with respect to any Intellectual Property owned by and/or licensed to Capital
One or its Subsidiaries. Neither Capital One nor any Capital One Subsidiary
has received any written notice of any pending claim with respect to any
Intellectual Property used by Capital One or any Capital One Subsidiary and
no Intellectual Property owned and/or licensed by Capital One or any Capital
One Subsidiary is being used or enforced in a manner that would be expected
to result in the abandonment, cancellation or unenforceability of such
Intellectual Property.  4.13 CERTAIN CONTRACTS. (a) Neither Capital One nor
any Capital One Subsidiary is a party to or bound by any contract,
arrangement, commitment or understanding (whether written or oral) (i) that
is a "material contract" (as such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of
Regulation S-K of the SEC) to be performed after the date of this Agreement
that has not been filed or incorporated by reference in the Capital One SEC
Reports filed prior to the date hereof or (ii) that materially restricts the
conduct of any line of business by Capital One or, to the knowledge of
Capital One, upon consummation of the Merger will materially restrict the
ability of the Surviving Corporation to engage in any line of business in
which a bank holding company may lawfully engage. Each contract, arrangement,
commitment or understanding of the type described in this Section 4.13(a),
whether or not set forth in the Capital One Disclosure Schedule, is referred

its Subsidiaries knows of, or has received notice of, any violation of any

Capital One or any of its Subsidiaries under any such Capital One
Contract.  4.14 RISK MANAGEMENT INSTRUMENTS. All Derivative Transactions

Option), whether entered into for the account of Capital One or any Capital
One Subsidiary or for the account of a customer of Capital One or any Capital
One Subsidiary, were duly authorized and entered into in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practice and in accordance with prudent
banking practice and applicable laws, rules, regulations and policies of any
Regulatory Authority and in accordance with the investment, securities,
commodities, risk management and other policies, practices and procedures
employed by Capital One and its Subsidiaries, and with counterparties
believed at the time to be financially responsible and able to understand
(either alone or in consultation with their advisers) and to bear the risks
of such Derivative Transactions. All of such Derivative Transactions are
legal, valid and binding obligations of Capital One or a Capital One
Subsidiary enforceable against it in accordance with their terms (except as
may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or
similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and subject to
general principles of equity), and are in full force and effect. Capital One
and each applicable Capital One Subsidiary have duly performed
their obligations under the Derivative Transactions to the extent that
such obligations to perform have accrued and, to Capital One\'s knowledge,
there are no breaches, violations or defaults or allegations or assertions of
such by any party thereunder.    38    4.15 INVESTMENT SECURITIES AND
COMMODITIES. (a) Each of Capital One and each Capital One Subsidiary has good
title to all securities and commodities owned by it (except those sold under

pledged in the ordinary course of business to secure obligations of Capital
One or its Subsidiaries. Such securities and commodities are valued on the
books of Capital One in accordance with GAAP in all material respects.

business) (the "CAPITAL ONE OWNED PROPERTIES"), free and clear of all Liens
of any nature whatsoever, except Permitted Encumbrances, and (b) is the
lessee of all leasehold estates reflected in the latest audited financial
statements included in such Capital One SEC Reports or acquired after the

the Capital One Owned Properties, the "CAPITAL ONE REAL PROPERTY"), free and
clear of all Liens of any nature whatsoever, except for Permitted
Encumbrances, and is in possession of the properties purported to be leased
thereunder, and each such lease is valid without default thereunder by the

result in, any liability or obligation of Capital One or any of its
Subsidiaries arising under common law or under any local, state or federal
environmental, health or safety statute, regulation or ordinance, including
the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of
1980, as amended, pending or threatened against Capital One or any of its
Subsidiaries. To the knowledge of Capital One, there is no reasonable basis
for, or circumstances that are reasonably likely to give rise to, any such
proceeding, claim, action, investigation or remediation by any Governmental
Entity or any third party that would give rise to any liability or obligation
on the part of Capital One or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither Capital One
nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any agreement, order, judgment,

or third party imposing any liability or obligation with respect to any of
the foregoing.  4.18 REORGANIZATION; APPROVALS. As of the date of this

could reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and (b)

promptly prepare and file with the SEC the Form S-4, in which the Joint Proxy
Statement will be included as a prospectus. Each of Capital One and North
Fork shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the Form S-4 declared
effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such
filing, and Capital One and North Fork shall thereafter mail or deliver the
Joint Proxy Statement to its respective stockholders. Capital One shall file
the opinion described in Section 7.3(c) on a post-effective amendment to the
Form S-4. Capital One shall also use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
all necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals
required to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
North Fork shall furnish all information concerning North Fork and the
holders of North Fork Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in
connection with any such action.   43     (b) The parties shall
cooperate with each other and use their respective reasonable best efforts to
promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation, to effect all
applications, notices, petitions and filings, to obtain as promptly as
practicable all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third
parties and Governmental Entities that are necessary or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
Merger), and to comply with the terms and conditions of all such permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations of all such third parties, Regulatory
Agencies or Governmental Entities. North Fork and Capital One shall have the
right to review in advance, and, to the extent practicable, each will consult
the other on, in each case subject to applicable laws relating to
the confidentiality of information, all the information relating to North
Fork or Capital One, as the case may be, and any of their respective
Subsidiaries, which appear in any filing made with, or written materials
submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing
right, each of the parties shall act reasonably and as promptly as
practicable. The parties shall consult with each other with respect to the
obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third
parties and Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the
other apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing contained herein shall be deemed to require Capital One to take any
action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or
restriction, in connection with obtaining the foregoing permits, consents,
approvals and authorizations of Governmental Entities, that would reasonably
be expected to have a material adverse effect (measured on a scale relative
to North Fork) on either Capital One or North Fork (a "MATERIALLY BURDENSOME
REGULATORY CONDITION").   (c) Each of Capital One and North Fork shall, upon
request, furnish to the other all information concerning itself, its
Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and such other matters as
may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Joint Proxy
Statement, the Form S-4 or any other statement, filing, notice or application

Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (d) Each of Capital
One and North Fork shall promptly advise the other upon receiving any
communication from any Regulatory Agency or Governmental Entity consent or
approval of which is required for consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement that causes such party to believe that there
is a reasonable likelihood that any Capital One Requisite Regulatory Approval
or North Fork Requisite Regulatory Approval, respectively, will not
be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval may be materially
delayed.   (e) North Fork shall cooperate with such reasonable requests as
may be made by Capital One with respect to any post-Closing reorganization of
Capital One\'s and North Fork\'s Subsidiaries, including filing prior to the
Closing such applications with Regulatory Agencies or Governmental Entities
as may be necessary or desirable in connection with any such
reorganization.  6.2 ACCESS TO INFORMATION. (a) Upon reasonable notice and
subject to applicable laws relating to the confidentiality of information,
each of North Fork and Capital One shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel,  
44    advisors, agents and other representatives of the other party,
reasonable access, during normal business hours during the period prior to
the Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments and
records, and, during such period, such party shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, make available to the other party (i) a copy of each report,
schedule, registration statement and other document filed or received by it
during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal securities laws or
federal or state banking or insurance laws (other than reports or documents
that such party is not permitted to disclose under applicable law) and (ii)
all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as
the other party may reasonably request (in the case of a request by North
Fork, information concerning Capital One that is reasonably related to the
prospective value of Capital One Common Stock or to Capital One\'s ability to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby). Neither North Fork nor
Capital One, nor any of its Subsidiaries, shall be required to provide access
to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would
jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of such party or its Subsidiaries or
contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty
or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The
parties shall make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under
circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.  
(b) All information and materials provided pursuant to this Agreement shall
be subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement entered
into between the parties as of March 7, 2006 (the "CONFIDENTIALITY
AGREEMENT").   (c) No investigation by a party hereto or its representatives
shall affect the representations and warranties of the other party set forth
in this Agreement.  6.3 STOCKHOLDER APPROVALS. Each of North Fork and
Capital One shall call a meeting of its stockholders to be held as soon as
reasonably practicable for the purpose of obtaining the requisite stockholder
approvals required in connection with this Agreement and the Merger, and each
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such meetings to occur as soon
as reasonably practicable and on the same date. The Board of Directors of
each of North Fork and Capital One shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain from its respective stockholders the stockholder vote in favor of the
approval and adoption of this Agreement required to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of North Fork and Capital
One agree that they have an unqualified obligation to submit this Agreement
to their respective stockholders at their respective stockholder
meetings.  6.4 AFFILIATES. North Fork shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause each director, executive officer and other person who is an
"affiliate" (for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act) of North Fork
to deliver to Capital One, as soon as practicable after the date of this
Agreement, and prior to the date of the meeting of North Fork stockholders to
be held pursuant to Section 6.3, a written agreement, in the form of Exhibit
A.  6.5 NYSE LISTING. Capital One shall cause the shares of Capital One
Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the
NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective
Time.  6.6 EMPLOYEE MATTERS. (a) For the one-year period following the
Effective Time, Capital One shall, or shall cause its applicable Subsidiaries
to, provide to those individuals actively   45    employed by North
Fork or one of its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (collectively, the
"COVERED EMPLOYEES") with employee benefits, rates of base salary or hourly
wage and annual bonus opportunities that are substantially similar, in the
aggregate, to the aggregate rates of base salary or hourly wage provided to
such Covered Employees and the aggregate employee benefits and annual bonus
opportunities provided to such Covered Employees under the North Fork Benefit
Plans as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time; PROVIDED that
nothing herein shall limit the right of Capital One or any of
its Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any Covered Employee at any
time or require Capital One or any of its Subsidiaries to provide any such
employee benefits, rates of base salary or hourly wage or annual bonus
opportunities for any period following any such termination.   (b) To the
extent that a Covered Employee becomes eligible to participate in an employee
benefit plan maintained by Capital One or any of its Subsidiaries, other than
North Fork or its Subsidiaries, Capital One shall cause such employee benefit
plan to (i) recognize the service of such Covered Employee with North Fork or
its Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility and vesting and, except under
defined benefit pension plans, benefit accrual under such employee benefit
plan of Capital One or any of its Subsidiaries to the same extent
such service was recognized immediately prior to the Effective Time under
a comparable North Fork Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee was
a participant immediately prior to the Effective Time or, if there is no
such comparable benefit plan, to the same extent such service was recognized
under the North Fork 401(k) plan immediately prior to the Effective Time,
PROVIDED that such recognition of service shall not operate to duplicate any
benefits payable to the Covered Employee with respect to the same period of
service, and (ii) with respect to any health, dental or vision plan of
Capital One or any of its Subsidiaries (other than North Fork and its
Subsidiaries) in which any Covered Employee is eligible to participate in the
plan year that includes the year in which such Covered Employee is eligible
to participate, (x) cause any pre-existing condition limitations under such
Capital One or Subsidiary plan to be waived with respect to such Covered
Employee to the extent such limitation would have been waived or satisfied
under the North Fork Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee participated
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (y) recognize any medical or
other health expenses incurred by such Covered Employee in the year that
includes the Closing Date for purposes of any applicable deductible and
annual out-of-pocket expense requirements under any such health, dental or
vision plan of Capital One or any of its Subsidiaries.   (c) From and after
the Effective Time, Capital One shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
honor, in accordance with the terms thereof as in effect as of the date
hereof or as may be amended after the date hereof as permitted under Section
5.2, each employment agreement and change in control agreement listed on
Section 3.11 of the North Fork Disclosure Schedule and the obligations of
North Fork and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time under the
Performance Plan and each deferred compensation plan or agreement listed
on Section 3.11 of the North Fork Disclosure Schedule; provided, that,
nothing herein will prevent Capital One from amending any such agreement or
plan in accordance with its terms, including such amendments as may be
necessary to avoid the imposition of a Tax under Section 409A of the Code.
Capital One agrees to take all action necessary to effectuate and satisfy the
obligations set forth in Section 6.6(c) of the North Fork Disclosure
Schedule.  6.7 INDEMNIFICATION; DIRECTORS\' AND OFFICERS\' INSURANCE.  
46     (a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative
(a "CLAIM"), including any such Claim in which any individual who is now, or
has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement, or who becomes
prior to the Effective Time, a director, officer or employee of North Fork or
any North Fork Subsidiary or who is or was serving at the request of North
Fork or any North Fork Subsidiary as a director, officer or employee of
another person (the "INDEMNIFIED PARTIES"), is, or is threatened to be, made
a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of,
or pertaining to (i) the fact that he is or was a director, officer or
employee of North Fork or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time
or (ii) this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, whether asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time,
the parties shall cooperate and use their best efforts to defend against and
respond thereto. All rights to indemnification and exculpation from
liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
now existing in favor of any Indemnified Party as provided in their
respective certificates or articles of incorporation or by-laws (or
comparable organizational documents), and any existing indemnification
agreements set forth in Section 6.7 of North Fork Disclosure Schedule, shall
survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms, and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified
after the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of such individuals for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time or taken at the request of Capital One pursuant to Section
6.8 hereof, it being understood that nothing in this sentence shall require
any amendment to the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation.   (b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to,
each Indemnified Party against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses,
liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement of or in
connection with any Claim based in whole or in part on or arising in whole or
in part out of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or
employee of North Fork or any Subsidiary of North Fork, and pertaining to any
matter existing or occurring, or any acts or omissions occurring, at or prior
to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, or at or after,
the Effective Time (including matters, acts or omissions occurring in
connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby) or taken at the request of Capital One
pursuant to Section 6.8 hereof.   (c) Capital One shall cause the
individuals serving as officers and directors of North Fork or any of its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time to be covered for a
period of six years from the Effective Time by the directors\' and officers\'
liability insurance policy maintained by North Fork (PROVIDED that Capital
One may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and
amounts containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous than
such policy) with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time that were committed by such officers and directors in their
capacity as such; PROVIDED that in no event shall Capital One be required to
expend annually in the aggregate an amount in excess of 250% of the
annual premiums currently paid by North Fork (which current amount is set
forth in Section 6.7 of the North Fork Disclosure Schedule) for such
insurance (the "INSURANCE AMOUNT"), and provided further that if Capital One
is unable to maintain such policy (or such substitute policy) as a result of
the preceding proviso, Capital One shall obtain as much comparable insurance
as is available for the Insurance Amount.   47     (d) The provisions
of this Section 6.7 shall survive the Effective Time and are intended to be
for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and
his or her heirs and representatives.  6.8 ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS. (a)
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of North Fork and
Capital One agree to cooperate fully with each other and to use reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause
to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective, at the time and in the manner contemplated by this Agreement, the
Merger. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, North Fork shall
use reasonable best efforts to comply with any reasonable request made by
Capital One from time to time in connection with Capital One\'s financing of
the Cash Component.   (b) In case at any time after the Effective Time any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement (including any merger between a Subsidiary of Capital One, on the
one hand, and a Subsidiary of North Fork, on the other) or to vest the
Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights,
approvals, immunities and franchises of either party to the Merger, the
proper officers and directors of each party and their respective Subsidiaries
shall, at Capital One\'s sole expense, take all such necessary action as may
be reasonably requested by Capital One.  6.9 ADVICE OF CHANGES. Each of
Capital One and North Fork shall promptly advise the other of any change or
event (i) having or reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on it
or (ii) that it believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or
constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or
covenants contained in this Agreement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no such
notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or
the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement;
PROVIDED FURTHER that a failure to comply with this Section 6.9 shall not
constitute a breach of this Agreement or the failure of any condition set
forth in Article VII to be satisfied unless the underlying Material Adverse
Effect or material breach would independently result in the failure of a
condition set forth in Article VII to be satisfied.  6.10 EXEMPTION FROM
LIABILITY UNDER SECTION 16(B). Prior to the Effective Time, Capital One and
North Fork shall each take all such steps as may be necessary or appropriate
to cause any disposition of shares of North Fork Common Stock or conversion
of any derivative securities in respect of such shares of North Fork Common
Stock in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange
Act, including any such actions specified in the No-Action Letter dated
January 12, 1999, issued by the SEC to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom,
LLP.  6.11 NO SOLICITATION.   (a) None of North Fork, its Subsidiaries or

investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other retained
representative) of North Fork or any of its Subsidiaries shall directly or
indirectly (i) solicit, initiate, encourage, facilitate (including by way of
furnishing information) or take any other action designed to facilitate any
inquiries or proposals regarding any merger, share exchange, consolidation,
sale of assets, sale of shares of capital stock (including, without  
48    limitation, by way of a tender offer) or similar transactions
involving North Fork or any of its Subsidiaries that, if consummated, would
constitute a North Fork Alternative Transaction (any of the foregoing
inquiries or proposals, including the indication of any intention to propose
any of the foregoing, being referred to herein as a "NORTH FORK ALTERNATIVE
PROPOSAL"), (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding a
North Fork Alternative Transaction or (iii) enter into any agreement
regarding any North Fork Alternative Transaction. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Board of Directors of North Fork shall be permitted, prior to
the meeting of North Fork stockholders to be held pursuant to Section 6.3,
and subject to compliance with the other terms of this Section 6.11 and to
first entering into an agreement with the person proposing such North Fork
Alternative Proposal on terms substantially similar to, and no less favorable
to North Fork than, those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, to
consider and participate in discussions with respect to a bona fide North
Fork Alternative Proposal received by North Fork, if and only to the extent
that the Board of Directors of North Fork reasonably determines in good faith
after consultation with outside legal counsel that failure to do so
would cause it to violate its fiduciary duties.   As used in this
Agreement, "NORTH FORK ALTERNATIVE TRANSACTION" means any of (i) a
transaction pursuant to which any person (or group of persons) (other than
Capital One or its affiliates) directly or indirectly, acquires or would
acquire more than 25% of the outstanding shares of North Fork or any of its
Subsidiaries or outstanding voting power or of any new series or new class of
preferred stock that would be entitled to a class or series vote with
respect to a merger of North Fork or any of its Subsidiaries whether from
North Fork or any of its Subsidiaries or pursuant to a tender offer or
exchange offer or otherwise, (ii) a merger, share exchange, consolidation or
other business combination involving North Fork or any of its Subsidiaries
(other than the Merger), (iii) any transaction pursuant to which any person
(or group of persons) (other than Capital One or its affiliates) acquires or
would acquire control of assets (including for this purpose the outstanding
equity securities of subsidiaries of North Fork and securities of the entity
surviving any merger or business combination including any of North Fork\'s
Subsidiaries) of North Fork, or any of its Subsidiaries representing more
than 25% of the fair market value of all the assets, net revenues or net
income of North Fork and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately
prior to such transaction, or (iv) any other consolidation, business
combination, recapitalization or similar transaction involving North Fork or
any of its Subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   (b) North Fork shall notify Capital One promptly (but in no
event later than 24 hours) after receipt of any North Fork Alternative
Proposal, or any material modification of or material amendment to any North
Fork Alternative Proposal, or any request for nonpublic information relating
to North Fork or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the properties,
books or records of North Fork or any Subsidiary by any Person or entity that
informs the Board of Directors of North Fork or any Subsidiary that it is
considering making, or has made, a North Fork Alternative Proposal. Such
notice to Capital One shall be made orally and in writing, and shall indicate
the identity of the Person making the North Fork Alternative Proposal or
intending to make or considering making a North Fork Alternative Proposal or
requesting non-public information or access to the books and records of North
Fork or any Subsidiary, and the material terms of any such North Fork
Alternative Proposal or modification or amendment to a North Fork Alternative
Proposal. North Fork shall keep Capital One fully informed, on a current
basis,   49    of any material changes in the status and any material
changes or modifications in the terms of any such North Fork Alternative
Proposal, indication or request. North Fork shall also promptly, and in any
event within 24 hours, notify Capital One, orally and in writing, if it
enters into discussions or negotiations concerning any North Fork Alternative
Proposal in accordance with Section 6.11(a).   (c) North Fork and its
Subsidiaries shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
discussions or negotiations with any Persons (other than each other)
conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing, and shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause all Persons other than the other party
hereto who have been furnished confidential information regarding itself in
connection with the solicitation of or discussions regarding a North Fork
Alternative Proposal, as the case may be, within the 12 months prior to the
date hereof promptly to return or destroy such information. North Fork agrees
not to, and to cause its Subsidiaries not to, release any third party from
the confidentiality and standstill provisions of any agreement to which North
Fork or any of its Subsidiaries is or may become a party, and
shall immediately take all steps necessary to terminate any approval that may
have been heretofore given under any such provisions authorizing any person
to make a North Fork Alternative Proposal.   (d) Nothing contained in this
Section 6.11 shall prohibit North Fork or its Subsidiaries from taking and
disclosing to its stockholders a position required by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule
14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act.  6.12 DIRECTORSHIPS. Capital One
shall take such actions as may be reasonably required to appoint, effective
as of the Effective Time, the President and Chief Executive Officer of North
Fork to the Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation, appointed to the
class of directors with its term expiring at the 2009 Annual Meeting of
Capital One stockholders, and, to the extent so required, shall increase the
size of the Capital One Board of Directors to permit the appointment of such
individual.  6.13 RESTRUCTURING EFFORTS. If either North Fork or Capital One
shall have failed to obtain the requisite vote or votes of its stockholders
for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement at a
duly held meeting of its stockholders or at any adjournment or postponement
thereof, then, unless this Agreement shall have been terminated pursuant to
its terms, each of the parties shall in good faith use its reasonable best
efforts to negotiate a restructuring of the transaction provided for herein
(it being understood that neither party shall have any obligation to alter or
change the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration, or the Tax treatment
of the Merger, in a manner adverse to such party or its stockholders) and to
resubmit the transaction to their respective stockholders for approval.

Agreement;   (d) by either Capital One or North Fork (PROVIDED that the
terminating party is not then in material breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein), if there shall have
been a breach of any of the covenants or agreements or any of the
representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part of
North Fork, in the case of a termination by Capital One, or Capital One, in
the case of a termination by North Fork, which breach, either individually or
in the aggregate, would result in, if occurring or continuing on the Closing
Date, the failure of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3, as the
case may be, and which is not cured within 45 days following written notice
to the party committing such breach or by its nature or timing cannot be
cured within such time period;   (e) by Capital One, if (i) North Fork shall

or (ii) the Board of Directors of North Fork shall have (A) failed to
recommend in the Joint Proxy Statement the adoption of the agreement of
merger set forth in this Agreement, (B) publicly withdrawn or modified, or
publicly announced its intention to withdraw or modify, in any manner adverse

permitted by the terms hereof;   (f) by North Fork, if Capital One shall
have materially breached its obligations under Section 6.3; or   (g) by
either Capital One or North Fork, if its Board of Directors determines in

Agreement.   The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to any
clause of this Section 8.1 (other than clause (a)) shall give written notice
of such termination to the other party in accordance with Section 9.4,
specifying the provision or provisions hereof pursuant to which such
termination is effected.   53    8.2 EFFECT OF TERMINATION. In the event
of termination of this Agreement by either North Fork or Capital One as
provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have
no effect, and none of North Fork, Capital One, any of their respective
Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors of any of them shall have
any liability of any nature whatsoever under this Agreement, or in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except that (i)
Sections 6.2(b), 8.2, 8.3, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5, 9.7, 9.8, 9.9 and 9.10 shall
survive any termination of this Agreement, and (ii) neither North Fork nor

Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any termination of
this Agreement, each of the Option Agreements shall remain in full force and
effect to the extent provided therein.  8.3 FEES AND EXPENSES. Except with
respect to costs and expenses of printing and mailing the Joint Proxy
Statement and all filing and other fees paid to the SEC in connection with
the Merger, which shall be borne equally by North Fork and Capital One, all
fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger, this Agreement, and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger
is consummated.  8.4 AMENDMENT. This Agreement may be amended by the
parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of
Directors, at any time before or after approval of the matters presented in
connection with Merger by the stockholders of North Fork and Capital One;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that after any approval of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement by the stockholders of North Fork or Capital One, as the
case may be, there may not be, without further approval of such stockholders,
any amendment of this Agreement that requires such further approval under
applicable law. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the parties.  8.5 EXTENSION; WAIVER. At
any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties, by action taken or
authorized by their respective Board of Directors, may, to the extent legally
allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
other acts of the other party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or (c)
waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained in this
Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on
behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on
strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall
not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or
other failure.   ARTICLE IX   GENERAL PROVISIONS  9.1 CLOSING. On the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, a closing
(the "CLOSING") shall take place at 10:00 a.m. on September 29, 2006 at a
place to be specified by the parties, PROVIDED that if on such date the
conditions set forth in Article VII have not been satisfied or
waived (subject to applicable law) (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied or waived at the Closing, but in all cases subject
to satisfaction thereof), the Closing shall take place at 10:00 a.m. on
October 31, 2006 if such conditions are satisfied or waived (in accordance
with applicable law) on such date or, if such conditions are not so  
54    satisfied or waived on such date, the second business day
immediately thereafter following the date on which such conditions have been
so satisfied or waived. The date on which the Closing actually occurs is
referred to herein as the "CLOSING DATE". The Effective Time of the Merger
shall be determined in accordance with Section 1.2. If the Effective Time of
the Merger would otherwise be during the two weeks immediately prior to the
end of a fiscal quarter of Capital One, then Capital One may postpone the
Closing Date until the first full week after the end of that fiscal
quarter.  9.2 STANDARD. No representation or warranty of North Fork
contained in Article III or of Capital One contained in Article IV shall be
deemed untrue or incorrect for any purpose under this Agreement, and no party
hereto shall be deemed to have breached a representation or warranty for any
purpose under this Agreement, in any case as a consequence of the existence
or absence of any fact, circumstance or event unless such fact, circumstance
or event, individually or when taken together with all other facts,
circumstances or events inconsistent with any representations or warranties
contained in Article III, in the case of North Fork, or Article IV, in the
case of Capital One, has had or would be reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect with respect to North Fork or Capital One, respectively
(disregarding for purposes of this Section 9.2 any materiality or Material
Adverse Effect qualification contained in any representations or warranties).
Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, the representations and
warranties contained in (x) Section 3.2(a) shall be deemed untrue and
incorrect if not true and correct except to an immaterial (relative to
Section 3.2(a) taken as a whole) extent, (y) Sections 3.2(b), 3.3(a),
3.3(b)(i), 3.7 and 3.24, in the case of North Fork, and Sections 4.2, 4.3(a),
4.3(b)(i), 4.7 and 4.19, in the case of Capital One, shall be deemed untrue
and incorrect if not true and correct in all material respects and (z)
Section 3.8(a), in the case of North Fork, and 4.8(a), in the case of Capital
One, shall be deemed untrue and incorrect if not true and correct in
all respects.  9.3 NONSURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND
AGREEMENTS. None of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
set forth in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this
Agreement shall survive the Effective Time, except for Section 6.8 and for
those other covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement that by
their terms apply or are to be performed in whole or in part after the
Effective Time.  9.4 NOTICES. All notices and other communications in

North Fork as Grantee]     Exhibit C   Form of Affiliate
Letter  Capital One Financial Corporation 1680 Capital One Drive McLean,
Virginia 22102  Ladies and Gentlemen:   I have been advised that as of the
date hereof I may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of North Fork
Bancorporation, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("NORTH FORK"), as the term
"affiliate" is defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of
the Rules and Regulations (the "RULES AND REGULATIONS") of the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "COMMISSION") under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the "Act"). I have been further advised that pursuant to the terms
of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of March 12, 2006 (the "MERGER
AGREEMENT"), by and between Capital One Financial Corporation, a Delaware
corporation ("CAPITAL ONE"), and North Fork, North Fork shall be merged with
and into Capital One (the "MERGER"). All terms used in this letter but not
defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Merger
Agreement.   I represent, warrant and covenant to Capital One that in the
event I receive any Capital One Common Stock as a result of the Merger:   I
shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of Capital One Common
Stock in violation of the Act or the Rules and Regulations.   I have
carefully read this letter and the Merger Agreement and discussed its
requirements and other applicable limitations upon my ability to sell,
transfer or otherwise dispose of Capital One Common Stock to the extent
I believed necessary with my counsel or counsel for North Fork.   I have
been advised that the issuance of Capital One Common Stock to me pursuant to
the Merger will be registered with the Commission under the Act on a
Registration Statement on Form S-4. However, I have also been advised
that, since at the time the Merger will be submitted for a vote of the
stockholders of North Fork I may be deemed to have been an affiliate of North
Fork and the distribution by me of Capital One Common Stock has not been
registered under the Act, I may not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of
Capital One Common Stock issued to me in the Merger unless (i) such sale,
transfer or other disposition has been registered under the Act, (ii) such
sale, transfer or other disposition is made in conformity with the volume and
other limitations of Rule 145 promulgated by the Commission under the Act, or
(iii) in the opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to Capital One, such
sale, transfer or other disposition is otherwise exempt from registration
under the Act.   I understand that Capital One is under no obligation to
register the sale, transfer or other disposition of Capital One Common Stock
by me or on my behalf under the Act or to take any other action necessary in
order to make compliance with an exemption from such registration
available.     I also understand that stop transfer instructions will be
given to Capital One\'s transfer agents with respect to Capital One Common
Stock and that there will be placed on the certificates for Capital One
Common Stock issued to me, or any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in
substance:   "The securities represented by this certificate have been
issued in a  transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities
Act of  1933 applies and may only be sold or otherwise transferred in 
compliance with the requirements of Rule 145 or pursuant to a  registration
statement under said act or an exemption from such  registration."   I also
understand that unless the transfer by me of my Capital One Common Stock has
been registered under the Act or is a sale made in conformity with the
provisions of Rule 145, Capital One reserves the right to put the following
legend on the certificates issued to my transferee:   "The shares
represented by this certificate have not been registered  under the
Securities Act of 1933 and were acquired from a person who  received such
shares in a transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated  under the Securities
Act of 1933 applies. The shares have been  acquired by the holder not with a
view to, or for resale in  connection with, any distribution thereof within
the meaning of the  Securities Act of 1933 and may not be sold, pledged or
otherwise  transferred except in accordance with an exemption from the 
registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933."   It is understood
and agreed that the legends set forth above shall be removed by delivery of
substitute certificates without such legend, and/or the issuance of a letter
to Capital One\'s transfer agent removing such stop transfer instructions,
and the above restrictions on sale will cease to apply, if (A) one year (or
such other period as may be required by Rule 145(d)(2) under the Securities
Act or any successor thereto) shall have elapsed from the Closing Date and
the provisions of such Rule are then available to me; or (B) if two years (or
such other period as may be required by Rule 145(d)(3) under the Securities
Act or any successor thereto) shall have elapsed from the Effective Date and
the provisions of such Rule are then available to me; or (C) I shall have
delivered to Capital One (i) a copy of a letter from the staff of
the Commission, or an opinion of counsel in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Capital One, or other evidence reasonably
satisfactory to Capital One, to the effect that such legend and/or stop
transfer instructions are not required for purposes of the Securities Act or
(ii) reasonably satisfactory evidence or representations that the securities
represented by such certificates are being or have been transferred in a
transaction made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145 under the
Securities Act or pursuant to an effective registration under the Securities
Act.   I recognize and agree that the foregoing provisions also apply to
(i) my spouse, (ii) any relative of mine or my spouse occupying my home,
(iii) any trust or estate in which I, my spouse or any such relative owns at
least 10% beneficial interest or of which any of us serves as trustee,
executor or in any similar capacity and (iv) any corporate or other
organization in which    I, my spouse or any such relative owns at least
10% of any class of equity securities or of the equity interest.   It is
understood and agreed that this Letter Agreement shall terminate and be of no
further force and effect if the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance
with its terms.   Execution of this letter should not be construed as an
admission on my part that I am an "affiliate" of North Fork as described in
the first paragraph of this letter or as a waiver of any rights I may have to
object to any claim that I am such an affiliate on or after the date of this
letter.   Very truly yours,    By:__________________________________
