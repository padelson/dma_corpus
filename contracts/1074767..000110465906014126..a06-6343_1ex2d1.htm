2. _EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS_

  

2.1 _Conversion of Company Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, the Company or
the holder of any of the shares of Company Common Stock:

  

(a) All shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company
(the " ** _Company Common Stock_** ") owned by the Company (including
treasury shares), Merger Sub or Parent (other than shares in trust accounts,
managed accounts and the like or shares held in satisfaction of a debt
previously contracted) automatically shall be cancelled and retired and shall
not represent capital stock of the Surviving Company and shall not be
exchanged for the Merger Consideration (as defined below); and

  

(b) Each outstanding share of Company Common Stock (other than those
cancelled pursuant to Section 2.1(a) and Dissenting Shares (as defined
below)) shall be converted into and become the right to receive an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to $8.50 (the " ** _Merger Consideration_** ").

  



        
   

  



  

2.2 _Effect on Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. At and after the Effective
Time, each share of common stock, par value $0.01, per share, of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one (1) validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
the Surviving Company and constitute the only outstanding shares of capital
stock of the Surviving Company and shall not be effected by the Merger.

  

2.3 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by a stockholder
who did not vote in favor of the Merger (or consent thereto in writing) and
who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares
pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section
262 of the DGCL (the " ** _Dissenting Stockholders_** "), ** __** shall not
be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (the " ** _Dissenting Shares_** "), ** __** but instead such
holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares
in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (and at the
Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and such holder
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL), unless and until such holder shall
have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost rights to
appraisal under the DGCL. If any Dissenting Stockholder shall have failed to
perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right, such holders
shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be treated as if they had been
converted into and become exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the
Effective Time, the Merger Consideration for each such share of Company
Common Stock, in accordance with Section 2.1(b), without any interest
thereon. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written
demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, attempted
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the
DGCL and received by the Company relating to stockholders rights of
appraisal, and (ii) the right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment
with respect to, or settle, or offer or agree to settle, any such demand for
payment. Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Paying
Agent pursuant to Section 3.1 to pay for shares of Company Common Stock for
which appraisal rights have been perfected shall be returned to Parent upon
demand.

  

2.4 _Treatment of Options and Other Stock-Based Awards_.

  

(a) As of the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of Company
Common Stock or other right to receive shares of Company Common Stock under
any Company Stock Plan (each _a_ " ** _Company Option_** ") ** __** which
is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior thereto shall become fully
vested as of the Effective Time and shall by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of any holder of any Company Option be cancelled and
the holder thereof will receive as soon as reasonably practicable following
the Effective Time a cash payment (without interest) with respect thereto
equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration
over the exercise price per share of such Company Option and (ii) the number
of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Company
Option (collectively, the " ** _Option Consideration_** ").  ** __** As of
the Effective Time, all Company Options,

  



        
   

  



  

whether or not vested or exercisable, shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically cease to exist, and each holder of a Company Option shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive
the Option Consideration.

  

(b) The Board of Directors of the Company (the " ** _Company Board_** ") **
__** or compensation committee of the Company Board shall make such
amendments and adjustments to or make such determinations with respect to the
Company Options, as are necessary to implement the provisions of this Section
2.4.  Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall take all
actions necessary to ensure that the Company will not following the Effective
Time, be bound by any options, SARs, warrants or other rights or agreements
which would entitle any Person, other than Parent and its Subsidiaries, to
own any capital stock of the Surviving Company or to receive any payment in
respect thereof other than with respect to the payment of the Option
Consideration as provided in Section 2.4(a). Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall take all actions necessary to terminate all its Company
Stock Plans, such termination to be effective at or before the Effective
Time.

  

3. _EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES FOR MERGER CONSIDERATION_

  

3.1 _Parent to Make Merger Consideration Available_.  Immediately prior to
the Effective Time, Parent shall (a) deposit, or shall cause to be deposited,
with a bank or trust company designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable
to the Company (the " ** _Paying Agent_** ") ** __** in a separate fund (the "
** _Exchange Fund_** "), ** __** for the benefit of the holders of
certificates or evidence of shares in book-entry form which immediately prior
to the Effective Time evidenced shares of Company Common Stock (each a " **
_Certificate_** "), ** __** an amount in cash sufficient to pay the aggregate
Merger Consideration, and (b) instruct the Paying Agent to timely pay the
Merger Consideration in accordance with this Agreement. The Merger
Consideration deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to this Section 3.1
shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent; _provided,_
_however,_  that any such investment or any payment of earnings from any such
investment shall not delay the receipt by the holders of record of the
Certificates of the Merger Consideration or otherwise impair such holders
rights hereunder. Any interest or income produced by such investments shall
be the property of and shall be paid promptly to Parent. In the event that the
funds in the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to make the payments
contemplated by Section 2.1(b), Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be
deposited, additional funds with the Paying Agent in an amount which is equal
to the deficiency in the amount required to make such payment. The Paying
Agent shall cause the Exchange Fund to be (i) held for the benefit of the
holders of shares Company Common Stock and (ii) applied promptly to
making the payments provided for in Section 2.  The Exchange Fund shall not
be used for any purpose that is not expressly provided for in this Agreement.

  

3.2 _Exchange of Shares_.

  

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Paying
Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate a form of letter
of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent and which shall be in customary form and
shall have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for payment of the Merger

  



        
   

  



  

Consideration. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate for exchange and
cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with a properly completed letter
of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check
representing the amount of the Merger Consideration that such former holder
has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of Section 2, in each
case, in respect of the Certificate surrendered pursuant to the provisions of
this Section 3, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled.

  

(b) If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to any Person other
than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered in exchange
therefor, it shall be a condition of the payment thereof that the Certificate
so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate
instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that
the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Paying Agent in advance
any transfer or other similar taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration to any Person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered, or required for any other reason relating to such
holder or requesting Person, or shall establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such tax has been paid or is not
payable.  Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.2, each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration. No
interest will be paid or will accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of
any Certificate. As used herein, " ** _Person_** " ** __** means an
individual, partnership, corporation, limited liability company, business
trust, joint stock company, trust, unincorporated association, joint venture
or other entity of whatever nature.

  

(c) All cash paid upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the
terms of this Section 3 shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock
previously represented by such Certificates. At or after the Effective Time,
there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the
shares of Company Common Stock which were issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time.  If, after the Effective Time, Certificates
representing such shares are presented for transfer to the Paying Agent, they
shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided in
this Section 3.

  

(d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
Companys stockholders for one year after the Effective Time shall be paid,
at the request of Parent, to Parent. Any stockholders of the Company who
have not theretofore complied with this Section 3 shall thereafter look only
to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration payable in respect of each
share of Company Common Stock held by such stockholder at the Effective Time
as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest
thereon.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, none
of Parent, the Company, the Paying Agent, Merger Sub or any other Person
shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company Common Stock for
any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

  

(e) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the
posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as

  



        
   

  



  

Parent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant
to this Agreement.

  

(f) Parent and the Paying Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby to any holder of Company Common Stock or
Company Options such amounts as Parent, or any affiliate (as defined under
the Exchange Act (an " ** _Affiliate_** ")) ** __** thereof, or the Paying
Agent are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " ** _Code_**
"), ** __** or any applicable provision of U.S. federal, state, local or
non-U.S. tax law. To the extent that such amounts are properly withheld by
Parent or the Paying Agent and paid over to the appropriate taxing
authority, such withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company Common Stock in
respect of whom such deduction and withholding were made by Parent or the
Paying Agent.

  

3.3 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. Without limiting the other provisions
of the Agreement, in the event that the Company changes the number of shares
of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as
a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock
split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger,
subdivision, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction,
the Merger Consideration and the Option Consideration shall be equitably
adjusted to reflect such change.

  

4. _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_

Parent concurrently herewith (the " ** _Company Disclosure Schedule_** ") **

this Agreement (the " ** _Voting Agreement_** ") has been approved at a duly
called and held meeting of the Company Board and which approval included a
Consenting Vote (as defined in that certain Amended and Restated Stockholder

(including the Merger), nor compliance by the Company with any of the terms
or provisions hereof, will (i) violate any provision of the Company Charter
Documents or Subsidiary Documents or (ii) assuming that the consents,
approvals and filings referred to in Section 4.4 are duly obtained or made,

revocation of or a right of termination or cancellation under, accelerate the
performance required by, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of
the respective properties or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, lease, agreement or other
instrument or obligation to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party, or by which they or any of their respective properties or assets may
be bound or affected, except (in the case of clause (ii) above) for such
violations, conflicts, breaches, defaults or other events which, either
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result
in a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  



        
   

  



  

4.4 _Consents and Approvals_. No consents or approvals of, or filings or
registrations with, any federal or state court, administrative agency or
commission or other governmental authority or instrumentality or self-

connection with the execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement
or the consummation by the Company of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, except for (a) any notices required to be filed under

with, other applicable requirements of non-U.S. laws intended to prohibit,
restrict or regulate actions or transactions having the purpose or effect of
monopolization, restraint of trade or harm to competition (collectively, " **
_Foreign Antitrust Laws_** "), (c) the filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the " ** _SEC_** ") of a proxy statement in definitive
form relating to the Company Stockholder Meeting (as amended or supplemented
from time to time, the " ** _Proxy Statement_** ") as well as any other
filings required to be made with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Act or
the Exchange Act, (d) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the
Delaware Secretary pursuant to the DGCL, and (e) consents or approvals of, or
filings or registrations with, Governmental Entities or third parties, the
failure of which to be obtained or made, individually or in the
aggregate, would not have or would not reasonably be expected to have or
result in a material adverse effect on the Companys ability to perform its
obligations under this Agreement or consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby.

  

4.5 _SEC Filings_. The Company has filed all forms, reports, statements,
certifications and other documents (including all exhibits, amendments and
supplements thereto) required to be filed by it with the SEC since January 1,
2003 (collectively, the " ** _Company SEC Reports_** "). None of the Companys
Subsidiaries is required to file periodic reports with the SEC pursuant to
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and
regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder (the " ** _Exchange Act_** ").
Each of the Company SEC Reports, as amended prior to the date of this
Agreement, complied as to form in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and
regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder (the " ** _Securities Act_** ")
and the Exchange Act, each as in effect on the date so filed (or if amended
or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then on the
date of such subsequent filing). None of the Company SEC Reports contained,
when filed or, if amended or supplemented prior to the date hereof, as of the
date of such amendment or supplemented, any untrue statement of a material
fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated or
incorporated by reference therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. To the Knowledge of the Company, no investigation by
the SEC with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is pending or
threatened. For purposes of this Agreement, " ** _Knowledge_** " shall mean
the actual knowledge, after reasonable inquiry (which shall not require
inquiry of persons other than the persons hereinafter referenced in this
definition, and with respect to such referenced individuals, shall require
inquiry solely within the scope of such individuals respective business
responsibilities), of the individuals listed on Section 4.5 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule. The officers of the Company listed in Section 4.5 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to have knowledge (actual,
constructive or otherwise) of any fact, event, condition or occurrence known
or deemed to be known by any other Person, other than as expressly set forth
in the foregoing sentence.

  



        
   

  



  

4.6 _Financial Statements_.

  

(a) At the time they were filed with the SEC, the consolidated financial
statements of the Company included in the Company SEC Reports complied as to
form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto as then in
effect, had been prepared in accordance with GAAP, applied on a consistent
basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto) and fairly presented (including within the meaning of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act of 2002) the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their
operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of
unaudited quarterly statements, to normal year end audit adjustments, none of
which has been or will be, individually or in the aggregate, material to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole). At the time they
were included in the Companys Current Report on Form 8-K furnished to the
SEC on February 13, 2006, the unaudited consolidated financial statements of
the Company for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005 had been prepared
in accordance with GAAP, applied on a consistent basis during the periods
involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly
presented (including within the meaning of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002)
the consolidated financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of
the date thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and cash
flows for the period then ended (subject to normal year end audit
adjustments, none of which has been or will be, individually or in the
aggregate, material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole).

  

(b) Except as set forth in Section 4.6(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
the records, systems, controls, data and information of the Company and its
Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic mechanical or photographic process whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct
control of the Company or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all
means of access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive
ownership and non-direct control that would not reasonably be expected to
have a material adverse effect on the system of internal accounting controls
described below in this Section 4.6(b). The Company has established and
maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule
13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) and internal control
over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule
15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Such disclosure controls and procedures
are designed to ensure that material information relating to the Company,
including its consolidated Subsidiaries, required to be disclosed by the
Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
accumulated and communicated to the Companys principal executive officer and
its principal financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure; and such disclosure controls and procedures are effective to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act, including
Section 13(b)(2) thereof, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms.  Based on their
most recent evaluation, the Companys principal executive officer and its
principal financial officer disclosed, based on their evaluation at that time
of internal control over financial reporting, to the Companys auditors and
the audit committee of the Company Board (A) all significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses (as such terms are defined in PCAOB Auditing Standard No.
2) in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting

  



        
   

  



  

which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Companys ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial data and (B) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in the Companys internal control over
financial reporting. A copy of any such disclosures has previously been
provided or made available to Parent. As of the date hereof, to the Knowledge
of the Company, the Company has no reason to believe that its outside
auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not
be able to give, without qualification, the certifications and attestations
required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section
404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 when next due.

  

(c) The Company is in compliance in all material respects with the provisions
of Section 13(b) of the Exchange Act.  Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor, to the Companys Knowledge, any director, officer, agent,
employee or other Person acting on behalf of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, has (i) used any corporate or other funds for unlawful
contributions, payments, gifts or entertainment, or made any unlawful
expenditures relating to political activity to government officials or others
or established or maintained any unlawful or unrecorded funds in violation of
Section 30A of the Exchange Act or (ii) accepted or received any unlawful
contributions, payments, gifts or expenditures. Except as set forth in the
Company SEC Reports filed by the Company and publicly available prior to the
date of this Agreement (the " ** _Filed Company SEC Documents_** "), ** __**
since the Companys proxy statement dated April 29, 2005 through the date
hereof, no event has occurred that would be required to be reported pursuant
to Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC.

  

(d) To the Knowledge of the Company, between January 1, 2003 and the date
hereof, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their
respective directors, officers, employees, auditors or accountants has
received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the
accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting
controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim
that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable
accounting or auditing practices. To the Knowledge of the Company, between
January 1, 2003 and the date hereof, no attorney representing the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of securities
laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by the Company or any of
its officers, directors, employees or agents to the Company Board or any
committee thereof or to any director or officer of the Company.

  

4.7 _Broker s Fees_. Except for the Companys engagement of J.P. Morgan
Securities Inc. (" ** _J.P. Morgan_** "), ** __** neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has employed any broker or finder or incurred any
liability for any brokers fees, commissions or finders fees in connection
with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company has
heretofore delivered or made available to Parent a correct and complete copy
of the Companys engagement letter with J.P. Morgan, together with any
amendment or supplement (the " ** _Engagement Letter_** "), which letter
describes all fees payable to J.P. Morgan in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, all agreements under which any such fees or
any expenses are payable and all indemnification and other agreements related
to the engagement of J.P. Morgan.

  



        
   

  



  

4.8 _Opinion of Financial Advisor_.  The Company Board has received and
furnished or made available a copy thereof to Parent (for information
purposes only), the opinion in writing of J.P. Morgan, dated as of the date
of this Agreement, to the effect that, as of such date, and subject to the
various assumptions and qualifications set forth therein, the consideration
to be received in the Merger by the common stockholders of the Company is
fair from a financial point of view to such stockholders (the " **
_Fairness Opinion_** ").

  

4.9 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

  

(a) Since the Balance Sheet Date, there have not been any events, changes,
occurrences, or state of facts that, individually or in the aggregate, have
had or that would reasonably be expected to have or result in a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

  

(b) Except as contemplated by this Agreement or permitted under Section 6.2,
since the Balance Sheet Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries have carried

Schedule, (i) each Company Contract is valid and binding on the Company and

term thereof), and, to the Knowledge of the Company, is valid and binding on
the other parties thereto, in each case, as enforceability may be limited by
the Bankruptcy and Equity Exceptions, (ii) the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries has in all material respects performed all obligations required
to be performed by it to date under each Company Contract, and (iii) no event
or condition exists which constitutes or, after notice or lapse of time or

of its Subsidiaries under any such Company Contract, except, in each case,
with

  



        
   

  



  

respect to the foregoing clauses (i) through (iii) as would not reasonably be
expected to result in a loss of a material benefit to the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as whole.  Except as set forth in Section 4.14(b) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, to the Knowledge of the Company, no other party
to any Company Contract is in material default thereunder, nor does any
condition exist that with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a
material default by any such other party thereunder. To the Knowledge of the
Company, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any
written notice of termination or cancellation under any Company Contract,
received any notice of material breach or default under any Company Contract
which material breach or default has not been cured, or granted to any third
party any rights, adverse or otherwise, that would constitute a
material breach of any Company Contract.

  

4.15 _Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except for (a) those liabilities or
obligations that are fully reflected or reserved against on the consolidated
balance sheet of the Company as at December 31, 2005 (the " ** _Balance Sheet
Date_** ") included in the Companys report referred to in the last sentence

accrued or contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due).

  

4.16 _Anti-Takeover Provisions_. The Company Board has taken all necessary
action so that no "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition" or
other state or federal anti-takeover statute or regulation (including Section

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

4.17 _Company Information_. The Proxy Statement, at the date first mailed to
the stockholders of the Company, at the time of the Company Stockholder
Meeting and at the time filed with the SEC, and any other document filed with
any other Governmental Entity in connection herewith, will not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
in which they are made, not misleading; provided, however, that no
representation is made by the Company with respect to statements made therein
based on information supplied in writing by Parent or Merger Sub specifically
for inclusion in such documents. The Proxy Statement (except for such
portions thereof as relate only to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Subsidiaries) will comply as to form in all material respects with

property.

and marketable title to all tangible personal property owned by them on the

where the failure to have such title does not and would not reasonably be
expected to result in, either individually or in the aggregate, a

  



  



        
   

  



  

Company Material Adverse Effect.  With respect to personal property used in
the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries which is leased rather than
owned, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary thereof is in default under the
terms of any such lease the loss of which would reasonably be expected to
result in, either individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

  

(c) _Leased Property_. All leases of real property and all other leases
material to the Company and its Subsidiaries under which the Company or a
Subsidiary, as lessee, leases real or personal property (true, complete and
correct copies of which have been provided or made available to Parent) are
valid and binding in accordance with their respective terms, there is not
under such lease any material existing default by the Company or
such Subsidiary or, to the Knowledge of the Company, the lessors thereunder,
or any event which with notice or lapse of time would constitute such a
default, and in the case of real estate leases the Company or such Subsidiary
quietly enjoys the premises provided for in such lease except, in each case,
as would not reasonably be expected to result in a loss of a material benefit
to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as whole.

disclosed in the Filed Company SEC Documents that secure indebtedness that is
reflected in the most recent consolidated financial statements of the Company
included in the Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof, (ii)

Liens for current Taxes not yet due and payable and other standard exceptions
commonly found in title policies in the jurisdiction where the property is
located, (iv) such encumbrances and imperfections of title, if any, as do not
materially detract from the value of the properties and do not materially
interfere with the present or proposed use of such properties or otherwise
materially impair such operations, (v) Liens imposed or promulgated by laws
with respect to real property and improvements, including zoning regulations
or (vi) mechanics, carriers, workmens, repairmens and similar Liens
incurred in the ordinary course of business.

  

4.19 _Insurance_. The Company and its Subsidiaries are insured with reputable
insurers against such risks and in such amounts as the management of the
Company reasonably has determined to be prudent in accordance with industry
practice (taking into account the cost and availability of such insurance).
The Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with their insurance
policies (the " ** _Policies_** "), including any State Self Insurance
program, and are not in breach or default under any of the terms thereof. As
of the date of this Agreement, no notice of cancellation or termination has
been received by the Company with respect to any such Policy.  Each such
policy is outstanding and in full force and effect (other than due to the
ordinary expiration of the term thereof) and, except as set forth on Section
4.19 of the Company Disclosure Schedule. All premiums and other payments due
under any such policy have been paid.

  

4.20 _Environmental Liability_. To the Knowledge of the Company, (a) neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received since January 1, 2004
any written notice of any legal, administrative, arbitral or other
proceedings, claims, actions, causes of action or, to the Knowledge of the

reasonably would reasonably be expected to result in the imposition, on the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries of

  



  



        
   

  

any liability or obligation arising under common law standards relating to
protection of the environment, natural resources or human health and
safety, or under any local, state, federal or foreign law, statute,
regulation, ordinance, or other legal requirement relating to the protection
of the environment, natural resources or human health and safety including
the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of
1980, as amended (collectively, " ** _Environmental Laws_** ") which
liability or obligation is material to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken
as a whole; ** __** (b) during or prior to the period of (1) its or any of
its Subsidiaries ownership or operation of any of their respective current
properties, (2) its or any of its Subsidiaries participation in the
management of any property, or (3) its or any of its Subsidiaries holding of
a security interest or other interest in any property, there were no releases
or threatened releases of hazardous, toxic, radioactive or dangerous
materials or other materials regulated under Environmental Laws, including
any pollutant, contaminant or petroleum product in, on, under or affecting
any such property, which would be reasonably expected to result in a Company
Material Adverse Effect; (c) none of the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
is subject to any agreement, order, judgment, decree, letter or memorandum by

Adverse Effect; and (e) the Company has made available to Parent copies of
any and all material environmental assessments, audits, inspections or other
such reports related to the Company or its Subsidiaries or any property
currently or formerly owned, operated or leased by the Company or its

Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

  

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary
(including Section 4.13), the representations and warranties of the Company
in this Section 4.20 constitute the sole representations and warranties of
the Company with respect to any matter (including any liability) relating to
Environmental Laws.

(including in contract, tort or otherwise) based upon any information
provided or made available, or statements made, to Parent prior to the

to the last sentence of this Section 7.5(b), Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to, provide to the Continuing

Subsidiaries), other than the parties hereto and their respective permitted
successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or remedies
(with respect to the matters provided for in this Section 7.5) under or by
reason of any provision of this Agreement. Nothing contained in this Section
7.5 or elsewhere in the Agreement shall be construed to prevent, from and
after the Effective Time, the termination of employment of any individual
Continuing Employee or, subject to the provisions of Section 7.5(a), any
change in the employee benefits available to any Continuing Employee or the
amendment or termination of any particular Company Plan in accordance with
its terms.

  

7.6 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving
Company shall jointly and severally: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each
individual who served as a director or officer of the Company prior to the
Effective Time (collectively, the " ** _Indemnified Parties_** ") to
the fullest extent authorized or permitted by Delaware law, as now or
hereafter in effect, in connection with any Claim (as defined below) and any
judgments, fines (including excise taxes), penalties and amounts paid in
settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or
payable in connection with or in respect of such judgments, fines, penalties
or amounts paid in settlement) resulting therefrom; and (ii) promptly pay on
behalf of or, within thirty (30) days after any request for advancement,
advance to each of the Indemnified Parties, to the fullest extent authorized
or permitted by Delaware law, as now or hereafter in effect, any Expenses (as
defined below) incurred in defending, serving as a witness with respect to or
otherwise participating in any Claim in advance of the final disposition of
such Claim, including payment on behalf of or advancement to the Indemnified
Party of any Expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with
enforcing any rights with respect to such indemnification and/or advancement,
in each case without the requirement of any bond or other security, but in
the case of advancement of Expenses upon receipt of an undertaking, to the
extent required by Delaware law, from such Indemnified Party to repay such
advanced Expenses if it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in
a final order that such Indemnified Party was not entitled to indemnification
hereunder with respect to such Expenses. In the event any Claim is brought
against any Indemnified Party, Parent and the Surviving Company shall each
use all commercially reasonable efforts to assist in the vigorous defense of
such matter, provided that neither Parent nor the Surviving Company shall
settle, compromise or consent to

  



  



        
   

  



  

the entry of any judgment in any Claim (and in which indemnification could be
sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder) without the prior written consent
of such Indemnified Party if and to the extent the claimant seeks any non-
monetary relief from such Indemnified Party, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld. The indemnification and advancement obligations
of Parent and the Surviving Company pursuant to this Section 7.6(a) shall
extend to acts or omissions occurring at or before the Effective Time and any
Claim relating thereto (including with respect to any acts or omissions
occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and any Claim relating
thereto) and all rights to indemnification and advancement conferred
hereunder shall continue as to an individual who has ceased to be a director
or officer of the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time and
shall inure to the benefit of such individuals heirs, executors and personal
and legal representatives. In connection with any determination as to whether
the Indemnified Parties are entitled to the benefits of this Section 7.6, the
burden of proof shall be on Parent and the Surviving Company to establish
that an Indemnified Party is not so entitled. As used in this Section 7.6(a),
(A) the term " ** _Claim_** " means any threatened, asserted, pending or
completed action, suit or proceeding, or any inquiry or investigation,
whether instituted by the Company, any Governmental Entity or any other
party, that any Indemnified Party in good faith believes might lead to the
institution of any such action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative, investigative or other, including any arbitration or other
alternative dispute resolution mechanism, arising out of or pertaining
to matters that relate to such Indemnified Partys duties or service as
a director, officer, trustee, employee, agent, or fiduciary of the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries, any employee benefit plan maintained by any of
the foregoing at or prior to the Effective Time and any other Person at the
request the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; and (B) the term " **
_Expenses_** " means attorneys fees and all other costs, expenses and
obligations (including experts fees, travel expenses, court costs,
retainers, transcript fees, duplicating, printing and binding costs, as well
as telecommunications, postage and courier charges) paid or incurred in
connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating
in (including on appeal), or preparing to investigate, defend, be a witness
in or participate in, any Claim for which indemnification is authorized
pursuant to this Section 7.6(a), including any action relating to a claim for
indemnification or advancement brought by an Indemnified Party.  References
to "Delaware law" appearing in this Section 7.6 shall mean the provisions of
Delaware law applicable to a Delaware corporations indemnification of its
directors and officers notwithstanding the fact that individuals who served
as a director or officer of the Company did not serve as a director or
officer of Parent.

  

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Company shall
keep in full force and effect, and comply with the terms and conditions of,
any agreement in effect as of the date of this Agreement between the Company
and any Indemnified Party providing for the indemnification of such
Indemnified Party.

  

(c) Without limiting any of the obligations under paragraph (a) of this
Section 7.6, Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification and all
limitations of liability existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties as
provided in the Companys Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or in the
corresponding constituent documents of any of the Companys Subsidiaries as
in effect as of the date of this Agreement with respect to matters occurring
on or prior to the Effective Time shall survive the Merger and shall continue
in full force and effect thereafter, without any amendment thereto. From and
after the date hereof, the Company shall not enter

  



  



        
   

  



  

into indemnification agreements with any director, officer or employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

  

(d) If Parent or the Surviving Company or any of its successors or assigns
shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving Person of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Company, as the case may
be, assume all of the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Company set
forth in this Section 7.6.

  

(e) As of the Effective Time, Parent, the Surviving Company or the Company
(with the election being at Parents option) shall have purchased and shall
maintain in full force and effect for a period of six (6) years after the
Closing Date a prepaid directors and officers liability insurance policy or
policies providing each individual currently covered by the Companys
directors and officers liability insurance coverage for events occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time (including acts or omissions relating to the
approval of this Agreement and consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby) that is no less favorable than the Companys existing policy;
_provided,_ _however,_  that Parent may substitute therefor policies of at
least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are
in the aggregate no less advantageous to such directors and officers of the
Company than the terms and conditions of the existing directors and
officers liability insurance policy of the Company from reputable carriers
having a rating comparable to the Companys current carrier.
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
not be required to pay an annual premium for the policy or policies in excess
of 250% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for
such insurance, provided, that if the annual premiums of such insurance
coverage exceed such amount, Parent or the Surviving Company shall be
obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost
not exceeding such amount. Section 7.6(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
sets forth the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such
insurance.

  

(f) The provisions of this Section 7.6 shall survive the consummation of the
Merger and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable
by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. The
obligations of Parent or the Surviving Company under this Section 7.6 shall
not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the
rights of any Indemnified Party under this Section 7.6 without the consent of
such affected Indemnified Party. Parent shall cause the Surviving Company
to perform all of the obligations of the Surviving Company under this Section
7.6.

  

7.7 _No Solicitation_.

  

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries, and shall
cause their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives and
agents (including any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by
it or any of its Subsidiaries) (collectively, " ** _Company
Representatives_** ") ** __** to, immediately cease any existing discussions
or negotiations, if any, with any Person that may be ongoing with respect to
an Acquisition Proposal and use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
the return from all Persons or cause the destruction of all copies of
confidential information provided to such parties by the Company or the
Company

  



  



        
   

  



  

Representatives. The Company shall not, and shall not authorize or permit any
Company Representative to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or
knowingly facilitate or encourage an Acquisition Proposal or any proposal
that is reasonably likely to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) furnish or
disclose to any Person non-public information with respect to or in
furtherance of an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) negotiate or engage in
discussions with any Person with respect to or in furtherance of an
Acquisition Proposal or (iv) enter into any agreement (whether or not
binding) or agreement in principle with respect to an Acquisition Proposal;
_provided_ , _however_ , that at any time prior to obtaining approval of the
Merger by the Company Required Vote, in response to a bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal (x) made after the date hereof that was not solicited by
the Company, (y) did not result from a breach of this Agreement and (z) which
the Company Board determines in good faith, after consulting with its
financial advisors and legal counsel, constitutes or could be reasonably
expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, then the Company may, at any time
prior to obtaining the Company Required Vote (but in no event after obtaining
the Company Required Vote) and after providing Parent not less than 24 hours
written notice of its intention to take such actions, (A) furnish information
with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal (and its officers, directors, employees, accountants,
consultants, legal counsel, advisors, agents and other representatives) and
(B) participate in discussions or negotiations with, and provide draft
documents and agreements to, and exchange the same with, the Person making
such Acquisition Proposal (and its officers, directors, employees,
accountants, consultants, legal counsel, advisors, agents and
other representatives) regarding such Acquisition Proposal, if (prior to
furnishing such information to, or entering into such discussions or
negotiations with, such Person) the Company receives from such Person an
executed confidentiality agreement no less favorable to the Company in any
material respect ( _i.e_., no less restrictive with respect to the conduct of
such Person) than the Confidentiality Agreement; provided that the Company
advises Parent of all such non-public information delivered to such Person
concurrently with its delivery to such Person and concurrently with its
delivery to such Person the Company delivers to Parent all such information
not previously provided or made available to Parent. Without limiting the
foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth
in this Section 7.7(a) by the Company, its Subsidiaries or the
Company Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 7.7(a)
by the Company. The Company shall provide Parent with a correct and complete
copy of any confidentiality agreement entered into pursuant to this Section
7.7(a) within 24 hours of the execution thereof.

  

(b) In addition to the other obligations of the Company set forth in this
Section 7.7, the Company shall promptly advise Parent, orally and in writing,
and in no event later than the later of 48 hours or one Business Day after
receipt, if any proposal, offer, inquiry or other contact is initially
received by, any information is initially requested from, or any discussions
or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, the Company in
respect of any Acquisition Proposal, and shall, in any such notice to Parent,
indicate the identity of the Person making such proposal, offer, inquiry or
other contact and the material terms and conditions of any proposals or
offers or the nature of any inquiries or contacts (and shall include with
such notice copies of any written materials received from or on behalf of
such Person relating to such proposal, offer, inquiry or request), and
thereafter shall keep Parent fully informed of all material developments
affecting the status and material terms of any such proposals, offers,
inquiries or requests (and the Company shall provide Parent with written

  



  



        
   

  



  

materials received by the Company that set forth the terms of such proposals,
offers, inquiries or requests).

  

(c) Except as set forth in this Section 7.7(c), the Company Board shall
not (i) withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, in a
manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation, (ii) approve or
recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal or
(iii) enter into any agreement (whether or not binding) or agreement in
principle with respect to any Acquisition Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 7.7(a)). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in response to the receipt of an Acquisition Proposal that was
not received as a result of a breach of this Agreement, if the Company Board
(A) determines in good faith by resolution duly adopted after consultation
with its legal counsel and financial advisors that such Acquisition Proposal
is a Superior Proposal and (B) determines in good faith, after consulting
with and receiving the advice of outside counsel, that the failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable law, then the Company Board may,
in response to such Superior Proposal, withdraw, or modify or change in a
manner adverse to Parent (including recommend a Superior Proposal), the
Company Recommendation ( _a_ " ** _Company Recommendation Change_** ") **
_;_** _provided_ ,  _however_ , the Company shall not make a Company
Recommendation Change (i) until after the third Business Day following
Parents receipt of written notice from the Company (the " ** _Notice_**
") containing a description of the material terms of such Acquisition
Proposal, the most current version of the written agreement relating to the
Acquisition Proposal and, advising Parent that the Company Board has
determined that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal and that the
Company Board intends to effect a Company Recommendation Change and (ii)
unless Parent, within three Business Days following the receipt of the
Notice, has failed to make a proposal that the Company Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation, is at least as favorable to the stockholders of the
Company from a financial point of view as such Superior Proposal, provided
that during such three Business Day period, the Company shall negotiate in
good faith with Parent, to the extent that Parent wishes to negotiate.

  

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the
Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange
Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the stockholders of the Company if the
Company Board determines in good faith that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company
under applicable law, provided that the making of any such disclosure shall
not affect the rights of Parent as set forth in this Agreement.

  

(e) As used in this Agreement:

  

(i) " ** _Acquisition Proposal_** " ** __** means any inquiry, proposal or
offer relating to (i) the acquisition of more than 15% of the outstanding
shares of capital stock or any other voting securities of the Company by any
Person (other than Parent or an Affiliate thereof), (ii) a merger,
consolidation, business combination, reorganization, share exchange, sale of
assets, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction
which would result in any Person (other than Parent or an Affiliate thereof)
acquiring 15% or more of the fair market value of the assets of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (including capital stock of

  



  



        
   

  



  

Subsidiaries of the Company), (iii) any other transaction which would result
in a Person (other than Parent or an Affiliate thereof) acquiring 15% or more
of the fair market value of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole (including capital stock of ubsidiaries of the Company),
immediately prior to such transaction (whether by purchase of assets,
acquisition of stock of a Subsidiary or otherwise) or (iv) any combination of
the foregoing.

  

(ii) " ** _Superior Proposal_** " ** __** means a bona fide written offer
obtained not in breach of this Agreement to acquire, directly or indirectly,
for consideration consisting of cash and/or securities, all of the equity
securities of the Company or all or substantially all of the assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis made by a third party
which is either (x) not subject to a financing contingency or (y) accompanied
by firm written financing commitments from recognized financing sources not
subject to any due diligence conditions (other than customary confirmatory
due diligence) and which, together with any available cash on hand, are
sufficient to fund the cash portion of the offer and which written offer is
otherwise on terms and conditions which the Company Board determines in its
good faith and reasonable judgment (after consultation with a
financial advisor of national reputation and outside counsel) to be more
favorable to the Companys stockholders than the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, taking into account at the time of
determination any changes to the terms of this Agreement that as of that time
had been proposed by Parent in writing and the ability of the Person making
such proposal to consummate the transactions contemplated by such proposal
(based upon, among other things, whether the Acquisition Proposal is subject
to a financing contingency, the availability of financing and the expectation
of obtaining required approvals).

  

7.8 _Standstill_. Until the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination
of this Agreement, neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall (a)

Company or any of its Affiliates (including any pension, retirement or
employee benefit fund), other than Parent and Merger Sub, including
brokerage, money management, financing, financial advisory, arbitrage, sales,
trading and passive market making activities, or (b) form, join or in any way
participate in a "group" (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange
Act), except as may result from the Voting Agreement, in connection with any

the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect
to the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange
Act

to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (i) any
written notice or other written communication received by such party from any
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby

party to comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be complied with
or satisfied by it hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to
deliver any notice pursuant to this Section 7.11 shall not be considered in
determining whether the condition set forth in Section 8.2(b) or 8.3(b) has

had previously been held; _provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to
clause (i) above, at the Termination Date, each of the other conditions to
the consummation of the Merger set forth in this Agreement (other than
the conditions set forth in Section 8.1(b) or Section 8.1(c)) has been
satisfied or waived or remains capable of satisfaction;

  

and _provided_ _further_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under
this Section 9.1(c) shall not be available to a party whose failure to

Date of June 30, 2006;

  



        
   

  



  

(d) by Parent if it is not in material breach of its obligations under this

Company herein are or become untrue or incorrect such that the condition set

breach on the part of the Company of any of its covenants or agreements

(e) by the Company if it is not in material breach of its obligations under
this Agreement, and if (i) any of the representations and warranties of

has been a breach on the part of Parent or Merger Sub of any of their
respective covenants or agreements herein such that the condition set forth
in Section 8.3(b) would not be satisfied, and, in either such case, such
breach has not been, or cannot be, cured within thirty (30) Business Days
after notice to Parent and Merger Sub;

  

(f) by either Parent or the Company if the condition set forth in Section

(iii) shall not have rejected any proposal respecting an Acquisition Proposal
within 10 Business Days of the making thereof (including, for these purposes,

exchange offer by its stockholders, which shall constitute a failure to
recommend against acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer), (iv)
shall have failed to publicly reconfirm the Company Recommendation or its
approval of any of the transactions contemplated hereby within seven days
after receipt of a written request from Parent that it do so if such request
is made following the making by any Person of an Acquisition Proposal, or (v)

accordance with Section 7.7; _provided,_ that prior to such termination or
simultaneously therewith the Company shall have paid or caused to be paid the
Termination Fee to Parent in accordance with the procedures of Section 9.2
(and such termination of this Agreement by the Company shall not take effect
unless and until the Termination Fee shall have been paid to Parent).

  

9.2 _Effect of Termination_.

  

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Parent or the
Company as provided in Section 9.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become
void and have no effect, and none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, any of
their respective Subsidiaries or any

  



  



  



        
   

  



  

of the officers or directors of any of them shall have any liability of any
nature whatsoever hereunder, or in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby; _provided,_ _however,_ that (i) Sections 7.2(b), 9.2,
and 10.2 shall survive any termination of this Agreement and (ii)
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, neither
Parent, Merger Sub nor the Company shall be relieved or released from any
liabilities or damages arising out of its willful breach of any provision of
this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Termination Fee shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub under circumstances
where the Termination Fee is payable by the Company.

  

(b) The Company shall pay Parent, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, the sum of $23.5 million (the " ** _Termination Fee_** ") ** __** if
this Agreement is terminated as follows:

  

(i) if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.1(g), then the
Company shall pay the entire Termination Fee to Parent on the second Business
Day after the date of the event giving rise to the obligation to make such
payment;

  

(ii) if this Agreement is terminated by (A) Parent pursuant to Section 9.1(d)
if the breach giving rise to such termination was willful, (B) by either
Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 9.1(f), or (C) by either Parent or
the Company pursuant to Section 9.1(c) (and at the time of such termination a
vote to obtain the Company Required Vote has not been held), then, in the
event that (1) after the date hereof and prior to the Termination Date any
Person (other than Parent or any of its Affiliates) shall have publicly made,
proposed, communicated or publicly disclosed an intention to make a bona fide
Acquisition Proposal and (2) within twelve (12) months of the Termination
Date the Company enters into a definitive agreement with any Person with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal (with all percentages in the definition of
Acquisition Proposal increased to 50%) or any Acquisition Proposal is
consummated by such Person (with all percentages in the definition of
Acquisition Proposal increased to 50%), then the Company shall pay, or cause
to be paid to, Parent the Termination Fee upon the consummation of any such
Acquisition Proposal; and

  

(iii) if this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section
9.1(h), the Company shall pay the entire Termination Fee to Parent as
provided in Section 9.1(h).

  

(c) Any amount that becomes payable pursuant to Section 9.2(b) shall be paid
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated
by Parent. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be
obligated to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

  

(d) The Company and Parent agree that the agreement contained in Section
9.2(b) is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, that without such agreement Parent would not have entered into
this Agreement, and that such amounts do not constitute a penalty.

  

9.3 _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable law, this Agreement
may be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their
respective boards of

  



  



        
   

  



  

directors, at any time before the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_
, that after receipt of the Company Required Vote, there may not be any
amendment of this Agreement which, by applicable law or in accordance with
the rules of any relevant stock exchange, requires further approval of the
Companys stockholders (which prohibited amendments include but are not
limited to any amendments of this Agreement which decrease the Merger
Consideration or which adversely affect the rights of the Companys
stockholders hereunder without the prior approval of such stockholders).
 This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed
on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

  

9.4 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
parties hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for
the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such
party, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance
with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a
waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

  

10. _GENERAL PROVISIONS_

  

10.1 _Nonsurvival of Representations, Warranties and Agreements_. None of the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in this Agreement or in

Effective Time.

10.7 _Specific Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court

to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

  

10.8 _Governing Law; Venue_. This Agreement shall be governed and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to any
applicable conflicts of law provisions (except to the extent that mandatory
provisions of federal law). Each of the parties hereto irrevocably submit to
the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Delaware Court of Chancery
(and if the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, any court of the

process for any action, suit or proceeding brought against such party in any
such court. Each party hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such suit,
action or proceeding brought in any such court shall be conclusive and

jurisdiction such party is or may be subject, by suit upon such judgment.

  

10.9 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid
or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability
without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions
of this Agreement or affecting the

  



  



        
   

  



  

validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of
this Agreement in any other jurisdiction, and if any provision of this
Agreement is determined to be so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision
shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable, in all cases so
long as neither the economic nor legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is affected in any manner materially adverse to any party
or its stockholders. Upon any such determination, the parties shall
negotiate in good faith in an effort to agree upon a suitable and equitable
substitute provision to effect the original intent of the parties.

to the extent practicable in the circumstances) issue such press release or
make such public statement or SEC filing as may upon the advice of outside
counsel be required by law or the rules and regulations of any applicable
stock exchange (including the NASDAQ National Market). The parties have agreed
upon the form of a joint press release announcing the Merger and the
execution of this Agreement.

INTENTIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT WHICH ANY PARTY MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY PROCEEDING LITIGATION OR COUNTERCLAIM BASED ON, OR ARISING OUT
OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT,
COURSE OF DEALING, STATEMENTS (WHETHER VERBAL OR WRITTEN) OR ACTIONS OF ANY
PARTY.  IF THE SUBJECT MATTER OF ANY LAWSUIT IS ONE IN WHICH THE WAIVER OF
JURY TRIAL IS PROHIBITED, NO PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL PRESENT AS A NON-
COMPULSORY COUNTERCLAIM IN ANY SUCH LAWSUIT ANY CLAIM BASED ON, OR
ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT. FURTHERMORE, NO
