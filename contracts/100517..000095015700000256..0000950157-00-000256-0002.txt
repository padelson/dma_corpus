                    ("Parent"), YELLOW JACKET ACQUISITION CORP., a Delaware
                    corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
                    ("Sub"), and US AIRWAYS GROUP, INC., a Delaware
                    corporation (the "Company").

          WHEREAS the Board of Directors of each of the Company and Sub has
approved and declared advisable, and the Board of Directors of Parent has
approved, this Agreement and the merger of Sub with and into the Company (the
"Merger"), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, whereby each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par
value $1.00 per share, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock") not owned
by Parent, Sub or the Company, other than the Appraisal Shares (as defined in
Section 2.01(d)), will be converted into the right to receive $60.00 in cash;

          WHEREAS Parent, Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger;


          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the
parties hereto agree as follows:


                                   ARTICLE I

                                  The Merger

          SECTION 1.01. The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Delaware
General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.03). At the Effective
Time, the separate corporate existence of Sub shall cease and the Company
shall continue as the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation") and
shall succeed to and assume all the rights and obligations of Sub in
accordance with the DGCL.

          SECTION 1.02. Closing. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall
take place at 11:00 a.m., New York time, on the second business day after the
satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by applicable


<PAGE>


                                                                             2


law) waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those that
by their terms cannot be satisfied until the time of the Closing), at the
offices of Cravath, Swaine & Moore, 825 Eighth Avenue, New York, New York
10019, or at such other time, date or place agreed to in writing by Parent and
the Company; provided, however, that if all the conditions set forth in
Article VI shall not have been satisfied or (to the extent permitted by
applicable law) waived on such second business day, then the Closing shall
take place on the first business day on which all such conditions shall have
been satisfied or (to the extent permitted by applicable law) waived. The date
on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "Closing
Date".

          SECTION 1.03. Effective Time. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, as soon as practicable on or after the
Closing Date, a certificate of merger or other appropriate documents (in any
such case, the "Certificate of Merger") shall be duly prepared, executed and
acknowledged by the parties in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
DGCL and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The
Merger shall become effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such subsequent
time or date as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the
Certificate of Merger. The time at which the Merger becomes effective is
referred to in this Agreement as the "Effective Time".

          SECTION 1.04. Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the
effects set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL.

          SECTION 1.05. Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws. (a) The
Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as amended to the date
of this Agreement, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by
applicable law.

          (b) The By-laws of Sub as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable law.

          SECTION 1.06. Directors. The directors of Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until
the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective


<PAGE>


                                                                             3


successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

          SECTION 1.07. Officers. The officers of the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation
until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective
successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.


                                  ARTICLE II

                           Conversion of Securities

          SECTION 2.01. Conversion of Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any
shares of capital stock of the Company, Parent or Sub:

          (a) Capital Stock of Sub. Each issued and outstanding share of
     common stock of Sub shall be converted into and become one fully paid and
     non assessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

          (b) Cancelation of Treasury Stock and Parent- Owned Stock. Each
     share of Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company as treasury
     stock, or by Parent or Sub, immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
     automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist and no
     consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

          (c) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each share of Company Common
     Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
     (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.01(b) and
     the Appraisal Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive $60.00
     in cash, without interest (the "Merger Consideration"). At the Effective
     Time all such shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
     automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
     certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any
     such shares (a "Certificate") shall cease to have any rights with respect
     thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration.


<PAGE>


                                                                             4


          (d) Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
     the contrary, shares (the "Appraisal Shares") of Company Common Stock
     issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are
     held by any holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands
     appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects
     with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL ("Section 262") shall not
     be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as
     provided in Section 2.01(c), but instead such holder shall be entitled to
     payment of the fair value of such shares in accordance with the
     provisions of Section 262. At the Effective Time, all Appraisal Shares
     shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
     shall cease to exist, and each holder of Appraisal Shares shall cease to
     have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
     fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section
     262. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to
     perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal
     under Section 262 or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine
     that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262,
     then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holder's
     Appraisal Shares under Section 262 shall cease and such Appraisal Shares
     shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into, and
     shall have become, the right to receive the Merger Consideration as
     provided in Section 2.01(c). The Company shall serve prompt notice to
     Parent of any demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common
     Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct all
     negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the
     Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent
     of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
     settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

          SECTION 2.02. Exchange of Certificates. (a) Paying Agent. Prior to
the Effective Time Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the payment of the Merger
Consideration upon surrender of Certificates (the "Paying Agent"), and, from
time to time after the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or cause the
Surviving Corporation to provide, to the Paying Agent funds in amounts and at
the times necessary for the payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.01(c) upon surrender of Certificates, it being understood that any
and all interest or income


<PAGE>


                                                                             5


earned on funds made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to this Agreement
shall be turned over to Parent.

          (b) Exchange Procedure. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a
Certificate (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
held by such person shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates
to the Paying Agent and shall be in customary form and have such other
provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancelation to the Paying
Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such
other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder
of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
amount of cash into which the shares formerly represented by such Certificate
shall have been converted pursuant to Section 2.01(c) into the right to
receive, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In
the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not
registered in the stock transfer books of the Company, the proper amount of
cash may be paid in exchange therefor to a person other than the person in
whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate
shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the
person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required
by reason of the payment to a person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been
paid or is not applicable. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the
cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

          (c) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. All cash
paid upon the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with the terms of this
Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented
by such Certificate. At the close of business on the day on which the
Effective Time occurs the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed,
and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or


<PAGE>


                                                                             6


the Paying Agent for transfer or any other reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this Article II.

          (d) No Liability. None of Parent, Sub, the Company or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law. If any certificates shall not have been surrendered prior to two
years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on
which any Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or became the
property of any Governmental Entity (as defined in Section 3.01(d)), any such
Merger Consideration in respect thereof shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

          (e) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond in
such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay in respect of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration.

          (f) Withholding Rights. Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign tax
law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the
appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common
Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.

as set forth on the disclosure schedule, with specific reference to the
Section or Subsection of this Agreement to which the information stated in
such disclosure relates (the "Company Disclosure Schedule") (provided that any
subsection under Section 3.01 of the Company Disclosure Schedule or any
subsections thereof shall each be deemed to include (i) all disclosures set
forth in other sections and subsections of the Company Disclosure Schedule
(including Sections 4.01(a) and 4.01(b)) and (ii) all disclosures set forth in
the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December

thereto) filed therewith (collectively, the "Filed SEC Documents"), in each of
clauses (i) and (ii) as and to the extent the context of such disclosures
makes it reasonably clear, if read in the context of such other section or
subsection, that such disclosures are applicable to such other sections or
subsections), the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Sub as
follows:

          (a) Organization, Standing and Power. Each of the Company and its

     ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such

     clause (i) above with respect to the Company) where the failure to be so
     organized, existing, qualified or licensed or in good standing
     individually or in the aggregate would not be expected to result in
     (taking into account the likelihood of such result occurring and the
     expected magnitude of such event if it were to occur) a material adverse
     effect (as defined in Section 8.03). The

     corporation, partnership, joint venture, association or other entity.

     Company Common Stock granted under any Company Stock Plan that were not
     granted in tandem with a related Company Stock Option. No shares of
     Company Common Stock are owned by any subsidiary of the Company. The
     Company has delivered to Parent a true and complete list, as of the close
     of business on May 19, 2000, of all outstanding stock options to purchase
     Company Common Stock granted under the Company Stock Plans (collectively,
     the "Company Stock Options") and all other rights to purchase or receive
     Company Common Stock (collectively, the "Company Stock Issuance Rights")
     granted under the Company Stock Plans, the number of shares subject to
     each such Company Stock Option or Company Stock Issuance Right, the grant
     dates and exercise prices of each such Company Stock Option or, as
     applicable, Company Stock Issuance Right and the names of the holder
     thereof. Except as set forth above, as of the close of business on May
     19, 2000, no shares of capital stock of, or other equity or voting
     interests in, the Company, or, to the extent issued or granted by the
     Company, options, warrants or other rights to acquire any such stock or
     securities were issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding. During the
     period from May 19, 2000 to the date of this Agreement, (x) there have
     been no issuances by the Company of shares of capital stock of, or other
     equity or voting interests in, the Company other than issuances of shares
     of Company Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of Company Stock Options
     outstanding on such date as required by their terms as in effect on the
     date of this Agreement and (y) there have been no issuances by the
     Company of options, warrants or other rights to acquire shares of capital
     stock or other equity or voting interests from the Company. All
     outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company are, and all shares
     that may be issued pursuant to the Company Stock Plans will be, when
     issued in accordance with the terms thereof, duly authorized, validly
     issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not subject to preemptive
     rights. There are no bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of
     the Company or any of its subsidiaries, and, except as set forth above,
     no

     securities or other instruments or obligations of the Company or any of
     its subsidiaries the value of which is in any way based upon or derived
     from any capital or voting stock of the Company, having the right to vote
     (or convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having the right to
     vote) on any matters on which stockholders of the Company or any of its
     subsidiaries may vote. Except as set forth above and except as
     specifically permitted under Section 4.01(a), there are no Contracts (as
     defined in Section 3.01(d)) of any kind to which the Company or any of
     its subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its
     subsidiaries is bound obligating the Company or any of its subsidiaries
     to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold,
     additional shares of capital stock of, or other equity or voting
     interests in, or securities convertible into, or exchangeable or
     exercisable for, shares of capital stock of, or other equity or voting
     interests in, the Company or any of its subsidiaries or obligating the
     Company or any of its subsidiaries to issue, grant, extend or enter into
     any such security, option, warrant, call, right or Contract. There are

     any of its subsidiaries or (II) vote or dispose of any shares of the
     capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, any of its

     Agreement, there are no irrevocable proxies and no voting agreements to
     which the Company is a party with respect to any shares of the capital
     stock or other voting securities of the Company or any of its
     subsidiaries.

          (ii) As of the date of the Agreement, the number of outstanding
     shares of Company Common Stock held by the trustee (the "Trustee") under
     the Company's Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the "ESOP") is 2,081,873, of
     which 900,156 shares are allocated to participants and beneficiaries
     under the ESOP and 1,181,717 shares are unallocated. As of the date of
     this Agreement, the outstanding and unpaid principal amount of the note
     evidencing the agreement to repay the loan (the "ESOP Loan") from the
     Company to the Trustee, dated August 11, 1989, the proceeds of which were
     used by the Trustee on behalf of the ESOP to purchase from the Company on
     such date 2,200,000 shares of Company Common Stock, is $72,241,786. The
     unallocated shares of Company Common Stock held in the

     corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and
     to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and
     delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the
     Company of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized
     by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and no other

     this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,
     subject, in the case of the consummation of the Merger, to obtaining the
     Stockholder Approval (as defined in Section 3.01(t)). This Agreement has

     Company's stockholders adopt this Agreement. The execution and delivery

     or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a
     right of, or result in, termination, cancelation or acceleration of any
     obligation or to loss of a material benefit under, or result in the

     or any of its subsidiaries or their respective properties or assets,
     other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), any such conflicts,
     violations, breaches, defaults, rights, losses, Liens or entitlements
     that individually or in the aggregate would not be expected to result in
     (taking into account the likelihood of such result occurring and the
     expected magnitude of such event if it were to occur) a material adverse
     effect. No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration,
     declaration or filing with, any domestic or foreign (whether national,
     federal, state, provincial, local or otherwise) government or any court,
     administrative agency or commission or other governmental or regulatory

     Agreement by the Company or the consummation by the Company of the
     transactions contemplated hereby or compliance with the provisions

     and such reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
     (the "Exchange Act"), as may be required in connection with this
     Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, (6)
     the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of
     the State of Delaware and appropriate documents with the relevant

     subsidiaries is qualified to do business, (7) any filings required under
     the rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"), (8)

     filing required to be received from or made with any Governmental Entity
     that generally regulates aspects of airline operations, including, but
     not limited to, noise, environmental, aircraft communications,
     agricultural, export/import and customs and (9) such other consents,
     approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations and
     filings the failure of which to be obtained or made individually or in
     the aggregate would not be expected to result in (taking into account the
     likelihood of such result occurring and the expected magnitude of such
     event if it were to occur) a material adverse effect.

          (e) SEC Documents. Each of the Company and the Principal Operating
     Sub has filed with the SEC, and has heretofore made available to Parent
     true and complete copies of, all forms, reports, schedules, statements
     and other documents required to be filed with the SEC by it since January
     1, 1997 (together with all information incorporated therein by reference,
     the "SEC Documents"). No subsidiary of the Company, other than the
     Principal Operating Sub, is required to file any form, report, schedule,
     statement or other document with the SEC. As of their respective dates,
     the SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements
     of the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act") or the Exchange Act,
     as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated
     thereunder applicable to such SEC Documents, and none of the SEC
     Documents at the time they were filed contained any untrue statement of a
     material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
     therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
     the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The
     financial statements (including the related notes) included in the SEC
     Documents comply as to form in all material respects with applicable
     accounting requirements and the published rules and


<PAGE>


                                                                            14


     regulations of the SEC with respect thereto in effect at the time of
     filing, have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted
     accounting principles ("GAAP") (except, in the case of unaudited
     statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent
     basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the
     notes thereto) and fairly present in all material respects (x) in the
     case of the SEC Documents filed by the Company, the consolidated
     financial position of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as of
     the dates thereof and their consolidated results of operations and cash
     flows for the periods then ended, and (y) in the case of the SEC
     Documents filed by the Principal Operating Sub, the consolidated
     financial position of the Principal Operating Sub and its consolidated
     subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and their consolidated results of
     operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the
     case of unaudited statements, to normal and recurring year-end audit
     adjustments). Except for contingent liabilities referenced or reflected
     (without regard to potential amount) in the Filed SEC Documents, as of
     December 31, 1999, the Company and its subsidiaries had no contingent
     liabilities, other than contingent liabilities that individually would
     not be expected to result in (taking into account the likelihood of such
     result occurring and the expected magnitude of such event if it were to
     occur) a material adverse effect.

          (f) Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Since December 31, 1999,
     the Company and its subsidiaries have conducted their respective
     businesses only in the ordinary course consistent with past practice, and
     there has not been (i) any state of facts, change, development, effect,
     condition or occurrence that individually or in the aggregate
     constitutes, has had, or would be expected to result in (taking into
     account the likelihood of such result occurring and the expected
     magnitude of such event if it were to occur) a material adverse effect,
     (ii) prior to the date of this Agreement, any declaration, setting aside
     or payment of any dividend on, or other distribution (whether in cash,
     stock or property) in respect of, any of the Company's or any of its
     subsidiaries' capital stock, except for dividends by a wholly owned
     subsidiary of the Company to its parent, (iii) prior to the date of this
     Agreement, any purchase, redemption or other acquisition of any shares of
     capital stock or any other securities of the Company or any of its

     shares or other securities, (iv) prior to the date of this Agreement, any
     split, combination or reclassification of any of the Company's or any of
     its subsidiaries' capital stock or any issuance or the authorization of
     any issuance of any other securities in respect of, in lieu of or in
     substitution for shares of capital stock or other securities of the
     Company or any of its subsidiaries, (v) (x) any granting by the Company
     or any of its subsidiaries to any current or former director, officer,
     employee or consultant of any increase in compensation, bonus or other
     benefits or any such granting of any type of compensation or benefits to
     any current or former director, officer, employee or consultant not
     previously receiving or entitled to receive such type of compensation or
     benefit, except for (A) increases of cash compensation and other
     immaterial changes in benefits (except for changes in benefits provided
     to officers other than as the result of immaterial changes made to
     Company Benefit Plans that are generally applicable to the employees of
     the Company or any of its subsidiaries, which changes are not
     specifically directed at or do not disproportionately affect such
     officers) in each case (1) in the ordinary course of business consistent
     with past practice or (2) required under any agreement or benefit plan in
     effect as of December 31, 1999, or (B) those actions taken by the Company
     to retain or attract employees in key positions as and to the extent

     any granting to any current or former director, officer, employee or
     consultant of the right to receive any severance or termination pay, or
     increases therein, other than (A) termination arrangements for employees
     (other than officers) entered into in the ordinary course of business
     consistent with past practice and (B) those actions taken by the Company
     to retain or attract employees in key positions as and to the extent
     consistent with the Retention Plan or (z) any entry by the Company or any
     of its subsidiaries into, or any amendment of, any Company Benefit
     Agreement(as defined in Section 3.01(j)), (vi) any payment of any benefit
     or the grant or amendment of any award (including in respect of stock
     options, stock appreciation rights, performance units, restricted stock
     or other stock-based or stock-related awards or the removal or
     modification of any restrictions in any Company Benefit Agreement or
     Company Benefit Plan or awards made thereunder) except as required to
     comply with any applicable law or any Company Benefit Agreement or

                                                                            16


     Company Benefit Plan existing on such date and except for those actions
     taken by the Company to retain or attract employees in key positions as
     and to the extent consistent with the Retention Plan, (vii) any damage or
     destruction, whether or not covered by insurance, that individually or in
     the aggregate would be expected to result in (taking into account the
     likelihood of such result occurring and the expected magnitude of such
     event if it were to occur) a material adverse effect, (viii) any material
     change in financial accounting methods, principles or practices by the
     Company or any of its subsidiaries, except insofar as may have been
     required by a change in GAAP or SEC accounting regulations or guidelines
     or applicable law, (ix) on or prior to the date of this Agreement, any
     material election with respect to taxes by the Company or any of its
     subsidiaries or any settlement or compromise of any material tax

     prior to the date of this Agreement, any material change in tax
     accounting methods, principles or practices by the Company or any of its
     subsidiaries, except insofar as may have been required by a change in
     GAAP or SEC accounting regulations or guidelines or applicable law or
     (xi) any revaluation by the Company or any of its subsidiaries of any of
     the material assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

          (g) Litigation. There is no suit, claim, action, investigation or
     proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened
     against or affecting the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of
     their respective assets that individually or in the aggregate would be
     expected to result in (taking into account the likelihood of such result
     occurring and the expected magnitude of such event if it were to occur) a
     material adverse effect, nor is there any statute, law, ordinance, rule,
     regulation, judgment, order or decree, of any Governmental Entity or
     arbitrator outstanding against, or, to the knowledge of the Company,
     investigation, proceeding, notice of violation, order of forfeiture or
     complaint by any Governmental Entity involving, the Company or any of its
     subsidiaries that individually or in the aggregate would be expected to
     result in (taking into account the likelihood of such result occurring
     and the expected magnitude of such event if it were to occur) a material
     adverse effect.

          (h) Contracts. Except for Contracts filed as exhibits to the Filed
     SEC Documents, as of the date hereof there are no Contracts that are
     required to be

                                                                            17


     filed as an exhibit to any Filed SEC Document under the Exchange Act and
     the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Except for Contracts
     filed in unredacted form as exhibits to the Filed SEC Documents, Section
     3.01(h) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete
     list of:

               (i) all Contracts to which the Company or any of its
          subsidiaries is a party, or that purports to be binding upon the
          Company, any of its subsidiaries or any of its affiliates, that
          contain a covenant (a "Restrictive Covenant") materially restricting
          the ability of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (or which,
          following the consummation of the Merger, could materially restrict
          the ability of Parent or any of its subsidiaries, including the
          Company and its subsidiaries) to compete in any business that is
          material to the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or
          Parent and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or with any person or
          in any geographic area, except for any such Contract (x) that would
          not be expected to result in the Company incurring costs or
          receiving revenues in excess of $5,000,000 per year, (y) that may be
          canceled without penalty by the Company or any of its subsidiaries
          upon notice of 60 days or less or (z) the terms and scope (including
          with respect to any Restrictive Covenants) are customary in the
          airline industry for Contracts of that type;

               (ii) all material joint venture, partnership, business alliance
          (excluding information technology contracts), code sharing and
          frequent flyer agreements (including all material amendments to each
          of the foregoing agreements);

               (iii) all maintenance agreements for repair and overhaul that
          would be expected to result in the Company incurring costs in excess
          of $10,000,000 per year (including all material amendments to each
          of the foregoing agreements); and

               (iv) as of the date hereof, all loan agreements, credit
          agreements, notes, debentures, bonds, mortgages, indentures and
          other Contracts pursuant to which any indebtedness (which term shall
          include capital leases and operating leases) of the Company or any
          of its subsidiaries is outstanding or may be incurred and all
          guarantees of or by the Company or any of its subsidiaries of


<PAGE>


                                                                            18


          any indebtedness of any other person (except for such indebtedness
          or guarantees of indebtedness the aggregate principal amount of
          which does not exceed $10,000,000), including the respective
          aggregate principal amounts outstanding as of the date of this
          Agreement. The Company has previously disclosed to Parent in
          writing, based upon the assumptions in such writing, the aggregate
          amount of indebtedness (which shall be deemed solely for purposes of
          this sentence to consist of capital leases, aircraft operating
          leases and indebtedness for borrowed money) of the Company and its
          subsidiaries (including all guarantees of indebtedness to third
          parties) as of the date of this Agreement.

     None of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is in violation of or
     default (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) under, or has
     waived or failed to enforce any rights or benefits under, any Contract to
     which it is a party or by which it or any of its properties or assets is
     bound, and, to the knowledge of the Company or such subsidiary, no other
     party to any of its Contracts is in violation or default (with or without
     notice or lapse of time or both) under, or has waived or failed to
     enforce any rights or benefits under, and there has occurred no event
     giving to others any right of termination, amendment or cancelation of,
     with or without notice or lapse of time or both, any such Contract
     except, in each case, for violations, defaults, waivers or failures to
     enforce benefits that individually or in the aggregate would not be
     expected to result in (taking into account the likelihood of such result
     occurring and the expected magnitude of such event if it were to occur) a
     material adverse effect. Except as identified in writing by the Company
     to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement, the Company has delivered
     or made available to Parent or its representatives true and complete
     copies of all Contracts listed on Section 3.01(h) of the Company
     Disclosure Schedule.

          (i) Compliance with Laws. Except with respect to Environmental Laws
     (as defined in Section 3.01(l)(vi)) and taxes, which are the subject of
     Sections 3.01(l) and 3.01(n), respectively, and except as otherwise set
     forth in any documents filed by the Company or the Principal Operating
     Sub with the SEC and publicly available prior to December 31, 1999, the
     Company and its subsidiaries and their relevant personnel and operations
     are, and since January 1, 1997 have been, in compliance with all
     statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, regulations, judgments, orders and
     decrees of any Governmental Entity applicable to their

                                                                            19


     businesses or operations, including all applicable operating
     certificates, Airworthiness Directives ("ADs"), Federal Aviation
     Regulations ("FARs"), DOT regulations, common carrier obligations and
     other applicable licensing agreements, except for any such noncompliance
     which would not individually or in the aggregate be expected to result in
     (taking into account the likelihood of such result occurring and the
     expected magnitude of such event if it were to occur) a material adverse
     effect. Except as otherwise set forth in any documents filed by the
     Company or the Principal Operating Sub with the SEC and publicly
     available prior to December 31, 1999, none of the Company or any of its
     subsidiaries has received, since January 1, 1997, a notice or other
     written communication alleging or identifying a possible material
     violation of any statute, law, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment,
     order or decree of any Governmental Entity applicable to its businesses
     or operations. Except as otherwise set forth in any documents filed by
     the Company or the Principal Operating Sub with the SEC and publicly
     available prior to December 31, 1999, the Company and its subsidiaries
     have in effect all permits, licenses, variances, exemptions,
     authorizations, operating certificates, Slots (as defined in Section
     3.01(p)), air service designations, franchises, orders and approvals of
     all Governmental Entities, including the FAA and the DOT (collectively,
     "Permits"), necessary or reasonably advisable for them to own, lease or
     operate their properties and assets and to carry on their businesses as
     now conducted, and there has occurred no violation of, default (with or
     without notice or lapse of time or both) under, or event giving to others
     any right of termination, amendment or cancelation of, with or without
     notice or lapse of time or both, any such Permit, except where the
     failure to have in effect such Permits or such violation, default or
     event would not individually or in the aggregate be expected to result in
     (taking into account the likelihood of such result occurring and the
     expected magnitude of such event if it were to occur) a material adverse
     effect. The Company does not believe that the Merger, in and of itself,
     would be expected to cause (taking into account the likelihood of such
     result occurring) the revocation or cancelation of any such Permit.

          (j) Absence of Changes in Company Benefit Plans; Employment
     Agreements. Since December 31, 1999, none of the Company or any of its
     subsidiaries has (i) terminated, adopted, amended or agreed to amend in
     any material respect any bonus, pension, profit sharing, deferred
     compensation, incentive compensation, stock ownership, stock purchase,
     stock appreciation, restricted stock, stock option, phantom stock,
     performance, retirement, thrift, savings, stock

     bonus, cafeteria, paid time-off, perquisite, fringe benefit, vacation,
     severance, disability, death benefit, hospitalization, medical, welfare
     benefit or other plan, program, policy, arrangement or understanding
     (whether or not legally binding) providing benefits to any of the current
     or former directors, officers, employees or consultants of the Company or
     any of its subsidiaries (collectively, "Company Benefit Plans") (other
     than any such actions taken with respect to Non-Significant Benefit Plans
     (as defined below) in the ordinary course of business), (ii) made any
     material change in any actuarial or other assumption used to calculate
     funding obligations with respect to any Company Pension Plan (as defined
     in Section 3.01(m)) or (iii) made any material change in the manner in
     which contributions to any Company Pension Plan are made or the basis on
     which such contributions are determined. There exist no employment,
     consulting, deferred compensation, severance, termination or
     indemnification agreements or arrangements between the Company or any of
     its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any current or former director,
     officer, employee or consultant of the Company or any of its
     subsidiaries, on the other hand (collectively, "Company Benefit
     Agreements") (other than Non-Significant Benefit Agreements (as defined
     below)), and no Company Benefit Agreement (other than Non-Significant
     Benefit Agreements) or Company Benefit Plan (other than Non- Significant
     Benefit Plans) provides benefits that are contingent, or the terms of
     which are materially altered, upon the occurrence of a transaction
     involving the Company or its subsidiaries of the nature contemplated by
     this Agreement. "Non-Significant Benefit Plans" means all immaterial
     Company Benefit Plans which do not provide benefits to any officers or
     directors of the Company or the Principal Operating Sub. "Non-Significant
     Benefit Agreements" means all immaterial Company Benefit Agreements which
     are not between the Company or the Principal Operating Sub, on the one
     hand, and any current officer or director of the Company or the Principal
     Operating Sub, on the other hand.

          (k) Labor and Employment Matters. As of the date hereof, Section
     3.01(k) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete
     list of all collective bargaining or other labor union contracts
     (including all amendments thereto) applicable to any employees of the
     Company or any of its subsidiaries. There is no labor dispute, strike,
     work stoppage or lockout, or, to the knowledge of the Company, threat
     thereof, by or with respect to any employee of the Company or any of its
     subsidiaries, except where such dispute, strike, work stoppage or lockout
     individually or in the aggregate would not be expected to

                                                                            21


     result in (taking into account the likelihood of such result occurring
     and the expected magnitude of such event if it were to occur) a material
     adverse effect. None of the Company or any of its subsidiaries has
     breached or otherwise failed to comply with any provision of any
     collective bargaining or other labor union contract applicable to any
     employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries and there are no
     grievances or complaints outstanding or, to the knowledge of the Company,
     threatened against the Company or any of its subsidiaries under any such
     Contract except for any breaches, failures to comply, grievances or
     complaints that individually or in the aggregate would not be expected to
     result in (taking into account the likelihood of such result occurring
     and the expected magnitude of such event if it were to occur) a material
     adverse effect. The Company has made available to Parent and its
     representatives true and complete copies of all Contracts listed on
     Section 3.01(k) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

          (l) Environmental Matters. (i) Permits and Authorizations. Each of
     the Company and its subsidiaries possesses all material Environmental
     Permits (as defined below) necessary to conduct its businesses and
     operations as currently conducted.

          (ii) Compliance. Each of the Company and its subsidiaries is in
     compliance in all material respects with all applicable Environmental
     Laws (as defined below) and all Environmental Permits, and none of the
     Company or its subsidiaries has received any (A) communication from any
     Governmental Entity or other person that alleges that the Company or any
     of its subsidiaries has violated or is liable under any Environmental Law
     other than communications with respect to violations or liabilities that
     would not be expected to result in (taking into account the likelihood of
     such result occurring and the expected magnitude of such event if it were
     to occur) a material adverse effect or (B) written request for material
     information pursuant to Section 104(e) of the U.S. Comprehensive
     Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act or similar state
     statute concerning the disposal of Hazardous Materials (as defined
     below).

          (iii) Environmental Claims. There are no Environmental Claims (as
     defined below) (A) pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
     threatened against the Company or any of its subsidiaries or (B) to the
     knowledge of the Company, pending or threatened against any person whose
     liability for any Environmental Claim the Company or any of its
     subsidiaries has retained or assumed, either contractually or by
     operation of law, in each case other


<PAGE>


                                                                            22


     than Environmental Claims that would not be expected to result in (taking
     into account the likelihood of such result occurring and the expected
     magnitude of such event if it were to occur) a material adverse effect.
     None of the Company or its subsidiaries has contractually retained or
     assumed any liabilities or obligations that would be expected to provide
     the basis for any Environmental Claim that would be expected to result in
     (taking into account the likelihood of such result occurring and the
     expected magnitude of such event if it were to occur) a material adverse
     effect.

          (iv) Stage III Requirements. (A) None of the Company or any of its
     subsidiaries will be required to make material expenditures to comply
     with the Stage III noise reduction requirements promulgated by the FAA
     (the "Stage III Requirements") or other applicable noise reduction
     requirements and (B) the retirement or other discontinuation of use by
     the Company or any of its subsidiaries of any aircraft that will not be
     in compliance with the Stage III Requirements or other applicable noise
     reduction requirements would not individually or in the aggregate be
     expected to result in (taking into account the likelihood of such result
     occurring and the expected magnitude of such event if it were to occur) a
     material adverse effect.

          (v) Releases. To the knowledge of the Company, there have been no
     Releases (as defined in Section 3.01(l)(vi)(D)) of any Hazardous
     Materials that could reasonably be expected to form the basis of any
     material Environmental Claim.

          (vi) Definitions. (A) "Environmental Claims" means any and all
     administrative, regulatory or judicial actions, orders, decrees, suits,
     demands, demand letters, directives, claims, liens, investigations,
     proceedings or notices of noncompliance or violation by any Governmental
     Entity or other person alleging potential responsibility or liability
     (including potential responsibility or liability for costs of
     enforcement, investigation, cleanup, governmental response, removal or
     remediation, for natural resources damages, property damage, personal
     injuries or penalties or for contribution, indemnification, cost
     recovery, compensation or injunctive relief) arising out of, based on or
     related to (x) the presence, Release or threatened Release of, or
     exposure to, any Hazardous Materials at any location, whether or not
     owned, operated, leased or managed by the Company or any of its
     subsidiaries, or (y) circumstances forming the basis of any violation or

                                                                            23


     alleged violation of any Environmental Law or Environmental Permit.

               (B) "Environmental Laws" means all domestic or foreign (whether
          national, federal, state, provincial or otherwise) laws, rules,
          regulations, orders, decrees, common law, judgments or binding
          agreements issued, promulgated or entered into by or with any
          Governmental Entity relating to pollution or protection of the
          environment (including ambient air, surface water, groundwater,
          soils or subsurface strata) or protection of human health as it
          relates to the environment, including laws and regulations relating
          to Releases or threatened Releases of Hazardous Materials or
          otherwise relating to the generation, manufacture, processing,

          (m) ERISA Compliance. (i) Section 3.01(m)(i) of the Company
     Disclosure Schedule contains a true and complete list, as of the date
     hereof, of all "employee welfare benefit plans" (as defined in Section
     3(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
     ("ERISA")), "employee pension benefit plans" (as defined in Section 3(2)
     of ERISA) ("Company Pension Plans") and all other Company Benefit Plans
     maintained or contributed to by the Company or any of its subsidiaries or
     any person or entity that, together with the Company or any of its
     subsidiaries, is treated as a single employer (a "Commonly Controlled
     Entity") under Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of


<PAGE>


                                                                            24


     the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), for the
     benefit of any current or former directors, officers, employees or
     consultants of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, other than, in
     each case, any Non- Significant Benefit Plans. The Company has provided
     or made available to Parent, to the extent requested by Parent, true and
     complete copies of (1) each Company Benefit Plan (or, in the case of any
     unwritten Company Benefit Plans, descriptions thereof), (2) the most
     recent annual report on Form 5500 required to be filed with the Internal
     Revenue Service (the "IRS") with respect to each Company Benefit Plan (if
     any such report was required), (3) the most recent summary plan
     description for each Company Benefit Plan for which such summary plan
     description is required and (4) each trust agreement and group annuity
     contract relating to any Company Benefit Plan, other than, in each case,
     any Non- Significant Benefit Plans. Each Company Benefit Plan has been
     administered in accordance with its terms, except where the failure so to
     be administered individually or in the aggregate would not be expected to
     result in (taking into account the likelihood of such result occurring
     and the expected magnitude of such event if it were to occur) a material
     adverse effect. The Company and its subsidiaries and all the Company
     Benefit Plans are in compliance with all applicable provisions of ERISA
     and the Code, except for instances of possible noncompliance that
     individually or in the aggregate would not be expected to result in
     (taking into account the likelihood of such result occurring and the
     expected magnitude of such event if it were to occur) a material adverse
     effect.

          (ii) Neither the Company nor any Commonly Controlled Entity has
     maintained, contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any Company
     Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA with respect to which
     the Company or any Commonly Controlled Entity has liabilities or
     obligations (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise).

          (iii) With respect to any Company Benefit Plan (other than any
     Non-Significant Benefit Plan) that is an employee welfare benefit plan,
     there are no understandings, agreements or undertakings, written or oral,
     that would prevent any such plan (including any such plan covering
     retirees or other former employees) from being amended or terminated
     without material liability to the Company or any of its subsidiaries on
     or at any time after the Effective Time.

          (iv) No current or former director, officer employee or consultant
     of the Company or any of its


<PAGE>


                                                                            25


     subsidiaries are party to any agreement or arrangement with the Company
     or any of its subsidiaries, nor are there any corporate policies in
     place, the benefits of which are contingent, or the terms of which are
     materially altered, upon the occurrence of a transaction involving the
     Company of the nature contemplated by this Agreement. Prior to the date
     of this Agreement, the Company has delivered to Parent a report that sets
     forth the Company's good faith estimate, as of the date of such report,
     of (x) the amount to be paid (subject to the exceptions described in such
     report and based upon the assumptions described in such report) to the
     current officers of the Company and the Principal Operating Sub and the
     president of each of the Company's three commuter subsidiaries under all
     Company Benefit Agreements and Company Benefit Plans (or the amount by
     which any of their benefits may be accelerated or increased) as a result
     of (i) the execution of this Agreement, (ii) the obtaining of the
     Stockholder Approval, (iii) the consummation of the Merger or the other
     transaction contemplated by this Agreement or (iv) the termination or
     constructive termination of the employment of such officers following one
     of the events set forth in clauses (i) through (iii) above and (y) the
     ramifications of such payments Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code.

          (v) The deduction of any amount payable pursuant to the terms of the
     Company Benefit Plans or any other employment contracts or arrangements
     will not be subject to disallowance under Section 162(m) of the Code.

          (vi) The Company has no liability or obligations, including under or
     on account of a Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement,
     arising out of the Company's hiring of persons to provide services to the
     Company and treating such persons as consultants or independent
     contractors and not as employees of the Company, except where such
     liability or obligation would not be expected to result in (taking into
     account the likelihood of such result occurring and the expected
     magnitude of such event if it were to occur) a material adverse effect.

          (n) Taxes. (i) Each of the Company and its subsidiaries has filed
     all tax returns required to be filed by it or requests for extensions to
     file such returns have been timely filed, granted and have not expired,
     and all such returns are true and complete, except for such failures to
     file or to have extensions granted that remain and such inaccuracies that
     individually or in the aggregate would not be expected to result in
     (taking into account the likelihood of such result occurring and the
     expected magnitude of such event if it were to occur) a material adverse
     effect. Each

                                                                            26


     of the Company and its subsidiaries has paid (or the Company has paid on
     its behalf) all taxes shown as due on such returns and all material taxes
     otherwise due (including withholding taxes pursuant to Sections 1441,
     1442, 3121 and 3402 of the Code or similar provisions under any foreign
     federal laws or any state or local laws, domestic or foreign), except for
     such failures to pay that individually or in the aggregate would not be
     expected to result in (taking into account the likelihood of such result
     occurring and the expected magnitude of such event if it were to occur) a
     material adverse effect, and the most recent financial statements
     contained in the Filed SEC Documents adequately provide for all taxes
     payable by the Company and its subsidiaries (in addition to any reserve
     for deferred taxes established to reflect timing differences between book
     and tax income) for all taxable periods and portions thereof accrued
     through the date of such financial statements, except where the failure
     to have such an adequate provision would not be expected to result in
     (taking into account the likelihood of such result occurring and the
     expected magnitude of such event if it were to occur) a material adverse
     effect.

          (ii) No deficiencies for any taxes have been proposed, asserted or
     assessed against the Company or any of its subsidiaries that are not
     adequately reflected in the most recent financial statements contained in
     the Filed SEC Documents, except for deficiencies that individually or in
     the aggregate would not be expected to result in (taking into account the
     likelihood of such result occurring and the expected magnitude of such
     event if it were to occur) a material adverse effect, and no requests for
     waivers of the time to assess any such taxes have been granted or are
     pending. The United States Federal income tax returns of the Company and
     each of its subsidiaries consolidated in such returns have been either
     examined by and settled with the IRS or closed by virtue of the
     applicable statute of limitations. There is no audit, examination,
     deficiency or refund litigation pending with respect to taxes and during
     the past three years no taxing authority has given written notice of the
     intent to commence any such examination, audit or refund litigation and
     which such examination, audit or refund litigation has not yet ended.
     None of the assets or properties of the Company or any of its
     subsidiaries is subject to any material tax lien, other than any such
     liens for taxes which are not due and payable, which may thereafter be
     paid without penalty or the validity of which are being contested in good
     faith by appropriate proceedings and for which adequate provisions are
     being maintained in accordance with GAAP.

                                                                            27


          (iii) None of the Company or any of its subsidiaries has constituted
     either a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" in a
     distribution of stock outside of the affiliated group of which the
     Company is the common parent qualifying or intended to qualify for
     tax-free treatment under Section 355(a) of the Code (A) in the two years
     prior to the date of this Agreement or (B) in a distribution that could
     otherwise constitute part of a "plan" or "series of related transactions"
     (within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code) in conjunction with
     the Merger.

          (iv) As used in this Agreement, "taxes" shall include all (x)
     domestic and foreign (whether national, federal, state, provincial, local
     or otherwise) income, franchise, property, sales, excise, employment,
     payroll, social security, value-added, ad valorem, transfer, withholding
     and other taxes, including taxes based on or measured by gross receipts,
     profits, sales, use or occupation, tariffs, levies, impositions,
     assessments or governmental charges of any nature whatsoever, including
     any interest penalties or additions with respect thereto, (y) liability
     for the payment of any amounts of the type described in clause (x) as a
     result of being a member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or
     unitary group, and (z) liability for the payment of any amounts as a
     result of being party to any tax sharing agreement or as a result of any
     express or implied obligation to indemnify any other person with respect
     to the payment of any amounts of the types described in clause (x) or
     (y).

          (o) Aircraft. (i) Section 3.01(o)(i) of the Company Disclosure
     Schedule sets forth a true and complete list of all aircraft owned,
     leased or operated by the Company or any of its subsidiaries as of April
     30, 2000. All aircraft owned, leased or operated by the Company or any of
     its subsidiaries (other than the Non-Operating Aircraft (as defined
     below) and the Excluded Leased Aircraft (as defined below)) are in
     airworthy condition and are being maintained according to applicable FAA
     regulatory standards and the FAA-approved maintenance program of the
     Company and its subsidiaries. The Company and its subsidiaries have
     implemented plans with respect to their respective aircraft (other than
     the Non-Operating Aircraft and Excluded Leased Aircraft) and engines
     that, if complied with, would result in the satisfaction of all
     requirements under all applicable ADs and FARs required to be complied
     with in accordance with the FAA-approved maintenance program of the
     Company and its subsidiaries, and the Company and its subsidiaries are in
     compliance with such plans in all material respects and currently have no
     reason to believe that they will not

                                                                            28


     satisfy any component of such plan on or prior to the dates specified in
     such plan. No Non-Operating Aircraft is currently included in, or is
     currently contemplated by the Company to be included in, the active fleet
     of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. All lease agreements relating
     to the lease of an Excluded Leased Aircraft by the Company or any of its
     subsidiaries to a third party lessee contain a customary undertaking by
     the third party lessee with respect to maintaining such Excluded Leased
     Aircraft in accordance with FAA regulatory standards and requirements
     under applicable ADs and FARs. The term "Non-Operating Aircraft" means
     each aircraft of the Company or any of its subsidiaries identified on
     Section 3.01(o)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule as not being in
     operation. The term "Excluded Leased Aircraft" means each aircraft owned

     retained any maintenance obligations.

     Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete list, as of the date
     hereof, containing all Contracts (other than existing aircraft leases)
     pursuant to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries may purchase or
     lease aircraft, including the manufacturer and model of all aircraft
     subject to each Contract, the nature of the purchase or lease obligation
     (i.e., firm commitment, subject to reconfirmation or option), the
     anticipated delivery date of each aircraft and the other material terms
     of each Contract. Except as identified in writing by the Company to
     Parent prior to the date of this Agreement, the Company has delivered or
     made available to Parent true and complete copies of all Contracts listed
     on Section 3.01(o)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, including all
     amendments thereto. The Company has also delivered to Parent a true and
     complete copy of the fleet plan for the Principal Operating Sub for the
     period ending December 31, 2004.

          (p) Slots; Operating Rights. (i) Section 3.01(p)(i) of the Company
     Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete list of all takeoff
     and landing slots and other similar takeoff and landing rights
     (collectively, the "Slots") used or held by the Company or any of its
     subsidiaries on the date of this Agreement at Slot- controlled airports,
     including a true and complete list of all Slot lease agreements. The
     Slots have been used 80% of each full and partial reporting period (as
     described in 14 CFR ss. 93.227(i)) since December 31, 1999, except to the

                                                                            29


     extent less usage was permitted as provided under 14 CFR ss. 93.227. The
     Slots have not been designated for the provision of essential air service
     under the regulations of the FAA.

          (ii) Section 3.01(p)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets
     forth a true and complete list of all foreign operating rights and all
     foreign takeoff and landing authorizations and other similar takeoff and
     landing rights used by the Company or any of its subsidiaries on the date
     of this Agreement.

          (q) Intellectual Property. (i) Each of the Company and its
     subsidiaries owns, or is validly licensed or otherwise has the right to
     use, all patents, patent rights, trademarks, trade secrets, trade names,
     service marks, copyrights and other proprietary intellectual property
     rights and computer programs (the "Intellectual Property Rights") used in
     its business, except for such Intellectual Property Rights the failure of
     which to own, license or otherwise have the right to use individually or
     in the aggregate would not be expected to result in (taking into account
     the likelihood of such result occurring and the expected magnitude of
     such event if it were to occur) a material adverse effect.

          (ii) None of the Company or any of its subsidiaries has infringed
     upon, misappropriated or otherwise violated any Intellectual Property
     Rights or other proprietary information of any other person, except for
     any such infringement, misappropriation or other violation that
     individually or in the aggregate would not be expected to result in
     (taking into account the likelihood of such result occurring and the
     expected magnitude of such event if it were to occur) a material adverse
     effect. None of the Company or any of its subsidiaries has received any
     written charge, complaint, claim, demand or notice alleging any such
     infringement, misappropriation or other violation (including any claim
     that the Company or any of its subsidiaries must license or refrain from
     using any Intellectual Property Rights or other proprietary information
     of any other person) that has not been settled or otherwise fully
     resolved, except for any such infringement, misappropriation or other
     violation that individually or in the aggregate would not be expected to
     result in (taking into account the likelihood of such result occurring
     and the expected magnitude of such event if it were to occur) a material
     adverse effect. To the Company's knowledge, no other person has infringed
     upon, misappropriated or otherwise violated any Intellectual Property
     Rights of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, except for any such
     infringement, misappropriation or other

                                                                            30


     violation that individually or in the aggregate would not be expected to
     result in (taking into account the likelihood of such result occurring
     and the expected magnitude of such event if it were to occur) a material
     adverse effect.

          (r) Business Combination Charter Provision. The approval of this
     Agreement by the Board of Directors of the Company referred to in Section
     3.01(d) represents the only action necessary to ensure that ARTICLE SIXTH
     of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company does not and
     will not apply to the execution or delivery of this Agreement or the
     consummation of the Merger.

          (s) State Takeover Statutes. The approval of the Merger by the Board
     of Directors of the Company referred to in Section 3.01(d) constitutes
     approval of the Merger for purposes of Section 203 of the DGCL and
     represents the only action necessary to ensure that Section 203 of the
     DGCL does not and will not apply to the execution or delivery of this
     Agreement or the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
     contemplated hereby. No other state takeover or similar statute or
     regulation is applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or the other
     transactions contemplated hereby.

          (t) Voting Requirements. The affirmative vote at the Stockholders
     Meeting (as defined in Section 5.01(b)) or any adjournment or
     postponement thereof of the holders of a majority of the outstanding
     shares of Company Common Stock in favor of adopting this Agreement (the
     "Stockholder Approval") is the only vote of the holders of any class or
     series of the Company's capital stock necessary to approve or adopt this
     Agreement or the Merger. The affirmative vote of the holders of the
     Company Common Stock is not necessary to approve any transaction
     contemplated by this Agreement (other than the consummation of the
     Merger).

          (u) Brokers. No broker, investment banker, financial advisor or
     other person, other than Salomon Smith Barney Inc., the fees and expenses
     of which will be paid by the Company, is entitled to any broker's,
     finder's, financial advisor's or other similar fee or commission in
     connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based
     upon arrangements made by or on behalf of the Company. The Company has
     delivered to Parent true and complete copies of all agreements under
     which any such fees or expenses are payable and all indemnification and
     other agreements related to the engagement of the persons to whom such
     fees are payable.

                                                                            31


          (v) Opinion of Financial Advisor. The Company has received the
     written opinion of Salomon Smith Barney Inc., in customary form, to the
     effect that, as of the date of this Agreement, the consideration to be
     received in the Merger by the Company's stockholders is fair to the
     Company's stockholders from a financial point of view, a copy of which
     opinion has been delivered to Parent.

          (w) Other Matters. The information (other than forecasts) furnished
     by the Company to Parent relating to the items (the "Specified Matters")
     identified in a letter specifically referencing this Section of the
     Agreement delivered by Parent to the Company on or prior to the date of
     this Agreement is accurate in all material respects and, taking into
     account the limited nature of the information disclosed, does not omit to
     state any fact necessary in order to make such information not
     misleading. There are no facts or terms with respect to the Specified
     Matters which have not been disclosed to Parent which would be expected
     to result in (taking into account the likelihood of such result occurring
     and the expected magnitude of such event if it were to occur) a material
     adverse effect. The forecasts dated April 25, 2000 delivered by or on
     behalf of the Company to Parent relating to the Specified Matters were
     prepared on the basis of assumptions the Company believes in good faith
     as of the date of this Agreement to be reasonable and the Company has no
     knowledge as of the date of this Agreement of any fact or information
     that would lead it to believe that such assumptions are incorrect or
     misleading in any material respect.

          SECTION 3.02. Representations and Warranties of Parent and Sub.
Parent and Sub represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

          (a) Organization. Each of Parent and Sub is a corporation duly
     organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the

          (b) Authority; Noncontravention. Parent and Sub have the requisite
     corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and

     Parent and Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly
     authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Parent and
     Sub and no other corporate proceedings on the part of


<PAGE>


                                                                            32


     Parent or Sub, including the approval of their respective stockholders,
     are necessary to approve this Agreement or to consummate the transactions
     contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered
     by Parent and Sub, as applicable, and constitutes a valid and binding
     obligation of Parent and Sub, as applicable, enforceable against Parent
     and Sub, as applicable, in accordance with its terms. The execution and
     delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
     contemplated hereby and compliance with the provisions of this Agreement
     do not and will not conflict with, or result in any violation or breach
     of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under,
     or give rise to a right of, or result in, termination, cancelation or
     acceleration of any obligation or to loss of a material benefit under, or
     result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets
     of Parent under, or give rise to any increased, additional, accelerated
     or guaranteed rights or entitlements under, any provision of (i) the
     Restated Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of Parent or the
     certificate of incorporation or by-laws (or similar organizational
     documents) of any of its subsidiaries (including Sub), (ii) any Contract
     applicable to Parent or Sub or their respective properties or assets or
     (iii) subject to the governmental filings and other matters referred to

     regulation or (B) judgment, order or decree, in each case applicable to
     Parent or Sub or their respective properties or assets, other than, in
     the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), any such conflicts, violations,
     defaults, rights, losses or Liens that individually or in the aggregate
     would not prevent or materially impede or delay (taking into account the
     likelihood of such result occurring and the expected magnitude of such
     event if it were to occur) the consummation of the Merger or the other
     transactions contemplated hereby. No consent, approval, order or
     authorization of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any
     Governmental Entity is required by or with respect to Parent or Sub in
     connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent
     and Sub or the consummation by Parent and Sub of the transactions
     contemplated hereby or the compliance with the provisions of this
     Agreement, except for (1) the filing of a premerger notification and
     report form under the HSR Act or any other applicable competition, merger
     control, antitrust or similar law or regulation, (2) any consent,
     approval, order, authorization,

     registration, declaration or filing required to be received from or made
     with any foreign regulatory authorities, (3) any filings required under
     the rules and regulations of the FAA, (4) any filings required under the
     rules and regulations of the DOT, (5) the filing of the Certificate of
     Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and
     appropriate documents with the relevant authorities of other states in
     which the Company is qualified to do business, (6) any consent, approval,
     order, authorization, registration, declaration or filing required to be
     received from or made with any Governmental Entity that generally
     regulates aspects of airline operations, including, but not limited to,
     noise, environmental, aircraft communications, agricultural,
     export/import and customs and (7) such other consents, approvals, orders,
     authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings the failure of
     which to be obtained or made individually or in the aggregate would not
     impair in any material respect the ability of Parent or Sub to perform
     its obligations under this Agreement or prevent or materially delay the
     consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

          (c) Interim Operations of Sub. Sub was formed solely for the purpose
     of engaging in the transactions contemplated hereby and has engaged in no
     business other than in connection with the transactions contemplated by
     this Agreement.

     extent required by a change in applicable law, (B) any Company Benefit
     Agreement or Company Benefit Plan providing for the payment of severance,

     this Section 4.01(a)(ix)(B) shall not apply to (I) any increase in cash
     compensation, (II) other immaterial changes in benefits (except for
     changes in benefits provided to officers other than as the result of

     such officers) and (III) termination arrangements for employees (other
     than officers), which increases, changes or arrangements described above
     in clauses (I) through (III) are made in the ordinary course of business
     consistent with past practice and (IV) those actions taken by the Company
     to retain or attract employees in key positions as and to the extent
     consistent with the Retention Plan, or (C) any other material Contract to
     which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party, provided that
     the restrictions set forth in this Section 4.01(a)(ix)(C) shall not apply
     to any modifications, amendments or terminations of any such Contract to
     the extent made in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
     practice;

          (x) except as required to comply with applicable law or any
     provision of any Company Benefit Agreement, Company Benefit Plan or other

     Sub or any other subsidiary of the Company as of the date of this

     action, which action or failure could result in the loss of Slots of the
     Company or any of its subsidiaries with an aggregate value in excess of
     $7,500,000;

          (xii) take any action which would result in the Company's
     representation and warranty set forth in the fifth sentence of Section
     3.01(d) not being accurate at any time after the date of this Agreement,
     disregarding solely for purposes of this clause (xii) the exception in
     such representation and warranty relating to matters which would not be
     expected to result in (taking into account the likelihood of such result
     occurring and the expected magnitude of such event if it were to occur) a
     material adverse effect;

          (xiii) take any action that would be expected to result in (A) any
     representation and warranty of the Company set forth in this Agreement
     that is qualified as to materiality becoming untrue, (B) any such
     representation and warranty that is not so qualified becoming untrue in
     any material respect or (C) any condition to the Merger set forth in
     Article VI not being satisfied; or

          (xiv) authorize any of, or commit, resolve or agree to take any of,
     the foregoing actions to the extent prohibited by the terms of this
     Agreement.

          (b) Certain Tax Matters. During the period from the date of this
Agreement to the Effective Time, except as specifically contemplated by this
Agreement (including anything set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule as
of the date of this Agreement), the Company shall, and shall cause each of its

of notice of any suit, claim, action, investigation, proceeding or audit
(collectively, "Actions") pending against or with respect to the Company or
any of its subsidiaries in respect of any


<PAGE>


                                                                            40


material tax (which is material at the time of receipt of such notice) and (y)
any such Action becoming material to the Company and its subsidiaries and (B)
not settle or compromise any such Action without Parent's consent; (ii) not
make any material tax election without Parent's consent; and (iii) not make
any material change in tax accounting methods, principles or practices except
insofar as may have been required by a change in GAAP or SEC accounting
regulations or guidelines or applicable law.

          (c) Advice of Changes; Filings. The Company and Parent shall confer
on a regular basis regarding operational and other material matters. The
Company shall promptly advise Parent in writing of any change or event of
which it has knowledge that would be expected to result in (taking into
account the likelihood of such result occurring and the expected magnitude of
such event if it were to occur) a material adverse effect. The Company and
Parent shall each promptly provide the other copies of all filings made by
such party with any Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, other than the portions of such filings
that include confidential information.

          (d) Consents. Parent shall not unreasonably withhold any consent
contemplated by Section 4.01(a) or (b) above. The reasonableness of
withholding any such consent shall be determined from Parent's point of view,
taking into account the relative burden to Parent and benefit to the Company
of granting such consent and any other factors which Parent determines in good
faith to be, and which are, of reasonable consequence to it in connection with
its determination.

          SECTION 4.02. No Solicitation. (a) The Company shall not, nor shall
it permit any of its subsidiaries to, or authorize or permit any director,
officer or employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any
investment banker, attorney, accountant or other advisor or representative of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, (i)
solicit, initiate or encourage, or take any other action knowingly to
facilitate, any Takeover Proposal (as defined below) or (ii) enter into,
continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any person any information with respect to, or
otherwise cooperate in any way with, any Takeover Proposal, in each case other
than a Takeover Proposal made by Parent; provided, however, that at any time
prior to obtaining the Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of the
Company may, in response to a bona fide written Takeover Proposal that such
Board of Directors

                                                                            41


determines in good faith is reasonably likely to result in an Adverse
Recommendation Change (as defined below) or constitutes or is reasonably
likely to lead to a Superior Proposal (as defined below), and which Takeover
Proposal was unsolicited and did not otherwise result from a breach of this
Section 4.02, and subject to compliance with Section 4.02(c) and (d), (x)
furnish information with respect to the Company and its subsidiaries to the
person making such Takeover Proposal (and its representatives) pursuant to a
customary confidentiality agreement, provided that all such information is
provided on a prior or substantially concurrent basis to Parent, and (y)
participate in discussions or negotiations with the person making such
Takeover Proposal (and its representatives) regarding such Takeover Proposal.

          The term "Takeover Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or offer
from any person relating to, or that is reasonably likely to lead to, any
direct or indirect acquisition, in one transaction or a series of
transactions, including any merger, consolidation, tender offer, exchange
offer, binding share exchange, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution, joint venture or similar transaction, of (A) assets
or businesses that constitute or represent 20% or more of the total revenue,
operating income, EBITDA or assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, or (B) 20% or more of the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock or capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, any of the
Company's subsidiaries directly or indirectly holding the assets or businesses
referred to in clause (A) above.

          (b) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee
thereof shall (i) withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub) or
propose publicly to withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub)
the recommendation or declaration of advisability by such Board of Directors
or any such committee of this Agreement or the Merger, or recommend, or
propose publicly to recommend, the approval or adoption of any Takeover
Proposal (other than a Takeover Proposal made by Parent), unless the Board of
Directors or a committee thereof determines in good faith, based on such
matters as it deems appropriate, after consulting with legal counsel, that the
failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to result in a breach
of its fiduciary duties under applicable law (each such action being referred
to herein as an "Adverse Recommendation Change"), (ii) adopt or approve, or
propose publicly to adopt or approve, any Takeover Proposal, or withdraw its
approval of the Merger, or propose publicly to withdraw its approval of the
Merger, (iii) cause or permit the Company to

                                                                            42


enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement (each, an
"Acquisition Agreement") constituting or related to, or which is intended to
or is reasonably likely to lead to, any Takeover Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 4.02(a)) or (iv) agree or
resolve to take any of the actions prohibited by clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of
this sentence. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 4.02 to the contrary,
at any time prior to obtaining the Stockholder Approval, the Board of
Directors of the Company may, in response to a Superior Proposal that was
unsolicited and that did not otherwise result from a breach of Section
4.02(a), cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.01(f) and concurrently enter into an Acquisition Agreement; provided,
however, that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.01(f), and any purported termination pursuant to Section 7.01(f)
shall be void and of no force or effect, unless the Company shall have
complied in all material respects with the provisions of this Section 4.02,
including the notification provisions in this Section 4.02, and in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of Sections 5.06(b) and (c)
(including the payment of the Parent Termination Fee (as defined in Section
5.06(b)) prior to or concurrently with such termination); and provided
further, however, that the Company shall not exercise its right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(f) until after the fifth business day
following Parent's receipt of written notice (a "Notice of Superior Proposal")
from the Company advising Parent that the Board of Directors of the Company
has received a Superior Proposal and specifying the terms and conditions of
the Superior Proposal and identifying the person making such Superior Proposal
(it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the price or any other
material term of a Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior
Proposal and a new five business day period). It is understood and agreed that
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with the previous sentence
shall not constitute a breach of any provision of this Agreement.

          The term "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide binding written
offer not solicited by or on behalf of the Company or any of its subsidiaries
made by a third party that if consummated would result in such third party (or
in the case of a direct merger between such third party and the Company, the
stockholders of such third party) acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than
50% of the voting power of the Company Common Stock or all or substantially
all the


<PAGE>


                                                                            43


assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, for
consideration consisting of cash and/or securities that the Board of Directors
of the Company determines in its good faith judgment (after consultation with
a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) to be superior from a
financial view to the stockholders of the Company, taking into account, among
other things, any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in
response to such Superior Proposal or otherwise.

          (c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 4.02, the Company promptly shall advise
Parent in writing of any request for information that the Company reasonably
believes could lead to or contemplates a Takeover Proposal or of any Takeover
Proposal, or any inquiry the Company reasonably believes could lead to any
Takeover Proposal, the terms and conditions of such request, Takeover Proposal
or inquiry (including any subsequent material amendment or modification to
such terms and conditions) and the identity of the person making any such
request, Takeover Proposal or inquiry. The Company shall keep Parent informed
in all material respects of the status and details (including material
amendments or proposed amendments) of any such request, Takeover Proposal or
inquiry.

          (d) Nothing contained in this Section 4.02 or elsewhere in this
Agreement shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its
stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the Company's stockholders if,
in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, after
consultation with outside counsel, failure so to disclose would be
inconsistent with applicable law; provided, however, that in no event shall
the Company or its Board of Directors or any committee thereof take, agree or
resolve to take any action prohibited by Section 4.02(b)(i) or 4.02(b)(ii).


                                   ARTICLE V

                             Additional Agreements

          SECTION 5.01. Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Stockholders
Meeting. (a) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement,
the Company and Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement
and the Company shall use its reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as
practicable to any comments of the SEC with


<PAGE>


                                                                            44


respect thereto and to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company's
stockholders as promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement.
The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from
the SEC or its staff or any request from the SEC or its staff for amendments
or supplements to the Proxy Statement and shall provide Parent with copies of
all correspondence between the Company and its representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC and its staff, on the other hand. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect
thereto, the Company (i) shall provide Parent an opportunity to review and
comment on such document or response, (ii) shall include in such document or
response all comments reasonably proposed by Parent and (iii) shall not file
or mail such document or respond to the SEC prior to receiving Parent's
approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

          (b) The Company shall, as promptly as practicable following the date
of this Agreement, establish a record date (which will be as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement) for, duly call,
give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the
"Stockholders Meeting") for the purpose of obtaining the Stockholder Approval,
regardless of whether an Adverse Recommendation Change has occurred at any
time after the date of this Agreement. The Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Stockholders Meeting to be held as promptly as
practicable following the date of this Agreement. The Company shall, through
its Board of Directors, recommend to its stockholders that they adopt this
Agreement, and shall include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement, in
each case subject to its rights under Section 4.02(b)(i). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees that its obligations pursuant
to this Section 5.01(b) shall not be affected by the commencement, public
proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company or any other
person of any Takeover Proposal.

          SECTION 5.02. Access to Information; Confidentiality. The Company
shall, and shall cause each of its subsidiaries to, afford to Parent, and to
Parent's officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and
other advisors and representatives, reasonable and prompt access during normal
business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time or the
termination of this Agreement to their respective properties, assets, books,
contracts, commitments,


<PAGE>


                                                                            45


directors, officers, employees, attorneys, accountants, auditors, other
advisors and representatives and records and, during such period, the Company
shall, and shall cause each of its subsidiaries to, make available to Parent
on a timely basis (a) a copy of each material report, schedule, form,
statement and other document received by it during such period pursuant to the
requirements of domestic or foreign (whether national, federal, state,
provincial, local or otherwise) laws and (b) all other information concerning
its business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request, in
each case subject to any confidentiality restrictions or legal restrictions
that prohibit the Company's ability to provide any such information to Parent.
The Company shall, and shall cause each of its subsidiaries to, (i) use their
respective reasonable best efforts to cause any confidentiality provision in
any Contract to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries becomes a party
to be inapplicable to Parent, its subsidiaries and their respective advisors
or representatives and (ii) in the event such reasonable best efforts are
unsuccessful, provide notice to Parent at least five business days prior to
entering into such contract that the Company or such subsidiary intends to
enter into a Contract that contains confidentiality provisions that would
prohibit Parent, its subsidiaries or their respective advisors or
representatives from reviewing such Contract. Parent will hold, and will
direct its officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and
other advisors and representatives to hold, any and all information received
from the Company, directly or indirectly, in confidence as and to the extent
provided in the Confidentiality Agreement dated March 3, 2000, between Parent
and the Company (as it may be amended from time to time, the "Confidentiality
Agreement"). The parties hereby agree that the term of the Confidentiality
Agreement is hereby amended such that it shall remain in full force and effect
until the one year anniversary of the date of termination of this Agreement.

          SECTION 5.03. Efforts; Notification. (a) Upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, in order to consummate and make
effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, Parent shall effect the divestiture of the assets and the provision
of assets, facilities and services as described in Exhibit A hereto to a
person or persons reasonably acceptable to the Company upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in Exhibit A, it being understood that
taking any or all of the actions described in this sentence shall in no way
limit Parent's obligations under the next following sentence. In addition,
each of the


<PAGE>


                                                                            46


parties agrees to use all reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all the other actions that are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate
and make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including using all reasonable efforts to accomplish the following:
(i) causing the conditions precedent set forth in Article VI to be satisfied,
(ii) obtaining all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents,
approvals, orders and authorizations from Governmental Entities and the making
of all necessary registrations, declarations and filings and (iii) obtaining
all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties. The parties
shall promptly after the date of this Agreement make all necessary filings and
registrations with the Governmental Entities, including filings under the HSR
Act and submissions of information requested by Governmental Entities. In
connection with and without limiting the foregoing, the Company and its Board
of Directors shall, if any state takeover statute or similar statute or
regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of
the other transactions contemplated hereby, use its reasonable efforts to
ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated
by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or
regulation on this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby. The Company and Parent will provide such assistance,
information and cooperation to each other as is reasonably required to obtain
any such waivers, consents, approvals, orders, and authorizations referred to
above and, in connection therewith, will notify the other person promptly
following the receipt of any comments from any Governmental Entity and of any
request by any Governmental Entity for amendments, supplements or additional
information in respect of any registration, declaration or filing with such
Governmental Entity and will supply the other person with copies of all
correspondence between such person and any of its representatives, on the one
hand, and any Governmental Entity on the other hand.

          (b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any
representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement becoming
untrue or inaccurate such that the condition set forth in Section 6.02(a)
would not be satisfied (a "Failed Section 6.02(a) Condition"); provided,
however, that no such notification shall affect the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties under this Agreement except that, as to any such
notice of a Failed Section 6.02(a) Condition with respect to


<PAGE>


                                                                            47


which Parent has not within 25 days (i) disagreed, in a notice delivered to
the Company, with the Company's conclusion that the condition set forth in
Section 6.02 would not be satisfied as a result of the circumstance described
in such notice by the Company, (ii) expressed the view, in a notice delivered
to the Company, that (A) it was in good faith considering waiving such Failed
Section 6.02(a) Condition (and would continue to comply with its obligations
under Section 5.03) or (B) it believed in good faith that it did not yet have
adequate information to form a reasonably complete view as to the facts and
circumstances with respect to the matter described in such notice from the
Company (which may include the magnitude of the harm resulting from such
circumstances), in which case such notice from Parent shall identify for the
Company the aspects of such information that Parent is lacking, or (iii)
terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(d)(i) hereof, then the
Failed Section 6.02(a) Condition shall be deemed waived insofar as arising out
of the circumstances set forth in such notice. In the case of clause (ii)
above, Parent shall give notice to the Company promptly after (x) in the case
of clause (ii)(A) it no longer is in good faith considering waiving a Failed
Section 6.02(a) Condition and (y) in the case of clause (ii)(B), it believed
in good faith that it had adequate information to form a reasonably complete
view as to the relevant facts and circumstances, and, in either such case,
absent termination of this Agreement by Parent within 20 days of such notice,
such Failed Section 6.02(a) Condition shall be deemed waived at the end of
such 20 day period.

          (c) Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company of any
representation or warranty made by it or Sub contained in this Agreement
becoming untrue or inaccurate such that the condition set forth in Section
6.03(a) would not be satisfied; provided, however, that no such notification
shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the
parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this
Agreement.

          SECTION 5.04. Company Stock Options. (a) As soon as practicable
following the date of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company
(or, if appropriate, any committee administering the Company Stock Plans)
shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions (if any) as may be
required to provide that each Company Stock Option outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, together with each outstanding stock appreciation
right granted in tandem with such Company Stock Option, shall be canceled in
exchange for a lump sum cash payment equal to


<PAGE>


                                                                            48


(1) the product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such Company Stock Option and (y) the Merger Consideration, minus (2) the
product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Stock Option and (y) the per share exercise price of such Company
Stock Option. Such payment shall be made promptly following the Effective
Time.

          (b) The Company shall take all steps as may be required to cause the
transactions contemplated by this Section 5.04 and any other dispositions of
Company equity securities (including derivative securities) in connection with
this Agreement by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company
to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, such steps
to be taken in accordance with the Interpretive Letter dated January 12, 1999,
issued by the SEC to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP.

          SECTION 5.05. Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance. (a) Parent
and Sub agree that all rights to indemnification and exculpation from
liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
now existing in favor of the current or former directors or officers of the
Company and its subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificates of
incorporation or by-laws (or similar organizational documents) shall be
assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further action, at
the Effective Time and shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms.

          (b) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, Parent
shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of
the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations set forth in this Section
5.05.

          (c) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain in
effect the Company's current directors' and officers' liability insurance
covering each person currently covered by the Company's directors' and
officers' liability insurance policy for acts or omissions occurring prior to
the Effective Time on terms with respect to such coverage and amounts no less
favorable in any material respect to such directors and officers than those of
such policy as in effect on the date of this Agreement;


<PAGE>


                                                                            49


provided that Parent may substitute therefor policies of a reputable insurance
company the material terms of which, including coverage and amount, are no
less favorable in any material respect to such directors and officers than the
insurance coverage otherwise required under this Section 5.05(c); provided
however, that in no event shall Parent be required to pay aggregate premiums
for insurance under this Section 5.05(c) in excess of 250% of the amount of
the aggregate premiums paid by the Company for 1999 for such purpose (which
1999 premiums are hereby represented and warranted by the Company to be equal
to the amount identified in writing by the Company to Parent prior to the date
of this Agreement), provided that Parent shall nevertheless be obligated to
provide such coverage as may be obtained for such 250% amount.

          (d) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall unconditionally
guarantee the timely payment of all funds owed by, and the timely performance
of all other obligations of, the Surviving Corporation under this Section
5.05. Parent agrees that its payment obligations hereunder are unconditional,
irrespective of the validity or enforceability of this Agreement against the
Surviving Company or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a
legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor (other than the
defenses of statute of limitations, which are not waived). Parent hereby
acknowledges that its obligations under this Section 5.05 constitute a
guaranty of payment and not merely of collectability and Parent hereby waives
(i) promptness, diligence, presentment, demand of payment, protest and order
in connection with this guarantee and (ii) any requirement that any party
enforcing the guarantee exhaust any right to take any action against the
Surviving Company or any other person prior to or contemporaneously with
proceeding to exercise any right against Parent hereunder.

          (e) The provisions of this Section 5.05 are intended to be for the
benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each indemnified party, his or her
heirs and his or her representatives.

          SECTION 5.06. Fees and Expenses. (a) Except as set forth in Section
5.06(c), all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid
by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is
consummated.

          (b) In the event that (i) (A) a Takeover Proposal has been made to
the Company or its stockholders or any

                                                                            50


person has announced an intention (whether or not conditional and whether or
not withdrawn) to make a Takeover Proposal, (B) thereafter this Agreement is
terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(i) (but
only if the Stockholders Meeting has not been held by the date that is five
business days prior to the date of such termination) or 7.01(b)(iii) and (C)
within 12 months after such termination, the Company or any of its
subsidiaries enters into any Acquisition Agreement with respect to, or
consummates, any Takeover Proposal (solely for purposes of this Section
5.06(b)(i)(C), the term "Takeover Proposal" shall have the meaning set forth
in the definition of Takeover Proposal contained in Section 4.02(a) except
that all references to 20% shall be deemed references to 40%), (ii) this
Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 7.01(f) or (iii)
this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.01(c), then the
Company shall pay Parent a fee equal to $150,000,000 (the "Parent Termination
Fee") by wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated by Parent
(x) in the case of a termination by the Company pursuant to Section 7.01(f),
concurrently with such termination, (y) in the case of a termination by Parent
pursuant to Section 7.01(c), within two business days after such termination
and (z) in the case of a payment as a result of any event referred to in
Section 5.06(b)(i)(C), upon the first to occur of such events.

          (c) If a Parent Termination Fee becomes payable to Parent in
accordance with Section 5.06(b), the Company shall reimburse Parent and Sub
for all their expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement concurrently
with the payment of such Parent Termination Fee to Parent; provided, however,
that the aggregate amount of such reimbursement shall not exceed $10,000,000.
All payments made pursuant to this Section 5.06(c) shall be made by wire
transfer of same day funds to an account designated by Parent.

          (d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated for any reason
other than pursuant to Sections 7.01(c), 7.01(d)(i) or 7.01(f), then Parent
shall, within two business days after such termination, pay to the Company
$50,000,000 (the "Company Termination Fee"). In the case where this Agreement
is terminated pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(i) or 7.01(b)(iii) and Parent,
subsequent to such termination, becomes entitled to payment of the Parent
Termination Fee pursuant to Section 5.06(b), the Company shall refund to
Parent the full amount of the Company Termination Fee, if any, paid by Parent
pursuant to this Section 5.06(d) concurrently with the payment of such Parent

Termination Fee. All payments made to the Company pursuant to this Section
5.06(d) shall be made by wire transfer of same day funds to an account
designated by the Company.

          SECTION 5.07. Information Supplied. (a) The Company agrees that none
of the information included or incorporated by reference in the Proxy
Statement will, at the date it is filed with the SEC or mailed to the
Company's stockholders or at the time of the Stockholders Meeting, or at the
time of any amendment or supplement thereof, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, except that no
covenant is made by the Company with respect to statements made in the Proxy
Statement based on information supplied by Parent or Sub specifically for
inclusion or incorporation by reference therein. The Proxy Statement will
comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

          (b) Parent and Sub agree that none of the information supplied or to
be supplied by Parent or Sub specifically for inclusion in the Proxy Statement
will (except to the extent revised or superseded by amendments or supplements
contemplated hereby), at the date the Proxy Statement is filed with the SEC or
mailed to the Company's stockholders or at the time of the Stockholders
Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading.

          SECTION 5.08. Benefits Matters. (a) For purposes of this Agreement,
"Affected Employees" shall mean those individuals who are classified as
regular permanent employees of the Company and its subsidiaries (including
those so classified employees who are on vacation, leave of absence,
disability or maternity leave) as of the Effective Time who are in jobs that
will not be covered by collective bargaining or other labor union contracts
applicable to employees of Parent or the Company or any of their subsidiaries
after giving effect to the Merger.

          (b) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, give
the Affected Employees full credit, for purposes of eligibility, vesting and
benefit accrual under any employee benefit plans or arrangements maintained by
Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their respective


<PAGE>


                                                                            52


subsidiaries, for the Affected Employees' service with the Company and its
subsidiaries to the same extent recognized by the Company and its subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time, except where such crediting would
result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, give to each Affected Employee who (i) is
a current officer of the Company or the Principal Operating Sub or is one of
the three current director-level employees of the Principal Operating Sub who
satisfy the requirements of clauses (ii) and (iii) of this sentence, (ii) was
formerly employed by Parent and its subsidiaries and (iii) who became employed
by the Company and its subsidiaries within three months of terminating
employment with Parent and its subsidiaries, full credit (as if there has been
no break in service) for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual
under any employee benefit plans or arrangements maintained by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and their respective subsidiaries, for such Affected
Employee's service with Parent and its subsidiaries prior to the Effective
Time to the same extent recognized by Parent and its subsidiaries immediately
prior to such Affected Employee's termination of employment with Parent and
its subsidiaries, except where such crediting would result in a duplication of
benefits. The foregoing provisions of this Section 5.08(b) shall not limit or
impair Parent's ability to offset under its plans, programs and arrangements
any benefits provided or accrued under the Company's benefit plans, programs,
or arrangements for the same period of service.

          (c) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i)
waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions exclusions and waiting
periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to
the Affected Employees under any welfare benefit plans in which such employees
may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time to the extent waived
under the applicable Company plan immediately prior to the Effective Time and
(ii) provide each Affected Employee with credit for any co- payments and
deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time in the calendar year in which the
Effective Time occurs in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements under any welfare plans in which the Affected Employees are
eligible to participate after the Effective Time.

          (d) Parent agrees to honor, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to honor, the Company Benefit Plans and Company Benefit Agreements
in accordance with their terms subject to any power to amend or terminate such
Company Benefit Plans and Company Benefit Agreements


<PAGE>


                                                                            53


contained therein. For a period of one year immediately following the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
provide to the Affected Employees while employed by the Surviving Corporation
or its subsidiaries employee benefit plans and arrangements not materially
less favorable in the aggregate to those provided to the Affected Employees
immediately prior to the Effective Time excluding, for this purpose,
equity-based compensation plans and arrangements; provided, however, Parent
will provide eligibility for option grants during such one-year period to
Affected Employees on the same basis as provided to similarly situated
employees of Parent and its subsidiaries. If an Affected Employee becomes
employed by Parent, such Affected Employee shall be provided employee benefit
plans and arrangements that are in the aggregate not materially less favorable
than the benefit plans and arrangements provided to similarly situated
employees of Parent.

          (e) Parent acknowledges that (i) except as disclosed in the Company
Disclosure Schedule, the consummation of the Merger (or, if otherwise provided
under the applicable Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement, the
approval of the Merger by the Company's stockholders) shall constitute a
"Change in Control" or a "Change of Control" for purposes of each Company
Benefit Plan and Company Benefit Agreement listed on Section 3.01(m)(iv) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule in which such concept is relevant and (ii)(A)
any termination of employment by or of any individual identified on Section
5.08(e)(ii)(A) of the Company Disclosure Schedule following the Effective Time
and (B) any termination of employment by or of any individual identified on
Section 5.08(e)(ii)(B) of the Company Disclosure Schedule during the period
commencing six months following the Effective Time and ending nine months
following the Effective Time, shall be deemed to be for "Good Reason" for
purposes of any employment agreement or other Company Benefit Agreement listed
on Section 3.01(m)(iv) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and any Company
Benefit Plan in which such individual participates.

          SECTION 5.09. Public Announcements. Parent and Sub, on the one hand,
and the Company, on the other hand, shall, to the extent reasonably
practicable, consult with each other before issuing, and give each other a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other
public statements with respect to this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The parties agree that the
initial press release to be issued with respect to the transactions
contemplated

by this Agreement shall be in the form heretofore agreed to
by the parties.

          SECTION 5.10 Future Employment. For a period of two years following
the Closing Date, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
offer continued employment to all non-officer employees of the Company or any
of its subsidiaries who are employed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries
at the Effective Time; provided, however, that this Section 5.10 shall not
apply to any employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (i) who are
discharged for cause or performance related reasons or (ii) who are employees
of a subsidiary of the Company which is sold or transferred to a third party
at or after the Effective Time. Following the two year period specified in the
prior sentence, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
provide all former non-officer, non-union employees of the Company and its
subsidiaries the same job security protection, if any, as provided to
similarly-situated employees of Parent and its subsidiaries.

          (c) Legal Restraint. No Legal Restraint that has the effect of (i)
     prohibiting or limiting in any material respect the ownership or
     operation by the Company, Parent or any of their respective affiliates of

     required in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
     contemplated by this Agreement, except, in the case of this clause (ii),
     for those the failure of which to be obtained individually or in the

                       Termination, Amendment and Waiver

          (b) by either Parent or the Company:

               (i) if the Merger shall not have been consummated by December
          31, 2000 (the "Initial Termination Date", and as such may be
          extended pursuant to this paragraph, the "Termination Date");
          provided, however, that if on the Initial Termination Date the
          conditions to the Closing set forth in Sections 6.01(a), 6.01(b),

          requesting an extension of the Termination Date has been delivered
          by Parent or the Company to the other at any time during the 45 day
          period ending on the Initial Termination Date, the Termination Date

          right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
          7.01(b)(i) shall not be available to any party whose breach of this

          consummated by such date;

               (ii) if any Legal Restraint set forth in Section 6.01(c) shall
          be in effect and shall have become final and nonappealable;
          provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement
          pursuant to this Section 7.01(b)(ii) shall not be available to any
          party whose breach of this Agreement has been a principal reason
          that such event has occurred; or

          (d) by Parent (i) if the Company shall have breached any of its
     representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement,
     which breach (A) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth
     in Section 6.02(a) or 6.02(b), and (B) has not been or is incapable of
     being cured by the Company within twenty business days after its receipt
     of written notice thereof from Parent; or (ii) if any Legal Restraint set
     forth in Section 6.02(c) shall be in effect and shall have become final
     and nonappealable; provided, however, that the right to terminate this
     Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.01(d)(ii) shall not be available to
     Parent if any breach by Parent of this Agreement has been a principal
     reason that such event occurred;

          (e) by the Company if Parent shall have breached any of its
     representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement,
     which breach (i) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth

     being cured by Parent within twenty business days after its receipt of
     written notice thereof from the Company; or

          (f) by the Company in accordance with the terms and subject to the
     conditions of Section 4.02(b).

this Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in Section 7.01,
this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any

the provisions of Section 3.01(u), the last two sentences of Section 5.02,
Section 5.06, this Section 7.02 and Article VIII; provided, however, that no
such termination shall relieve any party hereto from any liability or damages
resulting from a wilful breach by a party of any of its representations,
warranties or covenants set forth in this Agreement.

          SECTION 7.03. Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the
parties hereto at any time, whether before or after the Stockholder Approval
has been obtained; provided, however, that after the Stockholder Approval has
been obtained, there shall be made no amendment that by law requires further
approval by stockholders of the parties without the further approval of such
stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in

obligations or other acts of the other parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document

of such stockholders. Except as provided in Section 5.03(b), any agreement on
the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure
or delay by any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights nor shall
any single or partial exercise by any party to this Agreement of any of its
rights under this Agreement preclude any other or further exercise of such
rights or any other rights under this Agreement.

                         Capitol Air Divestiture Plan

Capitol Air Assets: Capitol Air will be comprised of the following
                    assets:

                    (A)  Aircraft: If requested by the buyer, a number and
                         type of aircraft identified by Tar Heel that are
                         necessary and reasonably suited to operate Capitol
                         Air.

                    (B)  Slots: If requested by the buyer, a number of jet and
                         commuter slots at Reagan-National Airport that are
                         necessary to operate Capitol Air, which number shall
                         not exceed 106 jet slots and 116 commuter slots. The
                         timing and identification numbers of such slots to be
                         reasonably agreed upon.

                    (C)  Gates: If requested by the buyer, up to eight gates
                         at Reagan-National Airport at locations to be
                         reasonably agreed upon that are necessary and
                         reasonably suited to operate Capitol Air. All leases
                         relating to such facilities will be assumed by the
                         buyer.

                    (D)  Airport Facilities: If requested by the buyer, ticket
                         counter and similar airport facilities to be
                         reasonably agreed upon that are necessary and
                         reasonably suited for the buyer to operate Capitol
                         Air. All leases relating to such facilities will be
                         assumed by the buyer.

                    (E)  Maintenance Facility: If requested by the buyer,
                         Yellow Jacket's line maintenance facility at
                         Reagan-National Airport. The lease relating to such
                         facility will be assumed by the buyer.

                    (F)  Other: If requested by the buyer, ground handling
                         equipment, spare parts and other items to be
                         reasonably agreed upon that are necessary for the
                         buyer to operate Capitol Air.

                    The Capitol Air assets will not include any assets not
                    necessary to operate Capitol Air or any cash. Capitol Air
                    will continue the operations of Yellow Jacket at Reagan-

                    certain flights to and from Charlotte, Pittsburgh and
                    Philadelphia).

                    Airport - Reagan-National Airport.

Capitol Air
Liabilities:        The buyer of Capitol Air will assume all liabilities
                    primarily related to Capitol Air.

Employees:          If requested by the buyer, Tar Heel will provide to the
                    buyer on an interim basis, subject to receipt of any
                    necessary labor approvals, the employees needed to operate
                    Capitol Air on market terms to be reasonably agreed upon.

Additional Support: Tar Heel will provide frequent flyer program support on
                    market terms to be agreed upon. In addition, Tar Heel
                    will, if requested by the buyer and if reasonably
                    practicable, provide to such buyer revenue accounting
                    services, maintenance services, training services, fuel
                    purchasing services and other services necessary for such
                    buyer to operate Capitol Air upon market terms to be
                    agreed upon.

Additional Assets:  If requested by the buyer of Capitol Air, [P] Airline,
                    Inc. ("Commuter Air") will be included in Capitol Air.

                    In this event, at the option of Tar Heel, either (i) the
                    buyer of Capitol Air will provide commuter feed to Tar
                    Heel and Yellow Jacket, on a code share basis at market
                    terms to be agreed upon, from points behind Yellow Jacket
                    hubs (the "Commuter Feed Points") currently served by
                    Commuter Air or (ii) Tar Heel will retain the assets of
                    Commuter Air that are used to provide service to the
                    Commuter Feed Points.

                    If the buyer of Capitol Air is not an existing mainline
                    carrier, such buyer will, if requested by Tar Heel,
                    reasonably and in good faith explore partnering
                    opportunities with existing mainline carriers.

Other Terms:        The divestiture agreement with each buyer will be
                    negotiated by such buyer and Tar Heel and will contain
                    customary terms for transactions of this type; provided,
                    however, that Tar Heel's obligation to indemnify any buyer
                    shall be limited to (x) in the case of losses relating to
                    any breach of a representation or warranty, 40% of the
                    purchase price paid to Tar Heel by such buyer, and (y) in
                    the case of all losses, the purchase price paid by such
                    buyer. The terms of the divestiture agreement must be
                    reasonably acceptable to both Tar Heel and Yellow Jacket
                    taking into account as a primary objective obtaining
                    antitrust clearance for the merger.

Closing:            The obligation to effect the Capitol Air divestiture will
                    be contingent upon the satisfaction of all conditions
                    precedent to the closing of the Tar Heel/Yellow Jacket
                    merger (assuming such divestiture is effected). The
                    obligation to effect the Capitol Air divestiture will also
                    be contingent upon receipt of all consents required to
                    permit the buyers to operate Capitol Air as contemplated
                    herein. At the closing of each transaction, the buyer will
                    pay to Yellow Jacket the cash purchase price agreed to by
                    such buyer. Tar Heel shall not be entitled to refrain from
                    selling Capitol Air on the terms contained herein on the
                    basis that the cash purchase price to which the potential
                    buyer has agreed is inadequate value for such assets.
