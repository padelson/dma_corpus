right that the Buyer or Guarantor may have at any time against any of the Sellers; or (v)&nbsp;any other act or omission that may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of Guarantor or otherwise operate as a discharge of Guarantor as
a matter of Law or equity. Notwithstanding anything the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Sellers and the Sellers&#146; Representative hereby agree that to the extent that Buyer is relieved from its payment and performance obligations under
this Agreement by satisfaction thereof, the Guarantor shall be similarly relieved, to such extent, of its obligations under this <U>Section</U><U></U><U>&nbsp;9(r)</U>. This Agreement shall conclusively be deemed to have been entered into and

any of the Sellers is pursuing its rights and remedies hereunder against Guarantor, neither the Sellers&#146; Representative nor any Seller, as applicable shall be under an obligation to pursue any rights and remedies it may have against the Buyer
