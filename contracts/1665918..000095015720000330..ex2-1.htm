being referred to as a "Dissenting Share" until such time as such Dissenting
Stockholder fails to perfect or otherwise  loses such Dissenting
Stockholder's appraisal rights under the DGCL with respect to such Dissenting
Share) shall not be converted into a right to receive a portion of the Merger
Consideration, but instead shall, effective as of the Effective  Time, no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and extinguished and
shall cease to exist, and except as otherwise provided by Law, the holder of
such Dissenting Share shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto
other  than the rights granted pursuant to the DGCL; _provided_ , that upon a
determination of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares and whenever such
fair value is due and  payable in accordance with the provisions of Section
262, the Parties shall cause the Paying Agent to remit to the Company the
portion of the Merger Consideration to which such Dissenting Stockholder is
entitled in respect of each such Dissenting  Share, and the Company shall pay
the fair value of the Dissenting Shares to the holders thereof in accordance
with Section 262; _provided_ , _however_ , that if, after the Effective Time,
such Dissenting Stockholder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses such
Dissenting Stockholder's right to appraisal pursuant to Section 262 or if a
court  of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such Dissenting
Stockholder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262, such
Dissenting Share shall be treated as if it had been converted as of the
Effective Time into the right to  receive the portion of the Merger
Consideration, if any, to which such Dissenting Stockholder is entitled
pursuant to _Section 2.4(b)(i)_ without interest thereon. The  Company shall
provide Buyer prompt written notice of any demand received by the Company for
appraisal of any Company Common Share and copies of all documents or
correspondence relating thereto, and Buyer shall have the opportunity and
right to  direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands. Except with the prior written consent of Buyer, the Company shall not

shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent only the
right, subject to _Section 2.7_, to receive the applicable portion  of the

Section 2.7 _Letter of Transmittal_.

 


 

 

(a) Buyer, at its sole cost and expense, will engage  the Escrow Agent or
another bank or trust company appointed by Buyer and reasonably acceptable to
the Company to be the paying agent (in such role, the "Paying  Agent") and
enter into an agreement, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Company,
with such Paying Agent, and Buyer shall cause the Paying Agent to effect (i)
the exchange of cash for Company Common Shares which are entitled to  payment
pursuant to _Section 2.4(b)(i)_ and (ii) the payment of the Redemption Amount
to the Company Preferred Stockholders pursuant to _Section 2.5(a)(xi)_. To
facilitate such exchange, as soon as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall deliver or cause to be delivered to each Person
who is, as of the  date of this Agreement, a holder of record of Company
Common Shares a form of letter of transmittal substantially in a customary
form reasonably acceptable to the Company and Buyer (the "Letter of
Transmittal"). Upon delivery of a Letter of Transmittal to the Company or,
following Closing, the Paying Agent, duly completed and validly executed by
the applicable Company Common Stockholder in  accordance with the
instructions thereto, together with such other documents as may be required
pursuant to such instructions (including any Certificate, to the extent such
Company Common Share is certificated, or, in each case, a duly executed 
affidavit of lost certificate), such holder of Company Common Shares shall be
entitled to receive, by the means indicated in such Letter of Transmittal,
promptly after the Effective Time (or within three Business Days after
delivery of the  completed Letter of Transmittal if such delivery occurs
after a date that is three Business Days prior to the Closing Date), such
Company Common Stockholder's applicable portion of the Closing Merger
Consideration payable in accordance with _Section 2.4(b)_; _provided_ , that
any Company Common Stockholder that delivers to the Company a  duly completed
and validly executed Letter of Transmittal at least three Business Days prior
to the Closing Date shall be paid their applicable portion of the Closing
Merger Consideration concurrently with the Closing. Upon receipt by the 
Company of any Letter of Transmittal (together with such other documents as
may be required pursuant to the instructions therein), the Company shall
promptly deliver a copy thereof to Buyer. Following the Effective Time, Buyer
shall cause the  Paying Agent to promptly pay to each Company Common
Stockholder whose Letter of Transmittal has been delivered to the Company and
provided to Buyer by the Company after a date that is three Business Days
prior to the Closing Date or has been  delivered to the Paying Agent on or
after the Closing Date such Company Common Stockholder's applicable portion of
the Closing Merger Consideration payable in accordance with _Section
2.4(b)_,  in each case, subject to compliance with this _Section 2.7_ and in
accordance with the Consideration Allocation Schedule. Subject to _Section
2.7(d)_, any Company Common Stockholder that has not delivered a Letter of
Transmittal to the Company in the applicable form at least three Business Days
prior to the Closing Date shall,  following the Closing Date, look only to
the Surviving Corporation for payment of any consideration to which such
Company Common Stockholder is entitled pursuant to this Agreement.

 


 

 

(b) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or  destroyed, then upon
the making of an affidavit by the holder of the Company Common Shares formerly
represented by such Certificate, or by a Representative of that holder, of
such loss, theft or destruction, the Paying

 

 

7  


 

 

Agent shall pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate,
the applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Company
Common Shares  formerly represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by
this _Article II_. As a condition of such payment and in its sole discretion,
the Surviving Corporation may  require the attesting holder to post a bond in
such reasonable and customary amount as Buyer may direct (not to exceed the
Merger Consideration payable with respect to the Company Common Shares
formerly represented by such Certificate) to indemnify  against any claim
that might be brought with respect to the Certificate upon which payment was
made.

 


 

 

(c) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of  the Company shall be
closed and no further registration of transfers of Equity Securities shall
thereafter be made on the records of the Company.

 


 

 

(d) At any time following the first anniversary of the  Closing Date, the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver
to it any funds that had been made available to the Paying Agent and which
have not been disbursed in accordance with this _Article II_ and thereafter
Company Common Stockholders entitled to receive payment pursuant to this
_Article II_  shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general
creditors thereof with respect to the payment of any applicable portion of the
Merger Consideration, to which  such Company Common Stockholder is entitled
pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in the foregoing, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, none of Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company,  the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of
any portion of the Merger Consideration properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law.

 


 

 

Section 2.8 _Adjustment Amount_.

 


 

 

(a) (i) No later than five Business Days prior to the  Closing Date, the
Company shall deliver to Buyer: a statement ("Estimated Closing Statement")
setting forth the Company's good faith estimate of: (A) the  Closing Working
Capital (such estimate, "Estimated Closing Working Capital"); (B) the Closing
Cash (such estimate, "Estimated Closing Cash"); (C) the Closing Indebtedness
(such estimate, "Estimated Closing Indebtedness");             
(D) the Closing Transaction Costs (such estimate, "Estimated Closing
Transaction Costs"); (E) the Net Tax Adjustment (such estimate, "Estimated Net
Tax Adjustment"); and (F) the Closing Merger Consideration. The Estimated
Closing Statement shall also include instructions that identify the bank
accounts  designated to facilitate direct payment by Buyer of (x) the Debt
Payoff Amount and (y) the Estimated Closing Transaction Costs (including any
such amounts to be paid in accordance with _Section 5.17_), in each case, to
the applicable payees on behalf of the Company Entities. The Estimated Closing
Statement shall be prepared and calculated in a manner consistent with the
applicable definitions contained  in this Agreement, the Sample Calculation
and in accordance with the Accounting Principles and shall include a
reasonably detailed summary of the calculations made to arrive at such
amounts. The Company shall provide to Buyer such supporting  documentation in
connection with the preparation and the calculation of the amounts set forth
in the Estimated Closing Statement as Buyer may reasonably request, and shall
cooperate with Buyer in its review and evaluation of the Estimated Closing 
Statement. The Company shall consider in good faith Buyer's comments to the
Estimated Closing Statement and shall revise the Estimated

 

 

8  


 

 

Closing Statement by no later than two Business Days prior to the Closing Date
if, based on its good faith assessment of Buyer's comments, the Company
determines such  changes are warranted, which revised statement and revised
calculations shall become the applicable Estimated Closing Statement and the
Estimated Closing Working Capital, Estimated Closing Cash, Estimated Closing
Indebtedness, Estimated Closing  Transaction Costs and Estimated Net Tax
Adjustment reflected therein, as applicable. Estimated Closing Working
Capital, Estimated Closing Cash, Estimated Closing Indebtedness, Estimated
Closing Transaction Costs and Estimated Net Tax Adjustment  (as set forth in
the Estimated Closing Statement delivered by the Company to Buyer) shall be
binding on the Parties for the purposes of determining the Closing Merger
Consideration.

 


 

 

(ii) No later than two business days prior to the  Closing Date, the Company
shall deliver to Buyer a schedule setting forth (A) the applicable portion of
the Redemption Amount payable to each Company Preferred Stockholder, (B) the
applicable portion of the Closing Merger Consideration payable to  each
Company Common Stockholder (including any applicable reduction to such amount
in connection with the repayment of any applicable Co-Invest Promissory Note
Balance in accordance with _Section 2.5(d))_, and (C) the applicable
percentage of the Adjustment Amount payable to each Company Common
Stockholder, in each case, calculated in accordance with the Company's
Organizational Documents and any other  applicable Contract governing the
Equity Securities of the Company as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
(the "Consideration Allocation Schedule").

 


 

 

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable following the  Closing, but in any
event no later than 90 days after the Closing Date (the "Preparation Period"),
Buyer will cause the Surviving Corporation to prepare, or  cause to be
prepared, and deliver to the Stockholders' Representative an unaudited
statement (the "Closing Statement"), setting forth the Surviving 
Corporation's good faith calculation of each of the Closing Amounts, the
Adjustment Amount and the Merger Consideration, _provided_ that the
Stockholders' Representative  has delivered to the Surviving Corporation, by
no later than the later of (i) 30 days following the Closing and (ii) 10 days
following the Surviving Corporation's request therefor, final trial balances,
financial statements and such other  information as the Surviving Corporation
may reasonably request in connection with the preparation of the Closing
Statement (it being agreed that the Preparation Period shall be extended by
one day for each day of delay by the Stockholders'  Representative in
delivering the information requested by the Surviving Corporation). The
Closing Statement shall be prepared and calculated in a manner consistent with
the applicable definitions contained in this Agreement, the Sample 
Calculation and in accordance with the Accounting Principles and shall include
a reasonably detailed summary of the calculations made to arrive at such
amounts. In the event the Surviving Corporation does not deliver the Closing
Statement to the  Stockholders' Representative within the Preparation Period,
the Estimated Closing Statement shall be deemed to have been delivered by the
Surviving Corporation to the Stockholders' Representative as the Closing
Statement upon the expiration of  the Preparation Period.

 


 

 

(c) Upon receipt from the Surviving Corporation, the  Stockholders'
Representative shall have 30 days to review the Closing Statement (the "Review
Period"). At the request of the Stockholders' Representative,  Buyer shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to (i) reasonably cooperate with and assist,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries, including the Company Entities, and each of
their respective Representatives to reasonably cooperate with and assist,
the  Stockholders' Representative and its Representatives in the review of
the Closing Statement

 


 

 

 

9  


 

 

(including by executing such documents and other instruments and taking
further actions as may be reasonably required to cause the Company Entities
and their  respective accountants to deliver to the Stockholders'
Representative and its Representatives copies of their work papers relating to
the Company Entities) and (ii) provide the Stockholders' Representative and
its Representatives with any  information reasonably requested by the
Stockholders' Representative that is necessary for its review of the Closing
Statement. If the Stockholders' Representative disagrees with the Surviving
Corporation's computation of the Closing Amounts (each  as set forth in the
Closing Statement), the Stockholders' Representative shall, on or prior to the
last day of the Review Period, deliver a written notice to the Surviving
Corporation (the "Notice of Objection") that sets forth the Stockholders'
Representative's objections to the Surviving Corporation's calculation of the
Closing Amounts, as applicable. Any Notice of Objection shall specify those 
items or amounts with which the Stockholders' Representative disagrees and
shall set forth the Stockholders' Representative's calculation of the Closing
Amounts, the Adjustment Amount and the Merger Consideration based on such
objections.

 


 

 

(d) If the Stockholders' Representative does not  deliver a Notice of
Objection to the Surviving Corporation with respect to any item contained in
the Closing Statement within the Review Period, the Stockholders'
Representative shall be deemed to have accepted the Surviving Corporation's 
calculation of all underlying items of the Closing Amounts, as applicable, and
such calculations shall be final, conclusive and binding; _provided_ , that
nothing herein,  including such final calculations, shall impair Buyer's
rights to indemnification for any amount pursuant to the Separation Agreement
to the extent any such amount has not actually been compensated through
payment of the Adjustment Amount,  including for the avoidance of doubt,
indemnification in respect of any Taxes otherwise indemnifiable pursuant to
the Separation Agreement, whether or not of a type included in the definition
of Net Tax Adjustment. If the Stockholders'  Representative delivers a Notice
of Objection to the Surviving Corporation within the Review Period, the
Surviving Corporation and the Stockholders' Representative shall, during the
30 days following such delivery or any mutually agreed extension  thereof,
use their good faith efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items and
amounts in order to determine the amount of the disputed Closing Amounts, as
applicable, the Adjustment Amount and the Merger Consideration. If, at the end
of  such 30-day period or any mutually agreed extension thereof, the
Surviving Corporation and the Stockholders' Representative are unable to
resolve their disagreements, they shall jointly retain and refer their
disagreements to KPMG LLP or such  other nationally recognized independent
accounting firm as may be mutually agreed by the Surviving Corporation and the
Stockholders' Representative (the "Independent             
Expert"). The Surviving Corporation and the Stockholders' Representative shall
instruct the Independent Expert promptly to review this _Section 2.8_, as well
as  the Closing Statement, Notice of Objection and any other materials
reasonably requested by the Independent Expert, and to determine, solely with
respect to the disputed items and amounts so submitted, whether and to what
extent, if any, the  Closing Amounts set forth in the Closing Statement
require adjustment. The Independent Expert shall act as an expert, and not as
an arbitrator, and shall base its determination solely on written submissions
by the Surviving Corporation and the  Stockholders' Representative and the
terms of this Agreement and not pursuant to an independent review. The Parties
shall make available to the Independent Expert all relevant books and records
and other items reasonably requested by the  Independent Expert. As promptly
as practicable, but in no event later than 45 days after its retention, the
Independent Expert shall deliver to the Surviving Corporation and the
Stockholders' Representative a report that sets forth its  resolution of the
disputed items and amounts and its

 


 

 

 

10  


 

 

calculation of the Closing Amounts; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Independent Expert may not assign a value to any item greater than the
greatest value for such item claimed by the Surviving Corporation, on the one
hand, and the Stockholders' Representative,  on the other hand, nor less than
the smallest value for such item claimed by the Surviving Corporation, on the
one hand, and the Stockholders' Representative, on the other hand. The
decision of the Independent Expert shall be final, conclusive and  binding on
the Parties, and no determinations by the Independent Expert, including any
work or analyses performed by the Independent Expert in connection with its
resolution of any dispute under this _Section 2.8(d)_ shall be admissible as
evidence in any Legal Proceeding among the Parties, except to the extent
necessary to enforce payment obligations under this _Section 2.8_. The costs
and expenses of the Independent Expert shall be allocated between the
Surviving Corporation, on the one hand, and the Stockholders' Representative
(on behalf of the Company Common  Stockholders in proportion to their
respective shares of the Merger Consideration), on the other hand, based upon
the percentage that the portion of the aggregate contested amount not awarded
to such Party bears to the aggregate amount actually  contested by such
Party, as determined by the Independent Expert. For example, if (i) the
Stockholders' Representative submits a Notice of Objection for $1,000, (ii)
the Surviving Corporation contest only $500 of the amount claimed by the 
Stockholders' Representative, and (iii) the Independent Expert ultimately
resolves the dispute by awarding the Stockholders' Representative $300 of the
$500 contested, then the costs and expenses of the Independent Expert would be
allocated 60%  (i.e., 300/500) to the Surviving Corporation and 40% (i.e.,
200/500) to the Stockholders' Representative (on behalf of the Company Common
Stockholders in proportion to their respective shares of the Merger
Consideration). Buyer, the Surviving  Corporation and the Stockholders'
Representative agree to execute, if requested by the Independent Expert, a
reasonable engagement letter, including customary indemnities in favor of the
Independent Expert.

 


 

 

(e) For purposes of this Agreement:

 


 

 

(i) "Final Closing Working Capital", "Final Closing Cash", "Final Closing
Indebtedness", "Final Closing Transaction Costs" and "Final Net Tax
Adjustment" mean the amounts of such items (A) as shown in the Closing
Statement delivered (or deemed to have been delivered) by the Surviving
Corporation to the Stockholders' Representative  pursuant to _Section 2.8(b)_
if no Notice of Objection with respect thereto is timely delivered by the
Stockholders' Representative to the Surviving Corporation pursuant  to
_Section 2.8(c)_, or (B) if a Notice of Objection is so delivered, (I) as
agreed by the Surviving Corporation and the Stockholders' Representative
pursuant to _Section 2.8(d)_ or (II) in the absence of such agreement, as
determined in the Independent Expert's report delivered pursuant to _Section
2.8(d)_; and

 


 

 

(ii) "Adjustment Amount" means, subject to the limitation contained in
_Section 2.8(f)_ and _Section 2.8(g)_, the amount (which may be positive or
negative), which shall be calculated as follows:

 


 

 

(A) if the Final Closing Working Capital is greater  than the Estimated
Closing Working Capital, the amount of such excess; _minus_

 


 

 

(B) if the Estimated Closing Working Capital is  greater than the Final
Closing Working Capital the amount of such excess; _plus_

 


 

 

 

11  


 

 

(C) if the Final Closing Cash is greater than the  Estimated Closing Cash,
the amount of such excess; _minus_

 


 

 

(D) if the Estimated Closing Cash is greater than the  Final Closing Cash,
the amount of such excess; _plus_

 


 

 

(E) if the Estimated Closing Indebtedness is greater  than the Final Closing
Indebtedness, the amount of such excess; _minus_

 


 

 

(F) if the Final Closing Indebtedness is greater than  the Estimated Closing
Indebtedness, the amount of such excess; _plus_

 


 

 

(G) if the Estimated Closing Transaction Costs are  greater than the Final
Closing Transaction Costs, the amount of such excess; _minus_

 


 

 

(H) if the Final Closing Transaction Costs are greater  than the Estimated
Closing Transaction Costs, the amount of such excess; _plus_

 


 

 

(I) if the Estimated Net Tax Adjustment is greater  than the Final Net Tax
Adjustment, the amount of such excess; _minus_

 


 

 

(J) if the Final Net Tax Adjustment is greater than  the Estimated Net Tax
Adjustment, the amount of such excess.

 


 

 

(f) Within three Business Days after the Adjustment  Amount has been finally
determined pursuant to this _Section 2.8_:

 


 

 

(i) if the Adjustment Amount is a negative number,  Buyer and the
Stockholders' Representative shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to
release and pay from the Adjustment Escrow Account the following amounts: (A)
to Buyer, an amount equal to the lesser of (I) the absolute value of the 
Adjustment Amount and (II) the funds remaining in the Adjustment Escrow
Account, and (B) to the Company Common Stockholders in accordance with each
Company Common Stockholder's applicable percentage of the Adjustment Amount as
set forth in the  Consideration Allocation Schedule, an amount equal to the
then-remaining funds, if any, in the Adjustment Escrow Account after taking
into account any funds released to Buyer pursuant to this _Section 2.8(f)(i)_;
and

 


 

 

(ii) if the Adjustment Amount is a positive number,  (A) Buyer shall pay, or
cause to be paid to the Paying Agent for further distribution, to each Company
Common Stockholder such Company Common Stockholders' proportionate share of
the Adjustment Amount, in each case in accordance with such Company  Common
Stockholder's applicable percentage of the Adjustment Amount as set forth in
the Consideration Allocation Schedule and by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account designated in such Company Common Stockholder's
Letter of  Transmittal; _provided_ , that in no event shall the aggregate
Adjustment Amount payable to the Company Common Stockholders exceed an amount
equal to the Adjustment Escrow  Amount, and (B) the Stockholders'
Representative shall be entitled to instruct the Escrow Agent to release and
pay to each Company Common Stockholder from the Adjustment Escrow Account such
Company Common Stockholders' proportionate share of the

 

 

12  


 

 

then-remaining funds in the Adjustment Escrow Account, in each case in
accordance with such Company Common Stockholder's applicable percentage of the
Adjustment Amount  as set forth in the Consideration Allocation Schedule and
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated in
such Company Common Stockholder's Letter of Transmittal; _provided_ , that
_Section 2.5(b)_ shall apply to any such payments, mutatis mutandis.

 


 

 

(g) The payment to Buyer from the Adjustment Escrow  Account described in
_Section 2.8(f)(i)(A)_ and the payment to the Company Common Stockholders in
_Section 2.8(f)(ii)(A)_  shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of each of
Buyer and the Company Common Stockholders, as applicable, for any and all
claims arising under this Agreement with respect to an Adjustment Amount in
favor of such parties, and neither Buyer nor  any of the Company Common
Stockholders shall have further Liability with respect to any such Adjustment
Amount in favor of any other Party beyond such payment; _provided_ ,  that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall impair Buyer's rights to
indemnification for any amount pursuant to the Separation Agreement to the
extent any such amount has not actually been compensated through payment of
the  Adjustment Amount, including for the avoidance of doubt, indemnification
in respect of any Taxes otherwise indemnifiable pursuant to the Separation
Agreement whether or not of a type included in the definition of Net Tax
Adjustment.

(a) At the Closing, Buyer and the Stockholders'  Representative shall enter
into the Escrow Agreement with a nationally recognized escrow agent reasonably
acceptable to the Company and Buyer (the "Escrow

right to compensation for any such excise Taxes. No payment or deemed payment
by the Company  Entities will arise or be made as a result (alone or in
combination with any other event) of the execution, delivery and performance

Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA.

duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of organization. Each of Buyer and  Merger Sub has all necessary
power and authority: (a) to conduct its business in the manner in which its
business is currently being conducted; (b) to own and use its assets in the
manner in which its assets are currently owned and used; and  (c) to perform
its obligations under all Contracts by which it is bound, except for any such
failure that would not have, and would not reasonably be expected to have,

Buyer and Merger Sub is qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign
corporation, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the nature of
its business or the character or location of the assets owned or used by it
requires such  qualification or licensing, except where the failure to be so
qualified, licensed or in good standing does not have, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Buyer
Material Adverse Effect.

 


 

 

Section 4.2 _Merger Sub_. Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose of
engaging in the Transactions and activities incidental to the Transactions and
has not engaged in any business activities or  conducted any operations other
than in connection with the Transactions and those incident to Merger Sub's
formation. Buyer owns beneficially and of record all of the outstanding
capital stock of Merger Sub, free and clear of all Encumbrances  and transfer
restrictions, except for such Encumbrances and transfer restrictions of
general applicability as may be provided under the Securities Act or other
applicable securities laws.

of this Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary action on the
part of Buyer and Merger Sub and their respective boards of directors 
(subject to the adoption of this Agreement by Buyer as the sole stockholder of
Merger Sub, which shall occur immediately following the execution and delivery
of this Agreement). Assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the

which shall occur immediately following the execution and delivery of this
Agreement). Assuming due authorization,  execution and delivery by the
Company, this Agreement is enforceable against Buyer and Merger Sub in
accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement may be subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium  and
other similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting the

Disclosure Schedules,  cause a violation by Buyer or Merger Sub of any Law or
order applicable to Buyer or Merger Sub, or to which they are subject; (iii)

the creation of any Encumbrance (other than Permitted  Encumbrance) on any
properties or assets of Buyer or Merger Sub, except in the case of clauses

individually or in the aggregate, a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

 


 

 

(b) Except as required in connection with the matters  set forth in _Section
3.5(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedules and as required by the HSR Act,

any Governmental Entity at any time prior to the Closing in connection with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Buyer or Merger Sub or the
consummation by  Buyer or Merger Sub of the Merger or the other Transactions,
except those filings, notifications, approvals, notices or Consents the
failure to make, obtain or receive would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a  Buyer Material Adverse Effect. No vote
of Buyer's or Merger Sub's stockholders is necessary to approve this Agreement
or any of the Transactions.

 


 

 

Section 4.5 _Absence of Litigation_. There is no Legal Proceeding pending and
served or, to the Knowledge of Buyer, pending and not served against Buyer or

(on their own behalf or on behalf of the Company) against Buyer or Merger Sub
arising out of the Merger or in connection with the Transactions (except as it
relates to breaches by  Buyer or Merger Sub of this Agreement). As of the
date of this Agreement, to the Knowledge of Buyer or Merger Sub, neither Buyer
nor Merger Sub is subject to any continuing order of, consent decree,
settlement agreement or similar written  agreement with, or continuing
investigation by, any Governmental Entity, or any order, writ, judgment,
injunction, decree, determination or award of any Governmental Entity, except
as would not and would not reasonably be expected to have a Buyer  Material
Adverse Effect.

sources of immediately available funds (including available lines of credit)
in an amount sufficient to (i) pay the Redemption Amount and the Merger

(assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in

as such debts become due, (ii) have capital sufficient to carry out their
respective businesses as currently conducted and (iii) own assets and

(a) Buyer acknowledges and confirms that, except for  the representations and
warranties expressly set forth in _Article III_ (as qualified or modified by
the Company Disclosure Schedules) or in a certificate delivered  pursuant to
this Agreement, none of the Company, their respective Affiliates or any of
their respective Representatives have made, or shall be deemed to have made,

Entities, including with respect to (a) merchantability or fitness for any
particular purpose,  (b) the operation of the business of the Company
Entities after the Closing, (c) the probable success or profitability of the
business of the Company Entities after the Closing or (d) the accuracy or
completeness of any Evaluation Material or the  appropriateness or
suitability of such information for the purposes of enabling Buyer to evaluate
the consummation of the Transactions. None of the Company, their respective
Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives will have or be 
subject to any Liability to Buyer or any other

 


 

 

 

35  


 

 

Person resulting from the distribution to Buyer, its Affiliates or their
respective Representatives of, or Buyer's use of or reliance on, any
Evaluation Material in  expectation of the Transactions. Buyer confirms that
the Company has made available to Buyer and Buyer's Representatives such
opportunity to ask questions of the personnel of the Company Entities, as well
as such access to the offices, properties  and books and records of the
business of the Company Entities as deemed appropriate by Buyer in connection
with its determination to enter into this Agreement and consummate the
Transactions.

 


 

 

(b) Buyer has conducted to its satisfaction its own  independent review and
analysis of, and based thereon has formed an independent judgment concerning,
the Transactions and the assets, properties, Liabilities, condition,
operations and prospects of the business of the Company Entities. Buyer and 
Merger Sub have been given access to and an opportunity to examine such
documents, materials and information concerning the Company Entities as Buyer
and Merger Sub have deemed necessary or advisable in order to reach an
informed decision as to  the decision to enter into this Agreement and
consummate the Transactions. In connection with such due diligence
investigation of the Company Entities by Buyer and Merger Sub and their
respective Affiliates, stockholders and Representatives,  Buyer and Merger
Sub and their respective Affiliates, stockholders and Representatives have
received or been provided access to and may continue to receive or be provided
access to (including in any "data rooms") after the date of this Agreement 
from the Company, the other Company Entities, and their respective Affiliates,
stockholders and Representatives, certain estimates, projections, forecasts
and other forward-looking information, as well as certain business plan
information,  regarding the Company Entities and their respective businesses
and operations. Buyer and Merger Sub acknowledge that there are uncertainties
inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections, forecasts and
other forward-looking  statements, as well as in such business plans, and
that Buyer and Merger Sub will have no claim against the Company Entities, or
any of their respective Affiliates, stockholders or Representatives, or any
other Person with respect to such matters  unless any such information is
expressly included in a representation or warranty contained in _Article III_
or in a certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement.   Each of Buyer and
Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that neither the Company Entities nor any
of their respective Affiliates, stockholders or Representatives, nor any other
Person, has made or is making any express or implied representation or 
warranty with respect to such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-

included in a representation or warranty contained in _Article III_ or in a
certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement.

or financial advisor is entitled to any brokerage, finder's or other similar
fee or commission, or the reimbursement of  expenses, in connection with the
Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Buyer, Merger Sub
or any of their respective Subsidiaries except for Persons, if any, whose fees
and expenses shall be paid by Buyer or Merger Sub.

the Company (or,  following the Closing, the Stockholders' Representative)
(such consents, in either case, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), except (a) if such announcement or other communication is
required by applicable Law, Order or the  rules and regulations of any
national securities exchange or national securities quotation system, in which
case the disclosing Party shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
Order, rule or regulation, first allow the Buyer or the  Company (or,
following the Closing, the Stockholders' Representative), as applicable, to
review such announcement or communication and comment thereon, and the
disclosing Party shall consider such comments in good faith and (b)
announcements and  communications to Governmental Entities in connection with
Filings or Permits relating to the Transactions required to be made under this
Agreement; _provided_ , that,  except to the extent required by the
immediately preceding clauses (a) and (b), no Party shall make, or allow to be
made, any public announcement or communication that includes or references (i)
the Merger Consideration or any element thereof, or  any of the other
economic terms of the Transactions, without the prior written consent of the
Buyer or the Company (or, following the Closing, the Stockholders'
Representative), as applicable, or (ii) any Affiliate of Stockholders'
Representative  (other than the Company) without the prior written consent of
the Person referred to in such announcement or statement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing herein will prohibit the issuance of any public
announcement or communication made by the Parties or their Affiliates which is
consistent with the initial public announcement  and the terms of this
Agreement and does not contain any information relating to the Parties or this
Agreement or the Transactions that has not been previously announced or made
public in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. For the  avoidance of
doubt, the foregoing shall not restrict disclosures by the Stockholders'
Representative to the Company Stockholders in order that such Company
Stockholders may provide information about this Agreement and the Transactions
to their  respective limited partners and prospective limited partners in
connection with their ordinary course fundraising, reporting and other
activities. Buyer and the Company shall reasonably consult with each other
concerning the means by which the  employees, customers and suppliers of the

way with, any Person or group of Persons concerning any sale of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Company Entities, taken as a whole, or
any of the Company  Common Shares, Company Preferred Shares or equity
interests of any Company Entity, or any change of control transaction,
consolidation, merger, business combination, conversion, consolidation,
liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction  involving any Company

agreement between any Company Entity and any such Person.

 


 

 

Section 5.5 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, whether or not the Transactions are consummated, each Party will
pay its own costs and expenses incurred in anticipation  of, relating to and
in connection with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement, the

the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that, at the Closing, the Estimated
Closing Transaction Costs shall be paid in accordance with _Article II_.

shall, and shall cause its respective Affiliates to, comply substantially with
any additional requests for information, including requests for production of
documents and production of witnesses for  interviews, investigational
hearings or depositions, made by the applicable Antitrust Authorities and take
all other reasonable actions to obtain all applicable consents, approvals,
clearances or waivers from the applicable Antitrust Authorities  required
under the HSR Act at the earliest practicable dates. For purposes of this
Agreement, "reasonable best efforts" shall not include nor require either

tangible or intangible) of any Company Entity or (B) agree to any Order or
regulatory condition of any Governmental  Entity, whether in an approval

 


 

 

 

42  


 

 

proceeding or another regulatory proceeding, in respect of the foregoing (any
of the foregoing effects, (a "Burdensome Condition")); _provided_ , _further_
, however, if  any action taken by Buyer that is not a Burdensome Condition
is not sufficient to satisfy the condition to Closing set forth in _Section
6.3(a)_, Buyer and its Affiliates  shall have an obligation (x) to litigate
in order to avoid the entry of any preliminary injunction related to the HSR
Act that would prevent the consummation of the Transactions, (y) in the event
that Buyer were successful at preventing the  granting of any such
preliminary injunction, defend against any appeal by the applicable Antitrust
Authority in respect thereof and (z) to oppose any injunction or initiate a
Legal Proceeding to lift any injunction (if applicable) related to a  private
cause of action that would prevent the consummation of the Transactions.

 


 

 

(b) During the Interim Period, except with the consent  of the Company,
Merger Sub and its Affiliates shall not take any action, including entering
into any transaction, that would reasonably be expected to prevent, materially
delay or make it materially more difficult to (i) file or obtain any  Filings
or Permits required under the HSR Act with or from any Antitrust Authority to
consummate the Transactions or (ii) secure satisfaction at the mutual
conditions set forth in _Section 6.3_,  or agree, in writing or otherwise, to
do any of the foregoing.

 


 

 

(c) Without limiting the generality of _Section 5.9(b)_, each Party agrees to,
and shall cause its respective Affiliates and Representatives to, cooperate
with the other Parties and use its reasonable best efforts  to facilitate and
expedite the identification and resolution of any issues arising under the HSR
Act as soon as reasonably practicable. Said reasonable best efforts and
cooperation shall include such Party's undertaking (to the extent permitted 
by applicable Law and in each case regarding the Transactions and without
waiving attorney-client or any other applicable privilege) to cause its
counsel to (i) furnish to each other Party's counsel such reasonably necessary
information and  reasonable assistance as the other Party may request in
connection with its preparation of any Filing or submission that is necessary
under the HSR Act (except for sharing any Item 4(c) or Item 4(d) documents)
and (ii) cooperate in the filing of  any substantive memoranda, white papers,
Filings, correspondence or other written or oral communications explaining or
defending this Agreement or any of the Transactions, articulating any
regulatory or competitive argument or responding to  requests or objections
made by any Antitrust Authority or any Person under the HSR Act. No Party or
any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives shall participate in any
material meeting or discussion (or any other communication by any  means)
with any Antitrust Authority in respect of any such Filings, applications,
investigations or other inquiry under the HSR Act without giving, to the
extent practicable, in the case of Buyer and its Affiliates, the Company, and
in the case  of the Company and its Affiliates, Buyer, prior notice of the
meeting or discussion, the opportunity to confer with each other regarding
appropriate contacts with and responses to personnel of said Antitrust
Authority, the opportunity to review  and comment on the contents of any
representations (oral or otherwise) expected to be communicated at the meeting
or discussion, and, to the extent permitted by the relevant Antitrust
Authority, the opportunity to attend and participate at the  meeting or
discussion (which, at the request of Buyer or the Company, as applicable,
shall be limited to outside antitrust counsel only). Buyer shall (x) control
the strategy for obtaining any consents, approvals, clearances and waivers
from any  Antitrust Authority in connection with the Transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (y) control the overall development of the
positions to be taken and the regulatory actions to be requested in any filing
or submission with any Antitrust  Authority in connection with the
Transactions and in connection with any

 


 

 

 

43  


 

 

investigation or other inquiry or litigation by or before, or any negotiations
with, an Antitrust Authority relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement  and of all other regulatory matters incidental thereto; _provided_
that Buyer shall consult and cooperate with the Company with respect to such
strategy, positions and  requested regulatory action and consider the
Company's views in good faith. In furtherance of the foregoing, neither the
Company nor Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company Entities to, (A) commit to
or agree with any Antitrust Authority to stay,  toll or extend any applicable
waiting period under the HSR Act or enter into a timing agreement with any
Antitrust Authority or (B) pull and refile any filing made under the HSR Act
prior to the Outside Date, in the case of each of clauses (A) or  (B) without
the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

timely making and filing all Filings, Tax Returns, reports and forms as may be
required to comply with the provisions of applicable Tax Laws relating to
Transfer  Taxes. The Company Stockholders shall be third-party beneficiaries
to this _Section 5.7_ and shall be entitled to the rights and benefits

Section 5.9 _Further Actions_.

 


 

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this  Agreement, the Parties shall
cooperate with the other Parties and shall use (and cause their respective
Affiliates to use) their reasonable best efforts (except where a different
efforts standard is specifically contemplated by this Agreement, in  which
case such different standard shall apply) (i) to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to promptly comply with all requirements that may be imposed on such
Party or  its Affiliates under applicable Law with respect to this Agreement

accordance with the terms of this  Agreement and (ii) not to take any action,
or fail to take any action, that could reasonably be expected to prevent,
materially delay or make it materially more difficult to consummate the
Transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing  contained in this
_Section 5.9_ shall require, and in no event shall the reasonable best efforts
of Buyer, the Company Stockholders or the Company (or any other efforts 
standard contained in this Agreement) be deemed or construed to require Buyer
(except to the extent set forth in _Section 5.5_), the Company Stockholders or
any

 


 

 

 

44  


 

 

Company Entity to make, or to cause to be made, any payment to any third party
in order to obtain the Consent of such third party.

 


 

 

(b) Each Party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates  to, promptly inform the
other Party of any material communication (i) received by such Party from, or
given by such Party to, any Governmental Entity from which any Permit is
required or (ii) received or given in connection with any Legal  Proceeding

Transactions, and will permit the other Party to review any communication
given by it to, and consult with each other in advance of any response to, or
meeting or  conference with, any such Governmental Entity or, in connection
with any Legal Proceeding by a private party, with such other Person, and to
the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity or other Person, give the
other Party the opportunity to  attend and participate in such meetings and
conferences.

 


 

 

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions of this  Agreement, at any time and
from time to time after the Closing, at a Party's request and without further
consideration, the other Parties shall execute and deliver to such requesting
Party such other instruments of sale, transfer, conveyance,  assignment and
confirmation, provide such materials and information and take such other
actions as may be necessary in order to consummate the Transactions. The
Company Stockholders shall be third-party beneficiaries to this _Section
5.9(c)_ and shall be entitled to the rights and benefits provided in the same
and may enforce the same as if party hereto.

 


 

 

(d) To the extent (i) (A) the Closing Indebtedness  exceeds the Estimated
Closing Indebtedness; and (B) the Closing Transaction Costs exceed the
Estimated Closing Transaction Costs and (ii) any such excess amount has been
taken into account in the calculation of the Adjustment Amount pursuant to
_Section 2.8(f)_, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company Entities to,
promptly pay any such excess amounts that remain outstanding to the applicable
third-party recipients  thereof.

 


 

 

Section 5.10 _Release_. Effective upon and as of the Closing, Buyer, on its
own behalf, and on behalf of each of its Affiliates, generally, irrevocably,
unconditionally and completely releases, acquits and  forever discharges each
Company Stockholder that is party to the Separation Agreement from all past,
present and future Losses of every kind, nature, description or character,
whether known or unknown, liquidated or unliquidated, that such Person  has,
owns or holds, or claims to have, own or hold, or may have, own or hold, in
each case, arising from the beginning of time through the Closing Date
relating to any matter involving the Company Entities or their respective
businesses arising  on or prior to the Closing, including for controlling
equityholder or lender Liability and breach of any fiduciary duty relating to
any pre-Closing actions or failures to act by any Stockholder Party;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section 5.10_  shall
constitute a release or waiver of any rights provided for under this Agreement
or the Separation Agreement.

 


 

 

Section 5.11 _Employee Matters_.

 


 

 

(a) Subject to the terms of any Collective Bargaining  Agreement, for the
12-month period following the Closing Date (the "Continuation Period"), Buyer
shall provide, or shall cause the Company Entities to  continue providing, to
each individual who is an Employee immediately prior to, and immediately
following, the Closing (each, a "Continuing Employee"): (i)  a base salary or
hourly wage rate, as applicable, that is at least equal to the base salary or
hourly

 


 

 

 

45  


 

 

wage rate provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Closing; (ii) bonus and other incentive compensation opportunities (excluding
equity and equity  based rights) that are no less favorable than those
provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing; and
(iii) employee benefits that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate,
to those provided to such Continuing  Employee immediately prior to the
Closing (excluding any equity and equity based rights, defined benefit pension
and retiree welfare benefits and any severance, retention, transaction or
change in control payments and benefits). Notwithstanding  anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, Buyer shall cause each Company Entity to
pay, in the manner and at the time paid in accordance with past practice or as
otherwise provided for in the applicable Employee Plan, all bonuses  payable
under an Employee Plan sponsored or maintained by a Company Entity to Business
Associates for services performed on or prior to the Closing Date to the
extent included in the calculation of the Closing Transaction Costs or, in the
case of  ordinary course bonuses, are otherwise reflected in the calculation
of the Closing Amount or the Adjustment Amount in accordance with Section 2.8.

 


 

 

(b) For all purposes, including vesting, eligibility to  participate and
level of benefits (other than benefits under defined benefit pension plans)
under the Benefit Plans of Buyer or its Affiliates (as applicable) providing
benefits to Continuing Employees after the Closing (the "New Plans"), each
Continuing Employee in such plans shall be credited with his or her years of
service with the Company Entities and their respective  predecessors prior to
the Closing, to the same extent as such Continuing Employee was entitled,
before the Closing, to credit for such service under any similar Employee Plan
in which such Continuing Employee participated or was eligible to 
participate immediately prior to the Closing (such plans, collectively, the
"Old Plans"); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the foregoing shall not apply to
the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits with
respect to the same period of service or in  the case of any newly
established New Plan that does not, as of the date of this Agreement, provide
credit for past service to any employee of Buyer and its Affiliates. In
addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer  shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause (i) each Continuing Employee to
be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and
all New Plans to the extent coverage under any such New Plan replaces coverage
under  any Old Plan and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical,
dental, pharmaceutical, vision, disability, life insurance and/or other
welfare benefits to any Continuing Employee (collectively, the "New Welfare
Plans"), (A) all pre-existing conditions, exclusions or limitations,
eligibility waiting periods and actively-at-work requirements of such New
Welfare Plans to be waived for  such Continuing Employee and his or her
covered dependents (to the extent such conditions, exclusions, limitations,
periods and requirements were waived or satisfied as of immediately prior to
the Closing under comparable Old Plans), and (B) any  eligible expenses
incurred by each Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during
the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such
Continuing Employee's participation in the corresponding New Welfare Plan
begins  to be taken into account under such New Welfare Plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, co-payment, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents for the  applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Welfare Plan. The participation cost to a Continuing
Employee under the New Welfare Plans shall be not more than the participation
cost to similarly situated  employees of Buyer and its Affiliates.

 


 

 

 

46  


 

 

(c) Without limiting the foregoing, with respect to  each applicable
Continuing Employee whose employment is terminated by Buyer and its
Affiliates, including any Company Entity, during the Continuation Period,
Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer shall provide severance benefits that are no
less  favorable to those to which such Continuing Employee would have been
entitled under the applicable Employee Plan providing severance benefits as in
effect as of the Closing; _provided_ ,  that with respect to Continuing
Employees who, as of the date of this Agreement, participate in the Smart and
Final Stores, Inc. 2018 Executive Severance Plan (the "Smart and Final Severance
Plan") and who are set forth on _Section 5.11(c)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedules, Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer shall  provide severance benefits
no less favorable to the severance benefits such Continuing Employee would
have received under the Smart and Final Severance Plan.

 


 

 

(d) With respect to any accrued but unused personal,  sick or vacation time
to which any Continuing Employee is entitled pursuant to the personal, sick or
vacation time policies applicable to such Continuing Employee immediately
prior to the Effective Time, to the extent included in the calculation  of
Final Closing Working Capital, Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company
Entities to, assume the Liability for such accrued personal, sick or vacation
time and allow such Continuing Employee to use such accrued personal, sick or
vacation time in  accordance with the practice and policies of the applicable
Company Entity and subject to applicable Laws.

 


 

 

(e) To the extent required by COBRA, a group health  plan of Buyer or an
Affiliate of Buyer will be responsible for providing COBRA continuation
coverage with respect to any and all "M and A qualified beneficiaries," as
defined in Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980B-9, with respect to the 
Transactions.

 


 

 

(f) On or before the Closing Date, the Company shall  provide a list of the
number and site of employment of any and all employees of each Company Entity
who have experienced, or will experience, an "employment loss" (as defined by
the WARN Act) within 90 days prior to the Closing Date (the "WARN List"). The
Company shall update the WARN List up to and including the Closing Date.
Subject to the accuracy in all material respects of the WARN List,  Buyer
shall be solely responsible for any Liabilities under the WARN Act or any
other Law relating to reductions in work force or the impact on employees of
plant closings or sales of business for any actions taken by Buyer or any of
its  Affiliates (including any Company Entity) on or after the Closing,
provided such Liabilities relate to a Business Associate who is found to have
suffered an "employment loss" under the WARN Act on or after the Closing or to
an individual listed  on the WARN List.

 


 

 

(g) The Company Entities shall use commercially  reasonable efforts, or shall
direct their applicable Affiliate to use commercially reasonable efforts, to
submit for a vote in a manner that satisfies Section 280G(b)(5) of the Code
and Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1, to the extent  applicable, the
right of each "disqualified individual" (as defined in Treasury Regulation
Section 1.280G-1) to receive or retain that portion of any payments or
benefits that, together with any other payments or benefits that may be
considered  "parachute payments" (as defined under Section 280G(b)(2) of the
Code), equals or exceeds 300% of such individual's "base amount" (as defined
in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code). No later than three (3) Business Days
prior to the Closing, the  Company shall deliver to Buyer documents
evidencing the results of such vote. Any documentation to be distributed in
connection with such vote, including any information

 


 

 

 

47  


 

 

statements or waivers, shall be provided to Buyer at least five (5) Business
Days prior to their distribution for Buyer's review and reasonable opportunity
to comment,  and the Company Entities shall in good faith consider any such
comments.

 


 

 

(h) The Company Entities and their Affiliates shall  consult with Buyer and
obtain Buyer's consent, which such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
prior to distributing any communications, whether or not in writing, to any
individual or entity, including any Company Associate or  Governmental
Entity, relating to the Pension Plan and benefits thereunder, other than any
communications that (i) relate to the routine payment of benefits or
administration of the Pension Plan and that are consistent in all material
respects  with any prior such communications or (ii) are required by Law and
where consulting with Buyer or obtaining Buyer's consent would result in a
violation of Law or the incurrence of any Liability, provided that, any such
communication pursuant to  this clause (ii) shall be provided to Buyer as
soon as practicable.

 


 

 

(i) Other than as set forth on _Section 5.11(i)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedules, effective as of the Closing Date, each Employee or other service
provider of the Company Entities shall cease being an active participant  in
any Employee Plan that is sponsored or maintained by the Red Store Entities
and the Red Store Entities shall have no further obligations to provide
compensation or benefits under such Employee Plans to Employees or other
service providers of  the Company Entities, and each employee or other
service provider of the Red Store Entities shall cease being an active
participant in any Employee Plan that is sponsored or maintained by the
Company Entities and the Company Entities shall have  no further obligations
to provide compensation or benefits under such Employee Plans to employees or
other service providers of the Red Store Entities.

 


 

 

(j) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.11_ or elsewhere in this Agreement,
express or implied, shall (i) confer upon any Company Associate or any
Employee, director, manager, officer or consultant of any Company Entity  any
right to continued employment or service (or resumed employment or service)
subsequent to the Closing, (ii) be treated as an amendment to, or be construed
as amending, any Employee Plan, New Plan or other benefit plan, program,
agreement or  arrangement, (iii) prevent Buyer and its Affiliates from
terminating or modifying any Employee Plan, New Plan or other benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement in accordance with its terms or (iv) confer
any rights or remedies (including  third-party beneficiary rights) on any
entity or individual other than the Parties to this Agreement.

 


 

 

Section 5.12 _D andO Indemnification and Insurance_.

 


 

 

(a) Buyer agrees that all rights to exculpation,  indemnification,
advancement of expenses and insurance coverage for liability for actions or
omissions occurring on or prior to the Closing Date now existing in favor of
each current and former director, manager, officer or employee of the 
Company Entities and each Person who served as a director, manager, officer,
member, trustee or other fiduciary of a pension, benefit or other Employee
Plan or another enterprise or Person if such service was at the request or for
the benefit of  a Company Entity (each, together with such Person's heirs,
executors or administrators, a "DandO Indemnified Party"), as provided in their
respective  Organizational Documents or in any Contract with any Company
Entity, in each case, as in effect as of the date of this Agreement and
accurate and complete and

 


 

 

 

48  


 

 

correct copies of which have been made available to Buyer prior to the date
hereof, shall survive the Closing and shall continue in full force and effect
in accordance  with the current terms of such Organizational Document or
Contract from the Closing Date until the expiration of the applicable statute
of limitations with respect to any claims arising out of such acts or
omissions. For a period of six years from  the Closing Date, Buyer shall
cause each Company Entity to maintain in effect the exculpation,
indemnification, advancement of expenses and insurance coverage provisions of
such Company Entity's Organizational Documents as in effect immediately 
prior to the date hereof or in any indemnification agreements of any Company
Entity with any DandO Indemnified Party as in effect immediately prior to the
date hereof and accurate and complete and correct copies of which have been
made available  to Buyer prior to the date hereof, and Buyer shall not, and
shall cause the Company Entities not to, amend, repeal or otherwise modify any
such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any DandO Indemnified  Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that all
rights to exculpation, indemnification, advancement of  expenses or insurance
coverage in respect of any Legal Proceedings pending or asserted or any claim
made within such period shall continue until the disposition of such Legal
Proceeding or resolution of such claim. From and after the Closing,  Buyer
shall cause the Company Entities to honor, in accordance with their respective
terms, each of the covenants contained in this _Section 5.12_. Notwithstanding
any  provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the Parties hereby
acknowledge that one or more of the DandO Indemnified Parties may have certain
rights to exculpation, indemnification, advancement of expenses and/or
insurance coverage provided by  any Affiliate of a Company Stockholder or
such DandO Indemnified Party or another Person of which such DandO Indemnified
Party is a manager, director, officer, stockholder, member, partner or
employee (an "Additional DandO Provider"). The Parties hereby agree that, with
respect to any advancement or indemnification obligation owed, at any time, to
a DandO Indemnified Party by the  Company Entities, the Company Entities (i)
are, relative to each Additional DandO Provider, the indemnitors of first resort
(i.e., the Company Entities' obligations to the applicable DandO Indemnified
Party under this Agreement and the  applicable Company Entity's
Organizational Documents and other applicable agreements are primary, and any
duplicative, overlapping or corresponding obligations of an Additional DandO
Provider are secondary), (ii) shall be required to make all  advances and
other payments under this Agreement and the applicable Company Entity's
Organizational Documents or Contracts, and shall be fully liable therefor,
without regard to any rights any DandO Indemnified Party may have against any 
Additional DandO Provider and (iii) irrevocably waive, relinquish and release
any such Additional DandO Provider from any and all claims against such
Additional DandO Provider for contribution, subrogation or any other recovery of
any kind in  respect thereof.

 


 

 

(b) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall cause each  of the Company
Entities to, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, indemnify
and hold harmless (and advance funds in respect of each of the foregoing,
following receipt of any undertakings required by applicable Law) each DandO 
Indemnified Party against any Loss resulting from, arising out of or otherwise
relating to any actual or threatened Legal Proceeding, resulting from, arising
out of, or otherwise relating to any action or omission occurring on or prior
to the  Closing in such DandO Indemnified Party's capacity as a director,
manager, officer or employee of a Company Entity or in such DandO Indemnified
Party's capacity as a director, manager, officer, member, trustee or other
fiduciary of a pension  or other Benefit Plan or another enterprise or Person
at the request or for the benefit of a Company Entity. In the event of any
such Legal Proceeding, Buyer shall, and shall

 


 

 

 

49  


 

 

cause the Company Entities to, reasonably cooperate with the DandO Indemnified
Party in the defense of any Legal Proceeding.

 


 

 

(c) The rights of each DandO Indemnified Party under  this Agreement shall be
in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such Person may
have under the Organizational Documents of any Company Entity, any other
Contract to which any Company Entity is a party, any applicable Law or 
otherwise. The provisions of this _Section 5.12_ shall survive the Closing and
expressly are intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, each of the DandO
Indemnified  Parties, each of whom is an intended third-party beneficiary of
this _Section 5.12_.

successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or surviving Person in such consolidation or merger

any Person, then, and in either such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of Buyer or such Company Entity, as the case
may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.12_,
including, for the avoidance of doubt, any applicable obligations set forth in

Section 5.13 _R andW Policy_. If Buyer obtains a RandW Policy, Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the RandW Policy shall include
that the RandW Insurer waives its rights  to bring any claim by way of
subrogation, claim for contribution or otherwise against the Stockholders'
Representative, any Company Stockholder or any of their respective Related
Parties, subject to any customary exceptions for fraud.   Notwithstanding the
foregoing, for the avoidance of doubt, the Parties acknowledge and agree that
the obtaining of the RandW Policy is not a condition to the Closing, and Buyer

waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ , to consummate the
Transactions.

 


 

 

Section 5.14 _Release of Guarantees_. The Parties agree to cooperate and use

guarantees, performance bonds, bid bonds and other similar agreements set
forth on _Section 5.14_,  of the Company Disclosure Schedules (collectively,
the "Stockholder Guarantees"), on or prior to the Closing, in each case solely
to the extent related to  the business of the Company Entities; _provided,_
that in no event shall the reasonable best efforts of the Parties in
connection with this _Section 5.14_ be deemed or construed to require any
Party to pay or commit to pay any fee, or grant any accommodation to, any
Person from whom any such release may be required. In the event any of  the
Stockholder Guarantees are not released prior to or at the Closing, Buyer will
indemnify and hold the applicable Company Stockholder and its Affiliates that
are a party to or otherwise have Liability with respect to each such
Stockholder  Guarantee harmless for any and all payments required to be made
under, and the costs and expenses incurred in connection with, such
Stockholder Guarantee by the applicable Company Stockholder and its Affiliates
that are a party to, or otherwise  have Liability with respect to, such
Stockholder Guarantee until such Stockholder Guarantee is released.

Section 5.15 _Affiliate Contracts_. At or prior to the Closing, the Company

case without further liability or obligation (contingent or otherwise) of any
party thereunder. The Company will provide Buyer with a  reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on any documents, agreements, instruments,

in  form and substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer.

threatened in writing against any Company Entity  or any of their respective
directors or officers, the Company will as soon as practicable notify in
writing Buyer of such Legal Proceeding or threatened Legal Proceeding and
shall keep Buyer informed on a reasonably current basis with respect to  the
status thereof. Prior to the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination
of this Agreement, the Company shall control the defense of any such Legal
Proceedings other than any Legal Proceeding involving any Antitrust Authority
or  otherwise related to the HSR Act, which shall be exclusively governed by
the provisions of _Section 5.6_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, -subject to
applicable Law and  where reasonabl-y practicable, the Company shall give
Buyer and its counsel the right to review and comment on all material filings
or responses to be made by the Company in connection with any such Legal
Proceedings and give reasonable and good  faith consideration to any such
comments made by Buyer and its counsel. The Company shall also give Buyer and
its counsel the right to consult on the settlement, release, waiver or
compromise of any such Legal Proceedings, and the Company shall  in good
faith take Buyer's views into account. No such settlement shall be agreed to
without the prior written consent of Buyer (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

 


 

 

Section 5.19 _Resignation of Directors and Officers_. At or prior to the
Closing, the Company shall deliver to Buyer evidence of the resignation,
effective as of the Effective Time, of all directors and  officers of the

agreements.

 


 

 

Section 5.20 _Notice of Merger_. As promptly as practicable following the date
of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare and deliver all required notices
and information to the Company Stockholders  under the DGCL and the Company's

Consenting Stockholder) in accordance with Section 228(e) of the DGCL (to the
extent required thereby) and the Company's Organizational Documents. To the
extent  required by applicable Law, the Stockholder Notice shall include
therewith a copy of Section 262 and shall be sufficient in form and substance
to start the 20-day period during which a Company Stockholder must demand
appraisal of such Company  Common Shares as contemplated by Section 262(d)(2)
of the DGCL. All materials mailed to the Company Stockholders in accordance
with this _Section 5.20_ will be subject to  Buyer's advance review and

drafts thereof. When such Separation Documents are available, the Company 
shall promptly address in good faith all comments and suggestions made by
Buyer with respect to drafts of such Separation Documents and shall not
execute such Separation Documents or otherwise consummate any of the
transactions contemplated  therein if Buyer reasonably asserts that such
Separation Documents do not properly provide for the Separation in the manner
set forth in this Agreement or the Separation Agreement or otherwise violate
the terms of this Agreement or the Separation  Agreement. The Company
Entities shall not grant any consent under, or waive any terms of, the
Separation Agreement without the written consent of Buyer (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 


 

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained  herein, the covenants
contained in _Section 5.21(b)_ shall not apply to any actions or other
matters, and the Separation Documents shall not be deemed to include any 
Contracts, in each case relating to or involving solely any Red Store Assets
(as defined in the Separation Agreement), Red Store Liabilities (as defined in

reasonably be expected to be adverse to the Buyer, the Company Entities or the
Business (other than such impacts that are reasonably expected to be only de
minimis in nature).

 


 

 

Section 5.22 _Excluded Marks._

 


 

 

(a) Subject to _Section 5.22(c)_ hereof and the Services Agreement, neither

derivative of any of the foregoing, and any names or trademarks confusingly
similar

 


 

 

 

52  


 

 

to any of the foregoing (collectively, the "Excluded Marks"). Buyer hereby 
acknowledges and agrees that neither it nor any of its Affiliates (including,
as of the Closing, the Company Entities) shall acquire any goodwill, rights or
benefits arising from the Excluded Marks and that all such goodwill, rights
and benefits  shall inure solely to the Red Store Entities and their
respective Affiliates, as applicable (it being understood that, to the extent
Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including, as of the Closing, the Company
Entities) acquires any right, title and  interest in and to any Excluded
Marks, Buyer or such Affiliate hereby irrevocably and perpetually assigns to
the Red Store Entities and their respective Affiliates, as applicable, all

will not include any Excluded Marks;  _provided_ , that the Company Entities
may make minimal use of the Excluded Marks solely in connection with a
reference to the Company Entities' history that is factually  accurate. From

Excluded Marks. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer and the Company Entities 
acknowledge and agree that the Red Entities and their respective Affiliates
may make minimal use of any trademarks included in the Company IP solely in
connection with a reference to the Company Entities' history that is factually
accurate.

Topco, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (other than the Company
Entities), hereby grants to Buyer and the Company Entities, for a period of
180 days immediately after the Closing, a limited, non-exclusive,  non-
sublicenseable, royalty-free license to use the Excluded Marks but solely to
the extent used by the Company Entities as of the Closing Date and solely to
facilitate the transition by Buyer and the Company Entities to new names and
marks. All  goodwill associated with the Excluded Marks generated by Buyer's
and the Company Entities' use of the Excluded Marks pursuant to the foregoing
license in this _Section 5.22(c)_  shall inure to the benefit of the Red
Store Entities and their respective Affiliates (other than the Company
Entities). To the extent any right, title or interest in or to any Excluded
Mark vests in Buyer or the Company Entities by operation of  law or
otherwise, Buyer or the Company Entities, as applicable, hereby irrevocably
and perpetually assign to the applicable Red Store Entity any and all such
right, title and interest throughout the world in and to such Excluded Mark.

their Representatives to use their respective reasonable best efforts to
provide, such cooperation and assistance as may be reasonably requested by

cooperation shall not unreasonably disrupt or interfere with the business or
the operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries, (ii)  nothing in this

required to adopt resolutions approving the  agreements, documents and
instruments for the Debt Financing.

Business Days  of the date on which this Agreement is terminated by Buyer.
Buyer acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section 7.2(b)_ are
an integral part of the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
that, without these agreements, the Company would not enter into this
Agreement. Accordingly, if Buyer fails promptly to pay any amount due pursuant
to this _Section 7.2(b)_, Buyer shall also pay any costs, fees and expenses
incurred by the Company or its Affiliates (including reasonable legal fees and
expenses) in connection with a legal action to  enforce this Agreement that
results in a judgment for such amount against Buyer. Any amount not paid when
due pursuant to this _Section 7.2(b)_ shall also bear interest  from the date
such amount is due until the date paid at a rate per annum equal to 5% per
annum compounded quarterly. Such interest shall be payable at the same time as
the payment to which it relates and shall be calculated daily on the basis
of  a year of 365 days and the actual number of days elapsed.

 


 

 

(c) The Parties agree and understand that in no event  shall Buyer be
required to pay the Reverse Termination Fee on more than one occasion.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except in the case
of any Fraud or intentional breach under this Agreement by Buyer or Merger
Sub,  if the Company receives the Reverse Termination Fee from Buyer pursuant
to _Section 7.2(b)_, such payment, together with any interest, costs, fees or
expenses payable  pursuant to _Section 7.2(b)_, shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Company, its Affiliates and its Representative and
their respective former, current, or future  general or limited partners,
stockholders, directors, officers, managers, members, Affiliates, agents and
other

 


 

 

 

58  


 

 

Representatives against Buyer, its Affiliates and any Financing Source, and
any of their respective former, current, or future general or limited
partners,  stockholders, directors, officers, managers, members, Affiliates,
agents or other Representatives for any loss suffered as a result of the
failure of the Transactions to be consummated or any breach of any covenant or
agreement in this Agreement or  otherwise and none of the Buyer, any of its
Affiliates or any Financing Source shall have any further liability or
obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions.

 


 

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained  herein, the rights of
the Company under this _Section 7.2_ are independent of and in addition to
such rights and remedies the Company may have under _Section 9.7_. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Company may simultaneously pursue (i) a grant of
specific performance pursuant to _Section 9.7_, (ii) subject to Section
7.2(c), its rights and remedies at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise and (iii) payment of the Reverse Termination Fee pursuant this
_Section 7.2_; _provided_ , that under no circumstances shall the Company be
permitted or entitled to receive (A) both  such grant of specific performance
that causes the Closing to occur and payment of a Reverse Termination Fee or
(B) more than one Reverse Termination Fee.

 


 

 

(e) Each of the Company and Buyer acknowledges that (i)  the agreements
contained in this _Section 7.2_ are an integral part of the Transactions, (ii)
the damages resulting from termination of this Agreement under circumstances 
where the Reverse Termination Fee is payable are uncertain and incapable of
accurate calculation and therefore, the amount payable pursuant to this
_Section 7.2_ is not a  penalty but rather constitutes liquidated damages in
a reasonable amount that will compensate the Company for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement
and in reliance on this Agreement and on  the expectation of the consummation
of the Transactions and (iii) without the agreements contained in this
_Section 7.2_, the Parties would not have entered into this  Agreement.

extent permitted under Law, any and all rights, claims and causes of action
(including any statutory rights to contribution or indemnification) for any
breach of any representation or warranty set forth  in this Agreement or any
covenant or obligation in this Agreement that is to have been performed by any
Party on or prior to the Closing or otherwise relating to any Company Entity
or the subject matter of this Agreement that such Party may have  against the
other Parties or any of their Affiliates or any of their respective Related
Parties arising under or based upon any theory whatsoever, under any Law, in
equity, contract, tort or otherwise, in each case, occurring or arising on or
prior  to the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing release
shall not apply to claims of,  and nothing contained in this Agreement shall
operate to limit the common law Liability of a Party to any other Party in the
event such Party is finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to
have committed knowing and intentional fraud  with intent to mislead against
such other Party in connection with this Agreement or the consummation of the
Transactions ("Fraud"); _provided_ , _further_ , that the cumulative Liability
of each Company Stockholder under this Agreement, including pursuant to the
foregoing proviso, shall in no event exceed the Merger Consideration
proceeds  actually received by such Company Stockholder.

 


 

 

(b) Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that, except  as expressly provided
in _Section 8.2(a)_ and _Section 8.2(b)_ of this Agreement, Article III  of
the Separation Agreement and the Stockholder Guarantees, none of the Company
Stockholders, the Company Entities or any of their respective Related Parties,
shall have any Liability or obligation arising under this Agreement or in
any  certificate or other document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or as
a result of the consummation of the Transactions, such _Section 8.2(a)_ and
_Section 8.2(b)_, Article III of the Separation Agreement being the sole and
exclusive remedy for all Losses arising under this Agreement or in any
certificate or other  document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or as a
result of the consummation of the Transactions, whether purporting to sound in
under any Law, in equity, contract, tort or otherwise.

illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or future Law or by any
court of competent jurisdiction, (a) such provision  will be fully severable,

Section 9.3 _Limited Recourse_. Each Party covenants and agrees that such
Party shall not institute, and shall cause its Affiliates not to institute,
any Legal Proceeding arising under or in connection  with this Agreement or
the consummation of the Transactions against any Related Party of any Party
(other than Buyer). Any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of,
or related to this Agreement or the consummation of the Transaction  may only
be brought against Persons that are expressly named as Parties, and then only
with respect to the specific obligations set forth in this Agreement. No
Related Party of any Party (other than Buyer) and no Related Party of a
Related Party  shall have any Liability or obligation for any of the
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements, obligations or Liabilities
of any Party under this Agreement or of or for any Legal Proceeding based on,
in respect of, or by reason of, the  consummation of the Transactions
(including the breach, termination or failure to consummate the Transactions),
in each case whether based on Contract, tort, strict Liability, other Laws or
otherwise and whether by piercing the corporate veil, by  a claim by or on
behalf of a Party or another Person or otherwise; _provided_ , _however_ , 
that nothing in this _Section 9.3_ shall be construed to affect the rights of
the rights of any party to the Separation Agreement (including Buyer as a
third-party  beneficiary thereunder) with respect to any other such party, in
each case, to the extent provided in, and subject to the terms and conditions
of, the Separation Agreement.

 


 

 

Section 9.4 _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries_.

 


 

 

(a) This Agreement, the Appendices, Schedules, Exhibits  and the other
documents, instruments and agreements specifically referred to in this
Agreement or therein or delivered pursuant to this Agreement or thereto set
forth the entire understanding of the Parties with respect to the
Transactions. Any  and all previous agreements and understandings between or
among the Parties regarding the subject matter of this Agreement, whether
written or oral, are superseded by this Agreement, except for the
Confidentiality Agreement. For the avoidance of  doubt, if this Agreement is
executed on the same date as the Separation Date (as defined in the Separation
Agreement), this Agreement shall be deemed executed and effective as of
immediately following the consummation of the transactions  contemplated by
Section 2.4 of the Separation Agreement.

 


 

 

(b) The terms and provisions of this Agreement are  intended solely for the
benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
This Agreement will not confer, and it is not the intention of the Parties for
this Agreement to confer, any rights or remedies upon any Person  other than
the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns, other than:
(i) _Section 9.3_ and, if the Effective Time occurs, _Section 5.9(c)_,
_Section 5.10 _and _Section 5.12_,  which will be for the benefit of the
Persons set forth therein, and any such Person

 


 

 

 

62  


 

 

will have the rights provided for therein, (ii) if the Effective Time occurs,
the right of the Company Stockholders to receive the amounts required to be
paid to the  Company Stockholders hereunder and (iii) this _Article IX_ in
respect of the Sections set forth under the immediately preceding clauses
(i)-(ii); provided that the Financing Sources shall be express third party
beneficiaries of and have the right to enforce _Section 7.2(c)_ , _Section
9.4_ , _Section 9.5_ , _Section      9.6_ and _Section 9.11(b)_.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company and the
Stockholders' Representative hereby waive any rights or claims against the
Financing Sources in connection with this Agreement, the  Transactions or the
Debt Financing, whether at law or equity, in contract, tort, statute or
otherwise.

 


 

 

Section 9.5 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, the Appendices, Exhibits and
Schedules to this Agreement, the Transactions and the other transactions
contemplated thereby (whether sounding at law or in  equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise) shall be governed by and interpreted and enforced in
accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to
any choice of Law or conflict of Laws rules or provisions (whether of the 
State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware; provided 
that any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of
any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or
in tort or otherwise, against the Financing Sources in any way relating to
this Agreement or  any of the Transactions, or any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Debt Financing, shall be governed by, and construed
in accordance with, the law of the State of New York (except that in all
events (x) the interpretation of the  definition of "Material Adverse Effect"
(and whether or not a "Material Adverse Effect" has occurred), (y) the
determination of the accuracy of any representation made by the Company
hereunder and whether, as a result of any inaccuracy thereof,  the Buyer has
the right to terminate its obligations (or decline to consummate the Closing
and other Transactions) hereunder and (z) the determination of whether the
Transactions have been consummated in accordance with the terms of this 
Agreement shall, in each case, be governed by, and construed in accordance
with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice
or conflict of law provision or rule that would cause the application of laws
of any other  jurisdiction).

 


 

 

Section 9.6 _Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_. Except as
provided in _Section 2.8(d)_, each Party irrevocably  submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery located in Wilmington,
Delaware (or, if such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, any
other state or federal court located in Wilmington, Delaware) for the purposes
of any  Legal Proceeding arising out of this Agreement, the Transactions or
the other transactions contemplated by any of the foregoing, and irrevocably
agrees to commence and litigate any such Legal Proceeding only in such courts.
Each Party further  agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or
document in accordance with _Section 9.1_ shall be effective service of
process, summons, notice or documents for  any such Legal Proceeding. Nothing
in this Agreement shall in any way be deemed to limit the ability of either
Party to serve any such process, summons, notice or document in any other
manner permitted by applicable Law. Each Party hereby  (a) irrevocably and
unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of any Legal
Proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the consummation of the
Transactions in such courts, (b) irrevocably and unconditionally waives and
agrees  not to plead or claim in any such court that any such Legal
Proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient
forum, does not have jurisdiction over any Party or that this Agreement, or
the subject matter hereof, may not be  enforced in or by such courts and (c)
irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to be bound by any judgment rendered by
any such court and such judgment may be enforced in any other

 


 

 

 

63  


 

 

court with jurisdiction over the Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each
of the Parties hereto agrees that it will not bring or support any action,
cause of  action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or
description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against the Financing Sources in any way relating to this
Agreement, the Debt Financing or any of  the Transactions, in any forum other
than any State or Federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan in the
City of New York. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ALL
RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING  OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS, THE DEBT FINANCING, THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY ANY OF THE FOREGOING OR THE ACTIONS, INCLUDING COUNTERCLAIMS,
OF THE PARTY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND  ENFORCEMENT
OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THEREOF. THE PARTIES HERETO EACH HEREBY AGREES AND
CONSENTS THAT SUCH WAIVER SHALL EXTEND FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE FINANCING
SOURCES.

 


 

 

Section 9.7 _Right to Specific Performance_.

 


 

 

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which  monetary relief,
even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly 
agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions or
specific performance or other equitable remedy to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, such  remedies being in addition to any other remedy to which such
Party is entitled at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise.

 


 

 

(b) The Parties hereby agree not to raise any  objections to the availability
of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain
breaches of this Agreement by the Parties, as applicable, and to specifically
enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent  breaches or
threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the respective
covenants and obligations of the Parties under this Agreement, all in
accordance with the terms of this _Section 9.7_, on the basis that any other
Party has an adequate remedy at law or that any award of specific performance
is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity.

 


 

 

(c) No Party shall be required to provide any evidence  of irreparable harm
or bond or other security in connection with seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to specifically enforce
the terms and provisions of this Agreement.

 


 

 

Section 9.8 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights or
obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned by any of the Parties
without the prior written consent of (a) Buyer, in the  case of an assignment
by the Company (prior to the Closing), and (b) the Company, in the case of an
assignment by Buyer or Merger Sub; _provided_ , that (i) Buyer and  Merger
Sub may assign any or all of its rights, interests or obligations under this
Agreement to any Affiliate of Buyer, but no such assignment shall relieve
Buyer or Merger Sub of its obligations hereunder, and (ii) Buyer may pledge
and grant a  security interest in its rights under this agreement to any
lenders as collateral security for Buyer's existing credit facility, the Debt
Financing or any other financing arrangement. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement will be  binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and
be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective successors and

 


 

 

 

64  


 

 

permitted assigns. Any attempted assignment in violation of the terms of this
_Section 9.8_  shall be null and void, ab initio.

 


 

 

Section 9.9 _Headings_. All headings contained in this Agreement are for
convenience of reference only, do not form a part of this Agreement and shall
not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation  of this Agreement.

 


 

 

Section 9.10 _Construction_. For the purposes of this Agreement, except as
otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or unless the context otherwise
requires: (a) the meaning assigned to each term  defined in this Agreement
shall be equally applicable to both the singular and the plural forms of such
term and vice versa, and words denoting either gender shall include both
genders as the context requires; (b) where a word or phrase is  defined in
this Agreement, each of its other grammatical forms shall have a corresponding
meaning; (c) the terms "hereof", "herein", "hereunder", "hereby" and
"herewith" and words of similar import shall, unless otherwise stated, be
construed to  refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
provision of this Agreement; (d) when a reference is made in this Agreement to
an Article, Section, subsection, paragraph, Exhibit, Schedule or other
attachment, such reference is to an  Article, Section, subsection, paragraph,
Exhibit, Schedule or other attachment to this Agreement unless otherwise
specified, and a reference to a subsection without further reference to a
Section is a reference to such subsection as contained in  the same Section
in which the reference appears; (e) unless otherwise specified, the word
"include", "includes" and "including" when used in this Agreement shall be
deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation", and the rule known as
ejusdem generis shall not be applicable to limit a general statement, followed
by or referable to an enumeration of specific matters, to matters similar to 
those specifically mentioned; (f) a reference to any Party to this Agreement
or any other agreement or document shall include such Party's predecessors,
successors and permitted assigns; (g) all accounting terms used and not
defined in this  Agreement have the respective meanings given to them under
GAAP; (h) any event, the scheduled occurrence of which would fall on a day
that is not a Business Day shall be deferred until the next succeeding
Business Day; (i) any statement in this  Agreement to the effect that any
information, document or other material has been "made available" by the
Company shall mean such information, document or material was included in and
available at least one Business Day prior to the date hereof  in the "Project
Trailblazer" online data room hosted by Merrill Corporation; (j) all
references to "dollars" or "$" or "US$" in this Agreement shall refer to
United States dollars, which is the currency used for all purposes in this
Agreement;  (k) the word "or" shall be disjunctive and not exclusive; and (l)
reference to any Law means such Law, as amended, modified, codified, replaced
or reenacted from time to time, and all rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder. The Parties  have participated jointly in the negotiation and
drafting of this Agreement, and any rule of construction or interpretation
otherwise requiring this Agreement to be construed or interpreted against any
Party by virtue of the authorship of this  Agreement shall not apply to the
construction and interpretation of this Agreement. Promptly following the date
hereof, the Company shall deliver to Buyer a flash drive or CD-ROM (in either
case, in PC-readable format) that contains all of the  documents which were
made available to Buyer in the "Project Trailblazer" online data room hosted
by Merrill Corporation.

 


 

 

Section 9.11 _Amendments and Waivers_. (a) This Agreement may not be amended,
supplemented or modified except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf
of Buyer, Merger Sub and, prior to the Closing,  the Company, or, following
the Closing, the Stockholders'

 


 

 

 

65  


 

 

Representative. Any term or condition of this Agreement may be waived at any
time in a written instrument duly executed by the Party that is entitled to
the benefit  of such term or condition. No waiver by any Party of any term or
condition of this Agreement, in any one or more instances, shall be deemed to
be or construed as a waiver of the same or any other term or condition of this
Agreement on any prior or  future occasion or affect in any way any rights
arising by virtue of any such prior or future occasion.

 


 

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained  herein, _Sections
7.2(c)_ , _Section 9.4_ , _Section 9.5_ , _Section 9.6_ and _Section 9.11(b)_
(and any provision of this Agreement to the extent an amendment or waiver of
such provision would modify the substance of  the aforementioned provisions)
may not be amended or waived in a manner that is materially adverse to any
Financing Source without the prior written consent of such Financing Source.

 


 

 

Section 9.12 _Attorney-Client Privilege; Conflict Waiver_. Notwithstanding
that Morgan, Lewis and Bockius LLP ("Morgan  Lewis") has acted as legal counsel
to the Company Entities prior to the Closing in connection with this Agreement
and the Transactions (the "Pre-Closing  Engagement"), and recognizing that
Morgan Lewis intends to act as legal counsel to the Company Stockholders and
their respective Affiliates after the Closing, Buyer hereby waives, on its own
behalf, and agrees to cause its Affiliates  (including the Company Entities
after the Closing) to waive, any conflicts that may arise in connection with
Morgan Lewis representing the Company Stockholders or any of their respective
Affiliates after the Closing, as such representation may  conflict with the
Pre-Closing Engagement. In addition, all communications relating to the Pre-
Closing Engagement and involving attorney-client confidences between the
Company Stockholders, their respective Affiliates or the Company Entities
and  Morgan Lewis shall be deemed to be attorney-client confidences that
belong solely to the Company Stockholders and their respective Affiliates (and
not the Company Entities). Accordingly, the Company Entities shall not,
without the Stockholders'  Representative's consent, have access to the files
of Morgan Lewis relating to the Pre-Closing Engagement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, upon and after the Closing, (a) the Company
Stockholders and their respective Affiliates  (and not the Company Entities)
shall be the sole holders of the attorney-client privilege with respect to the
Pre-Closing Engagement, and none of the Company Entities shall be a holder
thereof, (b) to the extent that files of Morgan Lewis in  respect of the Pre-
Closing Engagement constitute property of the client, only the Company
Stockholders and their respective Affiliates (and not the Company Entities)
shall hold such property rights and (c) Morgan Lewis shall have no duty 
whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such attorney-client communications or
files to any of the Company Entities by reason of any attorney-client
relationship between Morgan Lewis and the Company Entities or otherwise.

 


 

 

Section 9.13 _Appendices, Schedules and Exhibits_. Except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement, all Appendices, Exhibits and Schedules referred to
in this Agreement are intended to be and hereby are  made a part of this
Agreement. The Company Disclosure Schedules have been arranged, for purposes
of convenience only, in sections corresponding to the Sections of this
Agreement. The disclosure of any item in any section or subsection of the 
Company Disclosure Schedules will be deemed disclosed with respect to each
other section and subsection of the Company Disclosure Schedules so long as
its relevance to such other section of the Company Disclosure Schedules is
reasonably apparent  on the face of such disclosure. Certain information

 


 

 

 

66  


 

 

set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedules is or may be included solely for
informational purposes, is not an admission of Liability with respect to the
matters  covered by the information, and may not be required to be disclosed
pursuant to this Agreement. The specification of any dollar amount in the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or the inclusion of
any specific item in the  Company Disclosure Schedules is not intended to
imply that such amounts (or higher or lower amounts) or items (a) are or are
not material to the business, assets, Liabilities, financial condition,
results of operation or prospects of the Company  Entities, (b) amount to a
Material Adverse Effect or (c) occurred outside of the ordinary course of
business of the Company. No Party shall use the fact of the setting of such
amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any such item in the Company 
Disclosure Schedules in any dispute or controversy between the Parties as to
whether any obligation, item or matter not described in this Agreement or
included in the Company Disclosure Schedules is or is not material for
purposes of this  Agreement.

 


 

 

Section 9.14 _Stockholders ' Representative_.

 


 

 

(a) Each Company Stockholder, by its approval of, or  consent to, the Merger
and the adoption of this Agreement, its acceptance of any consideration
pursuant to this Agreement or delivery of a Letter of Transmittal, hereby
irrevocably appoints the Stockholders' Representative, as of the date of
this  Agreement, with power of designation and assignment as its true and
lawful attorney-in-fact and agent with full power of substitution, to act
solely and exclusively on behalf of, and in the name of, such Company
Stockholder, regarding any matter  relating to or arising under this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Transactions, with the full power,
without the consent of such Company Stockholder, to exercise as the
Stockholders' Representative in its sole discretion deems appropriate,  the
powers that such Company Stockholder could exercise under this Agreement with
respect to all of its rights and obligations and to take all actions with
respect thereto necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the
Stockholders'  Representative in connection with this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement and the Transactions. The appointment of the Stockholders'
Representative is coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable by any
Company Stockholder in any manner or for  any reason. Buyer, the Paying Agent
and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely exclusively, without
independent verification or investigation, upon any notices and other acts of
the Stockholders' Representative relating to the Company  Stockholders'
rights and obligations under this Agreement as being legally binding acts of
each Company Stockholder individually and collectively, and Buyer, the Paying
Agent and the Escrow Agent shall deliver any notice required or permitted 
under this Agreement to be delivered to the Company Stockholders to the
Stockholders' Representative. No Company Stockholder may take any action with
respect to its rights and obligations under this Agreement without the express
written consent  of the Stockholders' Representative.

 


 

 

(b) The Stockholders' Representative shall not be  required to expend or risk
its own funds or otherwise incur any financial Liability in the exercise or
performance of any of its powers, rights, duties or privileges or pursuant to
this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the transactions  contemplated hereby
or thereby. Furthermore, the Stockholders' Representative shall not be
required to take any action unless the Stockholders' Representative has been
provided with funds, security or indemnities from the Company Stockholders, 
which, in the Stockholders' Representative's determination, are sufficient to
protect the Stockholders' Representative against the costs, expenses and
Liabilities that may be incurred by the Stockholders' Representative in
performing such  actions. The Stockholders' Representative shall be entitled
to (i) rely upon the

 


 

 

 

67  


 

 

Estimated Closing Statement, (ii) rely upon any signature believed by it to be
genuine and (iii) reasonably assume that a signatory has proper authorization
to sign on  behalf of the applicable Company Stockholder or other Person.

 


 

 

(c) The Stockholders' Representative shall not be liable  to any Company
Stockholder for any act done or omitted under this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement as the representative of the Company Stockholders while acting in
good faith, and any act done or omitted shall be conclusive evidence of such 
good faith. Each Company Stockholder severally (pro rata in proportion to
their respective shares of the Merger Consideration) and not jointly shall
indemnify the Stockholders' Representative and hold the Stockholders'
Representative harmless  from and against any Losses (each, a "Representative
Loss") arising out of or in connection with any actions taken or omitted to be
taken by the  Stockholders' Representative under this Agreement or under the
Escrow Agreement, in each case as such Representative Loss is incurred or
suffered; _provided_ , that in the  event it is finally adjudicated that a
Representative Loss or any portion thereof was primarily caused by the gross
negligence or bad faith of the Stockholders' Representative, the Stockholders'
Representative will reimburse the Company  Stockholders the amount of such
indemnified Representative Loss attributable to such gross negligence or bad
faith. If not paid directly to the Stockholders' Representative by the Company
Stockholders, any such Representative Losses may be  recovered by the
Stockholders' Representative (without the requirement of any consent or
approval by Buyer) from the portion of the Adjustment Escrow Amount otherwise
distributable to the Company Stockholders pursuant to the terms of this 
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement at the time of distribution, in each case
in accordance with written instructions delivered by the Stockholders'
Representative to the Escrow Agent. While this _Section 9.14(c)_ allows for
the Stockholders' Representative to be paid from distributions to the Company
Stockholders from the Adjustment Escrow Amount, this does not relieve the
Company Stockholders from their  obligation to promptly pay such
Representative Losses as such Representative Losses are suffered or incurred,
nor does it prevent the Stockholders' Representative from seeking any remedies
available to it at law or otherwise; _provided_ , _however_ , that none of
Buyer, the Surviving Corporation nor any of their respective  Affiliates
(except for any such Affiliate that is a Company Stockholder, and then, only
in such Affiliate's capacity as a Company Stockholder) shall have any
Liability with respect to such items.

 


 

 

(d) Buyer and the Company acknowledge that the  Stockholders' Representative
is party to this Agreement solely for purposes of serving as the
representative of the Company Common Stockholders hereunder, and no action,
suit, claim, investigation or proceeding will be brought by, or on behalf of 
Buyer, the Company or the Surviving Corporation against the Stockholders'
Representative with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions, or any
statement, certificate, instruction, opinion, instrument or other documents
delivered hereunder  (with it being understood that any covenant or agreement
of or by the "Parties" or "each of the Parties" will not be deemed to require
performance by, or be an agreement of, the Stockholders' Representative unless
performance by the Stockholders'  Representative is expressly provided for in
such covenant or the Stockholders' Representative expressly so agrees in
writing).

 


 

 

Section 9.15 _Counterparts_. This Agreement, and the other documents,
agreements and instruments to be delivered in connection with this Agreement,
may be executed in counterparts, and any Party may  execute any such
counterpart, each of which when executed and delivered shall be deemed to be
an original and all of which counterparts taken together shall constitute but
one

shall have received a counterpart of this Agreement signed by the other
Parties. The  Parties agree that the delivery of this Agreement, and the
other documents, agreements and instruments to be delivered in connection with
this Agreement, may be effected by means of an exchange of electronically
transmitted signatures (including by  electronic mail in .pdf format).
