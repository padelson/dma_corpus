AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

 

This Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Agreement") is made and entered into
on this 16th day of February, 2010, by and among Portec Rail Products, Inc.,
a West Virginia corporation (the "Company"), L. B. Foster Company, a
Pennsylvania corporation ("Parent"), and Foster Thomas Company, a West
Virginia corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
("Acquisition Co.").

 

 

INTRODUCTION

 

 

A. The respective boards of directors of Parent, Acquisition Co. and the
Company have each determined that it is advisable and in the best interests
of their respective shareholders for Parent to acquire the Company; and for
such purpose have each approved a merger (the "Merger") of Acquisition Co.
with and into the Company, with the Company as the surviving corporation (the
"Surviving Corporation"), upon the terms and conditions set forth herein.

 

 

B. In furtherance of the Merger, it has been agreed that Acquisition Co. will
make a cash tender offer (the "Offer") to acquire all of the Company's
outstanding shares of common stock, $1.00 par value per share (the
"Company Common Stock") for $11.71 per share (such amount or any
greater amount per share paid pursuant to the Offer, subject to Section
1.1(f), is hereinafter referred to as the "Per-Share Amount"), without
interest, upon the terms and conditions set forth herein.

 

 

C. By resolutions duly adopted, the Company's board of directors has, in
light of and subject to the terms and conditions hereof: (i) determined
that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, specifically
including the Offer and the Merger, are fair to and in the best interests of
the Company and its shareholders; and (ii) resolved to recommend that the
Company's shareholders accept the Offer and tender their shares pursuant
thereto, and adopt this Agreement.

 

 

D. By resolution duly adopted, Parent has approved this Agreement and in its
capacity as the sole stockholder of Acquisition Co., adopted this Agreement.

 

 

E. Immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement and as a condition
and inducement to the Parent's and Acquisition Co's willingness to enter into
this Agreement, Parent is simultaneously entering into a shareholder tender
agreement substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit A (the "Tender and
Voting Agreement") with certain of the Company's directors and
executive officers (and certain related persons and entities) owning shares
of Company Common Stock and/or rights to acquire Company Common Stock,
pursuant to which (i) such shareholders are, among other things, agreeing to
tender, and not withdraw, all of such shareholders' shares of Company Common
Stock in the Offer upon the terms and conditions specified therein, and (ii)
certain of such shareholders are agreeing to certain restrictive covenants.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

 

AGREEMENT

 

 

Now, Therefore, in consideration of the foregoing premises hereby made a part
of this Agreement, the mutual covenants and agreements contained herein, and
for other good and valuable consideration the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally
bound subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth herein, hereby
agree as follows:

 

 

ARTICLE 1

 

 

THE OFFER

 

 

1.1 Conduct of the Offer.

 

 

(a) Provided that none of the events or circumstances set forth in Annex I
attached hereto shall have occurred or exist, as promptly as practicable (and
in any event not later than ten business days after the date hereof, provided
that the Company has within a reasonable time prior thereto furnished Parent
with the information about the Company required to be included in the Offer
Documents, as defined in paragraph (e) below), Acquisition Co. shall
commence, within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities and Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), the Offer.

 

 

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of the Offer and this Agreement,
Acquisition Co. shall accept for payment all shares of Company Common Stock
validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as soon as it is
permitted to do so under applicable Law (as defined in paragraph (c) below)
and shall pay for such shares in cash promptly thereafter (and in any event
in compliance with Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act). Acquisition Co.'s
obligation to accept for payment and to pay for any shares of Company Common
Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be subject to:

 

 

(i) the condition that there shall be a number of shares of Company Common
Stock validly tendered pursuant to the Offer and not withdrawn, together with
shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent and its subsidiaries
(excluding any Top-Up Shares, as defined in Section 1.4 below),
that, immediately prior to the acceptance for payment of shares of Company
Common Stock pursuant to the Offer, represents at least sixty five percent
(65%) of the Fully Diluted Number of Company Shares (as defined in paragraph
(d) below) (the "Minimum Condition"); and

 

 

(ii) the other conditions set forth in Annex I.

 

 

Acquisition Co. expressly reserves the right in its sole discretion to
increase the initial Per-Share Amount (in compliance with Rule 14d-10), to
waive (in whole or in part) any of the conditions of the Offer set forth in

Offer; provided, however, that without the Company's prior written consent:
(1) the Minimum Condition may not be amended or waived; (2) no change may be

Section 1.1(d), no change may be made that extends the expiration date of the
Offer beyond its initial expiration date, (4) except as provided in this
Agreement, no change may be made that amends any other terms of the Offer in

Co. shall not accept tendered Company Shares unless the conditions set forth
in (a) and (b) in Annex I shall have been satisfied.

For purposes of this Agreement, "Fully Diluted Number of Company Shares"
shall mean the sum of the (x) aggregate number of shares of Company Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the acceptance of shares of Company
Common Stock pursuant to the Offer, plus (y) the aggregate number of shares

other right to acquire capital stock of the Company or other security
exercisable for or convertible into shares of Company Common Stock or other
capital stock of the Company, any of which is outstanding immediately prior

(but excluding any Top-Up Shares).

 

 

(e) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Acquisition Co.
shall (i) file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with
respect to the Offer which will contain or incorporate by reference the offer
to purchase shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and form of
the related letter of transmittal and (ii) cause the offer to purchase
and related documents to be disseminated to holders of shares of Company
Common Stock in accordance with applicable federal securities laws.
Parent and Acquisition Co. agree that they shall use their reasonable best
efforts to cause the Schedule TO and all exhibits, amendments or supplements
thereto (collectively, the "Offer Documents") to comply in all material
respects with the Exchange Act, the rules and regulations thereunder and
other applicable Law. Each of Parent and Acquisition Co. agrees (and the
Company agrees to cooperate with Parent and Acquisition Co.) to use its
reasonable best efforts to respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Offer Documents or the Offer, to correct promptly
any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the
extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in
any material respect, and to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer
Documents as supplemented or amended to correct such information to be filed
with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of shares of Company Common
Stock, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal
securities laws. The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and
Acquisition Co. all information concerning the Company and the Company's
shareholders that may be required or reasonably requested in connection with
any action contemplated by this Section 1.1(e). The Company and its
counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
Offer Documents (including any amendment thereto) prior to the filing thereof
with the SEC. Parent and Acquisition Co. agree to provide the Company and
its counsel with any comments Parent, Acquisition Co. or their counsel may

(f) If, between the date of this Agreement and the date on which any
particular share of Company Common Stock is accepted for payment pursuant to
the Offer, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are changed into a
different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division,
subdivision or combination of shares, stock dividend, consolidation of
shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then
the Per-Share Amount shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such change
or transaction. For avoidance of doubt, it is understood that the Company
shall not have the right to take any such action with respect to the Company
Common Stock without the prior written consent of Parent. The provisions of
this Section 1.1(f) do not apply to the exercise of options granted prior to
the date hereof.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1.2 Company Actions.

 

 

(a) The Company hereby approves and consents to the Offer and represents that
its board of directors, at a meeting duly called and held or pursuant to
unanimous written action, has: (i) determined that this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, specifically including the Offer and
the Merger, are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and
its shareholders; (ii) approved and adopted this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, in
accordance with the requirements of the West Virginia Business Corporation

shareholders of the Company accept the Offer and tender their shares of
Company Common Stock and the Rights pursuant to the Offer and adopt and
approve this Agreement and the Merger (the "Company Board Recommendation")
and (v) irrevocably resolved to elect, to the extent of the Company's board
of directors' power and authority and to the extent permitted by law, not to
be subject to any other "moratorium", "control share acquisition", "business
combination", "fair price" or other form of anti-takeover laws and
regulations (collectively, "Takeover Laws") of any jurisdiction that may
purport to be applicable to this Agreement or the Tender and Voting Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. Finally, the Company
represents that its board of directors and/or compensation committee thereof
has adopted any necessary resolutions to provide for the treatment of Company
Options (as defined in Section 3.2(b) below) as set forth in Section 2.5(b)
of this Agreement. Subject to Section 5.3, the Company hereby consents to the
inclusion of the Company Board Recommendation in the Offer Documents.

 

 

(b) As promptly as practicable on the day that the Offer is commenced, the
Company shall file with the SEC and (following or contemporaneously with
the dissemination of the Offer Documents and related documents) disseminate
to holders of shares of Company Common Stock, in each case as and to the
extent required by applicable federal securities laws, a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the
Offer (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the "Schedule
14D-9") that shall reflect, subject to Section 5.3, the Company Board
Recommendation. The Company agrees that it shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to
comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder and other applicable Law. Each of Parent, Acquisition
Co. and the Company agrees to promptly correct any information provided by it
for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information
shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and the
Company further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule
14D-9 as supplemented or amended to correct such information to be filed with
the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of shares of Company Common Stock,
in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities
laws. Parent and its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 (including any amendment thereto) prior to
the filing thereof with the SEC. The Company agrees to provide Parent and its
counsel with any comments the Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC
or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of
such comments.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) The Company will, or will cause its transfer agent to, promptly furnish
Parent and Acquisition Co. with a list of its shareholders, mailing labels
and any available listing or computer file containing the names and addresses
of all record holders of shares of Company Common Stock and lists of
securities positions of shares of Company Common Stock held in stock
depositories, in each case as of the most recent practicable date, and will
provide to Parent such additional information (including updated lists of
shareholders, mailing labels and lists of securities positions) and such
other assistance as Parent or Acquisition Co. may reasonably request in
connection with the Offer and the Merger. Parent and Acquisition Co. and
their agents shall hold in confidence the information contained in any such
labels, listings and files, will use such information only in connection with
the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, will,
upon request, deliver to the Company or destroy (as requested), and will use
their reasonable best efforts to cause their agents to deliver to the Company
or destroy (as requested), all copies and any extracts or summaries from such
information then in their possession or control.

 

 

1.3 Directors.

 

 

(a) Effective upon the fulfillment of the Minimum Condition and upon the
acceptance for payment of the shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the
Offer and the delivery of funds to the depositary for the Offer to pay for
such shares, Parent shall be entitled to designate the number of directors,
rounded up to the next whole number, on the Company's board of directors that
equals the product of (i) the total number of directors on the Company's
board of directors (giving effect to the election of any additional directors
pursuant to this Section) and (ii) a fraction whose numerator is the
aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock then beneficially owned by
Parent and Acquisition Co. (including shares of Company Common Stock accepted
for payment pursuant to the Offer), and whose denominator is the total number
of shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding (provided that, in no
event shall Parent's director designees constitute less than a majority of
the entire board of directors of the Company), and the Company shall take all
commercially reasonable actions necessary to cause Parent's designees to be
elected or appointed to the Company's board of directors, including
increasing the number of directors, and seeking and accepting resignations of
incumbent directors. At such time, to the extent requested by Parent, and
subject to the applicable requirements of Nasdaq (including Stock Market Rule
5605(c)), the Company will also use its reasonable best efforts (i) to cause
individuals designated by Parent to constitute the number of members, rounded
up to the next whole number, on each committee of the Company's board of
directors, that represents the same percentage as the individuals designated
by Parent represent on the board of directors of the Company and (ii) to
cause individuals designated by Parent to constitute the same percentage of
the members of the board of directors of each Subsidiary (as defined in
Section 3.1 below) and each committee thereof.

 

 

(b) The Company's obligations to appoint Parent's designees to the Company's
board of directors shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and
Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all
actions, and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with
respect to the Company and persons designated by Parent pursuant to Section
1.3(a), as Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 of the Exchange Act require in order
to fulfill its obligations under this Section, so long as Parent shall have
furnished to the Company on a timely basis the information with respect to
Parent and its nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required by
Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 of the Exchange Act. The provisions of this
Section 1.3 are in addition to and shall not limit any rights which
Acquisition Co., Parent or any of their affiliates may have as a holder or
beneficial owner of shares of Company Common Stock as a matter of applicable
Law with respect to the election of directors or otherwise.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) Following the election or appointment of Parent's designees pursuant to
Section 1.3(a) and until the Effective Time, the approval of a majority of
the Individuals who were directors of the Company on the date hereof
("Continuing Directors"), or a single Continuing Director if there be only
one such Continuing Director, shall be required to authorize (and such
authorization shall constitute the authorization of the Company's board of
directors and no other action on the part of the Company, including any
action by any other director of the Company, shall be required to authorize)
any termination of this Agreement by the Company, any amendment of this
Agreement requiring action by the Company's board of directors, any extension
of time for performance of any obligation or action hereunder by Parent or
Acquisition Co. requiring the consent of the Company, any waiver of
compliance by the Company of any of the agreements or conditions contained
herein for the benefit of the Company or its shareholders, any required or
permitted consent or action by the board of directors of the Company
hereunder and any other action of the Company hereunder, which in the case of
any of the foregoing adversely affects in any material respect the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock (other than Parent or Acquisition Co.).

 

 

1.4 Top-Up Option.

 

 

(a) The Company hereby grants to Parent and Acquisition Co. an irrevocable
option which may be assigned by Parent to another wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent (the "Top-Up Option"), exercisable once upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth herein, to purchase at the Per-Share Amount an
aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock (the "Top-Up Shares")
equal to the lowest number of shares of Company Common Stock that, when added
to the number of shares Company Common Stock owned by Parent and its
subsidiaries at the time of such exercise, shall constitute one (1) share
more than ninety percent (90%) of the Fully Diluted Number of Company Shares
(after giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Shares); provided,
however, that in no event shall the Top-Up Option be exercisable for a number
of Shares in excess of the number of the authorized but unissued shares of
Company Common Stock as of immediately prior to the issuance of the Top-Up
Shares; provided, further, that the Parent and Acquisition Co. shall not
exercise the Top-UP Option for a number of shares which exceeds the maximum
number of shares that may be issued pursuant to WVBCA § 31D-6-621 without
shareholder approval; provided, further, that the Top-Up Option shall
terminate upon the earlier of: (x) the fifth (5th) Business Day (as such term
is defined in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) of the Exchange Act, "Business Day")
after the later of (1) the expiration date of the Offer and (2)
the expiration of any "subsequent offering period"; and (y) the termination
of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

 

 

(b) The obligation of the Company to deliver Top-Up Shares upon the exercise
of the Top-Up Option is subject to the conditions that (i) no provision of
any applicable Law (other than the applicable listing and corporate
governance rules and regulations of the Nasdaq Stock Market), and no
judgment, injunction, order or decree shall prohibit the exercise of the Top-
Up Option or the delivery of the Top-Up Shares in respect of such exercise
and (ii) Acquisition Co. has accepted for payment all shares of Company
Common Stock validly tendered in the Offer and not properly withdrawn and
delivered the funds for payment for such shares to the depositary for the
Offer.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) In the event Parent or Acquisition Co. wishes to exercise the Top-Up
Option, Parent or Acquisition Co. shall deliver to the Company a notice
setting forth: (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that Parent
or Acquisition Co. intends to purchase pursuant to the Top-Up Option; (ii)
the manner in which Parent or Acquisition Co. intends to pay the applicable
exercise price; and (iii) the place and time at which the closing of the
purchase of such shares of Company Common Stock by Parent or Acquisition Co.
is to take place. The Company shall, as soon as practicable following receipt
of such notice, notify Acquisition Co. of the number of shares of Company
Common Stock then outstanding, the number of shares of Company Common Stock
then outstanding on a fully-diluted basis and the number of Top-Up Shares. At
the closing of the purchase of such shares of Company Common Stock, Parent or
Acquisition Co. shall cause to be delivered to the Company the consideration
required to be delivered in exchange for such shares, and the Company shall
cause to be issued to Parent or Acquisition Co. (as the case may be) a
certificate representing such shares or, at Parent\'s or Acquisition Co.\'s
request or otherwise if the Company does not then have certificated shares,
the applicable number of book-entry shares. The parties shall cooperate to
issue the Top-Up Shares pursuant to an exemption from registration under the
Securities Act of 1933. Parent and Acquisition Co. represent and warrant that
the Top-Up Option, and the Top-Up Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the
Top-Up Option, if any, are being and shall be acquired by Parent or
Acquisition Co. for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for
resale in connection with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning of
the Securities Act of 1933).

 

 

(d) Parent or Acquisition Co. may pay the Company the aggregate price
required to be paid for the Top-Up Shares either (i) entirely in cash or cash
equivalents or (ii) at Parent\'s or Acquisition Co.\'s election, by (x)
paying in cash an amount equal to not less than the aggregate par value of
the Top-Up Shares and (y) executing and delivering to the Company
a promissory note having a principal amount equal to the aggregate price
required to be paid for the purchase of the Top-Up Shares but less the amount
to be paid in cash pursuant to the preceding clause (x) (a "Promissory
Note"). Any such Promissory Note shall be full recourse against Parent and
Acquisition Co. and (i) shall bear interest at a market rate of interest per
annum, payable in arrears at the end of one (1) year, (ii) shall mature
on the first (1st) anniversary of the date of execution and delivery of
such Promissory Note and (iii) may be prepaid, in whole or in part,
without premium or penalty.

2.2 Effect of Merger.

7 (other than delivery of items to be delivered at the Closing and other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the

Agreement, articles of merger satisfying the applicable requirements of the
WVBCA shall be duly executed by the Company and Acquisition Co. and,
concurrently with or as soon as practicable following the Closing, filed with

effective upon the date and time of the filing of such articles of merger
with the West Virginia Secretary of State, or at such later time as is

2.4 Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers.

 

 

Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time:

 

 

(a) the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended and restated as of the Effective Time to conform to the articles of
incorporation of Acquisition Co. as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time until thereafter changed or amended in accordance with the
provisions thereof and applicable Law;

 

 

(b) the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated as
of the Effective Time to conform to the bylaws of Acquisition Co. as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time until thereafter changed or
amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and applicable Law;

 

 

(c) the directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the
Effective Time shall be the respective individuals who are directors of

(d) the officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective
Time shall be the respective individuals who are officers of Acquisition Co.
immediately prior to the Effective Time until the earliest of their
resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected
and qualified, as the case may be.

 

 

2.5 Conversion of Shares.

 

 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Parent, Acquisition Co., the Company or any shareholder
of the Company:

 

 

(i) all shares of Company Common Stock then held by the Company or any wholly
owned Subsidiary shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

 

 

(ii) all shares of Company Common Stock, if any, then held by Parent,
Acquisition Co. or any other wholly owned subsidiary of Parent shall be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor;

 

 

(iii) except as provided in clauses (i) and (ii) above and subject to
Sections 2.5(c) and 2.8, each share of Company Common Stock then outstanding
shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Amount (the
"Merger Consideration"), without interest; and

 

 

(iv) all of the shares of the common stock, $1.00 par value per share, of
Acquisition Co. then outstanding shall be converted into one share of
Surviving Corporation Common Stock.

 

 

(b) All Company Options (as defined in Section 3.2(b) below) shall terminate
as of the Effective Time, whether or not vested or exercisable and without
regard to any agreements qualifying the right to retain or exercise any such
Company Options. At the Effective Time, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth below in this Section 2.5(b), each holder of a Company
Option whether or not vested or exercisable will be entitled to receive from
the Company, and shall receive, in settlement of each Company Option a
"Cash Amount." The "Cash Amount" shall be equal to the net amount of (A) the
product of the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise
price per share of such Company Option at the Effective Time, multiplied by
(ii) the number of shares subject to such Company Option, less (B) any
applicable withholdings for Tax (as defined in Section 3.17 below). If the
exercise price per share of any Company Option equals or exceeds the Merger
Consideration, the Cash Amount therefor shall be zero. Except as may be
otherwise agreed to by Parent and the Company, the Company\'s Stock Option
Plan (as defined in Section 3.2 below) shall terminate as of the Effective
Time and the provisions in any other plan, program or arrangement providing
for the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the capital
stock of Company or any Subsidiary shall be deleted, terminated and of no
further force or effect as of the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (i) payment of the Cash Amount is subject to written
acknowledgement, in a form acceptable to the Surviving Corporation, that no
further payment is due to such holder on account of any Company Option and
all of such holder\'s rights under such Company Options have terminated and
(ii) with respect to any Person subject to Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act,
any Cash Amount to be paid to such Person in accordance with this Section
2.5(b) shall be paid as soon as practicable after the payment can be made
without liability on such Person's part under Section 16(b) of the Exchange
Act.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are changed into a different
number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or
subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of
shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then
the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such
change or transaction. For avoidance of doubt, it is understood that
the Company shall not have the right to take any such action with respect to
the Company Common Stock without the prior written consent of Parent.
The provisions of this Section 2.5(c) do not apply to the exercise of
options granted prior to the date hereof.

 

 

2.6 Surrender of Certificates; Stock Transfer Books.

 

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust
company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the "Paying
Agent") for the holders of shares of Company Common Stock to receive the
funds to which holders of such shares shall become entitled pursuant to
Section 2.5. Such funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed
by the Parent or the Surviving Corporation. Earnings from such investments
shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation, and no part of such earnings shall accrue to the
benefit of holders of shares of Company Common Stock.

 

 

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each Person who was, at the Effective
Time, a holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.5, a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the certificates evidencing such shares (the
"Certificates") shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to
the Paying Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates pursuant thereto. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a
Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock formerly evidenced by
such Certificate, and such Certificate shall thereupon be canceled. No
interest shall accrue or be paid on the Merger Consideration payable upon the
surrender of any Certificate for the benefit of the holder of such
Certificate. If the payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate
formerly evidencing shares of Company Common Stock is registered on the
Company's stock transfer books, it shall be a condition of payment that the
Certificate so surrendered be endorsed properly or otherwise be in proper
form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid
all transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered, or shall have established to the satisfaction of
Acquisition Co. that such Taxes are not applicable. Except as set forth in
Section 2.8, until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.6(b), each
Certificate shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration for each share of Company
Common Stock formerly evidenced by such Certificate. If any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent may, in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to the payment of the Merger Consideration for each share
of Company Common Stock formerly evidenced by such Certificate, require the
owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate to provide an appropriate
affidavit and to deliver a bond (in such sum as Parent may reasonably direct)
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Paying Agent,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) At any time following the six-month anniversary of the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to
deliver to it any funds not then disbursed to holders of shares of Company
Common Stock (including without limitation all interest and other income
received by the Paying Agent in respect of all such funds), and, thereafter,
such holders shall be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject
to abandoned property, escheat and other similar laws) only as general
creditors thereof with respect to any Merger Consideration that may be
payable upon due surrender of the Certificates held by them. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent
nor any other party to this Agreement shall be liable to any holder of a
share of Company Common Stock for any Merger Consideration delivered in
respect of such share to a public official pursuant to any abandoned
property, escheat or other similar law. If any Certificates shall not have
been surrendered prior to five years after the Effective Time (or immediately
prior to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration in respect of
such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Body), any amounts payable in respect of such Certificate shall,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

 

 

(d) At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the Company's
stock transfer books shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of the Company's capital stock. From and
after the Effective Time, the holders of shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such shares except as otherwise provided herein or by
applicable Law.

 

 

(e) Each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and Acquisition Co. shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold (or cause the Paying Agent to deduct and
withhold) from the consideration otherwise payable in the Merger to any
holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to Taxes. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common
Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2.7 The Company's Shareholders' Meeting.

 

 

Unless the Merger is consummated in accordance with Section 31D-11-1105 of
the WVBCA as contemplated by Section 6.1(c) below, the Company, acting
through its board of directors, shall duly call a special meeting of
its shareholders (the "Special Shareholders Meeting") to be held in
accordance with the WVBCA at the earliest practicable date, upon due notice
thereof to its shareholders, to consider and vote upon, among other matters,
the adoption and approval of this Agreement and the Merger. The Company's
board of directors will recommend the approval of the Merger and will use its
best efforts, consistent with its fiduciary duties, to solicit the requisite
vote of the Company's shareholders to approve this Agreement and the Merger
pursuant to proxy solicitation materials.

 

 

2.8 Dissenters' Rights.

 

 

Holders of Company Common Stock may dissent from the Merger and exercise
their appraisal rights pursuant to and subject to the provisions of Sections
31D-13-1301 et seq. of the WVBCA. Each outstanding share of Company Common
Stock, the holder of which has demanded and perfected such holder's right to
dissent from the Merger and to be paid the fair value of such shares in
accordance with Sections 31D-13-1301 et seq. of the WVBCA and, as of the
Effective Time, has not effectively withdrawn or lost such dissenters' rights
("Dissenting Shares"), shall not be converted into or represent a right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.5, but the holder
thereof shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by the WVBCA;
provided, however, that if any holder of Company Common Stock demands
dissenters' rights with respect to such shares under the WVBCA and
subsequently effectively withdraws or loses (through failure to perfect or
otherwise) its dissenters' rights, then as of the Effective Time or the
occurrence of such event, whichever later occurs, such holder's Company
Common Stock will automatically be converted into and represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.5, without
interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate(s) formerly representing
such shares. After the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Company to make
all payments to holders of Dissenting Shares with respect to such demands in
accordance with the WVBCA. The Company shall give Parent: (i) prompt written
notice of any notice of intent to demand fair value for any shares of Company
Common Stock, withdrawals of such notices, and any other instruments served
pursuant to the WVBCA and received by the Company; and (ii) the opportunity
to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for fair
value for shares of Company Common Stock under the WVBCA. The Company shall
not, except with prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any
payment with respect to any demands for fair value for shares of Company
Common Stock or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

 

 

2.9 Further Action.

 

 

If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is determined by
Parent to be reasonably necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title
and possession of and to all rights and property of Acquisition Co. and the
Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation and Parent
shall be fully authorized (in the name of Acquisition Co., in the name of the
Company and otherwise) to take such action.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ARTICLE 3

 

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

 

Except as set forth in the disclosure schedules attached hereto, hereinafter
referred to as the "Company Disclosure Letter" (it being acknowledged that
disclosure in the Company Disclosure Letter with respect to any particular
Section of the Agreement shall be deemed disclosure with respect to another
Section of the Agreement to the extent that it is reasonably clear on the
face of such Schedule that such item applies to such other schedule or
incorporated by reference to a specific section of the Company SEC Documents
(as defined in Section 3.8 below) filed on or after January 1, 2009 but prior
to the date of this Agreement), the Company represents and warrants to Parent
and Acquisition Co. that all of the statements contained in this ARTICLE 3
are true and complete as of the date of this Agreement, and will be true and
complete as of the expiration date of the Offer as though made at such time
and as of the Effective Time as though made at the Effective Time (except as
to any representation or warranty that speaks as of a specific date, which
shall be true as of such date).

 

 

3.1 Organization.

 

 

(a) The Company and each Subsidiary is a corporation duly incorporated,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of
its incorporation and has all requisite corporate power and authority to own,
lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now being
conducted. The Company and each Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed and
in good standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which the character
of the property owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the business
conducted by it makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where
the failure to be so duly qualified or licensed and in good standing would
not be reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. For
purposes of this Agreement, a "Company Material Adverse Effect" shall mean
any change, result, effect, event, occurrence or state of facts (or any
development that has had or is reasonably likely to have any change or
effect) that is or would reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to
the business, financial condition, assets, liabilities or results
of operations of the Company and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or which
is or would reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to the ability of
such Persons to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby; provided,
however, that none of the following shall be deemed in itself, either alone
or in combination, to constitute, and none of the following shall be taken
into account in determining whether there has been, a Company Material
Adverse Effect: (i) any effect resulting from or arising in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or the execution
or announcement hereof, (ii) changes in general economic conditions
(including general financial, credit or capital market conditions including
changes in interest rates) in the United States, United Kingdom or
Canada, (iii) changes in generally accepted accounting principles, (iv)
any change in the price at which the shares of Company Common Stock are
publicly traded, (v) any matter relating to the Company\'s former properties
in Troy, New York (including any litigation or government action related to
the Company\'s former properties in Troy, New York), (vi) changes that are
the result of factors generally affecting the industries or markets in which
the Company or the Subsidiaries operate (other than those changes that have
had a disproportionate adverse effect relative to other industry participants
on the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole), (vii) acts of war
(whether or not declared), the commencement, continuation or escalation of a
war, acts of armed hostility, sabotage or terrorism or other international or
national calamity or any material worsening of conditions threatened or
existing as of the date of this Agreement (other than those that have had a
disproportionate adverse effect relative to other industry participants on
the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole), (viii) any material
disaster, or other force majeure event (other than those that have had a
disproportionate adverse effect relative to other industry participants on
the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole) or (ix) any divestiture by
the Company pursuant to Section 6.2 of this Agreement.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) The Company has heretofore made available to Parent accurate and complete
copies of the articles of incorporation and bylaws, as currently in effect,
of the Company and the Subsidiaries. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Subsidiary" shall mean a Subsidiary of the Company and an Entity shall be
considered a Subsidiary of the Company if the Company directly or indirectly
owns, beneficially or of record, an amount of voting securities of other
interests in such Entity that is sufficient to enable the Company to elect at
least a majority of the members of such Entity's board of directors or other
governing body, or at least 50% of the outstanding equity or financial
interests of such Entity. Neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries
(collectively, the "Acquired Companies") owns an equity interest in any
Entity other than a Subsidiary and none of the Acquired Companies have agreed
or is obligated to make, or is bound by any contract or other obligation
under which it may become obligated to make, any future equity or similar
investment in or capital contribution to any other Person.

or unvested ("Company Options") under the Company\'s 2006 Stock Option Plan

(7) the date on which such Company Option expires. The Company has no plans
or arrangements pursuant to which stock options or other stock-based equity

delivered to Parent and Acquisition Co. accurate and complete copies of all
stock plans pursuant to which Company has granted currently outstanding stock
options or other stock-based compensation or, could have granted stock
options or other stock-based compensation since December 31, 2008, or
currently can grant stock options or other stock-based compensation, and the
forms of all stock option agreements evidencing such options or other stock-
based compensation. Assuming that the Company complies with its
obligations under Section 2.5(b), the Company will not incur any liability as
a result of the cancellation of the Company Options as described in Section
2.5 and all rights of the holders of such Company Options will terminate as
of the Effective Time.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) Except for the Company Options and the Top-Up Option, there is no: (i)

currently exercisable) to acquire any shares of the capital stock or other
securities of Company (or any Subsidiary); (ii) outstanding security,
instrument or obligation that is or may become convertible into
or exchangeable for any shares of the capital stock or other securities of
Company (or any Subsidiary); or (iii) stockholder rights plan (or similar

calls or commitments of any character whatsoever relating to, or securities
or rights convertible into or exchangeable for, shares of any capital stock
of any Subsidiary, and there are no contracts, commitments, understandings or
arrangements by which any Subsidiary is bound to issue additional shares of
its capital stock, or options, warrants or rights to purchase or acquire any
additional shares of its capital stock or securities convertible into or

deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including but not

equity regarding the availability of remedies (the
"Enforceability Exceptions").

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3.5 Governmental Approvals.

 

 

No consent, approval, waiver or authorization of, notice to or declaration
or filing with ("Consent"), any Governmental Body on the part of the Company

the Subsidiaries is qualified or authorized to do business in order
to continue to do business therein, and (e) those Consents that, if they
were not obtained or made, would not be a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

3.6 Non-Contravention.

 

 

Other than as set forth in Schedule 3.6 of the Company Disclosure Letter,
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Tender and Voting
Agreement, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby and compliance by the Company with any of the provisions hereof and
thereof in accordance with their terms will not: (a) conflict with or result
in any breach of any provision of the articles of incorporation or bylaws or
other governing instruments of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries; (b)
require any Consent under or result in a violation or breach of,
or constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of time or both) a default
(or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation or acceleration)
under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any Company Material
Contract (as defined in Section 3.14 below); (c) result in the creation or
imposition of any lien or encumbrance of any kind upon any of the assets of
the Company or any Subsidiary; or (d) subject to obtaining the Consents from

provision of any Law to which the Company or any Subsidiary or its or any of
their respective assets or properties are subject, except, in the case of
clauses (b), (c) and (d) above, for any deviations from the foregoing which
would not be reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

presently is conducted, and the ownership, possession and use of the assets
of each of the Acquired Companies have complied and currently do comply with
all applicable Laws, including without limitation, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002 ("SOX"), except where failure to so comply would not be reasonably
likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. From December 31, 2006
through the date of this Agreement, none of the Acquired Companies have
received any written notice, nor to the knowledge of the Company, any oral
notice from any Governmental Body regarding any actual or possible material
violation of, or failure to comply in any material respect with, any Law.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 3.8 SEC Filings; Adequate Controls.

 

 

(a) The Company has made available to Parent and Acquisition Co. accurate and
complete copies of all registration statements, definitive proxy statements
and other statements, reports, schedules, forms and other documents (and all
amendments or supplements thereto) filed by Company with the SEC since
January 1, 2007 (the "Company SEC Documents"). All statements, reports,
schedules, forms and other documents required to have been filed by Company
with the SEC since January 1, 2007 have been so filed and in a timely manner.
Other than as disclosed on Section 3.8 of the Company Disclosure Letter, as
of the time it was filed with the SEC (or, if amended, supplemented or
superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then on the date
of such filing): (i) each of the Company SEC Documents complied in
all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), the Exchange Act, and SOX (as
the case may be); and (ii) none of the Company SEC Documents contained any
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

 

 

(b) The consolidated financial statements (including any related notes)
contained in the Company SEC Documents: (i) when filed, complied as to form
in all material respects with the published rules and regulations of the
SEC applicable thereto; (ii) when filed, were prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("US
GAAP"), except, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by SEC
regulations applicable to Form 10-Q, and except that the unaudited financial
statements may not contain footnotes and are subject to normal and recurring
year-end adjustments; and (iii) when filed fairly presented in all material
respects the consolidated financial position of the Company as of the
respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of operations and cash
flows of the Company for the periods covered thereby. The unaudited
consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of
September 30, 2009 included in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
for the quarter ended September 30, 2009 is sometimes referred to as the
"Latest Balance Sheet."

 

 

(c) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar contract or arrangement including any contract or
arrangement relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the
Company and any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated
affiliate (including any structured finance, special purpose or limited
purpose entity or Person), on the other hand or any "off-balance sheet
arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the
SEC), where the result, purpose or intended effect of such contract or
arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or
material liabilities of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the
Company's or such Subsidiary's published financial statements or other
Company SEC Documents.

 

 

(d) Prior to the Offer Closing Date (as defined in Section 7.3 below), the
Company has and will have in place the "disclosure controls and procedures"
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) required in
order for the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
to engage in the review and evaluation process mandated by the Exchange Act,
and has delivered copies of any such written procedures to Parent. The
Company's "disclosure controls and procedures" are reasonably designed to
ensure that all information required to be disclosed by the Company in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information is accumulated and
communicated to the Company's management as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(e) The Company maintains a system of accounting controls (including
"internal control over financial reporting" as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)
promulgated under the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable
assurances that (i) transactions are executed in accordance with management's
general or specific authorization, (ii) transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with US
GAAP and to maintain accountability for assets; (iii) access to assets is
permitted only in accordance with management's general or specific
authorization; and (iv) the recorded accountability for assets is compared
with existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken
with respect to any differences. Since December 31, 2008, the Company has
not received any written or oral notice from its registered independent
public accounting firm of a "reportable condition," "significant deficiency"
or "material weakness" in the Company's system of accounting controls as
those terms are defined under generally accepted auditing standards in the
United States.

 

 

3.9 Assets.

 

 

Other than as set forth in Section 3.9 of the Company Disclosure Letter,
except for Company Intellectual Property (title for which is described in
Section 3.13), the Acquired Companies have good and marketable title to all
of their respective assets reflected on the Latest Balance Sheet (other than
assets disposed of in the ordinary course of business since the date of the
Latest Balance Sheet) and have the right to transfer all rights, title and
interest in such assets, free and clear of any liens or encumbrances other
than (i) encumbrances set forth in the Latest Balance Sheet or (ii) Permitted
Encumbrances (as defined below). Except for Company Intellectual Property,
each of the Acquired Companies has all material assets necessary to operate,
or which are material to the operation of, its respective business as
currently conducted. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Permitted Encumbrances" shall mean encumbrances (i) for Taxes,
governmental charges, assessments or levies, provided that such Taxes,
governmental charges, assessments or levies are not yet due or are being
contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings, and in any case, for
which the Company has made an appropriate reserve on the Latest Balance
Sheet; (ii) deposits, encumbrances or pledges to secure payments of workmen's
compensation, public liability, unemployment and other similar insurance;
(iii) mechanics', workmen's, materialmen's, repairmen's, warehousemen's,
vendors', landlords' or carriers' encumbrances, or other similar encumbrances
arising in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices and
securing sums which are not past due or are being contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings, and in any case, for which the Company has made an
appropriate reserve on the Latest Balance Sheet; and (iv) encumbrances that
would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

3.10 Absence of Certain Changes or Events; No Undisclosed Liabilities.

 

 

Other than as set forth in Schedule 3.10 of the Company Disclosure Letter,
from December 31, 2008 and on or prior to the date of this Agreement, there
has not been any: (a) event that has had or would reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect; (b) declaration, payment or setting
aside for payment of any dividend (other than quarterly cash dividends at the
rate of $0.06 per share) or other distribution or any redemption or other
acquisition of any shares of capital stock or securities of the Company by
the Company or any split, combination or reclassification of any of the
capital stock of the Company; (c) damage (other than ordinary wear and tear)
or loss to any material asset or property of the Company, whether or not
covered by insurance which is reasonably likely to result in a Company
Material Adverse Effect; (d) change by the Company in accounting principles
or practices other than changes made as a result of changes in the
requirements of GAAP or the rules and regulations of the SEC; (e) other than
pursuant to the grant of Company Options or the exercise of Company Options
and the grant of the Top-Up Option, sale, issuance or grant of any capital
stock or other equity security of the Company or any Subsidiary, or sale,
issuance or grant of any instrument convertible into or exchangeable for any
such capital stock or other security; (f) Subsidiary formed or acquired or
investment made in or guarantee granted in favor of any Entity not a
Subsidiary; (g) amendment to the articles of incorporation or organization,
bylaws or other organizational documents of the Company or any Subsidiary;
(h) other than to the extent described in the Company\'s Annual Report on
Form 10-K for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2008 (the "Company\'s Form
10-K") or in any Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company after the
filing of the Company\'s Form 10-K and prior to the date hereof (x) increase
in compensation payable to any executive officer, director or consultant or
(y) granting to any executive officer, director or consultant any employment,
severance or termination agreement or any increase in severance or
termination pay or benefits; or (i) any delivery of a notice of default under
or non-renewal of any Company Material Contract (as defined in Section 3.14
below), except for (x) such defaults that were subsequently cured, (y) such
defaults which are not reasonably expected to result in a Company Material
Adverse Effect and (z) any non-renewal of any Company Material Contract which
was subsequently replaced or the loss of which would not result in a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Except for those liabilities that are fully
reflected or reserved against on the balance sheet of the Company included in
the Company\'s Form 10-K and for liabilities incurred in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practice, since December 31, 2008, neither
the Company nor any Subsidiary has incurred any liability of any
nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and
whether due or to become due) that, either individually or in the aggregate,
has had or would be reasonably likely to have, a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

 

 

3.11 Permits.

 

 

Other than as set forth in Schedule 3.11 of the Company Disclosure Letter,
the Company and Subsidiaries have all permits, certificates, licenses,
approvals and other authorizations required in connection with the operation
of their respective businesses (collectively, the "Company Permits") except
those Company Permits the absence of which would not be reasonably likely to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of the Company,
neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries is in material violation of
any Company Permit. No proceedings are pending or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened, to revoke or limit any Company Permit, except, in each
case, those the absence or violation of which would not be reasonably likely
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3.12 Legal Proceedings.

 

 

(a) Schedule 3.12 of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth all Proceedings
(as defined herein). Other than the proceedings set forth in Schedule 3.12 of
the Company Disclosure Letter, there is no suit, action or proceeding
(collectively, "Proceedings") pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened against the Company or any of the Subsidiaries which, individually
or in the aggregate, would be reasonably likely to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect; nor is there any judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order
of any Governmental Body outstanding against the Company or any Subsidiaries
which, individually or in the aggregate, would be reasonably likely to have a

3.15 Employee-Benefit Plans.

 

 

Schedule 3.15 of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a complete and

as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended, together with all regulations thereunder ("ERISA");
and (ii) whether or not described in the preceding clause, any

of the current or former employees, directors or agents of the Company,
the Subsidiaries or any of their respective beneficiaries or dependents;
provided, however, that "Benefit Plans" shall not include any multiemployer
plan, as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA, nor any periodic wage or salary,
bonus or other incentive compensation arrangement providing non-deferred

maintains or contributes to any defined benefit pension plan subject to ERISA
Title IV, or has any outstanding liability with respect to any such plan.
Each Company Benefit Plan has been maintained in compliance with its terms
and all applicable Law, except where the failure to do so would not be
reasonably likely to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect. There is no
pending or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened Proceeding or claim
against, or with respect to, any Company Benefit Plan (other than routine
claims for benefits) that would be reasonably likely to result in a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

Since December 31, 2008, there has been no termination, cancellation or
material curtailment of the business relationship of the Company or any
Subsidiary with any customer or supplier or group of affiliated customers or

Material Adverse Effect nor has the Company received any written notice of
intent to so terminate, cancel or materially curtail which would have such a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

in the Company Financial Statements). Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary has waived or extended any applicable statute of limitations to
assess any Taxes. There are no outstanding requests by the Company or
any Subsidiary for any extension of time within which to file any Tax Return

any, which become due and payable pursuant to such Tax Returns or assessments
received by it on or before the Closing Date, except for any such assessments
that, in each case, are being contested in good faith, are immaterial in
amount or for which adequate reserves will have been properly accrued as
provided in paragraph (b) above.

 

 

(d) Neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries has ever been a member of
an affiliated group of corporations (within the meaning of Section 1504 of
the Code) other than an affiliated group of which the Company is the

bound by or has any Obligation under any Tax-sharing agreement or
similar agreement or arrangement other than one that is solely between the
Company and one or more Subsidiaries or (ii) has any liability for Taxes of
any party (other than the Company or any Subsidiary) under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any similar provision of state, local or
foreign law, as a transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise.

 

 

(e) No audits or other administrative Proceedings or court Proceedings are
pending or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened with regard to any Taxes
or Tax Return of the Company, any Subsidiary or any affiliated, consolidated,
combined or unitary group of Entities of which the Company or any Subsidiary
is a member and, to the knowledge of the Company, no material issues have
been raised by any Tax authority in connection with any Tax or Tax Return
that have not been conclusively resolved.

 

 

(f) The Company and each Subsidiary has disclosed on its respective income
Tax Returns all positions taken therein that could give rise to a substantial
understatement of federal income Tax within the meaning of Section 6662 of
the Code.

 

 

(g) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has made nor is obligated to make
a payment that would not be deductible by reason of Section 280G of the Code.

 

 

(h) To the Company's knowledge, no claim has ever been made by a taxing
authority in a jurisdiction, where either the Company or any Subsidiary does
not file Tax Returns, that it is or may be subject to taxation in that
jurisdiction, except for any such claim that has been conclusively resolved.

Subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the Tender and Voting Agreement.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) The Company shall not, nor shall it permit any Subsidiary to, nor shall
it authorize or permit any of its or any Subsidiary\'s officers, directors,
employees, representatives, investment bankers, financial advisers,

Transaction Proposal, the Company shall provide Parent with oral and written
notice of the material terms and conditions of such Alternative Transaction
Proposal, request or inquiry, a copy of any term sheet or proposed definitive
agreement regarding such Alternative Transaction Proposal and any revisions
thereto, and the identity of the Person or group of Persons making any such
Alternative Transaction Proposal, request or inquiry. In addition, the

all material respects of the status and details (including amendments or

(d) Notwithstanding the covenants in Section 5.3(b) above, if the Company is
not in breach of its covenants contained in Section 5.3(b) above (it being
understood that a breach by a Subsidiary or Representative shall be deemed to
be a breach by the Company for purposes of this paragraph (d)), prior to the
Offer Closing Date (as defined in Section 7.3 below), in response to an
unsolicited bona fide Alternative Transaction Proposal that the Company's
board of directors determines in good faith (after receipt of advice from its
outside legal counsel and in consultation with its financial advisor)
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Superior
Proposal, the Company's board of directors may, to the extent that it
determines in good faith (after receipt of advice from its outside legal
counsel) that such action is required in order to comply with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law, take the following actions to the extent
reasonably necessary to satisfy such fiduciary duties (but only after giving
Parent not less than 24 hours written notice of the intention to take such
action and the identity of the Person or group of Persons making such
Alternative Transaction Proposal): (i) furnish information with respect to
the Company to any Person pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement
(as determined by the Company after consultation with its outside legal
counsel) but in no event less restrictive than the confidentiality provisions
contained in the Confidentiality, Non-disclosure and Exclusive Negotiation
Agreement (as hereafter defined) and provided that any information provided
to such Person is contemporaneously provided to Parent; and/or (ii)
participate in negotiations regarding such Alternative Transaction Proposal.
For purposes of this Agreement, a "Company Superior Proposal" means any bona
fide unsolicited written Alternative Transaction Proposal made by a third
party to acquire, directly or indirectly, for consideration consisting of
cash and/or securities (with any financing necessary to consummate such
Alternative Transaction Proposal to have been committed by a financial
institution), all of the Company's capital stock then outstanding or all of
the assets of the Company, on terms which the Company's board of directors
determines in its good faith judgment (based on the advice of its advisors)
to be more favorable from a financial point of view to the Company's
shareholders than the Offer and the Merger, as the same may be proposed to be
amended (taking into account all factors relating to such proposed
transaction deemed relevant by the Company's board of directors, including
without limitation the amount and form of consideration, the timing
of payment, the risk of consummation of the transaction, the financing
thereof and all other conditions thereto).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(e) Neither the Company's board of directors nor any committee thereof
shall (i) withhold, withdraw, amend or modify, or propose to withhold,
withdraw, amend or modify, the approval and Company Board
Recommendation, (ii) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or
recommend, any Alternative Transaction or (iii) cause the Company or any
Subsidiary to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement or other agreement with respect to an Alternative
Transaction unless the Company's board of directors shall have previously
terminated this Agreement pursuant to Sections 8.1(c), 8.1(e), 8.1(g) or
8.1(h).

 

 

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 5.3 shall prohibit the Company from
taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rules
14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any
other disclosure to the Company's shareholders if, in the good faith judgment
of the Company's board of directors, after receipt of advice from its outside
legal counsel, failure so to disclose would create a reasonable possibility
of a breach of its fiduciary duties to the Company's shareholders under
applicable Law; provided, however, neither the Company nor its board of
directors nor any committee thereof shall, except as permitted by Section
5.3(e), withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, the
Company Board Recommendation or approve or recommend, or propose publicly to
approve or recommend, an Alternative Transaction Proposal.

meeting of the holders of Company Common Stock to vote on the adoption of
this Agreement (the "Company Shareholder Meeting").

Top-Up Option or otherwise at least 90% of the outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock (such that the conditions of Section 31D-11-1105 of the WVBCA
are satisfied), the parties shall take all necessary and appropriate action
to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable after the
expiration date of the Offer (as such expiration date may have been extended
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement) without the Company
Shareholder Meeting (a "Short Form Merger").

 

 

(d) Parent agrees to cause all shares of Company Common Stock, if any, owned
by Parent or any subsidiary of Parent to be voted in favor of the adoption of
the Agreement at the Company Shareholder Meeting.

 

 

6.2 Regulatory Approvals.

 

 

Each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to file, as soon as
practicable after the date of this Agreement, all notices, reports and other
documents required to be filed by such party with any Governmental Body with
respect to the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Tender and Voting Agreement, and to submit promptly
any additional information requested by any such Governmental Body. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall,
promptly after the date hereof, prepare and file any notifications required
under any applicable antitrust Laws in connection with the Offer, the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Tender and
Voting Agreement. The Company and Parent shall respond as promptly
as practicable to any inquiries or requests received from any antitrust
authority or other Governmental Body in connection with antitrust or
related matters. Each of the Company and Parent shall (a) give the
other party prompt notice of the commencement or threat of commencement of
any Proceeding by or before any Governmental Body with respect to the Offer,
the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (b) keep the other party informed as to the status of any such
Proceeding or threat, and (c) promptly inform the other party of any
communication to or from any Governmental Body regarding the Offer, the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the Tender and Voting Agreement. Except as may be prohibited by any
Governmental Body or by any Law, (x) each party will consult and cooperate
with the other, and will consider in good faith the views of the other, in
connection with any analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief,
Proceeding under or relating to any foreign, federal or state antitrust or
fair trade Law, and (y) in connection with any such Proceeding, each party
will permit authorized Representatives of the other to be present at each
meeting or conference relating to any such Proceeding and to have access to
and be consulted in connection with any document, opinion or proposal made or
submitted to any Governmental Body in connection with any such Proceeding. At
the request of Parent, the Company shall agree to divest, sell, dispose of,
hold separate or otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits its
freedom of action with respect to its or the Subsidiaries' ability to operate
or retain any of the businesses, product lines or assets of the Company or
any Subsidiary, provided, however, that any such action is conditioned upon
the consummation of the Offer and satisfaction of all conditions to the
consummation of the Offer.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6.3 Employee Benefits.

 

 

Parent further agrees that to the extent Parent terminates or freezes a
Company Benefit Plan of the Acquired Companies, (i) that the employees of the
Acquired Companies who continue employment with Parent or its subsidiaries
shall be enrolled in comparable plans of Parent to the extent that Parent
then offers comparable plans to its employees who are employed at similar
geographic locations, and (ii) that for purposes of determining eligibility,
vesting and benefits under any such Parent plans, Parent will recognize
service with the Acquired Companies. For the avoidance of doubt, the
participation of any employees of the Acquired Companies in any equity based
compensation plans of Parent will be expressly determined by Parent in its
sole discretion. Nothing in this Agreement shall require Parent to
retain any Acquired Companies employees for any period of time after the

agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries with respect to any payments that are to be made to any of
its officers, directors or employees which are described in Section 2.5(b)
and Section 5.2 of the Company Disclosure Letter to be approved as an

6.4 Indemnification of Officers and Directors.

 

 

(a) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation\'s Bylaws to continue to contain the following
quoted indemnification provisions which are contained in the Company\'s
Bylaws and further agrees that for a period of six years after the Effective
Time these indemnification provisions shall apply to each person who was an
officer, director or employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries at any time
before the date hereof or who becomes before the Effective Time, an officer,
director, or employee or shareholder of the Company (the "Indemnified
Persons"):

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"1. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the corporation shall
indemnify any person (other than a shareholder of the corporation) who was or
is a party or threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or
completed action or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (including, without limitation, an action or proceeding by or
in the right of the corporation) by reason of the fact that he is or was a
director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving
at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent
of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, against expenses (including attorney fees), judgments, fines,
taxes and penalties and interest thereon, and amounts paid in settlement
actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action or
proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed
to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with
respect to any criminal action or proceedings, had no reasonable cause to
believe his conduct was unlawful.

 

 

2. To the extent permitted by applicable law the corporation shall indemnify any shareholder of the corporation who was or is a party or threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or proceedings, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative (including, without limitation, an action or proceeding by or in the right of the corporation) by reason of the fact that he is or was a shareholder, director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is, or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorney fees), judgments, fines, taxes and penalties and interest thereon, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action or proceeding, except in relation to matters as to which he shall have been finally adjudged to be liable by reason of having been guilty of gross negligence or wilful misconduct. In the event of any other judgment against any such shareholder or in the event of a settlement, indemnification shall be made only if the corporation shall be advised, in case none of the persons involved shall have been a director of the corporation, by the board of directors, and otherwise by independent counsel to be appointed by the board of directors, that in its or his opinion such shareholder was not guilty of gross negligence or wilful misconduct, and, in the event of a settlement, that such settlement was, or if still to be made, is, in the best interests of the corporation. If a determination is to be made by the board of directors, it may rely, as to all questions of law, on the advice of the independent counsel.

 



 

3. The foregoing rights of indemnification shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors or administrators of each such shareholder, director, officer, employee or agent and shall be in addition to and not exclusive of, any other rights to which such shareholder, director, officer, employee or agent may be entitled."

 



 

(b) Parent hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees and
becomes surety for the full and punctual performance by the Surviving
Corporation of the Surviving Corporation\'s obligations to indemnify the
Indemnified Persons under the foregoing subsection (a) of this Section 6.4 as
and when such performance shall become due. This is a guarantee of payment
and performance and not merely of collectibility, and a separate action or
actions may be brought by the Indemnified Persons against Parent regardless
of whether action is brought against the Surviving Corporation.

 

 

(c) Parent shall maintain, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
maintain, in effect for three years following the Effective Time, the current
directors' and officers' liability insurance policies covering the officers
and directors of the Company (provided that Parent may substitute therefor
policies of at least the same coverage containing terms and conditions which
are not materially less favorable) with respect to matters occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time. In connection with the foregoing, the Company
agrees in order for Parent to fulfill its agreement to provide directors' and
officers' liability insurance policies for three years to provide such
insurer or substitute insurer with such reasonable and customary
representations as such insurer may request with respect to the reporting of
any prior claims.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) In the event that either Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of Parent shall assume the obligation to cause the
Surviving Corporations Bylaws to continue to contain the indemnification
provisions in accordance with Section 6.4(a) and (b)and to provide directors
and officers liability insurance in accordance with Section 6.4(c).

 

 

(e) The provisions of this Section 6.4 shall be enforceable by the
Indemnified Persons against Parent and shall be binding on all
respective successors and assigns of Parent.

 

 



 

6.5 Additional Agreements.

 

 

Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions necessary to consummate the Offer and the
Merger and make effective the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Tender and Voting Agreement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, each party to this Agreement (a) shall make all

obtained (pursuant to any applicable Law or contract, or otherwise) by such
party in connection with the Offer and the Merger and each of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Tender and Voting
Agreement, and (c) shall use its reasonable best efforts to lift any
restraint, injunction or other legal bar to the Offer, the Merger or any of
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Tender and
Voting Agreement. Each party shall promptly deliver to the other parties a
copy of each such filing made, each such notice given and each such Consent
obtained by such party during the Pre-Closing Period. Nothing contained in
this Section or in this Agreement shall obligate the Parent or Acquisition
Co. to agree to hold separate or to dispose of any assets or businesses of
the Parent and its subsidiaries or of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

 

 

6.6 Press Releases.

 

 

Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any press
release or otherwise making any public statement with respect to the Offer,
the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Tender and Voting Agreement. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the Company shall not, and shall not permit any Subsidiary or
any Representative of any of the Acquired Companies to, make any disclosure
to employees of any of the Acquired Companies, to the public or otherwise
regarding the Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the Tender and Voting Agreement, unless (a) Parent
shall have been given the opportunity to review and comment upon such
disclosure and shall have approved such disclosure or (b) such disclosure is
required by applicable Law.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6.7 Resignation of Officers and Directors.

 

 

The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain and deliver to
Parent on or immediately following the acceptance of shares of Company Common
Stock pursuant to the Offer the resignation of sufficient directors of each
of the Acquired Companies in order that Parent shall have proportionate
representation on the boards of directors as provided in Section 1.3.

 

 

6.8 General Cooperation.

 

 

During the Pre-Closing Period, the Acquired Companies will use their
reasonable best efforts to operate their businesses in such a manner as to
achieve a smooth transition consistent with the respective business interests
of the Acquired Companies and Parent. In this regard, the Acquired Companies
and Parent agree that they will enter into good-faith discussions concerning
the businesses of the Acquired Companies, including but not limited to
personnel policies and procedures, and other operational matters.

TERMINATION

 

 

8.1 Termination.

 

 

This Agreement may be terminated prior to the Offer Closing Date or the
Effective Time, as set forth below, by action taken or authorized by the
board of directors of the party or parties effecting such termination,
whether before or after the Required Company Shareholder Vote, for any reason
provided below:

 

 

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

 

 

(b) prior to the Effective Time, by either Parent or the Company if a court
of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Body shall have issued a
final and non-appealable order, decree or ruling, or shall have taken any
other action, having the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the acceptance of shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to the Offer or the Merger or making consummation of the Offer or
the Merger illegal; provided, however, that in the case of a restraining
order, injunction or other order, each of the parties shall have used its
reasonable best efforts to prevent the entry of any such restraining order,
injunction or other order and to appeal as promptly as possible any
restraining order, injunction or other order that may be entered;

 

 

(c) prior to the Offer Closing Date, by either Parent or the Company if the
acceptance for payment of shares of Company Common Stock equal to or in
excess of the Minimum Condition pursuant to the Offer shall not have occurred
by the earlier of (i) the expiration of the Offer in accordance with its
terms as a result of a failure of any of the conditions of the Offer, or (ii)
the close of business on June 15, 2010 (the "Drop Dead Date"); provided,
however, that a party shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.1(c) if the failure of the acceptance for payment
of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer by the close
of business on the Drop Dead Date was caused by the intentional failure on
the part of such party to perform its obligations under this Agreement;

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) prior to the Offer Closing Date, by Parent if (i) the Company shall not
have performed and complied, in all material respects, with each covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement and required to be performed or
complied with by it, or (ii) if any of the representations and warranties of
the Company set forth in this Agreement (which for purposes of this Section
8.1(d) shall be read as though none of them contained any qualifiers such as
"Material Adverse Effect," "in all material respects" or other materiality
qualifiers) shall not have been true and correct as of the date of this
Agreement and as of the then scheduled expiration date of the Offer (as it
may be extended in accordance with the terms hereof) with the same force and
effect as though made as of such date of termination pursuant to this clause
(or as of the date when made in the case of any representation and warranty
which specifically relates to an earlier date), except where the failure of
such representations and warranties to be true and correct, individually or
in the aggregate, would not be a Company Material Adverse Effect; provided,
however, if such failure to perform or comply or inaccuracy of
representations and warranties is curable by the Company, then Parent may not
terminate the Agreement under this Section 8.1(d) with respect to a
particular failure to perform or comply or inaccuracy of representations
and warranties prior to or during the ten-Business Day period commencing
upon delivery by Parent of written notice to the Company of such failure to
perform or comply or inaccuracy of representations and warranties, so long as
the Company continues to exercise its reasonable best efforts to cure such
failure to perform or comply or inaccuracy of representations and warranties
during such ten-Business Day period;

 

 

(e) prior to the Offer Closing Date, by the Company if: (i) any of
Parent's representations and warranties contained in this Agreement shall
fail to be true and correct as of the date of this Agreement, or as of a date
subsequent to the date of this Agreement (as if made on such subsequent date)
(except to the extent such representations and warranties expressly relate to
an earlier date, in which case such representations and warranties shall not
be true and correct as of such earlier date), except where such failure does
not have a material adverse effect on the ability of Parent or Acquisition
Co. to consummate the Offer or the Merger; or (ii) Parent shall not have
complied with, in all material respects, Parent's covenants contained in this
Agreement, except where such noncompliance does not have a material adverse
effect on the ability of Parent or Acquisition Co. to consummate the Offer or
the Merger; provided, however, if such inaccuracy or breach is curable by
Parent, then the Company may not terminate this Agreement under this Section
8.1(e) with respect to a particular inaccuracy or breach prior to or during
the ten-business-day period commencing upon delivery by the Company of
written notice to Parent of such inaccuracy or breach, so long as Parent
continues to exercise its reasonable best efforts to cure such inaccuracy or
breach within such ten-business-day period; or

 

 

(f) prior to the Offer Closing Date, by Parent if the Company's board of
directors has authorized the Company to enter into a binding written
agreement regarding an Alternative Transaction Proposal (it being understood
that this Section 8.1(f) does not grant to the Company any right to take such
action) or if the Company\'s board of directors withdraws or modifies in a
manner adverse to Parent the Company Board Recommendation or fails to
reconfirm its recommendation within 15 business days after a written request
to do so, or approves or recommends any Alternative Transaction Proposal in
respect of the Company; or

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(g) prior to the Offer Closing Date, by the Company if (i) the Company's
board of directors determines that an Alternative Transaction Proposal
constitutes a Company Superior Proposal, (ii) the Company's board of
directors authorizes the Company to enter into a binding written agreement
regarding such Alternative Transaction Proposal (provided that the Company
complies with provisions of this Agreement including Section 5.3), (iii) the
Company provides information to Parent regarding such Alternative Transaction
Proposal as reasonably requested by Parent, (iv) the Company notifies Parent
in writing that the Company\'s board of directors has determined that such
Alternative Transaction Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal and
intends to authorize the Company to enter into a binding written agreement
with respect thereto (v) within five business days of receipt of such written
notification by Parent, Parent does not make an offer that the Company's
board of directors determines, in good faith after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and independent financial adviser, to be at least as
favorable to the Company's shareholders as the Company Superior Proposal) (it
being understood that the Company shall not enter into any binding agreement
during such five-business-day period), and (vi) the Company pays the
Termination Fee at or prior to the termination of this Agreement;
provided, however, that in the event that the determination by the Company's
board of directors that such Alternative Transaction Proposal constitutes a
Company Superior Proposal is made less than five business days prior to
the scheduled expiration date of the Offer, Parent shall have the right, in
its sole discretion, to either (A) reduce the five-day period described above
or (B) extend the Offer, in either case so that such five-day period will
end one day prior to the expiration date of the Offer (and the Company
hereby consents to any such action by Parent including any such extension of
the expiration date of the Offer); or

 

 

(h) by the Company if Parent or Acquisition Co. shall have (i) failed to
commence the Offer within ten business days of the date hereof (assuming that
the Company has timely complied with its obligations to cooperate with Parent
and Acquisition Co. in connection with the Offer), or (ii) failed to pay
pursuant to the Offer and in breach of this Agreement for shares of Company
Common Stock validly tendered and accepted for payment in the Offer by
Acquisition Co.

 

 

8.2 Effect of Termination.

 

 

If this Agreement is terminated as provided in Section 8.1, it shall be of no
further force or effect; provided, however, that (i) Section 8.2, Section 8.3
and Article 9 (and the Confidentiality, Non-disclosure and
Exclusive Negotiation Agreement, as defined below) shall survive the
termination of this Agreement, and shall remain in full force and effect,
(ii) the termination of this Agreement and the Tender and Voting Agreement
shall not relieve any party from any liability for fraud or from any
liability for any intentional or willful breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant, obligation or other provision contained in this
Agreement, and (iii) no termination of this Agreement shall in any way affect
any of the parties' rights or obligations with respect to any shares of
Company Common Stock accepted for payment and paid for pursuant to the Offer
prior to such termination. For purposes hereof, "Confidentiality, Non-
disclosure and Exclusive Negotiation Agreement" shall mean that certain
Confidentiality, Non-disclosure and Exclusive Negotiation Agreement dated as
of December 10, 2009, as amended, by and between Parent and the Company.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8.3 Expenses; Termination Fees.

 

 

(a) Except as set forth in this Section 8.3, all fees and expenses incurred
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses, whether or not
the Offer or the Merger is consummated; provided, however, that Parent and
the Company shall share equally all fees for the filing of any notice or
other document under any applicable antitrust law or regulation, including
the filing with the United States Department of Justice and Federal Trade
Commission pursuant to the HSR Act.

 

 

(b) If this Agreement is terminated (i) by Parent or Acquisition Co. pursuant
to Section 8.1(f), or (ii) by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(g); then
the Company shall pay to Parent substantially concurrently with such
termination, in the case of a termination by the Company, or within two (2)
Business Days thereafter in the case of a termination by Parent, the
Termination Fee.

 

 

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(d)
by reason of a breach by the Company of any representation, warranty or
covenant of the Company contained in this Agreement that the Company shall
have failed to cure in accordance with the notice and cure provisions of
Section 8.1(d), the Company shall promptly reimburse Parent for its and
Acquisition\'s reasonable out-of-pocket fees, costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. In
the event that (i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(d) by
reason of a breach by the Company of any representation, warranty or covenant
of the Company contained in this Agreement that the Company shall have failed
to cure in accordance with the notice and cure provisions of Section
8.1(d), (ii) prior to such termination an Alternative Transaction Proposal
shall have been publicly disclosed or otherwise communicated to the Company
or the Company\'s board of directors and not withdrawn, and (iii) within
six (6) months after such termination, the Company consummates a
transaction contemplated by any Alternative Transaction Proposal, then the
Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee (less any amount previously
paid pursuant to this Section 8.3(c)) on the date no later than two (2)
Business Days after the consummation of a transaction that constitutes an
Alternative Transaction Proposal; provided, however that in no event shall a
transaction engaged in by the Company during such six month period obligate
the Company to pay the Termination Fee if (x) the Company\'s shareholders
constitute at least sixty percent (60%) of the equity holders of the
surviving entity in such transaction and (y) such transaction was not the
Alternative Transaction Proposal publicly disclosed or otherwise communicated
to the Board of Directors prior to the termination of this Agreement. For
purposes of the immediately preceding sentence, the term
"Alternative Transaction Proposal" shall have the meaning assigned to such
term in Section 5.3 except that the references to "ten percent (10%)"
therein shall be deemed to be references to "a majority."

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(e)
by reason of a breach by Parent or Acquisition Co. of any representation,
warranty or covenant of Parent or Acquisition Co. contained in this Agreement
that Parent or Acquisition shall have failed to cure in accordance with the
notice and cure provisions of Section 8.1(e), Parent shall promptly reimburse
Company for Company\'s reasonable out-of-pocket fees, costs and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

 

(e) In the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(h)(ii)
a fee in immediately available United States Dollars in the amount of three
million three hundred and seventythree thousand dollars ($3,373,000.00) shall
be paid by the Parent to the Company within two (2) Business Days of
termination.

 

 

(f) For purposes of this Agreement, "Termination Fee" shall mean a fee in
immediately available United States Dollars equal to three million three
hundred and seventythree thousand dollars ($3,373,000.00).

 

 

(g) Company acknowledges and agrees that the agreements contained in this
Section 8.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, that the Termination Fee is not a penalty but rather liquidated
damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and Acquisition
Co. in the circumstances where such fee is payable to Parent, and that,
without these agreements, Parent would not have entered into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay when due any amount payable under
this Section 8.3, then: (i) the Company shall reimburse Parent for all costs
and expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred in
connection with the collection of such overdue amount and the enforcement by
Parent of its rights under this Section 8.3; and (ii) the Company shall pay
to Parent interest on such overdue amount (for the period commencing as of
the date such overdue amount was originally required to be paid and ending on
the date such overdue amount is actually paid to Parent in full) at a rate
per annum equal to 300 basis points over the "prime rate" (as announced by
PNC Bank, N.A. or any successor thereto) in effect on the date such overdue
amount was originally required to be paid.

 

 

(h) If the Parent fails to pay when due the fee set forth at Section 8.3(e)
then (i) Parent shall reimburse Company for all costs and expenses (including
fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred in connection with the collection
of such overdue amount and the enforcement by Company of its rights under
this Section 8.3 and (ii) the Parent shall pay to Company interest on such
overdue amount, computed in the same manner as in Section 8.3(g)(ii).

and assigns; provided, however, that neither this Agreement nor any of the
Company's rights hereunder may be assigned by the Company without the prior
written consent of Parent, and any attempted assignment of this Agreement or
any of such rights by the Company without such consent shall be void and of
no effect; provided, further, that Parent may assign this Agreement to any
direct or indirect subsidiary of Parent without the prior written consent of
the Company, but any such assignment shall not relieve Parent of any of its
obligations hereunder. Any assignment prohibited under this Section 9.11
shall be null and void.

enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other situation or
in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction or other authority declares that any term or provision
hereof is invalid, void or unenforceable, the parties agree that the court
making such determination shall have the power to reduce the scope, duration,
area or applicability of the term or provision, to delete specific words or
phrases, or to replace any invalid, void or unenforceable term or provision
with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest
to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or
provision.

ANNEX I

 

 

CONDITIONS OF THE OFFER

 

 

Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings set
forth in the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Agreement") of which this
Annex I is a part. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer,
Acquisition Co. shall not be required to accept for payment or, subject to
any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule
14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act (relating to Acquisition Co.'s obligation to
pay for or return tendered shares of Company Common Stock promptly after
termination or withdrawal of the Offer), pay for, and may delay the
acceptance for payment of or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations
of the SEC, the payment for, any tendered shares of Company Common Stock, and
may amend the Offer consistent with the terms of the Agreement or terminate
the Offer and not accept for payment any tendered shares of Company Common
Stock, if (i) the Minimum Condition shall not have been satisfied at the time
of expiration of the Offer (as the same may be extended pursuant to the
Agreement), or (ii) on any scheduled expiration date any of the following
events or circumstances shall occur or exist:

 

 

      

(a)

    |  

the  waiting period (or any extension thereof) applicable to the Offer or
the  Merger under the HSR Act shall not have expired or been  terminated;

    
---|--- 
 

 

 

      

(b)

    |  

any  waiting period applicable to the Offer or the Merger under any
applicable  foreign antitrust or competition-related legal requirements shall
not have  expired or been terminated, and any consent required under any
applicable  foreign antitrust or competition-related legal requirement in
connection  with the Offer or the Merger shall not have been obtained or not
be in  full force and effect;

    
---|--- 
 

 

 

      

(c)

    |  

any  event that has had or would reasonably be expected to result in a
Company  Material Adverse Effect;

    
---|--- 
 

 

 

      

(d)

    |  

(i)  any general suspension of trading in, or limitation on prices for, 
securities on the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq Global Select Market, 
(ii) a declaration of a banking moratorium or any suspension of  payments in
respect of banks in the United States or any limitation by  federal or state
authorities on the extension of credit by lending  institutions, or a
disruption of or material adverse change in either the  syndication market
for credit facilities or the financial, banking or  capital markets that have
a disproportionate adverse effect on the Company  and its Subsidiaries taken
as a whole relative to other industry  participants, or (iii) a commencement
of war or armed hostilities (other  than a continuation of such wars,
conflicts or actions in which the United  States armed forces were engaged as
of the date of the Agreement) directly  involving the United States or any
other jurisdiction in which the Company  or any of the Company\'s
Subsidiaries has material assets or operations,  provided that such action
results in a Company Material Adverse Effect or  materially or adversely
affects or delays the consummation of the  Offer;

    
---|--- 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

      

(e)

    |  

any  of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in the 
Agreement (without giving effect to any materiality or similar  qualification
contained therein) shall not be true and correct, as of the  date of this
Agreement or as of a date subsequent to the date of this  Agreement as if
made on such subsequent date, except to the extent the  failure of any such
representations and warranties to be true and correct  (without giving effect
to any materiality or similar qualification  contained therein), taken
together in their entirety, would not reasonably  be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect; provided, however, that  any such breach
capable of being cured has not in fact been cured prior to  the initial
expiration date of the Offer (or such later date upon which  the Offer shall
expire in accordance with Section  1.1(d));

    
---|--- 
 

 

 

      

(f)

    |  

the  Company shall not have performed and complied, in all material
respects,  with each covenant or agreement contained in the Agreement and
required to  be performed or complied with by it and such failure would
reasonably be  expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect and such
failure is  incapable of being cured or has not been cured during the grace
period  described in the proviso below; provided, however, if  such breach
is curable by the Company, then Parent may not terminate the  Agreement under
Section 8.1(d) of the Agreement with respect to a  particular breach prior to
or during the ten-business-day period  commencing upon delivery by Parent of
written notice to the Company of  such breach, so long as the Company
continues to exercise commercially  reasonable efforts to cure such breach
during such ten-business-day  period;

    
---|--- 
 

 

 

      

(g)

    |  

any  temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or
other  order preventing the consummation of the Offer or the Merger or any of
the  other transactions contemplated by the Agreement shall be pending or
shall  have been issued by any court of competent jurisdiction and remain
in  effect, or there shall be any Law enacted or deemed applicable by a 
Governmental Body to the Offer or the Merger or any of the other 
transactions contemplated by the Agreement that makes consummation of the 
Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the 
Agreement illegal;

    
---|--- 
 

 

 

      

(h)

    |  

any  antitrust regulator or body having decided to take, institute,
implement  or threaten any action proceeding, suit, investigation, enquiry
or  reference, or having required any action to be taken or otherwise
having  done anything or having enacted, made or proposed any statute,
regulation,  decision, order or change to published practice or there would 
be outstanding any statute, regulation, decision or order which  would or
might:

    
---|--- 
 

 

 

      

1.

    |  

impose  any limitation on, or result in a delay in, the ability of Parent
or  Acquisition Co. directly or indirectly to acquire or hold or to
exercise  effectively all or any rights of ownership in respect of shares or
other  securities (or the equivalent) in the Company or its Subsidiaries or
on  the ability of Parent directly or indirectly to hold or exercise 
effectively any rights of ownership in respect of shares or other  securities
(or the equivalent) in, or to exercise management control over,  the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, or

    
---|--- 
 

 

 

      

2.

    |  

require  Parent, Company or Acquisition Co. to divest any of their 
respective assets or businesses in connection with the Offer  and the Merger
or any of the transactions contemplated by the  Agreement;

    
---|--- 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

      

(i)

    |  

the  failure of the Company to obtain any necessary consent to the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement required by the Contracts with
the  Company\'s vendors identified in writing by the Parent to the Company on
or  prior to the date of this Agreement; or

    
---|--- 
 

 

 

      

(j)

    |  

the  Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its  terms.

    
---|--- 
 

 

 

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Acquisition
Co. and (except for the Minimum Condition) may be waived by Parent and
Acquisition Co., in whole or in part at any time and from time to time, in
the sole discretion of Parent and Acquisition Co. The failure by Parent or
Acquisition Co. at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not
be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right shall be deemed an
ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and from time to time.
