                 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION

        THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION ("Agreement") is
made and entered into as of July 20, 2000, by and among QUOKKA SPORTS, INC., a
Delaware corporation ("Parent"), and TOTAL SPORTS, INC., a Delaware corporation
(the "Company"). Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in
Exhibit A.

                                    RECITALS

        A.     Parent and the Company intend to effect a merger of the Company
into Parent in accordance with this Agreement and the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the "Merger"). Upon consummation of the Merger, Parent will be
the surviving corporation, and the Company will cease to exist.

        B.     It is intended that the Merger qualify as a tax-free
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). For financial reporting purposes, it is
intended that the Merger be treated as a "purchase."

        C.     The respective boards of directors of Parent and the Company have
approved this Agreement and approved the Merger.

        D.     In order to induce Parent to enter into this Agreement and to
consummate the Merger, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company are executing voting agreements
(the "Company Stockholder Voting Agreements"). In order to induce the Company to
enter into this Agreement and to consummate the Merger, concurrently with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, certain stockholders of Parent are
executing voting agreements (the "Parent Stockholder Voting Agreements").

        E.     In order to induce Parent to enter into this Agreement,
concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, certain
employees of the Company are entering into new or amended Employment and
Non-Competition Agreements.

                                    AGREEMENT

        The parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as
follows:

SECTION 1. DESCRIPTION OF TRANSACTION

        1.1 MERGER OF THE COMPANY INTO PARENT. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in
Section 1.3), the Company will be merged with and into Parent, the separate
existence of the Company will cease and Parent will be the surviving corporation
in the Merger.

        1.2 EFFECT OF THE MERGER. The Merger will have the effects set forth in
this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the "DGCL").


<PAGE>   8

        1.3 CLOSING; EFFECTIVE TIME. The consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the "Closing") will take place at the offices of
Cooley Godward LLP, One Maritime Plaza, 20th Floor, San Francisco, California,
at 10:00 a.m. on a date to be mutually agreed between Parent and the Company
(the "Closing Date"), which date will be no later than the fifth business day
after the satisfaction or waiver of the last to be satisfied or waived of the
conditions set forth in Sections 6 and 7 (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction
or waiver of such conditions). Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, a
certificate of merger satisfying the applicable requirements of the DGCL will be
duly executed by the Company and concurrently with or as soon as practicable
following the Closing delivered to the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware for filing. The Merger will become effective upon the filing of such
certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the
"Effective Time").

        1.4 CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS; DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS. As
of the Effective Time:

               (a) the certificate of incorporation of the surviving corporation
in the Merger will be the certificate of incorporation of Parent as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time;

               (b) the Bylaws of the surviving corporation in the Merger will be
the Bylaws of Parent as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time; and

               (c) the directors and officers of the surviving corporation in
the Merger will be the respective individuals who are directors and officers of
Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time.

        1.5 CONVERSION OF SHARES.

               (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any further action on the part of Parent, the Company or any stockholder of the
Company:

                      (i)    any shares of Company Stock then held by the
Company or any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company (or held in the Company's
treasury) will be canceled and retired and will cease to exist, and no
consideration will be delivered in exchange therefor;

                      (ii)   any shares of Company Stock then held by Parent
will be canceled and retired and will cease to exist, and no consideration will
be delivered in exchange therefor; and

                      (iii)  except as provided in clauses (i) and (ii) above
and subject to Sections 1.5(b), 1.5(c) and 1.5(d), the holder of a share of each
class and series of Company Stock then outstanding (other than Dissenting
Shares, as defined in Section 1.11) will be entitled to receive the percentage
interest in the Merger Consideration Shares (a portion of which will be
represented by Escrow Shares) set forth with respect to such class or series of
Company Stock on Exhibit B.

With respect to each class and series of Company Stock, the number of shares or
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock specified in Section 1.5(a)(iii) (as
such fraction may be adjusted


                                       2.
<PAGE>   9

in accordance with this Section 1.5(b)) is referred to as the "Exchange Ratio"
applicable to such class or series of Company Stock.

               (b) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
Time, the outstanding shares of Company Stock or Parent Common Stock are changed
into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split,
division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split,
consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar
transaction, then the Exchange Ratio applicable to each class and series of
Company Stock will be appropriately adjusted.

               (c) If any shares of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time are unvested or are subject to a repurchase option, risk
of forfeiture or other condition under any applicable restricted stock purchase
agreement or other agreement with the Company or under which the Company has any
rights, then the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange for such
shares of Company Stock will also be unvested and subject to the same repurchase
option, risk of forfeiture or other condition, and the certificates representing
such shares of Parent Common Stock may accordingly be marked with appropriate
legends. The Company will take all action that may be necessary to ensure that,
from and after the Effective Time, Parent is entitled to exercise any such
repurchase option or other right set forth in any such restricted stock purchase
agreement or other agreement.

               (d) No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock will be issued in
connection with the Merger, and no certificates or scrip for any such fractional
shares will be issued. Any holder of Company Stock who would otherwise be
entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after
aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to such
holder) will, in lieu of such fraction of a share and, upon surrender of such
holder's Company Stock Certificate(s) (as defined in Section 1.6), be paid in
cash the dollar amount (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest,
determined by multiplying such fraction by the closing price of a share of
Parent Common Stock on the Nasdaq National Market on the date the Merger becomes
effective.

        1.6 CLOSING OF THE COMPANY'S TRANSFER BOOKS. At the Effective Time: (a)
all shares of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
will automatically be canceled and retired and will cease to exist, and all
holders of certificates representing shares of Company Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will cease to have any
rights as stockholders of the Company; and (b) the stock transfer books of the
Company will be closed with respect to all shares of Company Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. No further transfer of any such shares
of Company Stock will be made on such stock transfer books after the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, a valid certificate previously representing
any shares of Company Stock (a "Company Stock Certificate") is presented to the
Exchange Agent (as defined in Section 1.7) or to Parent, such Company Stock
Certificate will be canceled and will be exchanged as provided in Section 1.7.

        1.7 EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES.

               (a) On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent will select a
reputable bank or trust company to act as exchange agent in the Merger (the
"Exchange Agent"). On or prior to the


                                       3.
<PAGE>   10

Effective Time, Parent will deposit with the Exchange Agent (i) certificates
representing the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to this Section
1, and (ii) cash sufficient to make payments in lieu of fractional shares in
accordance with Section 1.5(d). The shares of Parent Common Stock and cash
amounts so deposited with the Exchange Agent, together with any dividends or
distributions received by the Exchange Agent with respect to such shares, are
referred to collectively as the "Exchange Fund."

               (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time,
Parent will deliver or cause to be delivered to Gary Stevenson a certificate
representing the Stevenson Compensation Shares (other than the portion
representing Escrow Shares) and cause the Exchange Agent to mail to the record
holders of Company Stock Certificates (i) a letter of transmittal in customary
form and containing such provisions as Parent may reasonably specify (including
a provision confirming that delivery of Company Stock Certificates will be
effected, and risk of loss and title to Company Stock Certificates will pass,
only upon delivery of such Company Stock Certificates to the Exchange Agent),
and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Company Stock
Certificates in exchange for certificates representing Parent Common Stock. Upon
surrender of a Company Stock Certificate to the Exchange Agent for exchange,
together with a duly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as
may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent or Parent, (1) the holder of
such Company Stock Certificate will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
a certificate representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock
that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of Section
1.5, taking into account the Escrow Shares, as defined below (and cash in lieu
of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock), and (2) the Company Stock
Certificate so surrendered will be canceled. Until surrendered as contemplated
by this Section 1.7(b), each Company Stock Certificate will be deemed, from and
after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive shares of
Parent Common Stock, taking into account the Escrow Shares (and cash in lieu of
any fractional share of Parent Common Stock) as contemplated by Section 1. If
any Company Stock Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent may, in
its discretion and as a condition to the issuance of any certificate
representing Parent Common Stock, require the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Company Stock Certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit and to
deliver a bond (in such sum as Parent may reasonably direct) as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against the Exchange Agent or Parent with
respect to such Company Stock Certificate.

               (c) No dividends or other distributions declared or made with
respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time will
be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate with
respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to
receive in the Merger until such holder surrenders such Company Stock
Certificate in accordance with this Section 1.7 (at which time such holder will
be entitled, subject to the effect of applicable escheat or similar laws, to
receive all such dividends and distributions, without interest).

               (d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed
to holders of Company Stock Certificates as of the date 180 days after the
Closing Date will be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of Company
Stock Certificates who have not theretofore surrendered their Company Stock
Certificates in accordance with this Section 1.7 will thereafter look only to
Parent for satisfaction of their claims for Parent Common Stock, cash in lieu of


                                       4.
<PAGE>   11

fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and any dividends or distributions with
respect to Parent Common Stock.

               (e) Each of the Exchange Agent and Parent will be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of Company Stock such
amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code
or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent such amounts
are so deducted or withheld, such amounts will be treated for all purposes under
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid.

               (f) Parent will not be liable to any holder or former holder of
Company Stock or to any other Person with respect to any shares of Parent Common
Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto), or for any cash
amounts, delivered to any public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property law, escheat law or similar Legal Requirement.

        1.8 ESCROW. Parent will deposit 1,500,000 shares of the Merger
Consideration Shares with the Escrow Agent to be held and disbursed by the
Escrow Agent in accordance with the Escrow Agreement. Each holder of a Company
Stock Certificate and Gary Stevenson (each an "Escrow Stockholder") will be
deemed, without any act of such Escrow Stockholder, to have received and
deposited with the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement a number of
Merger Consideration Shares representing such Escrow Stockholder's proportionate
interest in the Escrow Shares ("Escrow Percentage"). Each Escrow Stockholder's
Escrow Percentage will be determined based on (a) the number of Merger
Consideration Shares issuable hereunder with respect to all Company Stock
Certificates held by such Escrow Stockholder (together, in the case of Gary
Stevenson, with the Stevenson Compensation Shares) divided by (b) the sum of (i)
the aggregate number of Merger Consideration Shares issuable hereunder with
respect to all Company Stock Certificates held by all Escrow Stockholders and
(ii) the Stevenson Compensation Shares. The Escrow Shares will be represented by
a certificate registered in the name of the nominee of the Escrow Agent (with
each Escrow Stockholder being the beneficial owner of such Escrow Stockholder's
Escrow Percentage). To the extent that any dividend or distribution, or other
transaction, with respect to the Escrow Shares results in a liability for Tax,
such Tax liability will be that of the Escrow Stockholders (in proportion to
each Escrow Stockholder's proportionate interest in the Escrow Shares), and not
of Parent or the Company. Any and all voting rights with respect to the Escrow
Shares will be exercisable by the Escrow Stockholders or their authorized agent
as of the Effective Time. Parent, the Company and the Escrow Stockholders hereby
agree and acknowledge that the Escrow Shares will be treated as transferred to
and owned by the Escrow Stockholders as of the Effective Time and at all times
thereafter for all Tax purposes.

        1.9 LOCKUP. Notwithstanding Parent's agreement to register the shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger as provided in Sections 5.1 and
5.5, prior to the expiration of one year after the Closing Date, no share of
Parent Common Stock issued in the Merger (including shares of Parent Common
Stock received upon exercise of Company Warrants assumed or replaced as provided
in Section 5.5) may be sold, transferred, hypothecated, pledged, made the
subject of an equity swap or similar agreement or otherwise transferred
(collectively, a "Disposition") without the prior written consent of Parent,
except as provided in this Section 1.9.


                                       5.
<PAGE>   12

The persons receiving Parent Common Stock in the Merger (including the Stevenson
Compensation Shares) may effect Dispositions as follows: (a) up to an aggregate
of 10% of the shares of Parent Common Stock received by such persons in the
Merger (excluding Escrow Shares) at any time after the Closing Date; (b) up to a
cumulative aggregate of 22% of such shares at any time after the expiration of
90 days after the Closing Date; (c) up to a cumulative aggregate of 47% of such
shares at any time after the expiration of 180 days after the Closing Date; and
(d) up to a cumulative aggregate of 72% of such shares at any time after the
expiration of 270 days after the Closing Date. Within these totals, Gary
Stevenson may effect Dispositions of the Stevenson Compensation Shares as
follows: (a) up to an aggregate of 60% of the Stevenson Compensation Shares
(excluding Escrow Shares) at any time after the Closing Date; (b) up to a
cumulative aggregate of 65% of such shares at any time after the expiration of
90 days after the Closing Date; (c) up to a cumulative aggregate of 75% of such
shares at any time after the expiration of 180 days after the Closing Date; and
(d) up to a cumulative aggregate of 85% of such shares at any time after the
expiration of 270 days after the Closing Date. The maximum number of Stevenson
Compensation Shares that are permitted to be disposed of in each period will
reduce the aggregate number of other Merger Consideration Shares that are
permitted to be disposed of in that period, so that the total of the two equals
the maximum aggregate number of Merger Consideration Shares specified above for
that period. Each person receiving shares of Parent Common Stock in the Merger
(other than the Stevenson Compensation Shares) will be entitled to effect
Dispositions of such person's pro rata share of the maximum total number of
shares (other than the Stevenson Compensation Shares) available to be disposed
of during each period. Promptly after the Closing Date, Parent will determine in
good faith and advise the persons who received Parent Common Stock in the Merger
of the maximum number or percentage of such shares that may be disposed of in
each of the above-described periods. Parent, in its sole discretion, may legend
the certificates representing such shares of Parent Common Stock to give effect
to this Section 1.9 and place stop transfer instructions with Parent's stock
transfer agent to enforce this Section 1.9.

        1.10 CLOSING BALANCE SHEET; MERGER CONSIDERATION ADJUSTMENT.

               (a) As soon as practicable, and in any event within 45 days,
after the Closing, Parent will prepare in good faith, and will cause Parent's
independent auditors to audit, the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as
of the close of business on the Closing Date (the "Closing Balance Sheet") and a
calculation of the amount, if any, by which the Company's Net Deficit (as
defined in Exhibit C) reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet is greater than:

                      (i)    $11,274,730 if the Closing Date is on or prior to
September 30, 2000;

                      (ii)   $11,424,730 if the Closing Date is after September
30, 2000 and on or before October 15, 2000;

                      (iii)  $11,574,730 if the Closing Date is after October
15, 2000 and on or before October 31, 2000;

                      (iv)   $11,724,730 if the Closing Date is after October
31, 2000 and on or before November 15, 2000; or


                                       6.
<PAGE>   13

                      (v)    $11,874,730 if the Closing Date is after November
15, 2000

(the "Merger Consideration Adjustment"). The Closing Balance Sheet will be
prepared in accordance with the principles set forth in Exhibit C. Promptly
after their preparation and review, Parent will deliver copies of the Closing
Balance Sheet and the calculation of the Merger Consideration Adjustment to the
Designated Company Agent. For a period of 45 days thereafter, Parent will allow
the Designated Company Agent and his or her professional advisors, at reasonable
times and on reasonable advance notice, to review, copy and make extracts from
the source documents and work papers relied upon by Parent and its professional
advisors in preparing the Closing Balance Sheet. If the Designated Company Agent
has not given Parent notice of any objection to the Closing Balance Sheet or the
calculation of the Merger Consideration Adjustment (which notice must contain a
statement of the basis of the Designated Company Agent's objection and the
Designated Company Agent's calculation of the Merger Consideration Adjustment)
within 45 days after their delivery to the Designated Company Agent, then the
Closing Date Balance Sheet and calculation of the Merger Consideration
Adjustment in the forms delivered to the Designated Company Agent will be deemed
final upon the expiration of such 45-day period.

               (b) If the Designated Company Agent provides notice of an
objection in accordance with Section 1.10(a), then the issues in dispute and
determination of the Merger Consideration Adjustment will be resolved in
accordance with this Section 1.10(b). First, Parent and the Designated Company
Agent will diligently attempt in good faith to resolve the issues and agree on
the amount of the Merger Consideration Adjustment. If Parent and the Designated
Company Agent are unable to resolve all of the issues within 45 days after
Parent's receipt of the Designated Company Agent's objection, then Parent and
the Designated Company Agent will submit the unresolved issues in dispute and
the determination of the Merger Consideration Adjustment to Arthur Andersen LLP,
independent auditors (the "Independent Auditors"), for final resolution. If
issues in dispute are submitted to the Independent Auditors for resolution,
then: (i) each party will furnish to the Independent Auditors such work papers
and other documents and information relating to the disputed issues as the
Independent Auditors may request and as are available to that party and will be
afforded the opportunity to present to the Independent Auditors any material
relating to the determination and to discuss the determination with the
Independent Auditors; (ii) the determination by the Independent Auditors of the
Merger Consideration Adjustment, as set forth in a written notice setting forth
such determination delivered to Parent and the Designated Company Agent by the
Independent Auditors (which will be requested within 30 days after the
submission to them of the issues in dispute), will be final, conclusive and
binding on the parties effective upon the delivery of such notice; and (iii)
Parent will bear the fees and costs of the Independent Auditors in making such
determination, subject to Parent's right to recover from the Escrow Fund: (x)
100% of such fees and costs if the final Merger Consideration Adjustment is
closer to the Merger Consideration Adjustment as calculated by Parent than it is
to the average of that number and the Merger Consideration Adjustment as
calculated by the Designated Company Agent; (y) none of such fees and costs if
the final Merger Consideration Adjustment is closer to the Merger Consideration
Adjustment as calculated by the Designated Company Agent than it is to the
average of that number and the Merger Consideration Adjustment as calculated by
Parent; and (z) 50% of such fees and costs in all other cases.


                                       7.
<PAGE>   14

               (c) At any time after a determination that the Merger
Consideration Adjustment is other than zero becomes final, Parent may deliver to
the Escrow Agent a copy, certified by Parent to be a true copy, of the final
determination thereof, whereupon the Merger Consideration Adjustment as so
delivered will represent an accepted claim under the Escrow Agreement.

        1.11 DISSENTING SHARES.

               (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, the shares of any holder of Company Stock who (i) has the right under
applicable law to demand dissenter's or appraisal rights for such shares, (ii)
has demanded and perfected such rights under applicable law and (iii) as of the
Effective Time, has not effectively withdrawn or lost such rights ("Dissenting
Shares"), will not be converted into Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section
1.5, but the holder thereof will only be entitled to such rights as are granted
by applicable law.

               (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any holder of shares of
Company Stock who has the right under applicable law to demand and who does
demand appraisal of such shares under applicable law effectively withdraws or
loses (through failure to perfect or otherwise) the right to appraisal, then, as
of the later of the Effective Time and the occurrence of such event, such
holder's shares will automatically be converted into and represent only Parent
Common Stock in accordance with Section 1.5.

               (c) The Company will give Parent (i) prompt written notice of any
written demands for appraisal, withdrawals of demands for appraisal and any
other instruments served on the Company pursuant to applicable law and (ii) the
opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands
for appraisal under applicable law. The Company will not voluntarily make any
payment with respect to any demands for appraisal and will not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent, settle or offer to settle any such demands.

        1.12 TAX CONSEQUENCES. For federal income tax purposes, the Merger is
intended to constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the
Code. The parties to this Agreement hereby adopt this Agreement as a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the
United States Treasury Regulations.

        1.13 ACCOUNTING TREATMENT. For financial reporting purposes, the Merger
is intended to be treated as a "purchase."

SECTION 2. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

        The Company represents and warrants to Parent as follows:

        2.1 SUBSIDIARIES; DUE ORGANIZATION; ETC.

               (a) The Company has no Subsidiaries, except for the corporations

is qualified to do business as a foreign corporation, and is in good standing,
under the laws of all jurisdictions where the nature of its business requires
such qualification.

        2.2 CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS; RECORDS. The Company has

board of directors of the Company. There have been no formal meetings or other
proceedings of the stockholders of the Company, the board of directors of the
Company or any committee of the board of directors of the Company that are not
fully reflected in all material respects in such minutes or other records. There
has not been any material violation of any of the provisions of the Company's
articles of incorporation or bylaws, and the Company has not taken any action

or will be filed on or before the applicable due date (including any extensions
of such due date), and (ii) has been, or will be when filed, complete and
correct in all material respects. All amounts shown on the Acquired Corporation
Returns to be due on or before the Closing Date have been or will be paid on or
before the Closing Date. The Company has delivered to Parent accurate and
complete copies of the Acquired Corporation Returns previously filed.

               (b) The Unaudited Interim Balance Sheet fully accrues all actual
and contingent liabilities for Taxes with respect to all periods through May 31,
2000 in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

               (c) No Acquired Corporation Return has ever been examined or
audited by any Governmental Body or other Person. No extension or waiver of the
limitation period applicable to any of the Acquired Corporation Returns has been
granted (by the Company or any other Person), and no such extension or waiver
has been requested from any Acquired Corporation.

               (d) No claim or Legal Proceeding asserting an actual or potential
Tax liability is pending or, to the Company's Knowledge, has been overtly
threatened against or with respect to any Acquired Corporation in respect of any
Tax. There are no unsatisfied liabilities for Taxes (including liabilities for
interest, additions to tax and penalties thereon and related expenses) with
respect to any notice of deficiency or similar document received by any Acquired
Corporation with respect to any Tax (other than liabilities for Taxes asserted
under any such notice of deficiency or similar document which are being
contested in good faith by the Acquired Corporations and with respect to which
adequate reserves for payment have been established on the Unaudited Interim
Balance Sheet). There are no material liens for Taxes upon any of the assets of
any of the Acquired Corporations except liens for current Taxes not yet due and
payable. None of the Acquired Corporations has entered into or become bound by
any agreement or consent pursuant to Section 341(f) of the Code (or any
comparable provision under state or foreign Tax laws).

               (e) Except as set forth in Part 2.14(e) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, none of the Acquired Corporations is, or has ever been, a party to or
bound by any tax indemnity agreement, tax sharing agreement, tax allocation
agreement or similar Contract. There is no agreement, plan, arrangement or other
Contract covering any employee or independent contractor or former employee or
independent contractor of any of the Acquired Corporations that, considered
individually or considered collectively with any other such Contracts, will, or
could reasonably be expected to, give rise directly or indirectly to the payment
of any amount that would not be deductible pursuant to Section 280G or Section
162 of the Code (or any comparable provision of state or foreign Tax laws).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties have agreed that the
non-deductibility of any payment by reason of Section 280G or Section 162 of the
Code (or any comparable provision of state or foreign Tax laws) would not in any
event (i) constitute Damages, or otherwise give rise to any claim by Parent
against the Company or the Escrow Fund, under this Agreement, or (ii) be taken
into account in determining whether the condition set forth in Section 6.1 has
been satisfied.

stock purchase, stock option, severance pay, termination pay, death and
disability benefits, hospitalization, medical, life or other insurance, flexible

Corporations for the benefit of any current or former employee of any of the
Acquired Corporations. Part 2.15(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule also

Corporations is required to establish any reserve or make any contribution for
the benefit of any current or former employee located in any jurisdiction
outside of the United States.

               (b) Part 2.15(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule includes any
employee pension benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(2) of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), or any similar
pension benefit plan under the laws of any foreign jurisdiction, whether or not
excluded from coverage under specific Titles or Subtitles of ERISA for the
benefit of employees or former employees of any of the Acquired Corporations (a
"Pension Plan").

               (c) Part 2.15(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule includes any
employee welfare benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA or any
similar welfare benefit plan under the laws of any foreign jurisdiction, whether
or not excluded from coverage under specific Titles or Subtitles of ERISA), for
the benefit of any current or former employees or directors of any of the
Acquired Corporations (a "Welfare Plan").

               (d) With respect to each Employee Plan, the Company has delivered
to Parent: (i) an accurate and complete copy of such Employee Plan (including
all amendments thereto); (ii) an accurate and complete copy of the annual

               (e) None of the Acquired Corporations is or has ever been
required to be treated as a single employer with any other Person under Section
4001(b)(1) of ERISA or Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code, except for
the Acquired Corporations. None of the Acquired Corporations has ever been a
member of an "affiliated service group" within the meaning of


                                      23.
<PAGE>   30

Section 414(m) of the Code. None of the Employee Plans identified in the Company
Disclosure Schedule is a multiemployer plan (within the meaning of Section 3(37)
of ERISA). None of the Acquired Corporations has ever made a complete or partial
withdrawal from a multiemployer plan, as such term is defined in Section 3(37)
of ERISA, resulting in "withdrawal liability," as such term is defined in
Section 4201 of ERISA (without regard to subsequent reduction or waiver of such
liability under either Section 4207 or 4208 of ERISA).

               (f) None of the Acquired Corporations has any plan or commitment
to create any Welfare Plan or any Pension Plan, or to modify or change any
existing Welfare Plan or Pension Plan (other than to comply with applicable law)
in a manner that would affect any current or former employee or director of any
of the Acquired Corporations.

               (g) No Employee Plan provides death, medical or health benefits
(whether or not insured) with respect to any current or former employee or
director of any of the Acquired Corporations after any termination of service of
such employee or director (other than benefit coverage mandated by applicable
law, including coverage provided pursuant to Section 4980B of the Code).

               (h) With respect to any Employee Plan constituting a group health
plan within the meaning of Section 4980B(g)(2) of the Code, the provisions of
Section 4980B of the Code ("COBRA") have been complied with in all material
respects. Part 2.15(h) of the Company Disclosure Schedule describes all
obligations of the Acquired Corporations as of the date of this Agreement under
any of the provisions of COBRA.

               (i) Each of the Employee Plans has been operated and administered
in all material respects in accordance with its terms and with applicable Legal
Requirements, including ERISA, the Code and applicable foreign Legal
Requirements. The Acquired Corporations have performed, in all material
respects, all of their respective obligations under the Employee Plans.

               (j) Each of the Employee Plans intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from
the Internal Revenue Service, and nothing has occurred that would adversely
affect such determination.

               (k) Except as set forth in Part 2.15(k) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, neither the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement, nor
the consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, will result in any bonus, golden parachute, severance or other
payment or obligation to any current or former employee or director of any of
the Acquired Corporations (whether or not under any Employee Plan), or
materially increase the benefits payable or provided under any Employee Plan, or
result in any acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such
benefits. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing (and except as set
forth in Part 2.15(k) of the Company Disclosure Schedule), the consummation of
the Merger will not result in the acceleration of vesting of any unvested
Company Options.

               (l) Part 2.15(l) of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a
list of all salaried employees of each of the Acquired Corporations as of the
date of this Agreement, and correctly reflects, in all material respects, their
salaries, any other compensation payable to them


                                      24.
<PAGE>   31

(including compensation payable pursuant to bonus, deferred compensation or
commission arrangements but excluding Company Options), their dates of
employment and their positions. None of the Acquired Corporations is a party to
any collective bargaining contract or other Contract with a labor union
involving any of its employees. Except as set forth in Part 2.15(l) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, all of the employees of the Acquired Corporations
are "at will" employees.

               (m) Part 2.15(m) of the Company Disclosure Schedule identifies
each employee of any of the Acquired Corporations who, as of the date of this
Agreement, is not fully available to perform work because of long-term
disability or other leave and sets forth the basis of such disability or leave
and the anticipated date of return to full service.

               (n) Each of the Acquired Corporations is in compliance in all
material respects with all applicable Contracts relating to employment,
employment practices, wages, bonuses and terms and conditions of employment,
including employee compensation matters, except as will not at any time be
deemed to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Acquired Corporations.

               (o) The Acquired Corporations, taken as a whole, have good labor
relations. To the Company's Knowledge, there are no facts indicating that (i)
the consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement will have a material adverse effect on the labor relations of the
Acquired Corporations taken as a whole, or (ii) as of the date of this
Agreement, any of the employees of any of the Acquired Corporations identified
in Part 2.15(o) of the Company Disclosure Schedule intends to terminate his or
her employment with the Acquired Corporation with which such employee is
employed.

        2.16 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. Each of the Acquired Corporations (i) is in
compliance in all material respects with all applicable Environmental Laws and
(ii) possesses all permits and other Governmental Authorizations required under
applicable Environmental Laws, and is in compliance with the terms and
conditions thereof in all material respects. None of the Acquired Corporations
has received any notice or other communication (in writing or otherwise),
whether from a Governmental Body, citizens group, employee or otherwise, that
alleges that any of the Acquired Corporations is not in compliance in all
material respects with any Environmental Law, and, to the Company's Knowledge,
there are no circumstances that could reasonably be expected to prevent or
interfere with the Acquired Corporations' future compliance in all material
respects with any existing Environmental Law. To the Company's Knowledge, (a)
all property that is leased to, controlled by or used by any of the Acquired
Corporations, and all surface water, groundwater and soil associated with or
adjacent to such property, is free of any material environmental contamination
of any nature, (b) none of the property leased to, controlled by or used by any
of the Acquired Corporations contains any underground storage tanks, asbestos,
equipment using PCBs, underground injection wells, and (c) none of the property
leased to, controlled by or used by any of the Acquired Corporations contains
any septic tanks in which process wastewater or any Materials of Environmental
Concern have been disposed. No Acquired Corporation has ever sent or
transported, or arranged to send or transport, any Materials of Environmental
Concern to a site that, pursuant to any applicable Environmental Law (i) has
been placed on the "National Priorities List" of hazardous waste sites or any
similar state list, (ii) is otherwise designated or identified as a potential
site for remediation, cleanup, closure or other environmental remedial activity,
or (iii) is subject to a Legal Requirement to take


                                      25.

or to make payment for the cost of cleaning up any site.

        2.17 INSURANCE. Part 2.17 of the Company Disclosure Schedule identifies
all insurance policies maintained by, at the expense of or for the benefit of
the Acquired Corporations and identifies any material claims thereunder that
have been made within two years prior to the date of this Agreement or have not
been fully adjusted. The Company has delivered to Parent accurate and complete
copies of the insurance policies and self insurance programs and arrangements
relating to the business, assets and operations of the Acquired Corporations.

other communication regarding any actual or overtly threatened (a) cancellation
or invalidation of any insurance policy, (b) refusal of any coverage or
rejection of any material claim under any insurance policy, or (c) material
adjustment in the amount of the premiums payable with respect to any insurance
policy.

        2.18 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS.. Except as set forth in Part 2.18 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule and except with respect to the Bridge Financing:

        2.19 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS; ORDERS.

               (a) Except as set forth in Part 2.19(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, there is no pending Legal Proceeding, and, to the Company's Knowledge,
no Person has overtly threatened to commence any Legal Proceeding: (i) that
involves any of the Acquired Corporations or any of the assets owned or used by
any of the Acquired Corporations; or any Person whose liability has or may have
been retained or assumed, in any manner, by any of the Acquired Corporations; or
(ii) that challenges, or that could reasonably be expected to have the effect of
preventing, delaying, making illegal or otherwise interfering with, the Merger
or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. To the
Company's Knowledge, except as set forth in Part 2.19(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, no event has occurred, and no claim, dispute or other
condition or circumstance exists, that could reasonably be expected to give rise
to or serve as a basis for the commencement of any such Legal Proceeding, except

Material Adverse Effect on the Acquired Corporations.

<PAGE>   33

               (b) As of the date of this Agreement, except as set forth in Part

               (c) There is no order, writ, injunction, judgment or decree to
which any of the Acquired Corporations, or any of the assets owned or used by
any of the Acquired Corporations, is subject. To the Company's Knowledge, no
officer or key employee of any of the Acquired Corporations is subject to any
order, writ, injunction, judgment or decree that relates to the Acquired
Corporations' businesses or to any assets owned or used by the Acquired
Corporations. To the Company's Knowledge, no officer or other employee of the
Acquired Corporations is subject to any order, writ, injunction, judgment or
decree that prohibits such officer or other employee from engaging in or
continuing any conduct, activity or practice relating to the business of any of
the Acquired Corporations.

        2.20 AUTHORITY; INAPPLICABILITY OF ANTI-TAKEOVER STATUTES; BINDING

accordance with its terms, subject to (i) laws of general application relating
to bankruptcy, insolvency and the relief of debtors, and (ii) rules of law

and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

        2.22 NO EXISTING DISCUSSIONS. None of the Acquired Corporations, and no
Representative of any of the Acquired Corporations, is engaged, directly or

contain any untrue statement by Parent of a material fact or omit to state a

to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) furnish any information regarding any
of the Acquired Corporations to any Person in connection with or in response to
an Acquisition Proposal or an inquiry or indication of interest that could lead
to an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) engage in discussions or negotiations with any
Person with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (iv) approve, endorse or
recommend any Acquisition Proposal or (v) enter into any letter of intent or
similar document or any Contract contemplating or otherwise relating to any
Acquisition Transaction. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Company acknowledges and agrees that any action inconsistent with of any of the
provisions set forth in


                                      39.
<PAGE>   46

the preceding sentence by any Representative of any of the Acquired
Corporations, whether or not such Representative is purporting to act on behalf
of any of the Acquired Corporations, will be deemed to constitute a breach of
this Section 4.3 by the Company.

               (b) The Company will promptly (and in no event later than 24
hours after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, any inquiry or indication of
interest that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal or
any request for nonpublic information) advise Parent orally and in writing of
any Acquisition Proposal, any inquiry or indication of interest that could
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal or any request for
nonpublic information relating to any of the Acquired Corporations (including
the identity of the Person making or submitting such Acquisition Proposal,
inquiry, indication of interest or request, and the terms thereof) that is made
or submitted by any Person during the Pre-Closing Period. The Company will keep
Parent fully informed with respect to the status of any such Acquisition
Proposal, inquiry, indication of interest or request and any modification or
proposed modification thereto.

               (c) The Company will immediately cease and cause to be terminated
any existing discussions with any Person that relate to any Acquisition
Proposal.

               (d) The Company agrees not to release or permit the release of
any Person from, or to waive or permit the waiver of any provision of, any
confidentiality, "standstill" or similar agreement to which any of the Acquired
Corporations is a party or under which any of the Acquired Corporations has any
rights, and will use its best efforts to enforce or cause to be enforced each
such agreement at the request of Parent.

        4.4 OPERATION OF PARENT'S BUSINESS. Except as set forth in Part 4.4 of
the Parent Disclosure Schedule, during the Pre-Closing Period, Parent will not
(without the prior written consent of the Company):

               (a) declare, accrue, set aside or pay any dividend or make any
other distribution in respect of any shares of capital stock, purchase, redeem
or otherwise reacquire, directly or indirectly, any shares of capital stock or
other securities (except for repurchases of Parent Common Stock from former
employees or consultants pursuant to contractual rights to do so);

               (b) issue any capital stock at less than fair market value (other
than (i) pursuant to any Parent employee stock option plans, (ii) upon
conversion or exercise of presently-outstanding securities convertible into or
exercisable for capital stock or (iii) pursuant to presently-outstanding
contractual rights to acquire such capital stock) or permit any of its
Subsidiaries to effect such an issuance, or effect any split of its capital
stock;

               (c) issue any capital stock (other than (i) pursuant to any
Parent employee stock option plans, (ii) upon conversion or exercise of
presently-outstanding securities convertible into or exercisable for capital
stock or (iii) pursuant to presently-outstanding rights to acquire such capital
stock) if the effect of such issuance would be that the Persons that have
executed and delivered to the Company the Parent Stockholder Voting Agreements
would not hold sufficient shares of Parent Common Stock to approve the Merger
and the issuance of Parent Common Stock in the Merger;


                                      40.
<PAGE>   47

               (d) amend or permit the adoption of any amendment to its
certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or effect or become a party to, or
permit any of its Subsidiaries to effect or become a party to, any Acquisition
Transaction;

               (e) take any action that would or would reasonably be expected to
result in (i) any of the conditions to the Merger set forth in Section 7 not
being satisfied or (ii) a material delay in the satisfaction of such conditions.

               (f) agree or commit to take any of the actions described in
clauses "(a)" through "(d)" of this Section 4.4.

SECTION 5. ADDITIONAL COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES

        5.1 FORM S-4 REGISTRATION STATEMENT; JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS;
FORM S-3 REGISTRATION STATEMENT.

               (a) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement,
Parent and the Company will prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus and Parent will prepare and cause to be filed with
the SEC the Form S-4 Registration Statement, in which the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus will be included as a prospectus. Each of Parent and the
Company will use all reasonable efforts to cause the Form S-4 Registration
Statement and the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to comply with the rules and
regulations promulgated by the SEC, to respond promptly to any comments of the
SEC or its staff and to have the Form S-4 Registration Statement declared
effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after it is filed
with the SEC. Parent will use all reasonable efforts to cause the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to Parent's stockholders, and the Company will
use all reasonable efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be
mailed to the Company's stockholders, as promptly as practicable after the Form
S-4 Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act. Each
of the Company and Parent will promptly furnish to the other party all
information concerning such party and its stockholders that may be required or
reasonably requested in connection with any action contemplated by this Section
5.1. If the Company or Parent becomes aware of any information, that should be
disclosed in an amendment or supplement to the Form S-4 Registration Statement
or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, then such party will promptly inform
the other party thereof and will cooperate with such other party in filing such
amendment or supplement with the SEC and, if appropriate, in mailing such
amendment or supplement to the stockholders of the Company and Parent.

               (b) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will use reasonable
efforts to obtain all regulatory approvals needed to ensure that the Parent
Common Stock to be issued in the Merger will be registered or qualified under
the securities law of every jurisdiction of the United States in which any
registered holder of Company Stock has an address of record on the record date
for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the
Company Stockholders' Meeting; provided, however, that Parent will not be
required (i) to qualify to do business as a foreign corporation in any
jurisdiction in which it is not now qualified or (ii) to file a general consent
to service of process in any jurisdiction.


                                      41.
<PAGE>   48

               (c) As promptly as practicable after the date on which it becomes
eligible to register securities on Form S-3, Parent will cause to be filed with
the SEC the Form S-3 Registration Statement to register the resale in brokers'
transactions of the Parent Common Stock received in the Merger by those
stockholders of the Company who will be subject to the resale restrictions set
forth in paragraph (c) of Rule 145 under the Securities Act (the "Rule 145
Sellers"). Parent will use all reasonable efforts to cause the Form S-3
Registration Statement to comply with the rules and regulations promulgated by
the SEC, to respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff and to have
the Form S-3 Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act
as promptly as practicable after it is filed with the SEC and in any event prior
to the Closing Date. The Company will keep the Form S-3 Registration Statement
continuously effective under the Securities Act for a period ending one year
after the Closing and during such period will supplement or amend the Form S-3
Registration Statement if and as required by the Securities Act or the rules and
regulations promulgated by the SEC thereunder.

               (d) As a condition precedent to using the Form S-3 Registration
Statement, each of the Rule 145 Sellers will enter into an agreement with Parent
containing the following provisions:

                      (i)    In the event that (1) there occurs an event
described in paragraph (ii) below or (2) in the reasonable judgment of Parent,
it becomes advisable to suspend use of the prospectus included in the Form S-3
Registration Statement (the "Resale Prospectus") for a discrete period of time
due to pending material corporate developments or similar material events that
have not yet been publicly disclosed and as to which Parent believes public
disclosure will be prejudicial to Parent, Parent will deliver to the Rule 145
Sellers a certificate to such effect, signed by an authorized officer of Parent.
Each of the Rule 145 Sellers will refrain from executing any sales of securities
pursuant to the Resale Prospectus from the time of receipt of such certificate
until such Rule 145 Seller is advised in writing by Parent that the Resale
Prospectus may again be used and has received copies of any additional or
supplemental filings that are incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference
in the Resale Prospectus. Parent will use all reasonable efforts to ensure that
the use of the Resale Prospectus may be resumed as soon as practicable and, in
the case of a pending development or event referred to above, as soon as the
earlier of (1) public disclosure of such pending material corporate development
or similar material event or (2) in the judgment of Parent, public disclosure of
such material corporate development or similar material event would not be
prejudicial to Parent. Parent will be entitled to exercise its right to suspend
use of the Resale Prospectus under this Section 5.1(d)(i) only for a period or
periods not to exceed an aggregate of 30 days in any three-month period or 90
days in any 12-month period.

                      (ii)   The events referred to in the first sentence of
paragraph (i) above are: (i) any request by the SEC for amendments or
supplements to the Form S-3 Registration Statement or the Resale Prospectus or
for additional information; (ii) the issuance by the SEC of any stop order
suspending the effectiveness of the Form S-3 Registration Statement or the
initiation or overt threatening of any proceedings for that purpose; (iii) the
receipt by Parent of any notification with respect to the suspension of the
qualification or exemption from qualification of the Parent Common Stock for
sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or overt threatening of any
proceeding for such purpose; and (iv) the existence of any fact or occurrence of
any event that makes any statement of a material fact in the Form S-3
Registration Statement or the Resale Prospectus or any document incorporated or
deemed to be incorporated by


                                      42.
<PAGE>   49

reference therein untrue or that would require the making of any changes in the
Form S-3 Registration Statement or Resale Prospectus in order that, in the case
of the Form S-3 Registration Statement, it will not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and that in
the case of the Resale Prospectus, it will not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading.

        5.2 COMPANY STOCKHOLDERS' MEETING.

               (a) The Company will take all action necessary under all
applicable Legal Requirements to call, give notice of and hold a meeting of the
holders of Company Stock to vote on a proposal to adopt this Agreement (the
"Company Stockholders' Meeting"). The Company Stockholders' Meeting will be held
as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 Registration Statement is declared
effective under the Securities Act. The Company will ensure that all proxies
solicited in connection with the Company Stockholders' Meeting are solicited in
compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements.

               (b) Subject to Section 5.2(c): (i) the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus will include a statement to the effect that the board of
directors of the Company recommends that the Company's stockholders vote to
adopt this Agreement at the Company Stockholders' Meeting (the recommendation of
the Company's board of directors that the Company's stockholders vote to adopt
this Agreement being referred to as the "Company Board Recommendation"); and
(ii) the Company Board Recommendation will not be withdrawn or modified in a
manner adverse to Parent, and no resolution by the board of directors of the
Company or any committee thereof to withdraw or modify the Company Board
Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent will be adopted or proposed.

               (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section
5.2(b), at any time prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the Required
Company Stockholder Vote, the Company Board Recommendation may be withdrawn or
modified in a manner adverse to Parent if the Company's board of directors
determines in good faith, after having taken into account the written advice of
the Company's outside legal counsel, that the withdrawal or modification of the
Company Board Recommendation is required in order for the Company's board of
directors to comply with its fiduciary obligations to the Company's stockholders
under applicable law.

               (d) The Company's obligation to call, give notice of and hold the
Company Stockholders' Meeting in accordance with Section 5.2(a) will not be
limited or otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure, announcement or
submission of any Acquisition Proposal or by any withdrawal or modification of
the Company Board Recommendation.

        5.3 PARENT STOCKHOLDERS' MEETING.

               (a) Parent will take all action necessary to call, give notice of
and hold a meeting of the holders of Parent Common Stock to vote on the issuance
of Parent Common Stock in the Merger (the "Parent Stockholders' Meeting"). The
Parent Stockholders' Meeting will be held as


                                      43.
<PAGE>   50

promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 Registration Statement is declared
effective under the Securities Act. Parent will ensure that all proxies
solicited in connection with the Parent Stockholders' Meeting are solicited in
compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements.

               (b) Subject to Section 5.3(c): (i) the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus will include a statement to the effect that the board of
directors of Parent recommends that Parent's stockholders vote to approve the
issuance of Parent Common Stock in the Merger (the recommendation of Parent's
board of directors that Parent's stockholders vote to approve the issuance of
Parent Common Stock in the Merger being referred to as the "Parent Board
Recommendation"); and (ii) the Parent Board Recommendation will not be withdrawn
or modified in a manner adverse to the Company, and no resolution by the board
of directors of Parent or any committee thereof to withdraw or modify the Parent
Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to the Company will be adopted or
proposed.

               (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section
5.3(b)(i), at any time prior to the approval of the issuance of Parent Common
Stock in the Merger by the stockholders of Parent, the Parent Board
Recommendation may be withdrawn or modified if the board of directors of Parent
concludes in good faith, after having taken into account the written advice of
Parent's outside legal counsel, that the withdrawal or modification of the
Parent Board Recommendation is required in order for the board of directors of
Parent to comply with its fiduciary obligations to Parent's stockholders under
applicable law.

               (d) Parent's obligation to call, give notice of and hold the
Parent Stockholders' Meeting will not be limited or otherwise affected by any
withdrawal or modification of the Parent Board Recommendation.

        5.4 REGULATORY APPROVALS. Each party will use all reasonable efforts to
file, as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, all notices,
reports and other documents required to be filed by such party with any
Governmental Body with respect to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and to submit promptly any additional
information requested by any such Governmental Body. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Company and Parent will, promptly after the
date of this Agreement, prepare and file the notifications required under the
HSR Act and any applicable foreign antitrust laws or regulations in connection
with the Merger. The Company and Parent will respond as promptly as practicable
to (i) any inquiries or requests received from the Federal Trade Commission or
the Department of Justice for additional information or documentation and (ii)
any inquiries or requests received from any state attorney general, foreign
antitrust authority or other Governmental Body in connection with antitrust or
related matters. Each of the Company and Parent will (1) give the other party
prompt notice of the commencement or overt threat of commencement of any Legal
Proceeding by or before any Governmental Body with respect to the Merger or any
of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (2) keep the other
party informed as to the status of any such Legal Proceeding or threat, and (3)
promptly inform the other party of any communication to or from the Federal
Trade Commission, the Department of Justice or any other Governmental Body
regarding the Merger. Except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Body or by
any Legal Requirement, (a) the Company and Parent will consult and cooperate
with one another, and will consider in good faith the views of one another, in
connection with any analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief,
argument, opinion or proposal made or


                                      44.
<PAGE>   51

submitted in connection with any Legal Proceeding under or relating to the HSR
Act or any other foreign, federal or state antitrust or fair trade law, and (b)
in connection with any such Legal Proceeding, each of the Company and Parent
will permit authorized Representatives of the other party to be present at each
meeting or conference relating to any such Legal Proceeding and to have access
to and be consulted in connection with any document, opinion or proposal made or
submitted to any Governmental Body in connection with any such Legal Proceeding.

        5.5 STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS.

               (a) Subject to Section 5.5(c), at the Effective Time, each
Company Option which is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the
Effective Time, whether or not vested, will be converted into and become an
option to purchase Parent Common Stock, and Parent will assume each such Company
Option in accordance with the terms (as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement) of the stock option plan under which it was issued and the terms of
the stock option agreement by which it is evidenced. Accordingly, from and after
the Effective Time, (i) each Company Option assumed by Parent may be exercised
solely for shares of Parent Common Stock, (ii) the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock subject to each such Company Option will be equal to the number of
shares of Company Stock subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio applicable to the class or
series of Company Stock for which such Company Option was exercisable
immediately prior to the Effective Time, rounding down to the nearest whole
share, (iii) the per-share exercise price under each such Company Option will be
adjusted by dividing the per-share exercise price under such Company Option by
the applicable Exchange Ratio and rounding up to the nearest cent and (iv) any
restriction on the exercise of any such Company Option will continue in full
force and effect and the term, exercisability, vesting schedule and other
provisions of such Company Option will otherwise remain unchanged; provided,
however, that each Company Option assumed by Parent in accordance with this
Section 5.5(a) will, in accordance with its terms, be subject to further
adjustment as appropriate to reflect any stock split, division or subdivision of
shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares,
reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction subsequent to
the Effective Time. The assumption of Company Options provided for in this
Section 5.5(a) is intended to be effected in a manner which is consistent with
Section 424(a) of the Code with respect to Company Options that are intended to
be "incentive stock options." In connection with the assumption or substitution
of Company Options, Parent intends to take such actions as may be necessary to
ensure that, prior to the expiration of one year after the Closing Date, no
shares of Parent Common Stock received upon exercise of assumed or substituted
Company Options may be the subject of a Disposition (as defined in Section 1.9)
without the prior written consent of Parent, except that each optionee may
dispose of: (a) up to an aggregate of 10% of the total number of shares of
Parent Common Stock covered by such options at any time after the Closing Date;
(b) up to a cumulative aggregate of 47% of such shares at any time after the
expiration of 180 days after the Closing Date; and (c) up to a cumulative
aggregate of 72% of such shares at any time after the expiration of 270 days
after the Closing Date. Parent, in its sole discretion, may legend the
certificates representing such shares of Parent Common Stock to give effect to
any applicable legal or contractual restrictions on resale. Parent will file
with the SEC, no later than 10 days after the Closing Date, a registration
statement on Form S-8 relating to the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
with respect to the Company Options assumed by Parent in accordance with this
Section 5.5(a) or replaced with new options by Parent in accordance with Section
5.5(c);


                                      45.
<PAGE>   52

provided, however, that Parent will have no obligation to register, at any point
in time, a greater number of shares than could then be resold in compliance with
the limitations set forth above in this Section 5.5(a).

               (b) Subject to Section 5.5(c), at the Effective Time, each
Company Warrant which survives the Merger will be assumed by Parent in
accordance with the terms (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) of any
agreement by which such Company Warrant is evidenced. All rights with respect to
Company Common Stock under outstanding Company Warrants will thereupon be
converted into rights with respect to Parent Common Stock. Accordingly, from and
after the Effective Time, (i) each Company Warrant assumed by Parent may be
exercised solely for shares of Parent Common Stock, (ii) the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock subject to each such assumed Company Warrant will be equal
to the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were subject to such
Company Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the
Exchange Ratio applicable to the class or series of Company Stock for which such
Company Warrant was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time, rounded
up to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, (iii) the per
share exercise price for the Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each
such assumed Company Warrant will be determined by dividing the exercise price
per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Warrant, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, by the Exchange Ratio for which such
Company Warrant was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
rounding the resulting exercise price up to the nearest whole cent, and (iv) all
restrictions on the exercise of each such assumed Company Warrant will continue
in full force and effect, and the term, exercisability, vesting schedule and
other provisions of such Company Warrant will otherwise remain unchanged;
provided, however, that each such assumed Company Warrant will, in accordance
with its terms, be subject to further adjustment as appropriate to reflect any
stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or other
similar transaction effected by Parent after the Effective Time.

               (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Section 5.5, in lieu of assuming outstanding Company Options in accordance with
Section 5.5(a) or outstanding Company Warrants in accordance with Section
5.5(b), Parent may, at its election, cause such outstanding Company Options or
Company Warrants to be replaced by issuing reasonably equivalent replacement
stock options or warrants (as the case may be) in substitution therefor.

               (d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will take all action
that may be necessary (under the plans pursuant to which Company Options are
outstanding and otherwise) to effectuate the provisions of this Section 5.5 and
to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, holders of Company Options
and Company Warrants have no rights with respect thereto other than those
specifically provided in this Section 5.5.

        5.6 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS.

               (a) Parent agrees that all employees of the Acquired Corporations
who continue employment with Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent after the
Effective Time ("Continuing Employees") will be eligible to continue to
participate in Parent's health and welfare benefit plans; provided, however,
that (i) nothing in this Section 5.6 or elsewhere in this Agreement will limit
the right of Parent to amend or terminate any such health or welfare benefit
plan at any


                                      46.
<PAGE>   53

time, and (ii) if Parent terminates any such health or welfare benefit plan,
then (upon expiration of any appropriate transition period), the Continuing
Employees will be eligible to participate in Parent's health and welfare benefit
plans, to substantially the same extent as similarly situated employees of
Parent. Nothing in this Section 5.6 or elsewhere in this Agreement will be
construed to create a right in any employee to employment with Parent or any
other Subsidiary of Parent and the employment of each Continuing Employee will
be "at will" employment.

               (b) The Company agrees to take (or cause to be taken) all actions
necessary or appropriate to terminate, effective immediately prior to the
Effective Time, any employee benefit plan sponsored by any of the Acquired
Corporations (or in which any of the Acquired Corporations participate) that
contains a cash or deferred arrangement intended to qualify under Section 401(k)
of the Code.

               (c) Part 5.6(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth
certain existing commitments to pay bonuses to employees of the Company who
remain employed by the Company (or by Parent or any of Parent's affiliates)
through December 15, 2000 (the "Stay Bonuses"). Parent agrees to pay the
specified Stay Bonuses to employees who remain employed by the Company (or by
Parent or any of Parent's affiliates) through December 15, 2000. In addition,
Parent agrees to pay the specified Stay Bonuses, together with severance as
specified in Part 5.6 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, to any of such
employees whose employment is terminated by Parent, other than for cause, prior
to December 15, 2000.

        5.7 DIRECTORS' AND OFFICERS' INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE.

               (a) All rights to indemnification existing in favor of any Person
who is now, or had been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement or who
becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of any of the
Acquired Corporations (the "Indemnified Persons") for acts and omissions
occurring prior to the Effective Time, as provided in the Company's certificate
of incorporation and bylaws (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) and
as provided in any indemnification agreements between the Company and the
Indemnified Persons (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) in the forms
disclosed by the Company to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement,
including, in the case of Gary Stevens, any replacement for such agreement
containing substantially identical indemnification provisions, will survive the
Merger and will be observed by Parent to the fullest extent available under
applicable law for a period of six years from the Effective Time.

               (b) Parent will include and cause to be maintained in effect in
its (or any successor's) certificate of incorporation and bylaws after the
Effective Time, provisions regarding elimination of liability of directors,
indemnification of officers, directors and employees and advancement of expenses
which are, in the aggregate, no less advantageous to the intended beneficiaries
than the corresponding provisions contained as of the date of this Agreement in
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company.

               (c) From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, Parent will maintain in effect, for the benefit of the
Indemnified Persons with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time, the existing policy of directors' and officers' liability
insurance maintained by the Company as of the date of this Agreement in the form


                                      47.
<PAGE>   54

disclosed by the Company to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement (the
"Existing Policy"); provided, however, that (i) Parent may substitute for the
Existing Policy a policy or policies of comparable coverage, and (ii) Parent
will not be required to pay annual premiums for the Existing Policy (or for any
substitute policies) in excess of $60,000 in the aggregate. In the event any
future annual premiums for the Existing Policy (or any substitute policies)
exceeds $60,000 in the aggregate, Parent will be entitled to reduce the amount
of coverage of the Existing Policy (or any substitute policies) to the amount of
coverage that can be obtained for an annual premium equal to $60,000.

               (d) The obligations of Parent under this Section 5.7 may not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any of the
Indemnified Persons without the consent of each such affected Indemnified Person
(it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Persons are intended third party
beneficiaries of this Section 5.7).

        5.8 PROVISION OF INFORMATION. During the Pre-Closing Period, each of the
Company and Parent will promptly notify the other party in writing of: (i) the
discovery by it of any event, condition, fact or circumstance that occurred or
existed on or prior to the date of this Agreement and that caused or constitutes
a material inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made by it in this
Agreement; (ii) any material breach of any covenant or obligation of it; and
(iii) any event, condition, fact or circumstance that, considered together with
all other events, conditions, facts and circumstances, would make the timely
satisfaction of any of the conditions set forth in Section 6 or Section 7
impossible or unlikely or is deemed to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Acquired Corporations (in the case of the Company) or a Material Adverse Effect
on Parent (in the case of Parent). Without limiting the generality of the

Law, Parent and its Subsidiaries will not sell, transfer, distribute or
otherwise dispose of any of the operating assets acquired from the Company in
the Merger, whether by merger or otherwise, in a transaction or series of
transactions that would cause the Merger to fail to satisfy the continuity of
business enterprise requirements of a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the
Code or the applicable Treasury Regulations.

however, it is understood by the parties that no updated Company Disclosure
Schedule will be deemed to supplement or amend the Company Disclosure Schedule
for the purposed of determining the accuracy as of the date of this Agreement of
any of the representations and warranties made by the Company in this Agreement.

        9.2 INDEMNIFICATION AND ESCROW.

               (a) From and after the Effective Time (but subject to Section
9.1(a)) the Escrow Fund will be available to compensate and reimburse each of
the Indemnitees for any Damages which are directly or indirectly suffered or
incurred by any of the Indemnitees or to which any of the Indemnitees may
otherwise become subject (regardless of whether or not such Damages relate to
any third-party claim) and which arise from or as a result of, or are directly
or indirectly connected with:

                      (i)    any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or obligation made by the Company herein and any Legal
Proceeding relating to any


                                      57.
<PAGE>   64

such inaccuracy or breach (including any Legal Proceeding commenced by any
Indemnitee for the purpose of enforcing any of its rights under this Section 9);
or

                      (ii)   any of the following: (1) any Merger Consideration
Adjustment pursuant to Section 1.10; (2) any Company Transaction Expenses to the
extent the aggregate of all such expenses exceeds $2,200,000; and (3) the claims
described in paragraphs (3) and (4) of Part 2.19(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule (the "Patent Claims").

               (b) Indemnification pursuant to this Section 9.2 will be the
exclusive remedy available to the Indemnitees for Damages of the type referred
to in the foregoing sentence, provided however that such limitation will not
apply with respect to claims based on the fraud of the Company.

        9.3 DEDUCTIBLE AMOUNT.

               (a) Except as otherwise expressly provided in Section 9.3(b), the
Indemnitees will be entitled to indemnification only if and to the extent the
aggregate amount of Damages that have been directly or indirectly suffered or
incurred by any one or more of the Indemnitees, or to which any one or more of
the Indemnitees has or have otherwise become subject, exceeds $500,000 (the
"Deductible Amount").

               (b) The Deductible Amount will not apply to any Damages which
arise from or as a result of or are directly or indirectly connected with (i)
the Patent Claims, or (ii) the fraud of the Company.

        9.4 SATISFACTION OF INDEMNIFICATION CLAIM; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

               (a) From and after the Effective Time, all claims against the
Escrow Stockholders under this Agreement will be satisfied exclusively and, to
the extent possible given such limitation, in full from the Escrow Fund in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, from and
after the Effective Time, the maximum liability of any Escrow Stockholder for
any breach of a representation, warranty or covenant of the Company or other
indemnified matter will be limited to such Escrow Stockholder's proportionate
interest in the Escrow Fund. Any Escrow Fund assets used to satisfy a claim
against the Escrow Stockholders under this Agreement will be taken from all of
the Escrow Stockholders on a pro rata basis in proportion to such Escrow
Stockholders' respective interests in the Escrow Fund.

               (b) In no event will the Indemnitees be entitled to receive from
the Escrow Fund an aggregate amount greater than $500,000 in respect of the
Patent Claims. The parties hereto agree that the ability of the Indemnitees to
be indemnified for Patent Claims without application of the Deductible Amount
(but subject to the indemnification cap set forth herein) is the exclusive
remedy in respect of Patent Claims under this Agreement and will not be included
as part of a separate indemnification claim that would have the effect of
negating the limitations applicable to Patent Claims hereunder.

               (c) In no event will the Indemnitees be entitled to receive from
the Escrow Fund an amount already recovered by Parent pursuant to the Merger
Consideration Adjustment


                                      58.
<PAGE>   65

provided for in Section 1.10 and in no event will any Damages include any amount
for which an accrual is included as a liability on the Final Closing Balance
Sheet.

        9.5 [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED].

        9.6 DEFENSE OF THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS. In the event of the assertion or
commencement by any Person of any claim or Legal Proceeding (whether against
Parent, against Parent or against any other Person) with respect to which any
Indemnitee may be entitled to make a claim pursuant to this Section 9, Parent
will notify the Designated Company Agent of such assertion or commencement
promptly after receiving notice thereof. The failure to give or delay in giving
such notice will not reduce the amount of any such claim, except to the extent
of any prejudice resulting from such failure or delay. The Escrow Stockholders,
acting through the Designated Company Agent, will defend the Indemnitees in such
action with counsel selected by the Designated Company Agent and reasonably
satisfactory to Parent.

               (a) If the Designated Company Agent so proceeds with the defense
of any such claim or Legal Proceeding:

                      (i)    The Designated Company Agent may obtain
reimbursement for all reasonable expenses relating to the defense of such claim
or Legal Proceeding as provided in the Escrow Agreement;

                      (ii)   Parent will make available to the Designated
Company Agent any documents and materials in its possession or control that may
be necessary to the defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding; and

                      (iii)  The Designated Company Agent will have the right to
settle, adjust or compromise such claim or Legal Proceeding with the consent of
Parent; provided, however, that such consent will not be unreasonably withheld.

               (b) To the extent that the Designated Company Agent fails to
provide such defense in a timely manner, Parent will have the right to proceed
with the defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding with counsel selected by
Parent. If Parent so proceeds with the defense of any such claim or Legal
Proceeding:

                      (i)    All reasonable expenses relating to the defense of
such claim or Legal Proceeding will be indemnifiable under Section 9.2;

                      (ii)   The Designated Company Agent defined below will
make available to Parent any documents and materials in his or her possession or
control that may be necessary to the defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding;
and

                      (iii)  Parent will have the right to settle, adjust or
compromise such claim or Legal Proceeding with the consent of the Designated
Company Agent; provided, however, that such consent will not be unreasonably
withheld.

        9.7 TAX CONTESTS. Parent will have the sole right to conduct any tax
audit or other tax contest relating to tax return of Parent; provided, however,
prior to the termination of the Escrow,


                                      59.
<PAGE>   66

the Designated Company Agent will have the right to conduct any Tax examination,
audit or contest relating to a Tax Return of the Company that is subject to the
indemnification obligations under Section 9 and will have the right to settle,
adjust or compromise any such tax contest with the consent of Parent, which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld. The Designated Company Agent may
obtain reimbursement in accordance with the Escrow Agreement for all reasonable
expenses relating to the conduct of any such Tax examination, audit or contest.

        9.8 EXERCISE OF REMEDIES BY INDEMNITEES OTHER THAN PARENT. No Indemnitee
(other than Parent or any successor thereto or assign thereof) will be permitted
to assert any indemnification claim or exercise any other remedy under this
Agreement unless Parent (or any successor thereto or assign thereof) will have
consented to the assertion of such indemnification claim or the exercise of such
other remedy.

SECTION 10. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

        10.1 DESIGNATED COMPANY AGENT. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company
will appoint a Person to serve as the agent for the Escrow Stockholders for
purposes of this Agreement (the "Designated Company Agent"). Parent will be
entitled to deal exclusively with the Designated Company Agent on all matters
relating to this Agreement, and will be entitled to rely conclusively (without
further evidence of any kind whatsoever) on any document executed or purported
to be executed on behalf of the Company and the Escrow Stockholders by the
Designated Company Agent, and on any other action taken or purported to be taken
on behalf of the Company and the Escrow Stockholders by the Designated Company
Agent, as fully binding upon the Company and the Escrow Stockholders. If the
person acting as the Designated Company Agent should die, become disabled or
otherwise be unable to fulfill his or her responsibilities as agent of the
Company or in the event that a majority in interest of the Escrow Stockholders
shall elect to terminate the responsibilities of the person acting as Designated
Company Agent, then a majority in interest of the Escrow Stockholders will
appoint a new representative to serve as the Designated Company Agent and will
promptly notify Parent of the identity of such successor. Any such successor
will become the "Designated Company Agent" for purposes of this Agreement.

        10.2 AMENDMENT. This Agreement may be amended with the approval of the
respective boards of directors of the Company and Parent at any time (whether
before or after adoption of this Agreement by the Company's stockholders and
whether before or after approval of the issuance of Parent Common Stock in the
Merger by Parent's stockholders); provided, however, that (i) after any such
adoption of this Agreement by the Company's stockholders, no amendment will be
made which by law requires further approval of the stockholders of the Company
without the further approval of such stockholders, and (ii) after any such
approval of the issuance of Parent Common Stock in the Merger by Parent's
stockholders, no amendment will be made which by law or NASD regulation requires
further approval of Parent's stockholders without the further approval of such
stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.


                                      60.

        10.3   WAIVER.

               (a) No failure on the part of any party to exercise any power,
right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of any
party in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement,
will operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or remedy; and no
single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege or remedy will
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other power, right,
privilege or remedy.

               (b) No party will be deemed to have waived any claim arising out
of this Agreement, or any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim, power, right, privilege or remedy is
expressly set forth in a written instrument duly executed and delivered on
behalf of such party; and any such waiver will not be applicable or have any
effect except in the specific instance in which it is given.

        10.4 ENTIRE AGREEMENT; COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement and the other
agreements referred to herein constitute the entire agreement and supersede all
other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among or
between any of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof; provided, however, that the letter agreement dated April 6, 2000
between the Company and Parent (relating to the protection of confidential
information) will not be superseded and will remain in full force and effect.
This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which will be
deemed an original and all of which will constitute one and the same instrument.

        10.5 APPLICABLE LAW; JURISDICTION. The procedures applicable to and
effect of the Merger will be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware.
Subject to the immediately preceding sentence, this Agreement will be governed
by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of California,
regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles
of conflicts of laws thereof. In any action between any of the parties arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement: (a) each of the parties irrevocably and unconditionally consents
and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal
courts located in Denver, Colorado; (b) if any such action is commenced in a
state court, then, subject to applicable law, no party will object to the
removal of such action to any federal court located in Colorado; (c) each of the
parties irrevocably waives the right to trial by jury; and (d) each of the
parties irrevocably consents to service of process by first class certified
mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, to the address at which such
party is to receive notice in accordance with Section 10.9.

        10.6 COMPANY DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE. The Company Disclosure Schedule will
be arranged in separate parts corresponding to the numbered and lettered
sections contained in Section 2, and the information disclosed in any numbered
or lettered part will be deemed to relate to and to qualify only the particular

        10.8 ASSIGNABILITY; THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARIES. This Agreement will be
binding upon, and will be enforceable by and inure solely to the benefit of, the
parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns; provided, however,
that neither this Agreement nor any party's rights hereunder may be assigned by
such party without the prior written consent of each other party, and any
attempted assignment of this Agreement or any of such rights by any party
without such consent will be void and of no effect. Nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to or will confer upon any Person (other than
the parties hereto) any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever,
except that (a) the Rule 145 Sellers (as defined in Section 5.1(c)) will be

<PAGE>   89

               that if (A) the amount of the Senior Preferred Stock Liquidation
               Preference is greater than the amount of the Senior Conversion
               Amount, and (B) the Effective Date Value of the Merger
               Consideration Shares distributable to the holders of Senior
               Preferred Stock is less than the Senior Preferred Stock
               Liquidation Preference, then the amount of Merger Consideration
               Shares available to be distributed to the holders of Senior
               Preferred Stock shall be distributed ratably among the holders of
               Senior Preferred Stock in proportion to the Series B Liquidation

               Liquidation Preference, Series D Liquidation Preference and

               in the event that the Senior Conversion Amount exceeds the Senior

               determined with respect to the Senior Conversion Amount is less
               than the per share amount payable under the Series B Liquidation
               Preference, the Series C Liquidation Preference, the Series C1
               Liquidation Preference, the Series D Liquidation Preference or

               respective liquidation preference for such holder's Senior
               Preferred Stock in lieu of the Senior Conversion Amount and the

               Preferred Stock shall be adjusted to reflect the priority of such
               payment. (For example, if the Senior Conversion Amount equates to
               a Series D Conversion Amount equal to $28.00 per share, the
               Series D Liquidation Preference per share would be greater than
               this value. In this scenario, the holder of Series D Preferred
               Stock could elect to receive the Series D Liquidation Preference
               in lieu of the Series D Conversion Amount; if the holders so
               elected, the Senior Conversion Amount would be reduced by the
               value of the Series D Liquidation Preference.) Each amount
               calculated under this definition with respect to the Series B
               Preferred Stock, the Series C Preferred Stock, the Series C1
               Preferred Stock, the Series D Preferred Stock, and the Series D1
               Preferred Stock and included in this Senior Preferred Stock
               Amount shall be designated respectively as the Series B
               Liquidation Amount, the Series C Liquidation Amount, the Series
               C1 Liquidation Amount, the Series D Liquidation Amount and the
               Series D1 Liquidation Amount.

        42.    Senior Preferred Stock Liquidation Preference means the sum of
               (i) the Series B Liquidation Preference; (ii) the Series C
               Liquidation Preference; (iii) the Series C1 Liquidation
               Preference; (iv) the Series D Liquidation Preference and (v) the
               Series D1 Liquidation Preference.

        43.    Senior Conversion Amount means the sum of (i) the Series B
               Conversion Amount; (ii) the Series C Conversion Amount; (iii) the

               and (v) the Series D1 Conversion Amount.

1.      The Company has been duly incorporated and is a validly existing
        corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.

2.      The Company has the requisite corporate power to own its property and
        assets, to conduct its business as such business is currently being
        conducted, to enter into the Agreements and to consummate the
        transactions contemplated thereby. To our knowledge, the Company is
        qualified as a foreign corporation to do business and is in good
        standing in each jurisdiction in the United States in which the
        ownership of its property or the conduct of its business requires such
        qualification and where the failure to qualify would have a Material
        Adverse Effect on the Company.

3.      All corporate action required to be taken on the part of the Company and
        its stockholders to authorize the Agreements and consummate the
        transaction contemplated thereby has been taken.

4.      Each of the Agreements has been duly and validly authorized, executed
        and delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid and binding
        agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance
        with its terms, except as enforcement may be limited by applicable laws
        and except as enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
        insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, moratorium or other similar
        laws affecting creditors' rights, and subject to general equity
        principles and to limitations on availability of equitable relief,
        including specific performance and injunctive relief.

5.      The execution and delivery of the Agreements and the consummation by the
        Company of the merger contemplated thereby are not prohibited by, and
        will not violate or conflict with (i) any provision of the certificate
        of incorporation or bylaws of the Company, (ii) any resolution adopted
        by the Company's stockholders, the Company's board of directors or any
        committee of the Company's board of directors, (iii) to the best of our
        knowledge, subject to receipt by the Company of the third-party consents
        identified on the Company Disclosure Schedule, any material Contract of
        the Company or, to the best of our knowledge, any of its Subsidiaries,
        except as would not be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
        Company, or (iv) any law, rule or regulation, the violation or
        contravention of which would be expected to have a Material Adverse
        Effect on the Company.

6.      To our knowledge, except as set forth in the Disclosure Schedule, there
        are no civil, criminal or administrative actions, suits or proceedings
        pending or threatened against the Company before any court, arbitrator,
        or administrative,

        governmental or regulatory authority, domestic or foreign, that question
        the validity or enforceability of the Agreements or the right of the
        Company to enter into the Agreements or could have a Material Adverse
        Effect on the Company.

7.      Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the authorized capital stock of
        the Company consisted of (i) 20,000,000 shares of Common Stock and (ii)
        7,500,000 shares of Company Preferred Stock, of which 761,903 are
        undesignated Preferred Stock (none of which are outstanding), 125,000
        are designated Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $10.00 per
        share, 518,841 are designated Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, par
        value $4.492 per share, 1,418,200 are designated Series C Convertible

        Series C1 Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $.001 per share,
        2,230,260 are designated Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, par value
        $.001 per share, 1,003,617 are designated Series D1 Convertible
        Preferred Stock, par value $.001 per share, and 811,423 are designated
        Series E Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $.001 per share, of the
        Company. 125,000, 445,263, 1,418,200, 630,756, 2,140,873, 0, and 811,423
        shares of Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock, Series B Convertible
        Preferred Stock, Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, Series C1
        Convertible Preferred Stock, Series D Convertible Preferred Stock,
        Series D1 Convertible Preferred Stock and Series E Convertible Preferred
        Stock, respectively, have been issued and are outstanding as of the date
        of this Agreement, based upon the Company's records, which are to our
        knowledge, accurate. To our knowledge, based upon a certificate of an
        officer of the Company, all of the outstanding shares of capital stock
        of the Company which have been issued have been duly authorized and
        validly issued, and are fully paid and non-assessable. To our knowledge,
        all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company were
        issued in transactions exempt from the registration requirements of
        Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. To our knowledge,
        except as set forth in the Disclosure Schedule, none of the outstanding
        shares of the Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock is subject
        to any repurchase option or restrictions on transfer in favor of, or
        imposed by, the Company (other than restrictions on transfer imposed by
        virtue of applicable federal and state securities laws). Except as set
        forth in the Agreement and on the Disclosure Schedule, to our knowledge,
        there are no options, warrants, conversion privileges, preemptive rights
        or other rights presently outstanding to purchase any of the authorized
        but unissued capital stock of the Company.

9.      Immediately prior to the Closing Date, except as set forth in the
        Disclosure Schedule, to our knowledge there was no: (a) outstanding
        subscription, option, call, warrant or right (whether or not currently
        exercisable) to acquire from the Company any authorized but unissued
        shares of the capital stock or other securities of the Company; (b)
        outstanding security, instrument or obligation that is or may become
        convertible into or exchangeable for any shares of the capital stock or
        other securities of the Company or (c) contract under which the Company
        is or may become obligated to sell or otherwise issue any shares of its
        capital stock or any other securities.

                                    EXHIBIT E

                      FORM OF OPINION OF COOLEY GODWARD LLP

        We have acted as counsel for Quokka Sports, Inc., a Delaware corporation
(the "Company"), in connection with that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger
and Reorganization (the "Agreement"), dated as of July 20, 2000, by and between
the Company and Total Sports, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Seller"). We are
rendering this opinion pursuant to Section 7.5(b) of the Agreement. Except as
otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the
respective meanings given to them in the Agreement.

        In connection with this opinion, we have examined and relied upon the
representations and warranties as to factual matters contained in and made
pursuant to the Agreement by the various parties and originals or copies
certified to our satisfaction, of such records, documents, certificates,
opinions, memoranda and other instruments as in our judgment are necessary or
appropriate to enable us to render the opinion expressed below. Where we render
an opinion "to the best of our knowledge" or concerning an item "known to us" or
our opinion otherwise refers to our knowledge, it is based solely upon (i) an
inquiry of attorneys within this firm who perform legal services for the
Company, (ii) receipt of a certificate executed by an officer of the Company
covering such matters, and (iii) such other investigation, if any, that we
specifically set forth herein.

        In rendering this opinion, we have assumed: the genuineness and
authenticity of all signatures on original documents; the authenticity of all
documents submitted to us as originals; the conformity to originals of all
documents submitted to us as copies; the accuracy, completeness and authenticity
of certificates of public officials; and the due authorization, execution and
delivery of all documents (except the due authorization, execution and delivery
by the Company of the Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Company
Stockholder Voting Agreements (collectively, the "Agreements")), where
authorization, execution and delivery are prerequisites to the effectiveness of
such documents. We have also assumed: that all individuals executing and
delivering documents had the legal capacity to so execute and deliver; that you
have received all documents you were to receive under the Agreements; that the
Agreement is an obligation binding upon you; if you are a corporation or other
entity, that you have filed any required California franchise or income tax
returns and have paid any required California franchise or income taxes; and
that there are no extrinsic agreements or understandings among the parties to
the Agreements that would modify or interpret the terms of the Agreements or the
respective rights or obligations of the parties thereunder.

        Our opinion is expressed only with respect to the federal laws of the
United States of America, the laws of the State of California and the General
Corporation Law of Delaware. Our opinion in paragraph 4 below as to the
validity, binding effect and enforceability of the Agreements is premised upon
the result that would obtain if a California court were to apply the internal
laws of the State of California to the interpretation and enforcement of the
Agreements. We express no opinion as to whether the laws of any particular
jurisdiction apply, and no opinion to the extent that the laws of any
jurisdiction other than those identified above are applicable to the subject
matter hereof. We are not rendering any opinion as to compliance with any
antifraud law, rule or regulation relating to securities, or to the sale or
issuance thereof.


                                       1.
<PAGE>   95

        With regard to our opinion in paragraph 8 below, we have examined and
relied upon a certificate executed by an officer of the Company, to the effect
that the consideration for all outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Company was received by the Company in accordance with the provisions of the
applicable Board of Directors resolutions and any agreement relating to the
issuance of such shares, and we have undertaken no independent verification with
respect thereto.

        On the basis of the foregoing, in reliance thereon and with the
foregoing qualifications, we are of the opinion that:

4.      The Company has been duly incorporated and is a validly existing
corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.

5.      The Company has the requisite corporate power to own its property and
assets, to conduct its business as such business is currently being conducted,
to enter into the Agreements and to consummate the transactions contemplated
thereby. To our knowledge, the Company is qualified as a foreign corporation to
do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in the United States in
which the ownership of its property or the conduct of its business requires such
qualification and where the failure to qualify would have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company.

6.      All corporate action required to be taken on the part of the Company to
authorize the Agreements and consummate the transaction contemplated thereby has
been taken.

7.      Each of the Agreements has been duly and validly authorized, executed
and delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid and binding agreement of
the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms,
except as enforcement may be limited by applicable laws and except as
enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
arrangement, moratorium or other similar laws affecting creditors' rights, and
subject to general equity principles and to limitations on availability of
equitable relief, including specific performance and injunctive relief.

8.      The execution and delivery of the Agreements and the consummation by the
Company of the merger contemplated thereby are not prohibited by, and will not
violate or conflict with (i) any provision of the certificate of incorporation
or bylaws of the Company, (ii) any resolution adopted by the Company's
stockholders, the Company's board of directors or any committee of the Company's
board of directors, (iii) to the best of our knowledge, any material Contract of
the Company or, to the best of our knowledge, any of its Subsidiaries, except as
would not be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, or (iv)
any law, rule or regulation, the violation or contravention of which would be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

9.      To our knowledge, except as set forth in the Parent Disclosure Schedule,
there are no civil, criminal or administrative actions, suits or proceedings
pending or threatened against the Company before any court, arbitrator, or
administrative, governmental or regulatory authority, domestic or foreign, that
question the validity or enforceability of the Agreements or the right of


                                       2.
<PAGE>   96

the Company to enter into the Agreements or could have a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company.

10.     The shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Agreement
have been duly authorized, and upon issuance and delivery against payment
therefor in accordance with the terms of the Agreement, will be validly issued,
outstanding, fully paid and nonassessable.

11.     Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the authorized capital stock of
the Company consisted of (i) [110,000,000] shares of Common Stock, of which
__________ are issued and outstanding based upon the Company's records, which
are to our knowledge, accurate, and (ii) 10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock,
none of which are issued and outstanding. To our knowledge, all of the
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company which have been issued have
been duly authorized and validly issued, and are fully paid and non-assessable.

        This opinion is intended solely for your benefit and is not to be made
available to or be relied upon by any other person, firm, or entity without our
prior written consent.

                                    EXHIBIT F

                            FORM OF ESCROW AGREEMENT

        THIS ESCROW AGREEMENT ("Agreement") is made and entered into as of
______, 2000 by and among: QUOKKA SPORTS, INC., a Delaware corporation
("Parent") _________________, as the designated company agent appointed pursuant
to the Merger Agreement ("Designated Company Agent"), and STATE STREET BANK AND
TRUST COMPANY OF CALIFORNIA, N.A., a national banking association (the "Escrow
Agent").

                                    RECITALS

        A.     Parent and the Company have entered into an Agreement and Plan of
Merger and Reorganization dated as of July ____, 2000 (the "Merger Agreement"),
pursuant to which the Parent will be the surviving corporation, the Company will
cease to exist and the Company's stockholders and Gary Stevenson ("Escrow
Stockholders") will have the right to receive shares of Common Stock of Parent.

        B.     Section 1.8 of the Merger Agreement contemplates the
establishment of an escrow arrangement to secure the indemnification and other
obligations of the Company under Section 9 of the Merger Agreement.

        C.     Pursuant to Section 10.1 of the Merger Agreement and Section 10
of this Agreement, the Escrow Stockholders have irrevocably appointed
________________, as representative, to serve as Designated Company Agent for,
among other things, all matters set forth in Section 9 of the Merger Agreement.

                                    AGREEMENT

        The parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

        1.     DEFINED TERMS. Capitalized terms used in this Agreement and not
otherwise defined shall have the meanings given to them in the Merger Agreement,
a copy of which is attached hereto.

        2.     ESCROW AND INDEMNIFICATION.

               (a) SHARES PLACED IN ESCROW. At the Effective Time, which shall
be set forth in a written notice by Parent to Escrow Agent: Parent shall issue
and deliver to Escrow Agent certificates for shares of Parent Common Stock
registered in the name of "Embassy & Co.," the nominee of the Escrow Agent,
representing the amounts with respect to the Escrow Stockholders as set forth on
EXHIBIT A hereto (the total number of such Parent Common Stock being placed in
escrow at the Effective Time being referred to herein as the "Initial Escrow
Shares"), evidencing the shares of Parent Common Stock to be held in escrow in
accordance with this Agreement and containing the following legend: "THE SHARES
REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE SUBJECT TO AN ESCROW AGREEMENT, DATED AS OF
________, 2000, BY AND AMONG QUOKKA SPORTS, INC., A DESIGNATED COMPANY AGENT
IDENTIFIED THEREIN AND STATE STREET BANK AND TRUST COMPANY OF CALIFORNIA, N.A."



                                       1.
<PAGE>   98

(the "Escrow Legend"). The shares of Parent Common Stock being held in escrow
pursuant to this Agreement (the "Escrow Shares"), together with any Escrow Cash
(as defined below) resulting from the sale by Escrow Agent of Escrow Shares (as
further described herein), shall constitute an escrow fund (the "Escrow Fund")
with respect to the indemnification obligations of the Company under Section
9.2(a) of the Merger Agreement. The Escrow Fund shall be held as a trust fund
and shall not be subject to any lien, attachment, trustee process or any other
judicial process of any creditor of any Escrow Stockholder or of any party
hereto. The Escrow Agent agrees to accept delivery of the Escrow Fund and to
hold the Escrow Fund in an escrow account (the "Escrow Account"), subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement.

               (b) VOTING OF ESCROW SHARES. The Escrow Stockholders, as
beneficial owners of the Escrow Shares, shall be entitled to exercise all voting
rights with respect to such Escrow Shares and the Escrow Agent shall not have
any authority to exercise any such voting rights. The Escrow Agent shall have no
responsibility for the genuineness, validity, market value, title or sufficiency
for any intended purpose of the Escrow Shares. The Escrow Agent shall be under
no obligation to preserve, protect or exercise rights in the Escrow Shares, and
shall be responsible only for reasonable measures to maintain the physical
safekeeping thereof, and otherwise to perform and observe such duties on its
part as are expressly set forth in this Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall not be
responsible for forwarding to any party, notifying any party with respect to, or
taking any action with respect to, any notice, solicitation or other document or
information, written or otherwise, received from the issuer or other person with
respect to the Escrow Shares, including but not limited to, proxy material,
tenders, options, the pendency of calls and maturities and expiration of rights
(such materials being referred to generally as "Proxy Materials"); provided,
however, that the Escrow Agent shall, within two (2) business days of receipt of
Proxy Materials that entitle the Escrow Stockholders to vote, send to Parent's
transfer agent a written notice identifying the number of Escrow Shares held in
the Escrow Fund as of the record date set forth in the Proxy Materials (the
"Record Date Escrow Shares"), including a copy of the pro rata interest of each
Escrow Stockholder shown on EXHIBIT A, and requesting that the transfer agent
(i) distribute the Proxy Materials to the Escrow Stockholders as beneficial
owners of the Escrow Shares and (ii) prepare proxy cards for each Escrow
Stockholder entitling each such Escrow Stockholder to vote the number of shares
(rounding down in order to avoid fractional shares) determined by multiplying
the Record Date Escrow Shares by the pro rata interest of each Escrow
Stockholder shown on EXHIBIT A.

               (c) DIVIDENDS, ETC. Any securities or other property
distributable (whether by way of dividend, stock split or otherwise) in a
tax-free transaction in respect of or in exchange for any Escrow Shares shall
not be distributed to the Escrow Stockholders, but rather shall be distributed
to and held by the Escrow Agent in the Escrow Account. Ordinary cash dividends
and any other taxable dividends, distributions or exchange proceeds will be paid
by Parent directly to the Escrow Stockholders and not to the Escrow Agent.
Unless and until the Escrow Agent shall actually receive such additional
securities or other property, it may assume without inquiry that the Escrow
Shares currently being held by it in the Escrow Account are all that the Escrow
Agent is required to hold. At the time any Escrow Shares are required to be
released from the Escrow Account to any Person pursuant to this Agreement, any
securities or other property previously received by the Escrow Agent in respect
of or in exchange for such Escrow Shares shall be released from the Escrow to
such Person.


                                       2.
<PAGE>   99

               (d) TRANSFERABILITY. The interests of the Escrow Stockholders in
the Escrow Account and in the Escrow Shares shall not be assignable or
transferable, other than by operation of law. No transfer of any of such
interests by operation of law shall be recognized or given effect until Parent
and the Escrow Agent shall have received written notice of such transfer.

               (e) FRACTIONAL SHARES. No fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock shall be retained in or released from the Escrow Account pursuant to this
Agreement. In connection with any release of Escrow Shares from the Escrow
Account, Parent and the Escrow Agent shall "round down" in order to avoid
retaining any fractional share in the Escrow Account and in order to avoid
releasing any fractional share from the Escrow Account. When shares are "rounded
down", no cash-in-lieu payments need to be made.

               (f) SALE OF ESCROW SHARES.

                      (i) VOLUNTARY SALE. Subject to the lockup restrictions
identified below, the Designated Company Agent may direct the Escrow Agent to
sell any or all of the Escrow Shares held in the Escrow Fund by delivery to the
Escrow Agent and Parent of a written notice stating the number of Escrow Shares
to be sold by the Escrow Agent and the minimum price per share to be realized
from such sale (the "Sale Notice"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, without Parent's written consent (which consent the Escrow Agent shall
not be required to request) the Escrow Agent shall not sell any of the Escrow
Shares pursuant to this Section 2(f)(i) prior to the expiration of one year
after the Closing Date, except for (a) up to an aggregate of 10% of the Initial
Escrow Shares at any time after the Closing Date; (b) up to a cumulative
aggregate of 22% of the Initial Escrow Shares at any time after the expiration
of 90 days after the Closing Date; (c) up to a cumulative aggregate of 47% of
the Initial Escrow Shares at any time after the expiration of 180 days after the
Closing Date; and (d) up to a cumulative aggregate of 72% of the Initial Escrow
Shares at any time after the expiration of 270 days after the Closing Date. To
the extent directed to do so by the Designated Company Agent (and provided that
the Sale Notice does not contemplate a sale of Escrow Shares in violation of the
lockup restriction identified above), the Escrow Agent shall, pursuant to the
provisions in Section 2(g) below, within two (2) business days of receipt of the
Sale Notice (provided that the minimum price per share indicated may be
realized) direct the sale of the number of Escrow Shares set forth in the Sale
Notice and shall add the proceeds of such sale less commission and Escrow Agent
fees (the "Transaction Fees") to the Escrow Fund (the proceeds, net of the
Transaction Fees, being referred to as "Escrow Cash"). Any liability resulting
from sales of Escrow Shares in violation of the lockup restrictions identified
above shall not be borne by the Escrow Agent but rather shall be borne by the
Escrow Stockholders indirectly as a result of their pro rata interest in the
Escrow Fund.

                      (ii) REQUIRED SALE. Satisfaction of any indemnification
claim pursuant to this Agreement shall be made only with Escrow Cash and not
with Escrow Shares.

                             (A) In order to satisfy any claims pursuant to
Section 3 hereunder, the Designated Company Agent shall direct the Escrow Agent
to sell such number of Escrow Shares held in the Escrow Fund as shall be
necessary to satisfy such claim by delivery to the Escrow Agent of a written
notice stating the number of Escrow Shares to be sold. To the extent directed to
do so by the Designated Company Agent, the Escrow Agent shall, pursuant to


                                       3.
<PAGE>   100

the provisions in Section 2(g) below, within two (2) business days of receipt of
such notice sell such number of Escrow Shares as is designated by the Designated
Company Agent, and shall add the Escrow Cash realized by the sale to the Escrow
Fund.

                             (B) In the event the Designated Company Agent shall
be deemed to have agreed (pursuant to Sections 3(b), (c) or (g) hereunder) that
Escrow Shares shall be sold by the Escrow Agent to satisfy an indemnification
claim, the Escrow Agent shall sell such number of Escrow Shares held in the
Escrow Fund as shall be necessary to satisfy such claim and shall add the Escrow
Cash realized by the sale to the Escrow Fund.

               (g) MECHANICS OF SALE OF ESCROW SHARES.

                      (i) In connection with any sale of Escrow Shares pursuant
to Section 2(f) of this Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to receive
and rely upon, prior to taking action in that regard, written direction from the
Designated Company Agent as to the manner and method to be undertaken in
carrying out such sale, including without limitation written direction (i)
identifying the number of Escrow Shares to be sold and (ii) identifying the
brokerage firm the Designated Company Agent requests to be used or instructing
the Escrow Agent to use a brokerage service of its choice, and (iii) setting
forth any necessary or special instructions with respect to the sale (including
any stop loss or minimum price per share instruction); and the Designated
Company Agent shall execute and deliver any instruments reasonably required by
the Escrow Agent in order to carry out such sale.

                      (ii) The Escrow Agent shall have no responsibility in
connection with such sale other than to make delivery of the Escrow Shares to
the selected brokerage firm, with instruction (including any special instruction
provided by the Designated Company Agent), and to receive and deposit into the
Escrow Fund the Escrow Cash received therefrom. The Escrow Agent shall have no
liability for any actions or omissions of any such brokerage firm and shall have
no liability for the price or execution achieved. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Designated Company Agent expressly acknowledges
that (a) the Escrow Shares may need to be sent to a transfer agent to be
reissued in saleable form, (b) the Escrow Shares may contain or be subject to
transfer restrictions that may limit their marketability and impose restrictions
upon the number of types of purchasers to whom they can be offered or sold, and
(c) the Escrow Agent shall have no liability for any failure or delay (or any
price change during such delay) on the part of the Designated Company Agent or
any transfer agent, or caused by any necessary registration or delivery
procedures, or compliance with any applicable transfer restrictions, involved in
the sale of such Escrow Shares.

                      (iii) The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to contract with
any brokerage firm (which may be selected by the Escrow Agent without liability
on its part unless the Designated Company Agent shall have indicated a brokerage
firm to be used, in which event such brokerage firm shall be used), which may be
affiliated with the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be indemnified
hereunder for any costs, expenses and risks associated therewith or arising
thereunder (other than resulting from its own gross negligence, bad faith or
wilful misconduct), and the Escrow Cash attributable to the Escrow Fund shall be
net of all brokerage commissions and charges (including the Escrow Agent's
charges). Any Escrow Shares to be sold by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement shall reduce the Escrow


                                       4.
<PAGE>   101

Shares attributable to the Escrow Stockholders on a pro rata basis, in
proportion to their respective interests set forth on EXHIBIT A.

                      (iv) In connection with any sale of Escrow Shares, the
Escrow Agent shall within five (5) business days of such sale, provide the
Designated Company Agent and Parent with written notice of the Escrow Cash
realized from such sale (net of all brokerage commissions and Escrow Agent
charges). In addition, after satisfaction of a claim hereunder, the Escrow Agent
shall within five (5) business days after satisfaction of such claim, provide
the Designated Company Agent and Parent with a written notice of the Escrow Cash
remaining in the Escrow Fund.

                      (v) In the event of a sale of Escrow Shares pursuant to
Section 2(f) hereunder, the Escrow Agent shall invest the Escrow Cash realized
from the sale of Escrow Shares (within two (2) business days of receipt thereof)
in the SSgA U.S. Treasury Money Market Fund; provided, however, that the Escrow
Agent shall (within 2 business days of receipt of a written request from the
Designated Company Agent) invest the Escrow Cash realized from a voluntary sale
pursuant to Section 2(f)(i) hereunder in accordance with the Designated Company
Agent's written request; provided, however, that the Designated Company Agent
may only request that the investment of Escrow Cash be made in treasury or money
market accounts of a nationally recognized financial institution (if the Escrow
Agent is unable to determine whether the financial institution is nationally
recognized, the Escrow Agent shall request and obtain Parent's consent prior to
making the requested investment, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld). Interest earnings on investments of Escrow Cash shall be reinvested
by the Escrow Agent in the investment to which such interest earnings pertain
unless otherwise instructed by the Designated Company Agent; provided, however,
that if such reinvestment is impracticable, the Escrow Agent shall notify the
Designated Company Agent requesting written instructions and, absent such
written instructions, shall not reinvest such interest earnings. To the extent
required by applicable laws or regulations, the Escrow Agent shall allocate any
interest earnings resulting from any investment of the Escrow Cash to the Escrow
Stockholders pro rata in accordance with each Escrow Stockholder's proportionate
interest in the Escrow Shares.

        3. ADMINISTRATION OF ESCROW ACCOUNT. Except as otherwise provided
herein, with respect to any claim pursuant to Section 9 of the Merger Agreement,
the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on the instructions of the Designated
Company Agent on behalf of the Escrow Stockholders and shall administer the
Escrow Account as follows:

               (a) If any Indemnitee has or claims to have incurred or suffered
Damages for which it is or may be entitled to indemnification, compensation or
reimbursement under Section 9 of the Merger Agreement, such Indemnitee may
deliver a claim notice (a "Claim Notice") to the Designated Company Agent and to
the Escrow Agent, on or prior to, but not after, the one year anniversary of the
Closing Date under the Merger Agreement (such one year anniversary being
referred to herein as the "Termination Date"); provided, however, that if, at
any time on or prior to the Termination Date, any Indemnitee (acting in good
faith) delivers to the Designated Company Agent and the Escrow Agent a Claim
Notice, then the claim asserted in such Claim Notice will survive the
Termination Date until such time as such claim is fully and finally resolved in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 3. The Escrow Agent shall not


                                       5.
<PAGE>   102

be deemed to have knowledge of termination of this Agreement earlier than the
Termination Date unless notice in writing of such earlier date has been provided
by Parent. Each Claim Notice shall state that such Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification, compensation or reimbursement under Section 9.2(a) of the
Merger Agreement and shall contain a brief description of the circumstances
supporting such Indemnitee's belief and shall contain a non-binding, preliminary
estimate of the amount of Damages such Indemnitee claims to have so incurred or
suffered (the "Claimed Amount").

               (b) Within 45 business days after receipt by the Designated
Company Agent of a Claim Notice, the Designated Company Agent may deliver to the
Indemnitee who delivered the Claim Notice and to the Escrow Agent a written
response (the "Response Notice") in which the Designated Company Agent: (i)
agrees that a whole number of Escrow Shares having a value equal to the full
Claimed Amount shall be sold by the Escrow Agent pursuant to Sections 2(f) and
(g) and the Escrow Cash realized by the sale may be released from the Escrow
Account to the Indemnitee; (ii) agrees that Escrow Shares having a value equal
to part, but not all, of the Claimed Amount (the "Agreed Amount") shall be sold
by the Escrow Agent pursuant to Sections 2(f) and (g) and the Escrow Cash
realized by the sale may be released from the Escrow Account to the Indemnitee
or (iii) indicates that no part of the Claimed Amount may be released from the
Escrow Account to the Indemnitee. Any part of the Claimed Amount that is not to
be released to the Indemnitee shall be the "Contested Amount." If a Response
Notice is not received by the Escrow Agent within such 45 business-day period,
then the Designated Company Agent shall be deemed to have agreed that Escrow
Shares having a value equal to the full Claimed Amount shall be sold by the
Escrow Agent pursuant to Sections 2(f) and (g) and the Escrow Cash realized by
the sale may be released to the Indemnitee from the Escrow Account.

               (c) If the Designated Company Agent delivers a Response Notice
agreeing that Escrow Shares having a value equal to the full Claimed Amount
shall be sold by the Escrow Agent pursuant to Sections 2(f) and (g) and the
Escrow Cash realized by the sale may be released from the Escrow Account to the
Indemnitee, or if the Designated Company Agent does not deliver a Response
Notice in accordance with Section 3(b) within the 45 business-day period
specified in Section 3(b), the Escrow Agent shall within five (5) business days
following the receipt of the Response Notice (or, if the Escrow Agent has not
received a Response Notice, within three (3) business days following the
expiration of the 45 business-day period referred to in Section 3(b)), sell or
cause to be sold such Escrow Shares pursuant to Sections 2(f) and (g) and the
Escrow Agent shall deliver or cause to be delivered to such Indemnitee the
Escrow Cash realized by the sale. Such payment shall be deemed to be made in
full satisfaction of the claim described in such Claim Notice and Escrow Agent
shall not be liable for the Claim Amount so released.

               (d) If the Designated Company Agent delivers a Response Notice
agreeing that Escrow Shares having a value equal to part, but not all, of the
Claimed Amount shall be sold by the Escrow Agent pursuant to Sections 2(f) and
(g) and the Escrow Cash realized by the sale may be released from the Escrow
Account to the Indemnitee, the Escrow Agent shall within five (5) business days
following the receipt of the Response Notice sell or cause to be sold such
Escrow Shares pursuant to Sections 2(f) and (g) and the Escrow Agent shall
deliver or cause to be delivered to such Indemnitee the Escrow Cash equal to the
Agreed Amount.


                                       6.
<PAGE>   103

               (e) If the Designated Company Agent delivers a Response Notice
indicating that there is a Contested Amount, the Designated Company Agent and
the Indemnitee shall attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute related to the
Contested Amount. If the Indemnitee and the Designated Company Agent shall
resolve such dispute, such resolution shall be binding on all of the Escrow
Stockholders and all of the Indemnitees and a settlement agreement shall be
signed by the Indemnitee and the Designated Company Agent and sent to the Escrow
Agent, who shall, within five (5) business days following receipt thereof, if
applicable, sell or cause to be sold pursuant to Section 2(g) Escrow Shares from
the Escrow Account in accordance with such agreement and having a value
approximately equal to the amount set forth in such settlement agreement (the
"Settlement Amount") and shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the
Indemnitee Escrow Cash equal to the Settlement Amount.

               (f) If the Designated Company Agent and the Indemnitee are unable
to resolve the dispute relating to any Contested Amount within 45 days after the
delivery of the Claim Notice, then the Escrow Agent shall retain the Contested
Amount in the Escrow Account until it receives either (i) a final non-appealable
court order from a court of competent jurisdiction, or (ii) written instructions
signed by Parent and the Designated Company Agent, in which case the Escrow
Agent shall follow the instructions set forth in such court order or written
instructions.

               (g) Any Escrow Cash released from the Escrow Account to an
Indemnitee shall be deemed to reduce the Escrow Cash pro rata with respect to
each Escrow Stockholder in accordance with each Escrow Stockholder's percentage
interest in the Escrow Fund set forth in EXHIBIT A.

        4. RELEASE OF ESCROW SHARES AND ESCROW CASH.

               (a) Within five (5) business days after the Termination Date, the
Escrow Agent shall distribute or cause the stock transfer agent for the Parent
Common Stock to distribute to each of the Escrow Stockholders at such Escrow
Stockholder's address set forth on EXHIBIT A (or at such other address(es) as
the Designated Company Agent shall provide the Escrow Agent) such Escrow
Stockholder's pro-rata portion of the Escrow Shares and Escrow Cash then held in
escrow (less any shares or cash distributed to the Designated Company Agent
pursuant to Section 10 hereof) and based on the percentage interests in the
Escrow Fund set forth in EXHIBIT A; provided, however, that if prior to the
Termination Date, any Indemnitee has given a Claim Notice containing a claim
which has not been resolved prior to the Termination Date in accordance with
Section 3, the Escrow Agent shall retain in the Escrow Account after the
Termination Date Escrow Shares and/or Escrow Cash having a value equal to 100%
of the Claimed Amount or Contested Amount, as the case may be, with respect to
all claims which have not then been resolved.

               (b) The Escrow Agent is not the stock transfer agent for the
Parent Common Stock. Accordingly, if a distribution of a number of shares of
Parent Common Stock less than all of the Escrow Shares is to be made, the Escrow
Agent must requisition the appropriate number of shares from such stock transfer
agent, delivering to it the appropriate stock certificate(s). For the purposes
of this Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall be deemed to have delivered Parent
Common Stock to the Person entitled to it when the Escrow Agent has delivered
such certificates to such stock transfer agent with instructions to deliver it
to the appropriate Person. Distributions


                                       7.
<PAGE>   104

of Parent Common Stock shall be made to Parent or the Escrow Stockholders, as
appropriate, at the addresses described in Section 11(b) or set forth on EXHIBIT
A hereto. Whenever a distribution of Escrow Shares or Escrow Cash is to be made
to the Escrow Stockholders, pro rata distributions shall be made to each of them
based on their proportionate interest in the Escrow Fund and at their addresses
set forth in EXHIBIT A.

               (c) Whenever a release of Escrow Shares occurs pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall be authorized to request and
shall request that the transfer agent for the Parent Common Stock remove the
Escrow Legend from the Escrow Shares being released.

               (d) In the event the Designated Company Agent has assumed the
defense of a third-party claim pursuant to Section 9.6 of the Merger Agreement,
the Designated Company Agent shall be authorized to direct the Escrow Agent to
use Escrow Cash then held in the Escrow Fund (or to sell Escrow Shares pursuant
to Section 2(f)(i) and use the Escrow Cash realized thereby) to cover the costs
of such defense without regard to the lockup restrictions set forth in Section
2(f)(i) hereof. Upon receipt of a written notice from the Designated Company
Agent specifying the amount of Escrow Cash to be distributed to cover the
defense of such a third-party claim (or the number of Escrow Shares to be sold
by the Escrow Agent pursuant to Section 2(f)(i)) and the manner of such
distribution, the Escrow Agent shall so distribute the amount of Escrow Cash
specified in such notice or sell the number of Escrow Shares specified in such
notice and distribute the Escrow Cash realized thereby.

        5. STOCK SPLITS. All numbers contained in, and all calculations required
to be made pursuant to, this Agreement shall be adjusted as appropriate to
reflect any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend or similar
transaction effected by Parent after the date hereof; provided, however, that
the Escrow Agent shall have received notice of such stock split or other action
and shall have received the appropriate number of additional shares of Parent
Common Stock or other property pursuant to Section 2(c) hereof. In the event of
any such stock split or other similar occurrence, Parent and the Designated
Company Agent shall deliver to the Designated Company Agent, within five (5)
business days of such event, a revised EXHIBIT A setting forth the new number of
Escrow Shares to be held in the Escrow Fund. Unless and until the Escrow Agent
receives the certificates representing additional shares of Parent Common Stock
or other property pursuant to Section 2(c), the Escrow Agent may assume without
inquiry that no such stock or other property has been or is required to be
issued with respect to Escrow Shares.

        6. FEES AND EXPENSES. Upon the execution of this Agreement by all
parties hereto and the initial deposit of the Escrow Fund in the Escrow Account,
fees and expenses, in accordance with EXHIBIT B attached hereto, will be payable
to the Escrow Agent. This annual Escrow Agent fee will cover the first twelve
months of the escrow. In accordance with EXHIBIT B attached hereto, the Escrow
Agent will also be entitled to reimbursement for reasonable and documented
out-of-pocket expenses, including those of its counsel, incurred by the Escrow
Agent in the performance of its duties hereunder and the execution and delivery
of this Agreement. All such fees and expenses shall be paid by Parent, except
for the payment of Transaction Fees (it being understood that the payment of
Transaction Fees shall reduce the net


                                       8.
<PAGE>   105

proceeds realized from the sale of Escrow Shares and shall have the effect of
reducing the amount of Escrow Cash held in the Escrow Fund).

        7. LIMITATION OF ESCROW AGENT'S LIABILITY.

               (a) The Escrow Agent undertakes to perform such duties as are
specifically set forth in this Agreement only each of which are solely
ministerial in nature, and shall have no duty under or obligation to determine
compliance with, any other agreement or document notwithstanding their being
referred to herein or attached hereto as an exhibit. The Escrow Agent shall not
be liable except for the performance of such duties as are specifically set
forth in this Agreement, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read
into this Agreement against the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall not be
deemed to be a fiduciary and shall incur no liability with respect to any action
taken by it or for any inaction on its part in reliance upon any notice,
direction, instruction, consent, statement or other document believed by it to
be genuine and duly authorized, nor for any other action or inaction except for
its own willful misconduct or negligence. In all questions arising under this
Agreement, the Escrow Agent may rely on the advice of counsel, and for anything
done, omitted or suffered in good faith by the Escrow Agent based upon such
advice the Escrow Agent shall not be liable to anyone. The Escrow Agent shall
not be required to take any action hereunder involving any expense unless the
payment of such expense is made or provided for in a manner reasonably
satisfactory to it. In no event shall the Escrow Agent be liable for incidental,
punitive or consequential damages whatsoever, even if the Escrow Agent has been
advised of the likelihood of such damages.

               (b) Parent hereby agrees to indemnify the Escrow Agent, its
officers, directors, employees and agents for, and hold it harmless against, any
loss, liability or expense incurred without negligence or willful misconduct on
the part of Escrow Agent, arising out of or in connection with its carrying out
of its duties hereunder. This right of indemnification shall survive the
termination of this Agreement, and the resignation of the Escrow Agent. The
costs and expenses of enforcing this right of indemnification shall also be paid
by Parent.

               (c) In the event that the Escrow Agent should at any time be (i)
confronted with inconsistent or conflicting claims or demands by the other
parties hereto or (ii) unsure of its duties hereunder, the Escrow Agent shall
have the right to interplead the parties in any California court or any court of
competent jurisdiction and request that such court determine the respective
rights of the parties with respect to this Agreement and, upon doing so, the
Escrow Agent shall be released from any obligations or liability to the other
parties as a consequence of any such claims or demands. The Escrow Agent may
consult counsel satisfactory to it, including in-house counsel, and will be
protected in respect of any action taken or omitted in reliance thereon.

               (d) The Escrow Agent may execute any of its powers or
responsibilities hereunder and exercise any rights hereunder, either directly or
by or through its agents or attorneys. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed
to impose upon the Escrow Agent any duty to qualify to do business in any
jurisdiction other than California. The Escrow Agent shall not be responsible
for and shall not be under a duty to examine, inquire into or pass upon the
validity, binding effect, execution or sufficiency of this Agreement or of any
amendment or supplement hereto.


                                       9.
<PAGE>   106

        8. TERMINATION. This Agreement shall terminate on the Termination Date
or, if earlier, upon the release by the Escrow Agent of the entire Escrow Fund
in accordance with this Agreement; provided, however, that if the Escrow Agent
has received from any Indemnitee a Claim Notice setting forth a claim that has
not been resolved by the Termination Date, then this Agreement shall continue in
full force and effect until the claim has been resolved and the Escrow Shares
sold and the Escrow Cash released in accordance with this Agreement.

        9. SUCCESSOR ESCROW AGENT. In the event the Escrow Agent becomes
unavailable or unwilling to continue as escrow agent under this Agreement, the
Escrow Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties and obligations
hereunder by giving its written resignation to the parties to this Agreement.
Such resignation shall take effect not less than 30 calendar days after it is
given to all parties hereto. Parent may appoint a successor Escrow Agent only
with the consent of a majority in interest of the Escrow Stockholders (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). If the parties fail to
agree on a successor Escrow Agent within such time, the Escrow Agent shall have
the right to apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a
successor Escrow Agent. The successor Escrow Agent shall execute and deliver to
the Escrow Agent an instrument accepting such appointment, and the successor
Escrow Agent shall, without further acts, be vested with all the estates,
property rights, powers and duties of the predecessor Escrow Agent as if
originally named as Escrow Agent herein. The Escrow Agent shall act in
accordance with written instructions from Parent and the Designated Company
Agent as to the transfer of the Escrow Fund to a successor escrow agent.

        10. DESIGNATED COMPANY AGENT. Pursuant to Section 10.1 of the Merger
Agreement, the Company irrevocably appointed _______________, as Designated
Company Agent, to act on behalf of the Company and the Escrow Stockholders as
their agent for purposes of the Merger Agreement, which includes their consent
to allow the Designated Company Agent to give and receive notices and
communications, to authorize delivery to Parent of Parent Common Stock, Escrow
Cash or other property from the Escrow Fund, to object to such deliveries, to
agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises, comply with orders
of courts with respect to such claims and to take all actions necessary or
appropriate in the judgment of the Designated Company Agent for the
accomplishment of the foregoing. Section 10.1 of the Merger Agreement provides
that a majority in interest of the Escrow Stockholders shall appoint a new
representative to serve as the Designated Company Agent if the person acting as
the Designated Company Agent should die, become disabled or otherwise be unable
to fulfill his or her responsibilities. The Designated Company Agent shall not
be responsible for any act done or omitted thereunder as Designated Company
Agent while acting in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment. The
Designated Company Agent shall be indemnified out of the Escrow Fund and held
harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on the part of the Designated
Company Agent and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of the Designated Company Agent's duties hereunder, including the
reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel or other professional retained
by the Designated Company Agent. The Designated Company Agent shall be paid (i)
the reasonable fees of the Designated Company Agent relating to his services
performed in such capacity and (ii) all costs and expenses, including those of
any legal counsel or other professional retained by the Designated Company
Agent, in connection with the acceptance and administration of the Designated
Company Agent's duties hereunder. Subject to the prior right of Parent to make
claims for Damages, the Designated Company Agent


                                      10.
<PAGE>   107

shall have the right to recover from the Escrow Fund, prior to any distribution
to the Escrow Stockholders pursuant to Section 4(a) or Section 4(b) hereof, a
number of Escrow Shares (or an equivalent amount of Escrow Cash then held in
escrow) set forth in a certificate of the Designated Company Agent delivered to
the Escrow Agent at least two (2) business days prior to the date on which a
distribution is to be made to the Escrow Stockholders equal to the quotient
obtained by dividing (i) any reasonable fees, costs and expenses set forth in
such certificate, including those of any legal counsel or other professional
retained by the Designated Company Agent, in connection with the acceptance and
administration of the Designated Company Agent's duties hereunder, by (ii) the
average of the closing sales price of Parent Common Stock on the Nasdaq National
Market as reported in the Wall Street Journal for the twenty (20) trading days
preceding the Closing Date under the Merger Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall
not be required to verify or confirm the amounts set forth in such certificate
or determine that reasonableness of such amounts and shall be entitled to rely
on such certificate in making payments to Designated Company Agent hereunder.
The Escrow Agent agrees to deliver to the Designated Company Agent such number
of Escrow Shares, or an equivalent amount of Escrow Cash then held in escrow,
prior to making any distribution of Escrow Shares or Escrow Cash to the Escrow
Stockholders.

        11. MISCELLANEOUS.

               (a) ATTORNEYS' FEES. If any action or proceeding relating to this
Agreement or the enforcement of any provision of this Agreement is brought

Sections 6 and 7), the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable
attorneys' fees, costs and disbursements (in addition to any other relief to
which the prevailing party may be entitled).

permitted to be delivered to any party under this Agreement shall be in writing

Documentation is not so certified to the Escrow Agent, the Escrow Agent shall be
required by the Internal Revenue Code, as it may be amended from time to time,
to withhold and remit to the Internal Revenue Service a portion of any interest
or other income earned on the investment of monies or other property held by the
Escrow Agent pursuant to this Agreement.
