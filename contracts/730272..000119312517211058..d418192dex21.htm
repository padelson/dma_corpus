Investor based on the Certification Form, and any Company Securityholder that
does not deliver such a Certification Form prior to the delivery of the
Spreadsheet, will receive solely cash for such holders portion of the Merger
Consideration in respect of his, her or its Company Capital Stock instead of
the mix of cash and Parent Common Stock provided for herein.

(b) _Effect on Company Capital Stock_.

 

(i) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the First Merger and without any
action on the part of Parent, First Merger Sub, the Company or the Company
Stockholders, each share of Company Capital Stock that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding any shares of
Company Capital Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.6(b)(ii) and any
Dissenting Shares) shall be canceled and extinguished and shall be converted
into the right to receive, upon surrender of the certificates representing
such share of Company Capital Stock, together with a duly executed and
completed Letter of Transmittal, in the manner provided in Section 2.8:

 

(A) in the case of an Accredited Investor that owns shares of Company Capital
Stock, (i) the Per Common Share Consideration, _minus_ (ii) an amount of cash
equal to the Per Share Escrow Amount multiplied by the Cash Consideration
Percentage, to be withheld and contributed to the Escrow Fund, _minus_ (iii) a
number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to (x) the Per Share Escrow
Amount _multiplied by_ the Stock Consideration Percentage, _divided by_ (y)
the Parent Common Stock Price, to be withheld and contributed to the Escrow
Fund, _minus_  (iv) the Per Share WC Escrow Amount, to be withheld and
contributed to the WC Escrow Fund, _plus_ (v) any Additional Per Share
Consideration, subject to (and without limiting any rights or remedies of the
Parent Indemnified Parties under this Agreement) the obligation of the
Company Stockholder that owns such share of Company Capital Stock immediately
prior to the Effective Time to return to Parent or the applicable Parent
Indemnified Parties the amount so received as a result of such conversion to
the extent such Company Stockholder has, at any time and from time to time,
any unsatisfied payment obligations to such Parent Indemnified Parties
pursuant to, and subject to the terms and conditions of, Section 2.9(b)(iii)
and Article IX; _provided_ , that the Parent Common Stock to be put in escrow
or delivered to an Accredited Investor shall in each case be rounded down to
the nearest whole number of shares after aggregating all shares put in escrow
or delivered to a Company Securityholder, as applicable; and

(B) in the case of a Company Stockholder that is a Non-Accredited Investor
that owns shares of Company Capital Stock, cash in the amount of (i) the Non-
Accredited Per Common Share Consideration _minus_ (ii) an amount in cash
equal to the Per Share Escrow Amount, to be withheld and contributed to the
Escrow Fund, _minus_ (iii) the Per Share WC Escrow Amount, to be withheld and
contributed to the WC Escrow Fund, _plus_ (iv) any Additional Per Share
Consideration, subject to (and without limiting any rights or remedies of the
Parent Indemnified Parties under this Agreement) the obligation of the Company
Stockholder that owns such share of Company Capital

 



20  Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time to return to Parent or the
applicable Parent Indemnified Parties the amount so received as a result of
such conversion to the extent such Company Stockholder has, at any time and
from time to time, any unsatisfied payment obligations to such Parent
Indemnified Parties pursuant to, and subject to the terms and conditions of,
Section 2.9(b)(iii) and Article IX. 

(ii) Each share of Company Capital Stock held in the treasury of the Company
or by Parent or the Merger Subs immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof and no payment or
distribution shall be made with respect thereto.

 

(c) _Treatment of Phantom Share Equivalents_.

 

(A) _Effect on Qualifying Phantom Share Equivalents_. At the Effective Time,
the holder of each Qualifying Phantom Share Equivalent shall, by virtue of
the First Merger, be entitled to receive, subject to compliance with and in
the manner provided in Section 2.8, for each such Qualifying Phantom Share
Equivalent, (i) the Accredited Per Phantom Share Consideration, _minus_ (ii)
an amount of cash equal to the Per Share Escrow Amount multiplied by the Cash
Consideration Percentage, to be withheld and contributed to the Escrow Fund,
_minus_ (iii) a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to (x) the Per
Share Escrow Amount _multiplied by_ the Stock Consideration Percentage,
_divided by_ (y) the Parent Common Stock Price, to be withheld and contributed
to the Escrow Fund,  _minus_ (iv) the Per Share WC Escrow Amount, to be
withheld and contributed to the WC Escrow Fund, _plus_ (v) any Additional Per
Phantom Share Consideration, subject to (and without limiting any rights or
remedies of the Parent Indemnified Parties under this Agreement) the
obligation of the Company Securityholder that owns such Qualifying Phantom
Share Equivalent immediately prior to the Effective Time to return to Parent
or the applicable Parent Indemnified Parties the amount so received as a
result of such conversion to the extent such Company Securityholder has, at
any time and from time to time, any unsatisfied payment obligations to such
Parent Indemnified Parties pursuant to, and subject to the terms
and conditions of, Section 2.9(b)(iii) and Article IX; _provided_ , that the
Parent Common Stock to be put in escrow or delivered to an Accredited Investor
shall in each case be rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares
after aggregating all shares put in escrow or delivered to a Company
Securityholder, as applicable.

 

(B) _Effect on Non-Qualifying Phantom Share Equivalents_. At the
Effective Time, the holder of each Non-Qualifying Phantom Share Equivalent
shall, by virtue of the First Merger, be entitled to receive, subject to
compliance with and in the manner provided in Section 2.8, for each such Non-
Qualifying Phantom Share Equivalent, cash in the amount of (i) the Non-
Accredited Per Common Share Consideration _minus_ (ii) an amount in cash
equal to the Per Share Escrow Amount, to be withheld and contributed to the
Escrow Fund, _minus_ (iii) the Per Share WC Escrow Amount, to be withheld and
contributed to the WC Escrow Fund, _plus_ (iv) any Additional Per Phantom
Share Consideration, subject to (and without limiting any rights or remedies
of the Parent Indemnified Parties under this Agreement) the obligation of the
Company Securityholder that owns such Non-Qualifying Phantom Share Equivalent
immediately prior to the Effective Time to return to Parent or the applicable
Parent Indemnified Parties the amount so received as a result of such
conversion to the extent such Company Securityholder has, at any time and
from time to time, any unsatisfied payment obligations to such Parent
Indemnified Parties pursuant to, and subject to the terms and conditions of,
Section 2.9(b)(iii) and Article IX.

(d) _Effect on Capital Stock of First Merger Sub and Second Merger Sub_.

 

(i) _First Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock of First Merger Sub issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share
of common stock of the First Step Surviving Corporation. Each stock
certificate of First Merger Sub evidencing ownership of any shares of common
stock shall

 



21  continue to evidence ownership of such share of common stock of the First
Step Surviving Corporation.

 

(ii) _Second Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock of the First Step
Surviving Corporation issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Second
Effective Time shall be converted into and exchanged for one validly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable unit of the Final Surviving Company. Each unit
certificate, if any, of Second Merger Sub evidencing ownership of any units
shall continue to evidence ownership of such unit of the Final Surviving
Company.

 

(e) In no event shall the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock
issued hereunder (the "Issued Shares"), including the Escrow Stock Amount,
exceed a number of shares equal to 19.9% of the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Closing (the "19.9%
Threshold"). In the event that the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
otherwise comprising the Issued Shares would exceed the 19.9% Threshold, the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock issued as part of the Merger
Consideration will be cut back to the 19.9% Threshold and the cash paid as
part of the Merger Consideration will be increased by an amount equal to the
Parent Common Stock Price with respect to each cut back share of Parent Common
Stock.

 

(f) Any cash proceeds payable to a Company Securityholder under Section 2.6
shall first be reduced by any outstanding loans owed by such Company
Securityholder as of the Closing to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(each, a "Securityholder Loan").

 

2.7 _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, shares of
Company Capital Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and which are held by Company Stockholders who have exercised and
perfected appraisal rights for such shares of Company Capital Stock in
accordance with the CGCL (collectively, the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be
converted into or represent the right to receive any portion of the Merger
Consideration. Such Company Stockholders shall be entitled only to such rights
as are granted by the CGCL to a holder of Dissenting Shares, unless and until
such Company Stockholders fail to perfect or effectively withdraw or
otherwise lose their appraisal rights under the CGCL. All Dissenting Shares
held by Company Stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who
effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their right to appraisal of such
shares of Company Capital Stock under the CGCL shall thereupon be deemed to
have been converted into and to have become exchangeable for, as of the
Effective Time, the right to receive the applicable portion of the Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon and less any applicable Tax
withholding, upon the surrender of the certificate representing such shares of
Company Capital Stock and a duly executed and completed Letter of Transmittal.

 

(b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
related instruments served pursuant to the CGCL and received by the Company
and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to demands for appraisal under the CGCL. The Company shall
not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such
demands.

 

2.8 _Exchange Mechanics_.

 

(a) Promptly following the Effective Time, but in no event later than one (1)
Business Day thereafter, Parent shall deposit the Escrow Amount and the WC
Escrow Amount to the Escrow Agent.

(b) As soon as commercially practicable (but not more than ten (10) Business
Days) after the date hereof, the Company shall mail or otherwise deliver to
each Company Stockholder a letter of transmittal in substantially the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit G_ (each, a "Letter of Transmittal") to the
address set forth

 



22  opposite such holders name on the Spreadsheet. After receipt of such Letter
of Transmittal and any other documents (including a Certification Form
pursuant to Section 2.6(a)) that Parent may reasonably require in order to
effect the exchange (the "Exchange Documents"), such Company Stockholder shall
surrender the certificates representing his, her or its shares of the Company
Capital Stock (the "Company Stock Certificates") to the Company (or Parent
following the Closing) for cancellation at the Effective Time together with
duly completed and validly executed Exchange Documents. Within the later to
occur of (i) five (5) Business Days of the receipt of the Company Stock
Certificates and Exchange Documents by Parent or (ii) one (1) Business Day
following the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the holder of such
Company Stock Certificates or Phantom Share Equivalents, (I) if such holder
is an Accredited Investor, in exchange therefor the Per Common Share
Consideration in respect of such share of Company Capital Stock or the
Accredited Per Phantom Share Consideration in respect of such Qualifying
Phantom Share Equivalent, or (II) if such holder is a Non-Accredited Investor,
in exchange therefor the Non-Accredited Per Common Share Consideration in
respect of each share of Company Capital Stock or such Non-Qualifying Phantom
Share Equivalent so surrendered for cancellation by such holder, in each case
excluding the amounts to be withheld and contributed to the Escrow Fund and
the WC Escrow Fund in accordance with Section 2.6. The Company Stock
Certificates so surrendered shall be canceled. Until so surrendered, after the
Effective Time, subject to appraisal rights under the CGCL, each Company
Stock Certificate will be deemed, for all corporate purposes thereafter, to
evidence only the right to receive the consideration provided for in this
Article II. No portion of the Per Common Share Consideration, Non-Accredited
Per Common Share Consideration or any Additional Per Share Consideration, as
the case may be, in each case excluding the amounts to be withheld and
contributed to the Escrow Fund and the WC Escrow Fund in accordance with
Section 2.6, shall be paid to any Company Stockholder that has not surrendered
his, her or its Company Stock Certificate until the holder of record of such
Company Stock Certificate shall surrender such Company Stock Certificate and
the Exchange Documents pursuant hereto.

(c) _Legend on Share Certificates_. The certificates representing the shares
of Parent Common Stock issuable in the Merger, shall include an endorsement
typed or otherwise denoted conspicuously thereon of the following legend
(along with any other legends that may be required under applicable Laws):

"THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, AND HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED FOR INVESTMENT AND
NOT WITH A VIEW TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THE SALE OR DISTRIBUTION THEREOF.
NO TRANSFER MAY BE EFFECTED WITHOUT AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT
RELATED THERETO OR AN OPINION OF COUNSEL IN A FORM SATISFACTORY TO THE
COMPANY THAT SUCH REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF
1933, AS AMENDED."

In the event that any shares of Parent Common Stock issuable hereunder shall
cease to be Restricted Shares, Parent shall, upon the written request of the
holder thereof, issue to such holder a new certificate representing such
shares of Parent Common Stock without the legend required by the foregoing.

(d) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or
other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to
shares of Parent Common Stock comprising part of the Base Parent Stock
Consideration with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock Certificates with respect to the
shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby until the holder of such
Company Stock Certificate shall surrender such Company Stock Certificate in
accordance with this Section 2.8.

(e) _Return of the Merger Consideration_. Any portion of the Merger
Consideration that remains unclaimed by the former holders of the Company
Capital Stock or holders of Phantom Share Equivalents for twelve (12) months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent. Any former holder of
Company Capital Stock or holder of Phantom Share Equivalents that has not
complied with this Section 2.8 prior to the end of such twelve-month period
shall thereafter look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat
or other similar 

 



23  Laws) but only as a general creditor thereof for payment of its claim for
its portion of the Merger Consideration. Any portion of the Merger
Consideration that remains unclaimed immediately prior to the date on which
it would otherwise become subject to any abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law, shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto. No interest shall be payable for any
shares of Parent Common Stock delivered to Parent pursuant to this Section
2.8(e) or cash which is subsequently delivered to any former holder of
Company Capital Stock or holder of Phantom Share Equivalents.

(f) _No Further Rights in the Company Capital Stock_. The applicable portion
of the Merger Consideration paid or payable in respect of the surrender for
exchange of shares of the Company Capital Stock in accordance with the terms
hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such shares and there shall be no further registration of
transfer on the records of the Final Surviving Company of such shares that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Company Stock Certificates are presented to the Final
Surviving Company for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this Section 2.8.

 

(g) _Lost Certificates or Documentation_. If any Company Stock Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Company Stock Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of
a bond, in such amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Company Stock Certificate,
the Final Surviving Company or Parent, as applicable, shall issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate, the applicable
portion of the Merger Consideration to which such Person is entitled pursuant
to the provisions of Section 2.6.

 

(h) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
2.8, none of Parent, the Escrow Agent, the Final Surviving Company or any
other party hereto shall be liable to any holder of any Company Capital Stock
or any holder of any Phantom Share Equivalents for any amount paid to a public
official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(i) _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in
exchange for any Company Capital Stock or Qualifying Phantom Share
Equivalents, and no holder of any of the foregoing shall be entitled to
receive a fractional share of Parent Common Stock. In the event that any
holder of Company Capital Stock or Phantom Share Equivalents would otherwise
be entitled to receive a fractional share of Parent Common Stock (after
aggregating all shares and fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable to such holder), then such holder shall be paid an amount in Dollars
(without interest) determined by multiplying (i) the Parent Common Stock Price
by (ii) the fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder
would otherwise be entitled. The parties acknowledge that payment of cash
consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock was
not separately bargained for consideration but represents merely a mechanical
rounding off for purposes of simplifying the problems that would otherwise be
caused by the issuance of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock.

2.9 _Working Capital Adjustment_.

(a) _Preparation of Estimated Closing Balance Sheet; Estimated Net Working
Capital_.

 

(i) The Company shall prepare in good faith and, at least three (3) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, deliver to Parent (A) an estimated balance
sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, which shall
be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, as of the close of
business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing Date,
reflecting thereon the Companys best estimate of all balance sheet items of
the Company (together with the estimated calculations referenced below, the
"Estimated Closing Balance Sheet"), (B) the Net Working Capital of the
Company, based on the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet ("Estimated Net Working
Capital"),

 



24  (C) the unpaid Transaction Expenses as of immediately prior to the Closing
("Estimated Transaction Expenses"), (D) the unpaid Indebtedness of the Company
and its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Closing ("Estimated
Indebtedness") and (E) Cash ("Estimated Cash"). The Estimated Closing Balance
Sheet, the Estimated Net Working Capital, the Estimated Transaction Expenses,
the Estimated Indebtedness and the Estimated Cash shall be prepared in
accordance with GAAP. The Company shall also provide reasonable detail
supporting each such calculation.

 

(ii) Following receipt of the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, the Company
shall permit Parent and its representatives at all reasonable times and upon
reasonable notice to review the Companys and its Subsidiaries working papers
relating to the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet (including the Estimated Net
Working Capital, the Estimated Transaction Expenses, the Estimated
Indebtedness and the Estimated Cash) as well as all of the Companys and its
Subsidiaries accounting books and records relating to the determination of
the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, and the Company shall make reasonably
available its representatives responsible for the preparation of the Estimated
Closing Balance Sheet in order to respond to the reasonable inquiries of
Parent. Prior to Closing, the parties shall discuss in good faith the
computation of any of the items on the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet
(including the Estimated Net Working Capital, the Estimated Transaction
Expenses, the Estimated Indebtedness and the Estimated Cash).

 

(iii) As promptly as practicable following the date hereof (and in any event,
within ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof), the Company shall
provide Parent with its good faith estimate of the cash needs of each foreign
Subsidiary of the Company on a per calendar month basis following the Closing.
Within ten (10) Business Days of Parents receipt of such estimates, Parent
shall provide the Company with the amount of unrestricted cash at each foreign
Subsidiary required to be at the Company at the Closing (which shall not
exceed three times the per calendar month estimate for such
foreign Subsidiary) (each, a "Minimum Cash Amount"). The parties hereto agree
that the Repatriation Discount shall not apply to any Minimum Cash Amount
notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein.

 

(b) _Preparation of Final Closing Balance Sheet_.

 

(i) As promptly as practicable, but no later than one hundred twenty (120)
days after the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare and deliver to the
Securityholder Representative (A) a balance sheet of the Company as of the
close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing Date,
reflecting thereon Parents determination of the balance sheet of the Company
and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis as of the close of business on
the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing Date (the "Closing Balance
Sheet"), (B) the Net Working Capital of the Company based on the Closing
Balance Sheet, (C) the unpaid Transaction Expenses as of immediately prior to
the Closing, (D) the unpaid Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries
as of immediately prior to the Closing, and (E) Cash.

 

(ii) Unless the Securityholder Representative delivers the Dispute Notice
within forty-five (45) days after receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet, such
Closing Balance Sheet shall be deemed the "Final Closing Balance Sheet," shall
be binding upon the Company Securityholders and Parent and shall not be
subject to dispute or review. If the Securityholder Representative disagrees
with the Closing Balance Sheet, the Securityholder Representative may, within
forty-five (45) days after receipt thereof, notify Parent in writing (the
"Dispute Notice"), which Dispute Notice shall provide reasonable detail of
the nature of each disputed item on the Closing Balance Sheet, including all
supporting documentation thereto, and the Securityholder Representative shall
be deemed to have agreed with all other items and amounts contained in the
Closing Balance Sheet delivered pursuant to this Section 2.9(b)(ii). Parent
and the Securityholder Representative shall first use commercially reasonable
efforts to resolve such dispute between themselves and, if Parent and the
Securityholder Representative are able to resolve such dispute, the Closing
Balance Sheet shall be revised to the extent necessary to reflect such
resolution, shall be deemed the "Final Closing Balance Sheet" and shall be
conclusive and

 



25  binding upon the Company Securityholders and Parent and shall not be subject
to dispute or review. If Parent and the Securityholder Representative are
unable to resolve the dispute within fifteen (15) days after receipt by
Parent of the Dispute Notice, Parent and the Securityholder Representative
shall submit the dispute to a nationally recognized independent accounting
firm selected by Parent and the Securityholder Representative which shall not
have been engaged for any material matter, directly or indirectly, by any
party hereto within the preceding two years (the "Accountants"). The
Accountants shall be directed to act as experts and not arbiters and shall
be directed to determine only those items that remain in dispute on the
Closing Balance Sheet. Each of Parent and the Securityholder Representative
shall furnish to the Accountants such workpapers and other documents and
information relating to such objections as the Accountants may reasonably
request and are available to that party or its Affiliates (or its independent
public accountants) and will be afforded the opportunity to present to the
Accountants any material relating to the determination of the matters in
dispute and to discuss such determination with the Accountants. Each of Parent
and the Securityholder Representative shall assign a value to each disputed
item and the Accountants shall determine each disputed item separately (based
on the determination that most closely complies with the terms of this
Agreement), but shall not assign a value to any disputed item that is greater
than the greatest value for such disputed item assigned to it by either party
or less than the smallest value for such disputed item assigned to it by
either party. Promptly, but no later than thirty (30) days after engagement,
the Accountants shall deliver a written report to Parent and the
Securityholder Representative as to the resolution of the disputed items, the
resulting Closing Balance Sheet and the resulting calculation of Net Working
Capital, Transaction Expenses, Indebtedness and Cash. The Closing Balance
Sheet as determined by the Accountants shall be deemed the "Final Closing
Balance Sheet," shall be conclusive and binding upon the Company
Securityholders and Parent and shall not be subject to dispute or review. The
fees and expenses of the Accountants in connection with the resolution of
disputes pursuant to this Section 2.9(b)(ii) shall be paid (A) by the Company
Securityholders, if Parents calculation of the portion of the Closing Net
Working Capital in dispute is closer to the Accountants determination than
the Securityholder Representatives calculation thereof, (B) by Parent, if the
reverse is true or (C) except as provided in clauses (A) or (B) above, equally
by the Company Securityholders and Parent. Parent and the Securityholder
Representative agree that they will, and agree to cause their respective
representatives and independent accountants to, cooperate and assist in the
preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet and in the conduct of the reviews
referred to in this Section 2.9(b)(ii), including the making promptly
available to the extent necessary of books, records, work papers and
personnel.

 

(iii) The Base Cash Consideration, in accordance with Article I, shall be
adjusted, dollar for dollar, downwards to the extent that the Adjustment
Amount is negative and upwards to the extent the Adjustment Amount is
positive. The "Adjustment Amount" means an amount equal to the sum of (A) the
Net Working Capital set forth on the Final Closing Balance Sheet (the
"Closing Net Working Capital") _minus_ the Estimated Net Working Capital, (B)
the Estimated Transaction Expenses _minus_ the Transaction Expenses set forth
on the Final Closing Balance Sheet (the "Closing Transaction Expenses"), (C)
the Estimated Indebtedness _minus_ the amount the Indebtedness set forth on
the Final Closing Balance Sheet (the "Closing Indebtedness") and (D) the Cash
set forth on the Final Closing Balance Sheet (the "Closing Cash") minus the
Estimated Cash. Within three (3) Business Days following the determination of
the Closing Net Working Capital, the Closing Transaction Expenses, the
Closing Indebtedness and the Closing Cash in accordance with Section
2.9(b)(ii), (A) if the Adjustment Amount is negative, Parent shall be entitled
to first recover from the WC Escrow Fund and then, to the extent necessary,
from the Escrow Fund a total amount equal to the absolute value of the
Adjustment Amount (which amount shall be payable by the Escrow Agent to Parent
within three (3) Business Days of such determination), (B) if the amount
remaining in the WC Escrow Fund after any amounts payable to Parent pursuant
to clause (A) above have been paid in full exceeds $2,000,000 (the "EC Special
Escrow Cap"), the Company Securityholders shall be promptly paid in cash his
or her Pro Rata Share of the Adjustment Amount from any amount remaining in
the WC Escrow Fund in excess of the EC Special Escrow Cap, which amount shall
be paid out to the Company Securityholders

 



26  in accordance with the Spreadsheet by Parent and (C) any amounts in the WC
Escrow Fund after any amounts payable to Parent pursuant to clause (A) above
have been paid in full shall remain in the WC Escrow Fund until such amounts
are released to a Parent Indemnified Party or the Company Securityholders in
accordance with Section 9.4(e)(iv). For any release from the Escrow Fund to
Parent pursuant to this Section 2.9(b)(iii), cash and shares of Parent Common
Stock shall be released ratably in the manner set forth in Section 9.4(e)(i)
and in accordance with Section 9.5(b)(iii). Parent and the Securityholder
Representative shall provide a joint written instruction as promptly as
possible following such determination to make the payments in accordance with
this Section 2.9(b)(iii).

2.10 _Notices_.

 

(a) The Company shall use their best efforts to obtain, promptly after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement (but in any event within five (5)
Business Days thereafter), the delivery of the Stockholder Consent, which
shall constitute all requisite approvals by any holders of Company Capital
Stock of this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

(b) Promptly, but in no event later than five (5) days after the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall deliver notice to all holders of the Company
Capital Stock of the approval by the requisite number of holders of Company
Capital Stock of the adoption of this Agreement and the principal terms of the
Merger, pursuant to and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the
CGCL and the Charter Documents (the "Stockholder Notices"). The Stockholder
Notices shall include (i) a summary of the principal terms of the Merger and
of this Agreement, (ii) a statement that the Board of Directors of the
Company has unanimously recommended that the holders of Company Capital Stock
consent in writing to the approval of the adoption of this Agreement and the
approval of the principal terms of the Merger, and (iii) all information
regarding Parent provided to the Company prior to the execution and delivery
of this Agreement by Parent for delivery to such holders in connection
therewith. The Company shall promptly inform Parent of the date on which the
notice described in the preceding sentence was sent. The Company shall ensure
that the Stockholder Notices does not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading (provided that the Company shall not be responsible for the
accuracy or completeness of any information concerning Parent furnished by
Parent in writing for inclusion in or with the Stockholder Notices).

(c) Promptly, but in no event later than one (1) day after the date of the
Stockholder Consent, the Company shall provide to each holder of Company
Capital Stock whose consent was not obtained a copy of the notice required
pursuant to Chapter 13 of the CGCL informing such holder that appraisal rights
are available for his, her or its shares of Company Capital Stock pursuant to
Chapter 13 of the CGCL along with such other information as required by
Chapter 13 of the CGCL and applicable Law (the "California Notice").

 

(d) Without limiting the rights and remedies of Parent or any of the other
Indemnified Parties, the Stockholder Notices and the California Notice,
including any amendments or supplements thereto, shall be subject to review
and approval by Parent, which approval shall not unreasonably be withheld.

 

(e) Each party shall provide to the other any information for inclusion in the
preparation of the Stockholder Consent, the Stockholder Notices or the
California Notice that may be required by applicable Laws or that is
reasonably requested by any other party.

 

2.11 _Withholding_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
the Company, Parent, the Final Surviving Company, and the Escrow Agent shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise
deliverable pursuant to this Agreement, such amounts as are required to be
deducted or withheld therefrom under any provision of applicable
Laws; provided, that Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
consult with the Securityholder Representative prior to withholding any
amounts payable hereunder and to cooperate with the Securityholder
Representative to minimize or eliminate any such

 



27  withholding. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld and
remitted to the applicable Governmental Entity, such amounts shall be treated
for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to
whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid. Any amounts payable to
Company Securityholders that require employment Tax withholding shall be paid
through the Companys payroll.

 

2.12 _Tax Consequences_. Other than as expressly set forth in this Agreement,
no party to this Agreement makes any representations or warranties to any
other party regarding the Tax treatment of the transactions pursuant to this
Agreement, including the Merger and the Reorganization, or any of the Tax
consequences to any other party of this Agreement, the Merger or
the Reorganization or any of the other transactions or agreements
contemplated hereby. Each party to this Agreement acknowledges that it is
relying solely on its own Tax advisors in connection with this Agreement, the
Merger, the Reorganization and the other transactions and agreements
contemplated hereby.

2.13 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If at any time after the
Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Final Surviving Company with full
right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, then the
officers and directors of the Final Surviving Company, Parent, First Merger
Sub and Second Merger Sub are fully authorized to take, and will take, all
such lawful and necessary actions. 

2.14 _Expense Fund_. Prior to the Closing, the Company will wire to the
Securityholder Representative the Expense Fund, which will be held by the
Securityholder Representative as agent and for the benefit of the Indemnifying
Holders in a segregated account and which will be used for the purposes of
paying directly, or reimbursing the Securityholder Representative for,
any third party expenses pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or
any Securityholder Representative engagement agreement. The Securityholder
Representative will hold the Expense Fund separate from his personal funds and
will not voluntarily make it available to its creditors in the event of
bankruptcy. The Expense Fund will be invested in a non-interest or other non-
earning bearing account. The Securityholder Representative is not providing
any investment supervision, recommendations or advice and will not be liable
for any loss of principal of the Expense Fund other than as a result of its
gross negligence or willful misconduct. In connection with the release in
full of the Escrow Fund, the Securityholder Representative will deliver the
balance of the Expense Fund to the Final Surviving Company for further
distribution to the Indemnifying Holders, in accordance with their respective
Pro Rata Shares as instructed by the Securityholder Representative in writing.
For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Expense Fund will be treated as
having been received and voluntarily set aside by the Indemnifying Holders.

Company Disclosure Schedule is valid and in full force and effect, and neither

and prior to the Closing to (i) all of the properties, books, Contracts,
commitments and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries, including
all Company Intellectual Property, (ii) all other information concerning the
business, properties and personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
Parent may reasonably request, and (iii) all employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as identified by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that in
exercising its access rights under this Section 6.1(a), Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts in order that such access would not interfere
unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. The Company agree to provide to Parent and its accountants,
counsel and other representatives copies of internal financial statements
(including income and other material Tax Returns, supporting documentation
and, for the avoidance of doubt, such monthly, quarterly and annual financial
statements and data relating to the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as are prepared for distribution to the management of 

 



58  the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Company Securityholders),
promptly upon request. During the Pre-Closing Period, Parent may, with
the Companys consent, which will not unreasonably be withheld, and so long
as Parent affords the Company the opportunity to participate, make inquiries
of Persons having business relationships with the Company (including
suppliers, licensors, distributors and customers) and the Company shall help
facilitate (and shall reasonably cooperate with Parent in connection with)
such inquiries, in each case in compliance with all applicable Laws (including
any applicable antitrust or competition Laws). No information or knowledge
obtained in any investigation pursuant to this Section 6.1(a) or otherwise
shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty contained
herein or be deemed to amend or supplement the Company Disclosure Schedule,
the conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the Merger in
accordance with the terms and provisions hereof, limit or otherwise affect any
rights or remedies available to Parent or any other Indemnified Party,
prevent or cure any misrepresentation, breach of warranty or breach of
covenant or otherwise prejudice in any way the rights and remedies of Parent
or any other Indemnified Party.

 

(b) During the Pre-Closing Period, Parent consider in good faith any
reasonable request of the Company for information concerning the business. No
information or knowledge obtained in any investigation pursuant to this
Section 6.1(b) or otherwise shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty contained herein, the conditions to the
obligations of the parties to consummate the Merger in accordance with the
terms and provisions hereof, limit or otherwise affect any rights or remedies
available to the Company or any other Indemnified Party, prevent or cure any
misrepresentation, breach of warranty or breach of covenant or otherwise
prejudice in any way the rights and remedies of the Company or any other
Indemnified Party. The Company hereby acknowledge that the Company, its
Affiliates and its representatives are aware that any information provided
hereunder by Parent may contain material, non-public information about Parent
and the Company hereby agrees that each such Person may not purchase (except
as provided for herein) or sell any securities of Parent while in possession
of such information.

 

6.2 _Confidentiality_. Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that the
disclosure of information obtained hereunder or pursuant to the negotiation
and execution of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be governed by the terms of the Mutual Non-
Disclosure Agreement dated as of July 14, 2016, between the Company and
Parent (the "NDA"); _provided_ , that the NDA shall terminate and be of no
further force and effect effective as of the Closing; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein or therein,
Parent shall not be restricted from making disclosures required by applicable
securities laws or under applicable stock exchange rules if Parent makes
available to the Company any such disclosure (solely to the extent it would
have otherwise been restricted by the NDA) and considers in good faith the
inclusion of any reasonable and timely comments provided to Parent by the
Company.

 

6.3 _Public Disclosure_. Except as expressly provided for herein, the Company
shall not (nor shall it authorize any Company Securityholder or Company
Representative to), directly or indirectly, issue or make any statement or
communication to any third party (other than its legal, accounting and
financial advisors that are bound by confidentiality restrictions)
regarding the existence or subject matter of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (including any claim or dispute arising out
of or related to this Agreement, or the interpretation, making, performance,
breach or termination hereof and the reasons therefor) without the consent of
Parent or as expressly provided for herein.

6.4 _Commercially Reasonable Efforts_. 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions provided in this Agreement and except
with regard to the Antitrust Laws and subject to Sections 6.4(b) and 6.4(c),
each of the parties hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take
promptly, or cause to be taken promptly, all actions, and to do promptly, or
cause to be done promptly, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated hereby, to cause all conditions to the obligations
of the other parties hereto to effect the Merger to be satisfied, to obtain
all necessary waivers, consents, approvals and other documents required to be
delivered hereunder and to effect all necessary registrations and filings and
to remove

in any event, to file each file the Notification and Report Form under the HSR
Act no more than five (5) Business Days after the date hereof and any other
applicable Antitrust Law no more than ten (10) Business Days after the date

orders under the Antitrust Laws impeding the ability to consummate the Merger
by the Outside Date.

 

(iii) The parties shall each cooperate reasonably with one another in
connection with resolving any inquiry or investigation by any Governmental
Entity relating to their respective Antitrust Filings or the transactions
contemplated hereby. Without limiting the foregoing, each party shall (A)

other materials in connection with the review of the Antitrust Filings or the
transactions contemplated hereby; (C) provide to the other party and its

substantive meeting or discussion with any Governmental Entity in respect of
investigation or inquiry concerning the transactions contemplated hereby
unless it consults with the other party in advance and, except as prohibited
by applicable Law or Governmental Entity, gives the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate thereat.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or any Related Agreement to the
contrary:

 

(i) Parent shall not be required to agree (and the Company shall neither agree
nor permit any of its Subsidiaries to agree without the prior consent of
Parent) to (A) any license, sale or other disposition or holding separate
(through establishment of a trust or otherwise) of any shares of its capital
stock or of any of its businesses, assets or properties, its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates, (B) the imposition of any limitation on the ability of Parent, the
Final Surviving Company, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates
to conduct their respective businesses or own any capital stock or assets or
to acquire, hold or exercise full rights of ownership of their respective
businesses and, in the case of Parent, the businesses of the Final Surviving
Company and its Subsidiaries, or (C) the imposition of any impediment on
Parent, the Final Surviving Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries
or Affiliates under any statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree,
order or other legal restraint governing competition, monopolies or
restrictive trade practices (clauses (A), (B) and (C), collectively,
"Remedies").

(ii) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing herein shall
permit or require Parent or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to (A)
litigate with any Governmental Entity or other Person in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, or (B) pay any 

 



60  consideration, relinquish any right or agree to any modifications of
existing Contracts or entry into new Contracts (other than the payment of
customary filing and application fees) in connection with obtaining any
waivers, consents, approvals from Governmental Entities or other Persons in
connection with this Agreement, the Related Agreements or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby.

 

(iii) Parent shall, on behalf of the parties, control and lead all
communications and strategy relating to the Antitrust Laws and litigation
matters ( _provided,_ that Parent acts in good faith and the Company is not
constrained from complying with applicable Laws).

 

6.5 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company or Parent, as the case may
be, shall give prompt notice to the other party of: (a) the occurrence of any
event that is reasonably likely to cause any representation or warranty of the
Company or Parent, respectively and as the case may be, contained in this
Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate at or prior to the Closing such that the
conditions to closing set forth in Section __ 7.2(a)(i) or Section __
7.3(a)(i), as the case may be, cannot be satisfied, or (b) __ any failure of
the Company or Parent, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
hereunder such that the conditions to closing set forth in Section 7.2(a)(ii)
or Section __ 7.3(a)(ii), as the case may be, cannot be satisfied;
_provided_ , that the delivery of any notice or the making of any disclosure
pursuant to this Section __ 6.5 shall not prevent Parent or the Company, as
applicable, from terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(f) or
Section 10.1(g) at any time within the Termination Period. If the Company or
Parent, as applicable, shall not terminate this Agreement within the
Termination Period, the Company or Parent, as applicable, shall be deemed to
have waived its right to terminate this Agreement under Section __ 10.1(f) or
Section 10.1(g). The "Termination Period" means a period starting upon
delivery of such disclosure notice and continue until the later to occur of
ten (10) __ Business Days following receipt by the non-breaching party of
such disclosure notice and ten (10) __ Business Days following receipt of all
information reasonably requested by the non-breaching party relating to the
breach. The Company and Parent shall promptly cooperate with and provide the
other all information reasonably requested to conduct such investigation.

 

6.6 _FIRPTA Compliance_. At or prior to the Closing, the Company shall
deliver to Parent a properly executed statement and executed notice to the
IRS dated within thirty (30) days of the Closing Date (with written
authorization for Parent to deliver such notice to the IRS) (a "FIRPTA
Compliance Certificate") in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent
under Treasury Regulation Section __ 1.1445-2(c)(3) and 1.897-2(h)(2), as
applicable.

 

6.7 _Plan of Reorganization_. For U.S. federal and state income Tax purposes,
the parties hereto intend that the Merger will constitute a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. This Agreement is intended
to constitute, and the parties hereby adopt this Agreement as, a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of Section 1.368-2(g) of the Treasury
Regulations. From and after the date of this Agreement, each party hereto
shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a
reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code, and will not knowingly take
any action, cause any action to be taken, fail to take any action or cause any
action to fail to be taken which action or failure to act would prevent the
Merger from qualifying as a reorganization under Section __ 368(a) of the
Code.

6.8 _280G Stockholder Approval_. Promptly following the execution of
this Agreement, the Company shall submit to the holders of Company Capital
Stock for approval (in a manner reasonably satisfactory to Parent), by such
number of holders of Company Capital Stock as is required by the terms
of Section __ 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, any payments or benefits that may
separately or in the aggregate, constitute "parachute payments" pursuant to
Section __ 280G of the Code ("Section __ 280G Payments") (which
determination shall be made by the Company and shall be subject to review and
approval by Parent), such that such payments and benefits shall not be deemed
to be Section __ 280G Payments, and prior to the Closing, the Company shall
deliver to Parent notification and evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent
that (a) __ a vote of the holders of Company Capital Stock was solicited
in conformance with Section __ 280G and the regulations promulgated
thereunder and the requisite stockholder approval was obtained with respect to
any payments or benefits that were subject to the 

 



61  stockholder vote (the "280G Stockholder Approval"), or (b) to the extent
that the 280G Stockholder Approval was not obtained and as a consequence, that
such payments or benefits shall not be made or provided to the extent they
would cause any amounts to constitute Section __ 280G Payments, pursuant to
the waivers of those payments or benefits, which were executed by the affected
individuals prior to the vote of the holders of Company Capital Stock
pursuant to this Section __ 6.8.

6.9 _Termination of Arrangements and Agreements; Transfer of Assets_.

(a) Except for this Agreement, the Related Agreements and those agreements
set forth on Schedule 6.9(a), unless otherwise instructed in writing by
Parent prior to the Closing, the Company shall terminate all Contracts between
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and one or
more Interested Parties, on the other hand, prior to the Closing, in each
case without any remaining Liability of any kind on the part of the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries, Merger Subs or Parent as a result of or in connection
with such termination or such Contract. Each such termination agreement shall

(b) The Company shall amend all Contracts listed on Schedule 6.9(b) prior to
the Closing as provided for on Schedule 6.9(b). Each such amendment shall be
in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent. The Company shall take

attached to Schedule 6.9(b) as promptly as practicable following the date
hereof, and in any event, prior to the Closing.

 

(c) All tangible and intangible assets and property listed on Schedule 6.9(c)
shall be transferred and assigned to the Company by the applicable Interested
Parties prior to the Closing. The Company and its Subsidiaries, Merger Subs

with respect to such transfers and assignments. Each agreement form
of assignment agreement and transfer shall be in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Parent.

(d) Parent and its Affiliates shall not have any Liability to the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries, any Company Securityholder or any other Person for
any Liabilities resulting from the Company seeking to obtain such
terminations, amendments, transfers and assignments.

 

(e) Any Liabilities of any kind on the part of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that arise in connection with the performance by the Company of

(f) Within five (5) Business Days of the date hereof, the Company shall form a
new, wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company which is organized as a godo
kaisha in Japan (the "Japanese Subsidiary"). The Company will be the sole
member and managing member. The executive officer shall be Tony MacDonald. As
promptly as practicable following the date hereof, and in any event within
thirty-five (35) days of the date hereof, the Company shall (collectively, the
"Japanese Reorganization"):

 

(i) obtain a tax identification number and set up a bank account for the
Japanese Subsidiary;

 

(ii) file an IRS Form 8832 for the Japanese Subsidiary, effective its date of
formation, electing for the Japanese Subsidiary to be disregarded as a
separate entity from the Company for U.S. federal income tax purposes (and
promptly thereafter provide proof of such filing to Parent);

 

(iii) take any and all actions to transfer and assign to the Japanese
Subsidiary (A) all tangible, intangible assets and property (and all related
Liabilities) held or owned by the branch of the Company located in Japan
(known as Spectrum Japan) (the "Japanese Branch"), including those assets,
intangible assets and property listed on Schedule 6.9(f), and (B) all
Contracts to which the Japanese Branch is a party, including those Contracts
listed on Schedule 6.9(f) (collectively, the "Japanese Assets");

 



62 (iv) take all actions required under any Contract or under applicable Law
to effectuate and perfect the transfer and assignment of the Japanese Assets
to the Japanese Subsidiary in full, including filing any notices, properly
registering the Japanese Subsidiary as the owner of all Japanese Assets
(including paying any and all ad valorem registration duties) and seeking any
and all consents required to effectuate such transfer and assignment (or
obtaining waivers of any right to terminate as a result of such transfer and
assignment) and paying any and all amounts due and payable as a result of
such transfer and assignment; _provided_ , that if it is not possible to
assign any Indebtedness of the Japanese Branch to the Japanese Subsidiary
within twenty (20) days following the date hereof, the Company will arrange
to repay such Indebtedness (including any and all penalty fees, interest and
other Liabilities) in full and release any and all Liens prior to the date
that is thirty (30) days following the date hereof; _provided_ , _further_
, that all formal debtor notification and acceptance procedures shall be
completed and all relevant periods expired;

 

(v) cause all employees of the Japanese Branch (the "Japanese Employees") to
resign from the Japanese Branch and execute and deliver new employment
documentation with the Japanese Subsidiary as his or her employer effective as
of a date prior to the Closing Date, in each case in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Parent, and make any and all payments required under
any Contract or under applicable Law as a result of the resignation of such
employees with the Japanese Branch and hiring such employees with the Japanese
Subsidiary;

 

(vi) cause all Company Employee Plans for the Japanese Employees to be
transferred to the Japanese Subsidiary; and

 

(vii) cause the Japanese Subsidiary to be covered by any and all insurance
policies of the Company and its Subsidiaries or obtain new insurance in form

At the same time the Japanese Assets and Japanese Employees are being
transferred or without delay thereafter, the Company will take all actions
required under applicable Law to close down the Japanese Branch and deregister
the Japan representative, including the publication of a public notice in
the Official Gazette and sending individual notices to known creditors in
order to complete creditor protection procedures.

(g) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to
change the registered name of the owner of assets and properties in the name
of "Spectrum Laboratories, Inc." (or other predecessor entity) to the Company.

 

6.10 _Stock Plan_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall take any and all
actions necessary to terminate the Stock Plan.

 

6.11 _Consents_. During the Pre-Closing Period, each of the Company shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary consents, waivers
and approvals of any parties to any Contract as are required thereunder in
connection with the Merger or for any such Contracts to remain in full force
and effect (including to obtain waivers of any termination rights that are
triggered as a result of entering into this Agreement or the Closing), all of
which are required to be listed in Section 3.6 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, so as to preserve all rights of, and benefits to, the Company and
its Subsidiaries under such Contract from and after the Closing (the "Required
Consents"). Such consents, waivers and approvals shall be in a form reasonably
acceptable to Parent. Any Liabilities of any kind on the part of the Company
and its Subsidiaries that arise in connection with the performance by the
Company and its Subsidiaries of this Section __ 6.11 shall be included
as Transaction Expenses (whether matured or unmatured and whether or not yet
due and payable).

6.12 _Notices_. The Company shall send each of the notices set forth in
Schedule 6.12 hereto in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent
(the "Notices") promptly following the date hereof. Any Liabilities of any
kind on the part of the Company and its Subsidiaries that arise in connection
with the performance by the Company and its Subsidiaries of this Section __
6.12 shall be included as Transaction Expenses (whether matured or unmatured
and whether or not yet due and payable).

 



63 6.13 _Resignation of Officers and Directors_. The Company shall cause each
officer and director (or similar positions) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, respectively, to execute a resignation and release letter in the

instructed in writing by Parent prior to the Closing).

6.14  _Termination of Consultants_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company,
unless instructed otherwise by Parent in writing, shall deliver a notice of
termination of the consulting relationship to each of the Companys
consultants.

 

6.15 _Continuing Employees_. All employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries who are employed in the United States with the Company or one of
its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing (or at another date certain
prior to the Closing as determined by Parent) (collectively, the "U.S. Offered
Employees") will be offered continued employment on an at-will basis by or
with Parent or one of its Subsidiaries (the offering entity, the "Employer").
The employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who are employed
outside of the United States with the Company or one of its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Closing (or at another date certain prior to the
Closing as determined by Parent) and for which Parent requests new employment
documents be executed prior to the Closing are referred to as the "Non-U.S.
Offered Employees" (and together with the U.S. Offered Employees, the "Offered
Employees"). The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause all Offered Employees to accept employment with the Employer by
executing and delivering their New Hire Documents to the Employer, such New
Hire Documents to be effective as of the Closing Date. The Offered Employees
who accept employment with the Employer and execute and deliver their New
Hire Documents shall be referred to herein as "Continuing Employees." The
Company shall, prior to the Closing Date, terminate any U.S. Offered Employee
who does not accept employment with the Employer. U.S. Continuing Employees
shall be eligible to participate in the health, welfare and other benefit
programs of the Company (other than the 401(k) Plan, which will be Parents
plan) unless otherwise provided for in the New Hire Documents (it being
understood that equity incentive plans are not considered employee benefits
for this purpose). Service with the Company or its Subsidiaries will be
included for purposes of determining the vacation or paid-time off accrual
rate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Section __
6.15 shall (i) __ be treated as an amendment of any particular employee
benefit plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement, (ii) __ give any
third party, including any Offered Employee, Continuing Employee, any former
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any beneficiary
representative thereof, any right to enforce the provisions of this Section
__ 6.15 or (iii) __ operate to duplicate any benefit provided to any
Continuing Employee or the funding of any such benefit. Nothing contained in
this Agreement is intended to (x) __ confer upon any Offered Employee,
Continuing Employee or any other Person any right to continued employment
after the Effective Time or (y) __ prevent Parent or any of its Affiliates
from amending, modifying or terminating any employee benefit plan, program,
policy, agreement or arrangement at any time.

6.16 _Termination of Section 401(k) and Section 125 Plans_. Effective as of
no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, each of the
Company and any ERISA Affiliate shall terminate any and all Company Employee
Plans intended to include a Code Section __ 401(k) arrangement (each, a
"401(k) Plan") and any and all Company Employee Plans intended to meet the
requirements of Code Section __ 125 (each a "125 Plan") (unless Parent
provides written notice to the Company that any or all such 401(k) Plans
and/or 125 Plans shall not be terminated). Unless Parent provides such written
notice to the Company, no later than five (5) __ Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that each 401(k)
Plan and each 125 Plan has been terminated (effective as of no later than the
day immediately preceding the Closing Date) pursuant to resolutions of the
Board of Directors of the Company, or such ERISA Affiliate, as the case may
be. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to review and
approval of Parent, which approval shall not unreasonably be withheld. The
Company also shall take such other actions in furtherance of terminating each
401(k) Plan and each 125 Plan as Parent may reasonably require. Employees of
the Company and its Subsidiaries with outstanding participant loan balances
under any 401(k) Plan shall be permitted to roll over their plan loans to
Parents 401(k) plan after the Closing as part of any qualifying rollover
distribution. __ Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate shall place any
participant loan in default under any 401(k) Plan, provided that each 

 



64  employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries apply for a distribution and
rollover of his or her 401(k) Plan in a timely manner so that rollovers can be
made prior to the end of the grace period for the repayment of the loan. In
the event that termination of a 401(k) Plan would reasonably be anticipated to
trigger liquidation charges, surrender charges or other fees (other than
administrative expenses in the ordinary course) then such charges and/or fees
shall be included in Transaction Expenses of the Company and shall be the
responsibility of the Company, and the Company shall take such actions as are
necessary to reasonably estimate the amount of such charges and/or fees
and provide such estimate in writing to Parent no later than five (5)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

6.17 _Repayment of Company Indebtedness_. Prior to or concurrent with the
Closing, the Company shall repay and extinguish all Indebtedness of the types
included in clauses (a), (c), (d), (e), (f), (j) and (k) (and clause (n) to
the extent relating to the foregoing) of the definition of Indebtedness (the
"Funded Indebtedness"), in each case without any further Liability to the
Company, its Subsidiaries, the Final Surviving Company, Parent and its
Affiliates, and, in the case of Indebtedness to be repaid and extinguished at
the Closing, shall deliver, at least three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, UCC-3 termination statements, intellectual property
assignment terminations and executed payoff letters or final invoices, as
applicable, from each lender, creditor, noteholder or other counterparty to
which such Funded Indebtedness is owing (whether or not then due and payable),
in each case (a) that sets forth the amount to be paid on or prior to the
Closing Date, together with wire transfer instructions, (b) evidencing that
the payment of such amount would result in the full repayment, satisfaction,
release, and discharge of all current and future obligations of the Company
and its Subsidiaries (and, in the case of hedging, swap or similar agreements,
the complete unwind and settlement of such arrangements) in respect of such
item and of all current and future Liens relating to such item and (c)
contemplating the delivery of UCC-3 termination statements, mortgage releases
and other Lien releases that when filed or recorded, as the case may be, will
be sufficient to release any and all Liens relating to such item. The Company
shall arrange for delivery of all such UCC-3 termination statements, mortgage
releases and other Lien releases, if any, at the Closing.

 

6.18 _Equity Holding Information_. The Company shall deliver to Parent, not
less than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, a spreadsheet in
a form reasonably acceptable to Parent, which shall include the information

schedules related thereto) and facilitating the grant of a security interest

ARTICLE VIII

 

TAX MATTERS

8.1 _Tax Returns_.

(a) _Tax Returns_. The parties acknowledge and agree that for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, the taxable year of the Company will end on the Closing
Date and, to the extent applicable Laws in other taxing jurisdictions so
permit, the parties will elect to cause the taxable year of the Company to
terminate on the Closing Date. Parent shall prepare and timely file or cause
to be prepared and timely filed all Tax Returns required to be filed by the
Company and any of its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date for Pre-Closing Tax
Periods, including Tax Returns with respect to a Straddle Period. Parent
shall deliver all income Tax Returns and other Tax Returns other than a
payroll, sales or use Tax Return prepared in a manner consistent with past
practice, IRS Form 5500 or property Tax Return for Pre-Closing Tax Periods to
the Securityholder Representative for the Securityholder Representatives
review and comment at least thirty (30) days prior to the date on which such
income Tax returns are required to be filed and as soon as is reasonably
practicable with respect to any such non-income Tax Returns. Parent shall
consider any comments with respect to such Tax Returns from the
Securityholder Representative in good faith. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, it is understood that, all Taxes indicated as due and payable on
such Tax Returns shall be the responsibility of the Indemnifying Holders to
the extent such Indemnifying Holders are liable for such Taxes under Section
9.2(a). Unless otherwise required by applicable Law, such Tax Returns shall be
prepared in accordance with past practices and customs and the U.S. federal
state and local income Tax Returns for the Companys tax period ending on the
Closing Date shall reflect the Transaction Deductions. The Company and its
Subsidiaries shall not elect to waive any carryback of net operating losses
under Section 173(b)(3) of the Code (or any comparable provision of state or
local Law) on any Tax Return of the Company filed in respect of a taxable
period ending on or before the Closing Date.

 

8.2 _Tax Contests_. Parent shall promptly notify the Securityholder
Representative in writing upon receipt by Parent, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries of notice in writing of any audit or other administrative
proceeding or inquiry or judicial proceeding involving Taxes that could give
rise to a claim for indemnification under Section 9.2 or could reasonably be
expected to impact the determination of a Pre-Closing Tax Refund (a "Tax
Contest"); _provided,_ that the failure of the notified party to give any
other party notice as provided herein

 



71  shall not relieve such other party of its indemnification obligations under
Article IX except to the extent that such other party is actually and
materially prejudiced thereby. Parent shall have the right to control and
conduct any such Tax Contest, provided that (i) __ Parent shall keep the
Securityholder Representative reasonably informed of all material developments
on a timely basis, (ii) __ Parent shall provide to the Securityholder
Representative copies of any written material correspondence received from the
Tax authority related to such Tax Contest, (iii) __ Securityholder
Representative may participate in any such contest with representation of its
choice at the Company Securityholders expense and (iv) except with the
consent of the Securityholder Representative (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), no settlement of any such Tax
Contest shall be determinative of the amount of Losses relating to such matter
for purposes of this Agreement. In the event of any conflict or overlap
between the provisions of this Section 8.2 and Section 9.6, the provisions of
this Section 8.2 shall control.

8.3 _Straddle Periods_. For purposes of this Agreement, in order to
apportion appropriately any Taxes relating to a Straddle Period, the portion
of any Taxes that are allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending
on and including the Closing Date shall be (a) in the case of income Taxes
and all other Taxes that are not imposed on a periodic basis, the amount that
would be payable if the taxable year or period ended on the Closing Date based
on an interim closing of the books (and for such purpose, the Tax period of
any controlled foreign corporation, partnership or other pass-through entity
in which the Company holds a beneficial interest shall be deemed to terminate
at such time) and (b) __ in the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a
periodic basis, the amount of such Taxes for the relevant period multiplied by
a fraction the numerator of which shall be the number of days from the
beginning of the period up to and including the Closing Date and
the denominator of which shall be the number of days in the entire period.
For the avoidance of doubt, exemptions, allowances or deductions that are
calculated on an annual basis (including depreciation and amortization
deductions) shall be allocated between the period ending on the Closing Date
and the period after the Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in
each period by an interim closing of the books as of the Closing, other than
with respect to any property placed into service after the Closing.

8.4 _Tax Cooperation_. Parent, the Final Surviving Company, the Company,
their respective Subsidiaries and the Securityholder Representative shall
cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other
parties hereto, in connection with the filing, preparation and review of Tax
Returns, and any Tax audits, Tax proceedings or other Tax-related claims
(including claims under this Agreement). Such cooperation shall include
providing records and information that are reasonably relevant to any such
matters and in their possession (or if not in their possession, if reasonably
able to obtain), making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information, and explaining any materials provided pursuant
to this Section 8.4. Parent, the Final Surviving Company, the Company, their
respective Subsidiaries and the Securityholder Representative shall not
destroy or dispose of any Tax workpapers, schedules or other materials and
documents in their possession or under their control supporting Tax Returns
of the Company and its Subsidiaries for Pre-Closing Tax Periods until the
seventh (7th) anniversary of the Closing Date.

 

8.5 _Transfer Taxes_. All sales, use, transfer, value added, goods and
services, gross receipts, excise, conveyance and documentary, stamp,
recording, registration, conveyance and similar Taxes and fees incurred in
connection with the transactions pursuant to this Agreement, including
penalties and interest ("Transfer Taxes") shall be borne fifty percent (50%)
by Parent and fifty percent (50%) by the Company Securityholders. Parent
shall timely file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with
respect to all such Transfer Taxes and the Company Securityholders shall join
in the execution of any such Tax Returns to the extent required by applicable
Law.

8.6 _Tax Refunds_. Any refund of Taxes (including estimated Taxes) of
the Company and its Subsidiaries (whether received as a cash refund or as a
credit against Taxes otherwise payable in lieu of a refund) with respect to
any Pre-Closing Tax Period that are received by Parent or its Affiliates
after the Closing Date, other than (i) any Tax refund that results from the
carryback to a Pre-Closing Tax Period of any Tax attribute (including net
operating losses) created in a taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning
after the Closing Date, (ii) to the

 



72  extent such Tax refund is a refund of Taxes which were not included in the
calculation of Closing Indebtedness or Closing Transaction Expenses, were not
actually paid by the Company or its Subsidiaries on or prior to the Closing
Date or the Indemnifying Holders after the Closing Date, (iii) to the extent
such Tax refund is received by Parent or its Affiliates on a date that is
later than three (3) years following the Closing Date or (iv) to the extent
the payment of such Tax refund to the Indemnifying Holders could reasonably be
expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code (any such Tax refund, a "Pre-Closing
Tax Refund"), shall be for the account of the Indemnifying Holders, and Parent
shall pay over to the Escrow Agent to add such amount to the Escrow Fund any
such Pre-Closing Tax Refund within thirty (30) days after receipt thereof,
less any costs, Taxes or expenses incurred in connection with the receipt or
payment thereof. Any such Pre-Closing Tax Refund that is added to the Escrow
Fund shall be subject to the provisions of Article IX. In the event any such
Pre-Closing Tax Refund is subsequently disallowed or determined to be an
amount less than the amount taken into account pursuant to this Section 8.6 by
the applicable Governmental Entity, the Indemnifying Holders shall promptly
return such excess to Parent or its Affiliates, as applicable, along with any
applicable interest and penalties imposed by a Governmental Entity on such
amounts to the extent such Pre-Closing Tax Refund was actually paid to
the Indemnifying Holders or was used to satisfy an indemnification claim
pursuant to Article IX. For the avoidance of doubt, any such Tax refund (or
credit in lieu thereof) related to a Straddle Period shall be prorated based
upon the method employed in Section 8.3. At the cost of the Securityholder
Representative on behalf of the Indemnifying Holders (which shall be promptly
reimbursed to Parent), at the direction of the Securityholder Representative,
Parent shall cause the Final Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
file for, and use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, any refund of
material Taxes to which Parent determines in good faith in consultation with
the Securityholder Representative that the Indemnifying Holders are entitled
hereunder.

8.7 _Certain Covenants_. Unless otherwise required by applicable Law, Parent
and its Affiliates shall not and shall not cause the Final Surviving Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to amend any Tax Return filed on or before the
Closing Date, or make any Tax election which would have a retroactive and
adverse effect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, except without the prior written
consent of the Securityholder Representative (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

thereof (the "Parent Fundamental Representations" and, together with the
Company Fundamental Representations, the "Fundamental Representations" and
individually, each a "Fundamental Representation"). If an Officers
Certificate asserting a breach of a representation or warranty is
delivered (x) __ in the case of representations and warranties that survive
until the Survival Date, on or before the Survival Date, (y) __ in the case
of the Special Representations, on or before the third (3rd) anniversary of
the Closing Date and (z) __ in the case of all other representations and
warranties, before the date on which such representation or warranty ceases to
survive, then the claims arising in connection with such Officers Certificate
shall survive for the benefit of all Indemnified Parties beyond the
expiration of the applicable survival period for such representation or
warranty until such claims are fully and finally resolved. The covenants and
indemnities (other than for breach of representation and warranties as
provided for in the prior sentence) of a party hereunder shall survive until
thirty (30) __ days following the expiration of the statute of limitations
applicable to the subject matter thereof (or such longer period as specified
in the applicable covenant). The parties further acknowledge that the time
periods set forth in this Section __ 9.1 for the assertion of claims under
this Agreement are the result of arms length negotiation among the parties
and that they intend for the time periods to be enforced as agreed by the
parties.

(viii) any claim or threatened claim by any actual or purported Company

(b) By virtue of the Merger, subject to the provisions of this Article IX,
from and after the consummation of the Merger, each of Parent and Merger Subs
agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company
Securityholders and their respective Affiliates (collectively, the "Company
Indemnified Parties"), from and against, and shall compensate and reimburse
the Company Indemnified Parties for, all Losses incurred or sustained by the
Company Indemnified Parties, or any of them, directly or indirectly, arising
under, in connection with or as a result of (i) any breach (or an allegation
that would amount to a breach in the case of a third party claim) of a
representation or warranty made by Parent and Merger Subs in Article IV of
this Agreement, or any Related Agreement, (ii) any failure (or an
allegation that would amount to a failure in the case of a third party claim)

Agreement or any Certificate, to the extent committed as of or prior to the
Closing, by Parent or a Merger Sub or any authorized representative thereof.
Claims by any Company Indemnified Party shall be exclusively brought by the
Securityholder Representative.

(c) For the purpose of this Article IX only, when determining the amount of
Losses suffered by an Indemnified Party as a result of any breach, inaccuracy
or failure, any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in
this Agreement that is qualified or limited in scope as to material, material
adverse effect, Company Material Adverse Effect, Parent Material Adverse
Effect or any other materiality qualifications or limitations shall be deemed
to be made or given without such qualification or limitation.

 

(d) No Indemnifying Holder shall have any right of contribution,
indemnification or right of advancement from the Final Surviving Company or
Parent or any of their respective Affiliates with respect to any Loss claimed
by a Parent Indemnified Party.

(e) The Company and the Securityholder Representative (on behalf of the
Company Securityholders) have agreed that the Parent Indemnified Parties
rights to indemnification, compensation and reimbursement

 



75  contained in this Article IX relating to the representations, warranties,
covenants and obligations of the Company or the Securityholder Representative
are part of the basis of the bargain contemplated by this Agreement. For
purposes of this Agreement, each statement or other item of information set
forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be a
representation and warranty made by the Company in this Agreement. Parent has
agreed that the Company Indemnified Parties rights to indemnification,
compensation and reimbursement contained in this Article IX relating to the
representations, warranties, covenants and obligations of Parent are part
of the basis of the bargain contemplated by this Agreement.

(f) This Article IX shall constitute the exclusive remedy after the Closing
for recovery of Losses by the Indemnified Parties (x) as a result of breaches
of the matters specified in Section 9.2(a), _provided_ , that notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall limit the
rights or remedies of Parent or any other Parent Indemnified Party (i) in the
case of fraud or Willful Breach or Transaction Expenses or Indebtedness as
described in Section 9.2(a)(viii), (ii) against a signatory to a Related
Agreement (other than the Company) for matters relating to such Related
Agreement, (iii) with respect to specific performance, injunctive and other
equitable relief, or (iv) claims relating to Related Party Transactions or
(y) as a result of breaches of the matters specified in Section 9.2(b),
_provided_ , that notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing in
this Agreement shall limit the rights or remedies of Company Indemnified
Parties (i) in the case of fraud or Willful Breach, (ii) against a signatory
to a Related Agreement for matters relating to such Related Agreement or (iii)
with respect to specific performance, injunctive and other equitable relief.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Parent Indemnified
Parties sole remedy for Losses with respect to breaches of a representation
or warranty contained in Section 3.11(a) (other than Sections 3.11(a)(vii),
(xi), (xiii), (xiv), or (xv) or with respect to any interest, penalties or
additions to Tax imposed in tax periods (or portions thereof) beginning after
the Closing and that are imposed on unpaid Taxes for Pre-Closing Tax Periods)
shall be limited to Taxes of the Company or its Subsidiaries for Pre-Closing
Tax Periods.

9.3 _Maximum Payments; Remedy_.

 

(a) The Parent Indemnified Parties, on the one hand, or the Company
Indemnified Parties, on the other hand (each, an "Indemnified Party"), shall
not be entitled to any recovery resulting from Section 9.2(a)(i) or Section
9.2(b)(i), respectively, until such time (if at all) as the total amount of
all Losses that have been suffered or incurred by any one or more of such
Indemnified Parties with respect to such matters exceeds $500,000 in the
aggregate; and in such event, the Parent Indemnified Parties or the Company
Indemnified Parties, as the case may be, shall, subject to the limitations
set forth in the remaining subsections of Section 9.3, be entitled to be
indemnified against and compensated and reimbursed to the extent all Losses
exceed $200,000; _provided_ , that the limitations set forth in this Section
9.3(a) shall not apply to any indemnification claims relating to (i) any
breach of any representation or warranty that involves fraud or Willful Breach
or (ii) any breach of the Special Representations and the Fundamental
Representations.

(b) The maximum amount that the Parent Indemnified Parties may recover
from each Indemnifying Holder under Section 9.2(a)(i) shall be limited to
such Indemnifying Holders Pro Rata Share of the General Cap; _provided_ ,
that (i) in the case of any breach or inaccuracy of the
Special Representations, the maximum amount that the Parent Indemnified
Parties may recover from each Indemnifying Holder shall be limited to such
Indemnifying Holders Pro Rata Share of $72 million and (ii) in the case of
any breach of the Company Fundamental Representations, the maximum amount
that the Parent Indemnified Parties may recover from each Indemnifying Holder
shall be limited to the aggregate consideration received by such Indemnifying
Holder pursuant to this Agreement (including any portion of the Escrow Fund
and the WC Escrow Fund) (the "Indemnifying Holder Proceeds"). The attributed
dollar value of any Parent Common Stock returned by an Indemnifying Holder in
connection with any claim for indemnification hereunder (including the number
of shares recoverable by the Parent Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Holders Pro Rata Share of a Loss) or in determining the Indemnifying Holder
Proceeds shall be equal to the Parent Common Stock Price. Except for fraud or
Willful Breach committed by an Indemnifying Holder, no Indemnifying Holder
shall be liable for any

 



76  fraud or Willful Breach committed by the Company or any if their respective
directors, officers, employees, advisors, agents or representatives beyond
such Indemnifying Holders Indemnifying Holder Proceeds. Notwithstanding
anything contained herein to the contrary, nothing herein shall limit the
recovery amount against an Indemnifying Holder, or remedies available to a
Parent Indemnified Party, for such Indemnifying Holders fraud or Willful
Breach.

(c) The maximum amount that the Parent Indemnified Parties may recover from
each Indemnifying Holder under Section 9.2(a) (other than Section
9.2(a)(iii)) shall be limited to the Indemnifying Holder Proceeds.

 

(d) Except for fraud or Willful Breach committed by Parent or Merger Subs, the
maximum amount that the Company Indemnified Parties may recover under Section
9.2(b)(i) shall be limited to the General Cap; _provided_ , that in the case
of any breach of the Parent Fundamental Representations and claims under
Section 9.2(b)(ii), the maximum aggregate amount that the Company Indemnified
Parties may recover from each Parent and Merger Subs shall be limited to the
aggregate Indemnifying Holder Proceeds.

 

(e) Nothing in this Article IX shall limit the Liability of any party hereto
for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement or any Related Agreement if the First Merger does
not occur.

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, (i) if and solely to the extent the amount of
a Loss is recovered by an Indemnified Party through the actual payment of a
Payable Claim to such Indemnified Party, the same amount of such Loss may not
be recovered again by such Indemnified Party by reason of such Loss being
subject to indemnification under more than one provision of this Agreement and
(ii) if and solely to the extent that a Loss in connection with an
Indemnifiable Matter was expressly taken into account in connection with
calculations of the Estimated Net Working Capital, the Estimated Indebtedness
or the Estimated Transaction Expenses pursuant to Section 2.9, the same amount
of such Loss may not be recovered under this Article IX, but, in the case of
the immediately preceding clauses (i) and (ii), the amount, if any, of Loss
that exceeds the amount already recovered under clause (i) or already taken
into account under clause (ii) shall be recoverable on and subject to the
terms and conditions of this Article IX.

(g) The Indemnified Parties right to indemnification pursuant to this
Article IX on account of any Losses will be reduced by all insurance or other
third party indemnification or contribution proceeds actually received by the
Indemnified Parties in respect of those Losses, net of applicable costs and
expenses involved in seeking such recovery (including increases in premiums
relating thereto). The Indemnified Parties shall remit to the party from which
such Indemnified Party is seeking indemnification under this Section 9.3(g)
(the "Indemnifying Party"), for the benefit of such other party, any such
insurance or other third party proceeds that are paid to the Indemnified
Parties with respect to Losses for which the Indemnified Parties have been
previously indemnified pursuant to this Section 9.3(g).

9.4 _Claims for Indemnification; Resolution of Conflicts_.

(a) _Making a Claim for Indemnification; Officer s Certificate_. A Company
Indemnified Party or a Parent Indemnified Party may seek recovery of Losses
pursuant to this Article IX by delivering to Parent or the Securityholder
Representative, as applicable, an Officers Certificate in respect of such
claim. The date of such delivery of an Officers Certificate is referred to
herein as the "Claim Date" of such Officers Certificate (and the claims for
indemnification contained therein). For purposes hereof, "Officers
Certificate" means a certificate signed by any authorized representative of
an Indemnified Party (or, in the case of an Indemnified Party who is an
individual, signed by such individual) stating that an Indemnified Party has
paid, sustained, incurred, or accrued, or reasonably anticipates that it will
have to pay, sustain, incur or accrue Losses and including, to the extent
reasonably practicable, a non-binding, preliminary estimate of the amounts of
such Losses;  _provided_ , that the Officers Certificate need only specify
such information to the knowledge of such

 



77  officer or such Indemnified Party as of the Claim Date, shall not limit any
of the rights or remedies of any Indemnified Party, and may be updated and
amended from time to time by the Indemnified Party by delivering an updated
or amended Officers Certificate to the Securityholder Representative or
Parent, as applicable.

 

(b) _Objecting to a Claim for Indemnification_.

 

(i) The Securityholder Representative or Parent, as applicable, may object, in
whole or in part, to a claim for indemnification set forth in an Officers
Certificate by delivering to the Indemnified Party seeking indemnification a
written statement of objection to the claim made in the Officers Certificate
(an "Objection Notice");  _provided_ , that, to be effective, such Objection
Notice must (A) be delivered to the Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 11.1
prior to 5:00 p.m. New York time on the thirtieth (30th) day following the
Claim Date of the Officers Certificate (such deadline, the "Objection
Deadline" for such Officers Certificate and the claims for indemnification
contained therein) and (B) set forth in reasonable detail the nature of
the objections to the claim in respect of which the objection is made.

(ii) To the extent the Securityholder Representative or Parent, as
applicable, does not object in writing (as provided in Section 9.4(b)(i)) to
the claims contained in an Officers Certificate prior to the Objection
Deadline for such Officers Certificate, such failure to so object shall be
an irrevocable acknowledgment by the Securityholder Representative or the
Parent, as applicable, that the Indemnified Party is entitled to the full
amount of the claims for Losses set forth in such Officers Certificate (and
such entitlement shall be conclusively and irrefutably established) with
respect to the applicable Indemnifying Parties (any such claim, an "Unobjected
Claim"). Within thirty (30) days of a claim becoming an Unobjected Claim, the
Indemnifying Parties shall make the applicable payment to such Indemnified
Party, subject to Sections 9.3(c), 9.3(c), 9.4(e) and 9.5.

 

(c) _Resolution of Conflicts_. In case the Securityholder Representative or
Parent, as applicable, timely delivers an Objection Notice in accordance with
Section 9.4(b)(i) hereof, the Securityholder Representative or Parent, as
applicable, and the applicable Indemnified Parties shall attempt in good faith
to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of
such claims. If the Securityholder Representative or Parent, as applicable,
and the Indemnified Parties reach an agreement, a memorandum setting forth
such agreement shall be prepared and signed by all applicable parties (any
claims covered by such an agreement, "Settled Claims"). Any amounts required
to be paid as a result of a Settled Claim shall be paid by the Indemnifying
Party to the Indemnified Parties pursuant to the Settled Claim within thirty
(30) days of the applicable claim becoming a Settled Claim, subject to
Sections 9.3(c), 9.4(e) and 9.5. If the Securityholder Representative or
Parent, as applicable, and the Indemnified Parties are unable to reach an
agreement, the matter specified in the Objection Notice shall be resolved
pursuant to Section 11.7 (any claims resolved pursuant thereto, "Resolved
Claims").

 

(d) _Payable and Unresolved Claims_. A "Payable Claim" means a claim for
indemnification of Losses under this Article IX, to the extent that such
claim has not yet been satisfied (including by release to the Parent
Indemnified Party of cash and Parent Common Stock from the Escrow Fund), that
is (i) a Resolved Claim, (ii) a Settled Claim, or (iii) an Unobjected Claim.
An "Unresolved Claim" means any claim for indemnification of Losses under this
Article IX specified in any Officers Certificate delivered pursuant
to Section 9.4(a), to the extent that such claim is not a Payable Claim and
has not been satisfied (including by release to the Indemnified Party of cash
and Parent Common Stock from the Escrow Fund).

 

(e) _Escrow Amount; Recovery of Losses_.

 

(i) Subject to Sections 9.4(a), 9.4(b) and 9.4(c) above, by virtue of this
Agreement and as partial security for the indemnity obligations provided for
in Sections 9.2(a) hereof, subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Parent
Indemnified Parties shall have the right, and shall be required, in the manner
provided in this Section 9.4(e) and Section 9.5(b), to recover the amount of
any Losses with respect to which the Parent Indemnified Parties are entitled
to indemnification under Section 9.2(a)(i)

 



78  (other than for breaches of Special Representations and Fundamental
Representations or in the case of fraud or Willful Breach) first by the
release, from the Escrow Fund, of cash and shares of Parent Common Stock.
Subject to Sections 9.4(a), 9.4(b) and 9.4(c) above, by virtue of this
Agreement and as partial security for the indemnity obligations provided for
in Sections 9.2(a) hereof, subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Parent
Indemnified Parties shall have the right in the manner provided in this
Section 9.4(e) and Section 9.5(b), to recover the amount of any Losses with
respect to which the Parent Indemnified Parties are entitled to
indemnification under Section 9.2(a) (other than for breaches of
representations and warranties that are not Special Representations or
Fundamental Representations and absent fraud or Willful Breach) from the
Escrow Fund. Each release from the Escrow Fund pursuant to Section 9.4(e) or
Section 9.5(b) to Indemnifying Holders that are Non-Accredited Investors
shall be entirely cash. Each release from the Escrow Fund pursuant to Section
9.4(e) or Section 9.5(b) to Indemnifying Holders that are Accredited
Investors shall be in cash and shares of Parent Common Stock as follows: (i)
the amount of cash shall equal (A) such Indemnifying Holders Pro Rata Share
of the total amount to be released _multiplied by_ the Cash Consideration
Percentage _plus_ (B) any amount that such Indemnifying Holder is entitled to
receive in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to
Section 2.8(i), and (ii) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock shall
equal such Indemnifying Holders Pro Rata Share of (A) the total amount to be
released _multiplied by_ the Stock Consideration Percentage, _divided by_ (B)
the Parent Common Stock Price, rounded down to the nearest whole share;
_provided_ , that such split shall be adjusted if and as required to account
for the mix of cash and shares of Parent Common Stock recoverable under
Section 9.4(e)(ii). Each release from the Escrow Fund pursuant to Section
9.4(e) or Section 9.5(b) to Parent (on behalf of applicable Parent Indemnified
Parties) shall be in cash and shares of Parent Common Stock as follows (unless
otherwise adjusted as contemplated by Section 9.4(e)(ii)): (x) the amount of
cash shall equal the product obtained by _multiplying_ the total amount to be
released by the Escrow Cash Percentage, and (y) the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock shall equal the quotient obtained by _dividing_ (I) the total
amount to be released multiplied by the Escrow Stock Percentage, _by_ (II) the
Parent Common Stock Price, rounded down to the nearest whole share.

 

(ii) On the date any claim by a Parent Indemnified Party becomes a Payable
Claim, payment of the amount of such Payable Claim, ratably in cash and/or
shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 9.4(e)(i), shall be
made to the Parent Indemnified Parties from the Escrow Fund in accordance
with Section 9.5(b)(i), or if not recovered from the Escrow Fund, ratably in
cash and/or shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with the splits
provided for in Section 9.4(e)(i); _provided_ , that any claim under Sections
9.2(a)(iii), 9.2(a)(vi), 9.2(a)(viii), 9.2(a)(x), 9.2(a)(xi) or 9.2(a)(xii)
may, at Parents sole option, be recovered in any mix of cash and shares of
Parent Common Stock; provided, further, however, that, to the extent that
there is cash in the Escrow Fund, Parent shall elect to recover cash rather
than shares to the extent that such recovery of shares could reasonably be
expected, individually or in the aggregate, to cause the aggregate value of
the Issued Shares, computed using the Parent Common Stock Price (other than
any shares of Parent Common Stock recovered by a Parent Indemnified Party
pursuant to this Article IX), to comprise less than 40% of the aggregate
amount of the Base Total Consideration, as adjusted pursuant to Section
2.9(b)(iii). Any Payable Claim to a Company Indemnified Party shall be paid by
Parent in cash.

 

(iii) At the Escrow Release Time, if and to the extent the dollar equivalent
(calculated in accordance with Section 9.4(e)(i)) of the Escrow Fund exceeds
the aggregate amount of Unresolved Claims, then the amount of such excess
shall be paid, ratably in cash and/or shares of Parent Common Stock in
accordance with Sections 9.3(b) and 9.4(e)(i), from the Escrow Fund in
accordance with Section 9.5(b)(ii) to the Final Surviving Company (who shall
then promptly distribute such cash and/or shares to the
Company Securityholders so that each Company Securityholder receives its, his
or her Pro Rata Share of such cash and/or number of shares of Parent Common
Stock); _provided_ , that (A) no Company Securityholder shall be entitled to
any fractional share, (B) any fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock to
which any Company Securityholder would otherwise be entitled shall be paid in
cash in accordance with Section 2.8(i), and (C) any shares that
remain undistributed by the Escrow

 



79  Agent as a result of this proviso shall be returned by the Escrow Agent to
Parent. From and after the Escrow Release Time until such time as the Escrow
Fund has been fully depleted pursuant to Sections 9.4(e)(ii) and 9.4(e)(iii)
and the last sentence of this Section 9.4(e)(iii), Parent shall promptly
deliver to the Securityholder Representative a notice, as each Unresolved
Claim (whether or not such Unresolved Claim existed on the Escrow Release
Time) becomes resolved as either a Payable Claim or a claim that is not a
Payable Claim, of such resolution and either (A) if and to the extent such
Unresolved Claim has been resolved as a Payable Claim, Parent shall specify
the amount of such Payable Claim, and payment of such amount, ratably in cash
and/or shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 9.4(e)(i),
shall be made to the Indemnified Parties from the Escrow Fund in accordance
with Section 9.5(b)(i), and (B) if and to the extent such Unresolved Claim has
been resolved as not a Payable Claim, Parent shall specify the amount, if any,
of cash and shares of Parent Common Stock (valued in accordance with Section
9.4(e)(i)), corresponding to the amount by which such portion of such
Unresolved Claim exceeds the aggregate amount of the remaining Unresolved
Claims (including Unresolved Claims that did not exist on the Escrow Release
Time). The amount, if any, of cash and shares of Parent Common Stock specified
pursuant to the preceding clause as payable to the Company Securityholders
shall be paid, as applicable, from the Escrow Fund in accordance with Section
9.5(b)(ii) to the Final Surviving Company (who shall then promptly distribute
such cash and/or shares to the Company Securityholders so that each Company
Securityholder receives its, his or her Pro Rata Share of such cash and/or
number of shares of Parent Common Stock); _provided_ , that (1) no Company
Securityholder shall be entitled to any fractional share, (2) any fraction of
a share of Parent Common Stock to which any Company Securityholder would
otherwise be entitled shall be paid in cash in accordance with Section 2.8(i),
and (3) any shares that remain undistributed by the Escrow Agent as a result
of this proviso shall be returned by the Escrow Agent to Parent.

(iv) Any claim for Losses under the EC Special Indemnity may, at Parents
sole option, be recovered from the WC Escrow Fund; _provided_ , that following
the payment of the Adjustment Amount as provided for in Section 2.9(b)(iii)
until the end of the EC Escrow Period, the Parent Indemnified Parties shall
be required to recover the amount of any Losses with respect to which the
Parent Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification under the EC
Special Indemnity first by the release from the WC Escrow Fund;  _provided
further_ , that Parents recovery from the WC Escrow Fund in accordance with
this Section 9.4(e)(iv) shall in no event exceed the EC Special Escrow Cap. On
the date any claim by a Parent Indemnified Party under the EC Special
Indemnity becomes a Payable Claim, if payment is to come from the WC Escrow
Fund as provided for in this Section 9.4(e)(iv), the amount of such Payable
Claim shall be paid from the WC Escrow Fund. At the end of the EC Escrow
Period (subject to the payment in full of all Payable Claims under the EC
Special Indemnity to the Parent Indemnified Parties), if and to the extent the
WC Escrow Fund exceeds the aggregate amount of Unresolved Claims under the EC
Special Indemnity, then the amount of such excess shall be paid in cash from
the WC Escrow Fund to the Final Surviving Company (who shall then promptly
distribute such cash to the Company Securityholders so that each Company
Securityholder receives its, his or her Pro Rata Share of such cash).

9.5 _Escrow Arrangements_.

 

(a) _Escrow Fund_. At the Closing, Parent will deposit the Escrow Amount and
the WC Escrow Amount with the Escrow Agent, without any act of the Company
Securityholders, such deposit of the Escrow Amount and the WC Escrow Amount to
constitute an escrow fund to be governed by the terms set forth in the Escrow
Agreement.

 

(b) _Satisfaction of Claims_.

 

(i) If payment is to be made to a Parent Indemnified Party from the Escrow
Fund pursuant to Section 9.4(e)(ii), Parent and the Securityholder
Representative shall promptly deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow
Agent directing the Escrow Agent to release from the Escrow Fund to the 

 



80  applicable Parent Indemnified Party the amount of cash and number of shares
of Parent Common Stock so payable, plus a pro rata portion (based on the
amount of such reduction of the Escrow Fund relative to the amount of cash
and number of shares of Parent Common Stock in the Escrow Fund as of
immediately before such release) of all amounts in the Escrow Fund that exceed
the Escrow Amount as of immediately before such release (i.e., earnings
(including interest and dividends) on the Escrow Amount and on such earnings
in accordance with the Escrow Agreement); _provided_ , that (A) no fractional
shares shall be released to any Indemnified Party pursuant to this Section
9.3(b) and 9.5(b)(i), (B) the Indemnified Parties shall have no right to
recover any amount of cash in lieu of any fraction of a share of Parent Common
Stock to which such holder would otherwise have had a right, and (C) any cash
and shares that remain undistributed by the Escrow Agent as a result of this
proviso shall be released by the Escrow Agent to Parent. To the extent that
any distribution of shares of Parent Common Stock from the Escrow Fund to an
Indemnified Party (other than Parent) would, in the reasonable discretion of
Parent, fail to comply with applicable securities laws, then, upon the receipt
of notice from Parent, the Escrow Agent shall distribute such shares from
the Escrow Fund to Parent and Parent shall pay such Indemnified Party an
amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock to which such Indemnified Party would otherwise be entitled
pursuant to this Section 9.5(b)(i) and (y) the Parent Common Stock Price.

(ii) If payment is to be made to the Final Surviving Company from the Escrow
Fund pursuant to Section 9.4(e)(iii) or the last sentence of Section
9.4(e)(iii), Parent and the Securityholder Representative shall promptly
deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent directing the Escrow
Agent to release to the Final Surviving Company the amount of cash and number
of shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) so
payable plus a pro rata portion (based on the amount of such reduction of the
Escrow Fund relative to the amount of cash and number of shares of Parent
Common Stock in the Escrow Fund immediately before such release) of all
amounts in the Escrow Fund that exceed the Escrow Amount as of immediately
before such release (i.e., earnings (including interest and dividends) on the
Escrow Amount and on any such earnings in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement) (and the Final Surviving Company shall then promptly
distribute such cash and shares of Parent Common Stock to each such Company
Securityholder so that each such Company Securityholder receives such amount
attributable to it, him or her); _provided_ , that (A) no fractional shares
shall be distributed by the Final Surviving Company to any Company
Securityholder, (B) any fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock to which
such Company Securityholder would otherwise be entitled shall be paid in cash
in accordance with Section 2.8(i), and (C) any cash and shares that remain
undistributed by the Escrow Agent as a result of this proviso shall be
returned by the Escrow Agent to Parent.

 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, to the
extent that any distribution of shares of Parent Common Stock from the Escrow
Fund to a Company Securityholder would, in the reasonable discretion of
Parent, fail to comply with applicable securities laws, then, upon the receipt
of notice from Parent, the Escrow Agent shall distribute such shares from the
Escrow Fund to Parent and Parent shall pay such Company Securityholder an
amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock to which such Indemnifying Holder would otherwise be entitled
pursuant to this Article IX and (y) the Parent Common Stock Price.

(iv) If payment is to be made to a Parent Indemnified Party from the WC
Escrow Fund pursuant to Section 9.4(e)(iv), Parent and the Securityholder
Representative shall promptly deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow
Agent directing the Escrow Agent to release from the WC Escrow Fund to the
applicable Parent Indemnified Party the amount of cash so payable.

9.6 _Third Party Claims_. If Parent becomes aware of a third party claim (a
"Third Party Claim") which Parent reasonably believes may result in a claim
for indemnification by a Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article IX
(except for claims with respect to indemnification pursuant to Section
9.2(a)(xii), which shall be governed by Section __ 8.2), Parent shall notify
the Securityholder Representative promptly of such claim, and
the Securityholder Representative shall be entitled on behalf of the Company
Securityholders, at their expense, to

 



81  participate in, but not to determine or conduct, the defense of such Third
Party Claim. If there is a Third Party Claim that, if adversely determined,
would give rise to a right of recovery for Losses under the Agreement, then
any amounts incurred by the Parent Indemnified Parties in defense or
settlement of such Third Party Claim, regardless of the outcome of such claim,
shall be deemed Losses under the Agreement. Parent shall have the right in
its sole discretion to conduct the defense of, and to settle, any such claim
and the Securityholder Representative and the Company Securityholders shall
not have a right of approval or consent with respect to any such Third Party
Claim; _provided_ , that except with the consent of the Securityholder
Representative (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), no settlement of any such Third Party Claim with third party
claimants shall be determinative of the amount of Losses relating to such
matter. If the Securityholder Representative has consented to any such
settlement, the Company Securityholders and the Indemnifying Holders shall
have no power or authority to object under any provision of this Article IX
to the amount of such settlement, adjustment or compromise constituting a
Payable Claim.

If the Securityholder Representative (on behalf of any Company Indemnified
Party) becomes aware of a third party claim (a "Company Third Party Claim")
which such the Securityholder Representative reasonably believes may result in
a claim for indemnification by any Company Indemnified Party pursuant to this
Article IX, the Securityholder Representative shall notify Parent promptly of
such claim, and the Securityholder Representative shall be entitled on behalf
of the Company Indemnified Parties, at their expense, to participate in, but
not to determine or conduct, the defense of such Company Third Party Claim.
Parent shall have the right in its sole discretion to conduct the defense of,
and to settle, any such claim and the Securityholder Representative and the
Company Securityholders shall not have a right of approval or consent with
respect to any such Company Third Party Claim; _provided_ , that except with
the consent of the Securityholder Representative (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), no settlement of any such
Company Third Party Claim with third party claimants shall be determinative of
the amount of Losses relating to such matter. If the Securityholder
Representative has consented to any such settlement, the Company Indemnified
Parties shall have no power or authority to object under any provision of this
Article IX to the amount of such settlement, adjustment or
compromise constituting such claim.

9.7 _Securityholder Representative_.

 

(a) Roy T. Eddleman is hereby appointed as of the date hereof as the agent and
attorney in fact of the Company Securityholders as the Securityholder
Representative for and on behalf of the Company Securityholders to give and
receive notices and communications in connection with this Agreement and
related matters, including in connection with any Tax Contest or claims
for indemnification under this Article IX and to agree to, negotiate, and
enter into settlements, adjustments and compromises of, and demand arbitration
and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to,
such claims, and to take all other actions that are either (i) necessary or
appropriate in the judgment of the Securityholder Representative for the
accomplishment of the foregoing or (ii) specifically permitted by the terms of
this Agreement. Such agency may be changed by the Company Securityholders
from time to time upon not less than ten (10) days prior written notice to
Parent; _provided_ , that the Securityholder Representative may not be removed
unless a majority of the Company Securityholders (as determined by the
respective Pro Rata Shares) agree in writing to such removal and to the
identity of the substituted agent. A vacancy in the position of the
Securityholder Representative may be filled by a majority of the Company
Securityholders (as determined by the respective Pro Rata Shares). No bond
shall be required of the Securityholder Representative, and the Securityholder
Representative shall not receive any compensation for its services other than
pursuant to that certain Engagement Letter entered into by and among the
Securityholder Representative, the Company and certain Company
Securityholders. After the Closing, notices or communications to or from the
Securityholder Representative shall constitute notice to or from the Company
Securityholders.

(b) The Securityholder Representative shall not be liable for any act done or
omitted hereunder or under the Escrow Agreement while acting in good faith and
without gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Company Securityholders,
severally (based on such Indemnifying Holders Pro Rata Share of each 

 



82  Representative Loss) and not jointly shall indemnify the Securityholder
Representative, and defend and hold the Securityholder Representative
harmless, against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, claims,
penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and expenses (including
the fees and expenses of counsel and experts and their staffs and all expense
of document location, duplication and shipment)
(collectively, "Representative Losses") arising out of or in connection with
the Securityholder Representatives execution and performance of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, in each case as such Representative Loss
is suffered or incurred; _provided_ , that in the event that any such
Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to have been directly caused by the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Securityholder Representative,
the Securityholder Representative will reimburse the Company Securityholders
the amount of such indemnified Representative Loss to the extent attributable
to such gross negligence or willful misconduct. If not paid directly to the
Securityholder Representative by the Company Securityholders, any such
Representative Losses may be recovered by the Securityholder Representative
from (i) the Expense Fund, and (ii) the amounts in the Escrow Fund at such
time as remaining amounts would otherwise be distributable to the Company
Securityholders; _provided_ , that (A) the sole means by which the
Securityholder Representative may recover Escrow Funds pursuant to the
preceding clause (ii) prior to the distribution of such Escrow Funds to the
Company Securityholders is to instruct the Final Surviving Company to pay
such Escrow Funds to the Securityholder Representative instead of to the
Company Securityholders at the time when the Securityholder Representative
would otherwise be required to instruct the Final Surviving Company as to the
allocation of the distribution of such Escrow Funds to the Company
Securityholders, and (B) while this section allows the Securityholder
Representative to be paid from the Expense Fund and the Escrow Fund, this
does not relieve the Company Securityholders from their obligation to promptly
pay such Representative Losses as they are suffered or incurred, nor does it
prevent the Securityholder Representative from seeking any remedies available
to it at law or otherwise. In no event will the Securityholder Representative
from seeking any remedies available to it at law or otherwise. In no event
will be required to advance its own funds on behalf of the Company
Securityholders or otherwise. The Company Securityholders acknowledge and
agree that the foregoing indemnities will survive the resignation or removal
of the Securityholder Representative or the termination of this Agreement.

 

(c) A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Securityholder
Representative, including (i) an amendment, extension or waiver of this
Agreement pursuant to Sections 10.3 and 10.4 hereof and (ii) an instruction to
the Final Surviving Company pursuant to Section 9.7(b), shall constitute a
decision of all or any portion of the Company Securityholders and shall be
final, binding and conclusive upon the Company Securityholders. Parent is
entitled to rely upon any notice provided to or communication with Parent and
its Affiliates and any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Securityholder Representative as being the decision, act, consent or
instruction of all the Company Securityholders. The Parent Indemnified Parties
are hereby relieved from any Liability to any Person for any acts done by such
Parent Indemnified Party in accordance with such decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Securityholder Representative.

9.8 _Tax Treatment_. Any payment under Section 2.9, Section __ 8.6 or
Article IX of this Agreement shall be treated by the parties for U.S. federal,
state, local and non-U.S. income Tax purposes as a purchase price adjustment
unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

Agreement under this Section 10.1(b) shall not be available to any party whose
willful and material breach of this Agreement has been a principal cause of

such action or failure to act constitutes breach of this Agreement which has
not been cured at the time of such termination;

 

(c) by Parent, if the Company has not delivered the Stockholder Consent to
Parent within one (1) Business Day after the execution of the Agreement;

(d) by Parent, if any Governmental Entity shall have enacted, issued,

and which has the effect of making the Merger illegal;

 

(e) by Parent, if there shall be any action taken, or any statute, rule,
regulation or order enacted, promulgated or issued or deemed applicable to
the Merger by any Governmental Entity, which would constitute any Remedies;

(f) except as provided in Section 6.5, by Parent, if it is not in material
breach of its obligations under this Agreement and either (i) there has been a
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company
or a Company Securityholder contained in this Agreement or any Related
Agreement such that the conditions set forth in Section 7.2(a) would not be
satisfied and such breach has not been cured within thirty (30) days after
written notice thereof to the Company and the applicable Company
Securityholder; _provided_ , that no cure period shall be required for a
breach which by its nature cannot be cured or (ii) any of the conditions to
Closing in Article VII for the benefit of Parent are incapable of being
satisfied on or before the date specified in Section 10.1(b); or

 

(g) except as provided in Section 6.5, by the Company, if none of the Company
or the Company Securityholders is in material breach of their respective
obligations under this Agreement or any Related Agreement and either (i) there
has been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of
Parent contained in this Agreement such that the conditions set forth in
Section 7.3(a) would not be satisfied and such breach has not been cured
within thirty (30) days after written notice thereof to Parent; _provided_ ,
that no cure period shall be required for a breach which by its nature cannot
be cured or (ii) any of the conditions to Closing in Article VII for the
benefit of the Company are incapable of being satisfied on or before the date
specified in Section 10.1(b). 

10.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement
as provided in Section 10.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and
there shall be no Liability on the part of Parent, the Company or the Company
Securityholders, or their respective officers, directors or Stockholders,
if applicable; _provided_ , that each party hereto and each Person shall
remain liable for any Willful Breaches of this Agreement or any Related
Agreements prior to its termination; and _provided further_ , that the
provisions of Sections 6.2 (Confidentiality), 6.3 (Public Disclosure),
Article XI (General Provisions) and this Section __ 10.2 shall remain in full
force and effect and survive any termination of this Agreement pursuant
to the terms of this Article X.

10.3 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended at any time prior to the
Effective Time by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their
respective boards of directors, whether before or after adoption of this
Agreement by the stockholders of the Company or First Merger Sub; _provided_ ,
that after any such stockholder adoption of this Agreement, no amendment
shall be made to this Agreement that by law requires further approval or
authorization by the stockholders of the Company or First Merger Sub without
such further approval or authorization. This Agreement may not be amended,
except by an instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto. For purposes
of resolution of disputes and other matters between any Indemnified Parties
and one or more Company Securityholders after the Effective Time
under Article IX or otherwise, it is understood that the Securityholder
Representative shall have the authority to bind all the Company
Securityholders.

 



84 10.4 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing, Parent, on the
one hand, and the Company , on the other hand, may, to the extent legally
allowed, (a) __ extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations
of the other party hereto, (b) __ waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties made to such party contained herein or in any

agree that any extension or waiver signed by the Securityholder Representative
after the Closing shall be binding upon and effective against all Company
Stockholders whether or not they have signed such extension or waiver. No

Schedules, Sections, Annexes and Exhibits to this Agreement, except as

signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being

illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will continue
in full force and effect and the application of such provision to other
Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the
intent of the parties hereto. The parties further agree to replace such void
or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable
provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business
and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

 

11.6 _Other Remedies_. Except as otherwise set forth herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative
with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or

at law, the parties shall be entitled to specific performance or other
equitable relief, including injunctive relief, in the event of a breach or
threatened breach of this Agreement.

 

11.7 _Arbitration; Submission to Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of
Process_.

 

(a) Except for a determination of the Final Closing Balance Sheet, which shall
be resolved exclusively by the Accountants pursuant to Section 2.9(b)(ii),
all disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of or relating to the
Agreement, the Related Agreements (other than as expressly set forth therein)
or any other agreement or document executed and delivered pursuant to the
Agreement (other than as expressly set forth therein) or the negotiation,
breach, validity or performance hereof and thereof or the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, including claims of fraud or fraud in
the inducement, and including as well the determination of the scope or
applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, shall be resolved solely and
exclusively by binding arbitration administered by JAMS in New York, New York,
before a single arbitrator (the "Arbitrator"). Except as modified in this
Section, the arbitration shall be administered pursuant to JAMSs
Comprehensive Rules and Procedures. The parties further agree that this
arbitration shall apply equally to requests for temporary, preliminary or
permanent injunctive relief, except that in the case of temporary or
preliminary injunctive relief any party may proceed in court without prior
arbitration for the purpose of avoiding immediate and irreparable harm or to
enforce its rights under any non-competition covenants.

(b) The parties covenant and agree that the arbitration hearing shall
commence within thirty (30) days of the date on which a written demand for
arbitration is filed by any party hereto (the "Filing Date"). The hearing
shall be no more than five (5) Business Days. In connection with the
arbitration, the Arbitrator shall have the power to order the production of
documents by each party and any third-party witnesses. In addition, each party
may take up to three (3) depositions as of right, with each deposition
limited to eight (8) hours, excluding breaks, and the Arbitrator may grant
additional depositions upon good cause shown. For purposes of determining the
number of depositions as of right, multiple petitioners or multiple
respondents shall each respectively be deemed one party. The Arbitrator shall
not have the power to order the answering of interrogatories or the response
to requests for admission. The Arbitrators award shall be made and
delivered within ninety (90) days of the Filing Date, shall be binding and
final as between the parties, and a judgment may be entered upon the award in
any court having jurisdiction thereof. The Arbitrators decision shall set
forth a reasoned basis for any award of damages or finding of liability. The
parties covenant and agree that the arbitration shall conclude within six (6)
months of the Filing Date, and the Arbitrator shall be provided notice of such
six-month limit (and agreed to abide by it) prior to his or her appointment as
Arbitrator.

 



87 (c) The parties will (i) bear their own attorneys fees, costs and expenses
in connection with the arbitration, and (ii) share equally in the fees and
expenses charged by the Arbitrator; _provided_ , that the prevailing party
shall be awarded its share of the Arbitrators fees and expenses and all other
costs and expenses, including attorneys, consultants and experts fees;
_provided further_ that any party unsuccessfully refusing to comply with the
award or an order of the Arbitrator shall be liable for costs and expenses,
including attorneys, consultants and experts fees, incurred by the other
party in enforcing the award or order. If the Arbitrator determines a party to
be the prevailing party under circumstances where the prevailing party
obtained relief on some but not all of the claims and counterclaims, the
Arbitrator may award the prevailing party an appropriate percentage of the
costs and expenses incurred by the prevailing party.

 

(d) Subject in all cases to the foregoing, each of the parties hereto
irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state or
federal courts located within New York, New York, in connection with any
matter based upon, arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the matters
contemplated herein, agrees that process may be served upon them in any
manner authorized by the laws of the State of New York for such Persons and
waives and covenants not to assert or plead any objection which they might
otherwise have to such jurisdiction, venue and such process. Each party agrees
not to commence any legal proceedings related hereto except in such courts.

11.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the Laws
that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws
thereof.

 

11.9 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AND ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

 

11.10 _Rules of Construction_. The parties hereto agree that they have been
represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefore, waive the application of any Law, regulation, holding or rule
of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document
will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.

11.11 _No Third Party Beneficiary_. Notwithstanding anything contained in
this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement, expressed or
implied, is intended to confer on any Person other than the parties hereto or
their respective successors and assigns any rights, remedies, or Liabilities
under or by reason of this Agreement except that (i) __ Article IX shall
also be for the benefit of the Indemnified Parties and (ii) __ Section 6.20,
from and after (and subject to the occurrence of) the Effective Time, shall be
for the benefit of the DandO Indemnified Parties.

11.12 _Disclosure Schedule_. The Company Disclosure Schedule shall be
arranged in separate parts corresponding to the numbered and lettered
sections and subsections contained in this Agreement, and the information
disclosed in any numbered or lettered part shall be deemed to relate to and to
qualify only the particular representation or warranty of the Company set
forth in the corresponding numbered or lettered section or subsection of this
Agreement, except to the extent that (a) __ such information is explicitly
cross-referenced in another part of the Company Disclosure Schedule, or (b)
it is readily apparent on the face of the disclosure (without reference to any
document referred to therein) that such information qualifies another
representation and warranty of the Company in this Agreement. Nothing in
the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed adequate to disclose an
exception to a representation or warranty of the Company made in this
Agreement, unless the applicable part of the Company Disclosure Schedule
identifies the exception with reasonable particularity and describes the
relevant facts in reasonable detail. The mere listing of a document or other
item in, or attachment of a copy thereof to, the Company Disclosure Schedule
will not be deemed adequate to disclose an exception to a representation or
warranty made in this Agreement (unless the representation or warranty
pertains directly to the existence of the document or other item itself).

and performance of the Related Agreements to which such Signatory
Securityholder is a party nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated thereby will (i) violate any Contract, Law or order applicable
to such Signatory Securityholder or by which any of its properties or assets
are bound, except for such violations which would not reasonably be likely to
have a material adverse effect upon such Signatory Securityholders ability
to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Related Agreements or (ii)
__ result in the creation of any Lien upon the securities of the Company
owned by such Signatory Securityholder.

 

c. _Ownership and Transfer of Interests_. Such Signatory Securityholder is the
record and beneficial owner of and holds all rights, title and interest in
and to the securities set forth opposite such Signatory Securityholders

 



4  name on such Signatory Securityholders signature page hereto, and as of the

owner of and hold all right, title and interest in such securities, in each

e. _Securityholder Activities_. Except as disclosed in Section 3.16 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, such Signatory Securityholder or his or her

f. _Tax Matters_. Such Signatory Securityholder has had an opportunity to
review with such Signatory Securityholders own Tax advisors the Tax
consequences of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement. Such Signatory Securityholder understands that such Signatory
Securityholder must rely solely on such Signatory Securityholders advisors
and not on any statements or representations made by Parent, the Company or
any of their agents or Affiliates. Such Signatory Securityholder understands
that such Signatory Securityholder (and not Parent, the Company, the First
Surviving Corporation or the Final Surviving Company) shall be responsible for
such Signatory Securityholders Tax liability that may arise as a result of
the Merger or the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

g. _Brokers  Fees_. Such Signatory Securityholder has not entered into any
agreement which will give rise to any Liability or obligation to pay any fees
or commissions to any broker, finder or similar agent with respect to the
Merger Agreement, the Merger or the transactions contemplated by the Related
Agreements to which such Signatory Securityholder is a party.

h. _Investment Intent_. In the case of a Signatory Securityholder that is an
Accredited Investor, with respect to the Parent Common Stock issued to such
Signatory Securityholder pursuant to and in accordance with the Merger
Agreement, such Signatory Securityholder acknowledges and agrees that:

(1) the issuance of the Parent Common Stock is made in reliance upon such
Signatory Securityholders representations, warranties, covenants and
acknowledgments set forth in this _Section 4(h)_ and that such
representations, warranties, covenants and acknowledgments constitute a
material inducement to Parent entering into this Agreement and the Merger
Agreement;

(2) such Signatory Securityholder is acquiring the shares of Parent Common
Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement only for investment for his or her own
account, not as a nominee or agent, and not with the view to, or for resale in
connection with, any distribution thereof, and such Signatory Securityholder
has no present intention of distributing any of such securities in violation
of the Securities Act or any applicable state securities Law and has no
Contract, undertaking, agreement or arrangement with any Person regarding the
distribution of such securities in violation of the Securities Act or
any applicable state securities Law;

 



5 (3) such Signatory Securityholders investment in the shares of Parent Common
Stock involves a high degree of risk and may result in a complete loss of his
or her investment, and such Signatory Securityholder has sought such
accounting, legal and Tax advice as he or she has considered necessary to make
an informed investment decision with respect to his or her acquisition of the
shares of Parent Common Stock;

(4) the shares of Parent Common Stock when issued will not be registered
under the Securities Act by reason of a specific exemption from the
registration and prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act, the
availability of which depends upon, among other things, the bona fide nature
of the investment intent and the accuracy of such Signatory Securityholders
representations set forth in this Agreement;

(5) the shares of Parent Common Stock when issued will constitute "restricted
securities" under Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act and,
therefore, such shares may not be sold unless they are registered under the
Securities Act or an exemption from the registration and prospectus delivery
requirements of the Securities Act is available; such Signatory Securityholder
acknowledges and agrees that, except as provided the Stockholder Agreement
with respect to shares held by Roy T. Eddleman, Parent is under no
obligation, and does not intend, to register the resale of the shares of
Parent Common Stock issued to such Signatory Securityholder, such Signatory
Securityholder will be required to bear the financial risks of holding
Parent Common Stock for an indefinite period of time, and that there is no
guarantee that such Signatory Securityholder will be able to achieve liquidity
with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock that such Signatory
Securityholder receives;

 

(6) such Signatory Securityholder is able to fend for himself or herself in
the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, has such knowledge and
experience in financial and business matters as to be capable of evaluating
the merits and risks of his or her investments, and has the ability to bear
the economic risks of his or her investments; and

 

(7) at no time was he or she presented with or solicited by any publicly
issued or circulated newspaper, mail, radio, television or other form of
general advertisement or solicitation in connection with the issuance of the
Parent Common Stock to such Signatory Securityholder in connection with
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

and Procedures. The parties further agree that this arbitration shall apply
equally to requests for temporary, preliminary or permanent injunctive
relief, except that in the case of temporary or preliminary injunctive relief
any party may proceed in court without prior arbitration for the purpose of
avoiding immediate and irreparable harm or to enforce its rights under any
non-competition covenants.

The parties covenant and agree that the arbitration hearing shall commence
within thirty (30) days of the date on which a written demand for arbitration
is filed by any party hereto (the " _Filing Date_ "). The hearing shall be no

interrogatories or the response to requests for admission. The Arbitrators
award shall be made and delivered within ninety (90) days of the Filing Date,
shall be binding and final as between the parties, and a judgment may be
entered upon the award in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The
Arbitrators decision shall set forth a reasoned basis for any award of
damages or finding of liability. The parties covenant and agree that the
arbitration shall conclude within six (6) months of the Filing Date, and the
Arbitrator shall be provided notice of such six-month limit (and agreed to
abide by it) prior to his or her appointment as Arbitrator. The parties will
(i) bear their own attorneys fees, costs and expenses in connection with the
arbitration, and (ii) share equally in the fees and expenses charged by the
Arbitrator; _provided_ , that the prevailing party shall be awarded its share
of the Arbitrators fees and expenses and all other costs and expenses,
including reasonable attorneys, consultants and experts fees; _provided
further_ that any party unsuccessfully refusing to comply with the award or an
order of the Arbitrator shall be liable for costs and expenses, including
reasonable attorneys, consultants and experts fees, incurred by the other
party in enforcing the award or order. If the Arbitrator determines a party to
be the prevailing party under circumstances where the prevailing party
obtained relief on some but not all of the claims and counterclaims, the
Arbitrator may award the prevailing party an appropriate percentage of the
costs and expenses incurred by the prevailing party.

HEREOF.

WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER
SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR."

representation or statement not set forth in this release made by any
representative of the Company or anyone else with regard to the subject
matter, basis or effect of this release or otherwise.

 

c. Releasor hereby acknowledges and agrees that neither the release provided
hereunder nor the furnishing of the consideration for the release given
hereunder will be deemed or construed at any time to be an admission by any
Released Party or Releasor of any improper or unlawful conduct.

 

d. Releasor hereby irrevocably covenants to refrain from, directly or
indirectly, asserting any claim, or commencing, instituting or causing to be
commenced, any action, proceeding, charge, complaint, or investigation of any
kind against any of the Released Parties, in any forum whatsoever (including
any administrative agency), that is based upon any claim purported to be
released hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary
in this release, it is understood and agreed that the release given herein
does not prohibit Releasor from filing an administrative charge with the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission or similar equal employment
opportunity/anti-discrimination administrative agency (federal, state or
local). The Releasor, however, waives any right to monetary or other recovery
in connection with any such charge and/or in the event any such federal,
state or local administrative agency pursues any claims on the Releasors
behalf or otherwise in connection with any such charge or relating to the
Releasors employment with the Company or any Affiliate, successor or
assign. 

e. This release may be pleaded by the Released Parties as a full and complete
defense regarding any matter purported to be released hereby and may be used
as the basis for an injunction against any action at law or equity instituted
or maintained against them regarding such matter in violation of this Joinder,
Release and Waiver. In the event any claim is brought or maintained by a
Releasor against the Released Parties in violation of this Joinder, Release
and Waiver, the applicable Signatory Stockholder shall be responsible for all
costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, incurred by the
Released Parties in defending same.

arbitrator (the " _Arbitrator_ "). Except as modified in this _Section 6_,
the arbitration shall be administered pursuant to JAMSs Comprehensive Rules
and Procedures. The parties further agree that this arbitration shall apply
equally to requests for temporary, preliminary or permanent injunctive
relief, except that in the case of temporary or preliminary injunctive relief
any party may proceed in court without prior arbitration for the purpose of
avoiding immediate and irreparable harm or to enforce its rights under any
non-competition covenants.

The parties covenant and agree that the arbitration hearing shall commence
within thirty (30) days of the date on which a written demand for arbitration
is filed by any party hereto (the " _Filing Date_ "). The hearing shall be no
more than five (5) Business Days. In connection with the arbitration, the
Arbitrator shall have the power to order the production of documents by each
party and any third-party witnesses. In addition, each party may take up to
three (3) depositions as of right, with each deposition limited to eight (8)
hours, excluding breaks, and the Arbitrator may grant additional depositions
upon good cause shown. For purposes of determining the number of depositions
as of right, multiple petitioners or multiple respondents shall each
respectively be deemed one party. The Arbitrator shall not have the power to
order the answering of interrogatories or the response to requests for
admission. The Arbitrators award shall be made and delivered within ninety
(90) days of the Filing Date, shall be binding and final as between the
parties, and a judgment may be entered upon the award in any court having
jurisdiction thereof. The Arbitrators decision shall set forth a
reasoned basis for any award of damages or finding of liability. The parties
covenant and agree that the arbitration shall conclude within six (6) months
of the Filing Date, and the Arbitrator shall be provided notice of such six-
month limit (and agreed to abide by it) prior to his appointment as
Arbitrator. The parties will (i) bear their own attorneys fees, costs and
expenses in connection with the arbitration, and (ii) share equally in the
fees and expenses charged by the Arbitrator; _provided_ , that the prevailing
party shall be awarded its share of the Arbitrators fees and expenses and all
other costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys, consultants and
experts fees; _provided further_ that any party unsuccessfully refusing to
comply with the award or an order of the Arbitrator shall be liable for costs
and expenses, including reasonable attorneys, consultants and experts
fees, incurred by the other party in enforcing the award or order. If the
Arbitrator determines a party to be the prevailing party under circumstances
where the prevailing party obtained relief on some but not all of the claims
and counterclaims, the Arbitrator may award the prevailing party an
appropriate percentage of the costs and expenses incurred by the prevailing
party.

consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state or federal
courts located within New York, New York, in connection with any  matter based upon, arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the

collectively, " _Claims_ "), except those Claims (i) arising exclusively as a
stockholder of Parent following the Closing, (ii) __ for accrued wages
payable in the ordinary course of business in the current payroll cycle,
(iii) __ related to any indemnification to which the Releasor that is an

benefits afforded by section 1542 of the Civil Code of the State of
California, or any similar or analogous provision of the laws of any other
jurisdiction. Section 1542 of the Civil Code of the State of California
provides as follows:

"A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW
OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH
IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR."

 

Releasor understands the significance of this release of unknown claims and
waiver of statutory protection against a release of unknown claims, and
acknowledges and agrees that this waiver is essential and material
consideration in exchange for the entry of Parent and the Merger Subs into the
Merger Agreement.

 

(ii) Releasor represents and acknowledges that he has read this release and
understands its terms and has been given an opportunity to ask questions of
the Companys representatives, and to consult with independent legal counsel
of his own choosing. Releasor further represents that in signing this release
he does not rely, and  has not relied, on any representation or statement not set forth in this
release made by any representative of the Company or anyone else with regard
to the subject matter, basis or effect of this release or otherwise.

(iii) Releasor hereby acknowledges and agrees that neither the release
provided hereunder nor the furnishing of the consideration for the release
given hereunder will be deemed or construed at any time to be an admission by
any Released Party or Releasor of any improper or unlawful conduct.

 

(iv) Releasor hereby irrevocably covenants to refrain from, directly or
indirectly, asserting any claim, or commencing, instituting or causing to be
commenced, any action, proceeding, charge, complaint, or investigation of any
kind against any of the Released Parties, in any forum whatsoever (including
any administrative agency), that is based upon any claim purported to be
released hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary
in this release, it is understood and agreed that the release given herein
does not prohibit Releasor from filing an administrative charge with the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission or similar equal employment
opportunity/anti-discrimination administrative agency (federal, state or
local). The Releasor, however, waives any right to monetary or other recovery
in connection with any such charge and/or in the event any such federal,
state or local administrative agency pursues any claims on the Releasors
behalf or otherwise in connection with any such charge or relating to the
Releasors employment with the Company or any Affiliate, successor or
assign. 

(v) This release may be pleaded by the Released Parties as a full and complete
defense regarding any matter purported to be released hereby and may be used
as the basis for an injunction against any action at law or equity instituted
or maintained against them regarding such matter in violation of this
Agreement. In the event any claim is brought or maintained by a
Releasor against the Released Parties in violation of this Agreement, the
Recipient shall be responsible for all costs and expenses, including
reasonable attorneys fees, incurred by the Released Parties in defending
same.

ARTICLE 1 

ESCROW DEPOSIT

Section 1.1.  _Appointment; Receipt of WC Escrow Fund and Escrow Fund_.

appointment under the terms and conditions set forth herein.

(b) Upon execution hereof, Parent shall deliver to the Escrow Agent (a) the

Section 1.2. _Investments_.

(a) The Escrow Agent shall invest the Escrow Cash and WC Escrow Fund,
including any and all interest and investment income, in accordance with the

In the absence of written investment instructions from the Parties, the
Escrow Agent shall deposit and invest the Escrow Cash and WC Escrow Fund,
including any and all interest and other income, in the MandT Bank Corporate

and other income earned on the Escrow Cash and WC Escrow Fund shall become
part of the Escrow Fund or the WC Escrow Fund, respectively, and shall be
disbursed in accordance with Section 1.3 or Section 1.4 of this Escrow
Agreement; provided, that forty percent (40%) of all such interest and other

within five (5) Business Days following the end of the calendar year, and (ii)
without duplication, upon (x) the Escrow Release Time and (y) any other final
distribution of Escrow Cash pursuant to this Escrow Agreement, with respect
to the portion of such calendar year, in each case, to Parent in accordance
with the instructions provided by Parent to the Escrow Agent, as "Tax
Distributions".

 

(b) The Escrow Agent is hereby authorized and directed to sell or redeem any
such investments of the Escrow Cash and WC Escrow Fund as it deems necessary
to make any payments or distributions required under this Escrow Agreement.
The Escrow Agent shall have no responsibility or liability for any loss which
may result from any investment or sale of investment made pursuant to
this Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent is hereby authorized, in making or
disposing of any investment permitted by this Escrow Agreement, to deal with
itself (in its individual capacity) or with any one or more of its Affiliates,
whether it or any such Affiliate is acting as agent of the Escrow Agent or
for any third person or dealing as principal for its own account. The Parties
acknowledge that the Escrow Agent is not providing investment supervision,
recommendations, or advice. The Escrow Agent is directed not to, and will
not, invest or seek to invest the Escrow Stock; rather, the Escrow Stock shall
be held uninvested and safeguarded by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the
terms of this Escrow Agreement and the Merger Agreement.

 

Section 1.3. _Disbursements_.

(a) Within three (3) Business Days of final determination of the Adjustment
Amount (the " _WC Adjustment Date_ "), Parent and the Securityholder
Representative shall submit to the Escrow Agent a joint written instruction if
the Adjustment Amount is negative, directing the Escrow Agent to release to
Parent from the WC Escrow Fund and then, to the extent necessary, from the
Escrow Fund a total amount equal to the absolute value of the Adjustment
Amount. With respect to a joint written instruction delivered pursuant to the
preceding sentence, if the WC Escrow Fund is not sufficient to cover the
amount of the disbursement, the amount to be released from the Escrow Fund in
respect of such deficiency shall be calculated as follows: (x) the amount of
cash shall equal the product obtained by _multiplying_ the total amount such
deficiency by the Escrow Cash Percentage, and (y) the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock shall equal the quotient obtained by _dividing_ (I) the
total amount of such deficiency multiplied by the Escrow Stock Percentage,
_by_ (II) the Parent Common Stock Price, rounded down to the nearest whole
share.

 

(b) A Parent Indemnified Party may seek recovery pursuant to Article IX of the
Merger Agreement by delivering to the Securityholder Representative, with a
copy to the Escrow Agent, an Officers Certificate in respect of such claim.

(c) The Securityholder Representative may object, in whole or in part, to a
claim for indemnification set forth in an Officers Certificate by delivering
to each of (x) the applicable Parent Indemnified Party and (y) the Escrow
Agent, a written statement of objection to the claim made in the Officers
Certificate (an " _Objection Notice_ "); provided, that, to be effective, such
Objection Notice must (A) be delivered to each of the applicable   Parent Indemnified Party and the Escrow Agent prior to 5:00 p.m. New York
time on the thirtieth (30th) day following the date of such Officers
Certificate (the " _Objection Deadline_ "), and (B) set forth in reasonable
detail the nature of the objections to the claims in respect of which the
objection is made.

 

(d) To the extent, in respect of any Officers Certificate, the Securityholder
Representative does not deliver an Objection Notice in accordance with
Section 1.3(c) on or before the Objection Deadline applicable to that
Officers Certificate pursuant to Section 1.3(c), the Securityholder
Representative shall be deemed to have irrevocably acknowledged that the
applicable Parent Indemnified Party is entitled to the full amount of the
claims for Losses set forth in such Officers Certificate (and such
entitlement shall be conclusively and irrefutably established) with respect to
the applicable Parent Indemnified Parties (any such claim, an " _Unobjected
Claim_ "). Upon receipt by the Escrow Agent of written instructions from
Parent identifying, and attaching a copy of, an Officers Certificate and
confirming that the claim made in such Officers Certificate is an Unobjected
Claim, the Escrow Agent shall pay to Parent (on behalf of the applicable
Parent Indemnified Party) the amount of such Unobjected Claim in accordance
with Section 1.3(f), unless the Escrow Agent has received from the
Securityholder Representative an Objection Notice in respect of such Officers
Certificate on or before the Objection Deadline applicable to such Officers
Certificate pursuant to Section 1.3(c).

 

(e) In the event that the Securityholder Representative timely delivers an
Objection Notice (in accordance with Section 1.3(c) above),
the Securityholder Representative and Parent shall attempt in good faith to
agree upon the rights of the respective Parties with respect to each of such
claims. If the Securityholder Representative and Parent reach an agreement, a
memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by all
applicable Parties (any claims covered by such an agreement, " _Settled
Claims_ "). Subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, any amounts required
to be paid as a result of a Settled Claim shall be paid by the Escrow Agent
in accordance with Section 1.3(f) to Parent (on behalf of the applicable
Parent Indemnified Party) within thirty days after the Escrow Agents receipt
of joint written instructions delivered by Parent and the Securityholder
Representative directing the Escrow Agent to make the applicable Settled Claim
payment. If the Securityholder Representative and Parent are unable to reach
an agreement, the matter specified in the Objection Notice shall be resolved
pursuant to the Merger Agreement (any claims so resolved, " _Resolved Claims_
").

(f) In respect of each claim (other than claims for Losses under the EC
Special Indemnity for which Parent, at its sole option, has elected to recover
from the WC Escrow Fund in accordance with Section 9.4(d)(iv) of the Merger
Agreement) made pursuant to an Officers Certificate, to the extent that such
claim has not yet been satisfied by release to Parent of cash and Parent
Common Stock from the Escrow Fund, that is (i) a Resolved Claim, (ii) a
Settled Claim, or (iii) an Unobjected Claim (each such claim, a " _Payable
Claim_ "), (A) Parent shall, if such Payable Claim is an Unobjected Claim, in
written instructions to the Escrow Agent in accordance with Section 1.3(d), or
(B) Parent and the Securityholder Representative shall, if such Payable Claim
is a Settled Claim or a Resolved Claim, in joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent, set forth the total amount to be paid in respect of such Payable
Claim, the portion of the Payable Claim to be comprised of the Escrow Cash
and the portion of the Payable Claim to be comprised of the Escrow Stock.
Parent (if such Payable Claim is an Unobjected Claim), or Parent and the
Securityholder Representative (if such Payable Claim is a Settled Claim or a
Resolved Claim), shall make all such calculations and apportionments in
accordance with Article IX of the Merger Agreement, with the apportionment of
cash and Parent Common Stock to be calculated as follows: (x) the amount of
cash shall equal the product obtained by multiplying the total amount to be
released by the Escrow Cash Percentage, and (y) the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock shall equal the quotient obtained by dividing (I) the total
amount to be released multiplied by the Escrow Stock Percentage, by (II) the
Parent Common Stock Price, rounded down to the nearest whole share; _provided_
, that any claim by Parent under Sections 9.2(a)(iii), 9.2(a)(vi),
9.2(a)(viii), 9.2(a)(x), 9.2(a)(xi) or 9.2(a)(xii) of the Merger Agreement
may, at Parents sole option, be recovered in any mix of cash and shares of
Parent Common Stock, subject to the limitations on recovery of Parent Common
Stock in the Merger Agreement. In respect of each Payable Claim made under
the EC Special Indemnity pursuant to an Officers Certificate and for which
Parent, at its sole option, has elected to recover from the WC Escrow Fund in
accordance with Section 9.4(d)(iv) of the Merger Agreement, to the extent
that such claim has not yet been satisfied by release to Parent of cash from
the WC Escrow Fund, (A) Parent shall, if such Payable Claim is an Unobjected
Claim, in written instructions to the Escrow Agent in accordance with Section
1.3(d), or (B) Parent and the Securityholder Representative shall, if  such Payable Claim is a Settled Claim or a Resolved Claim, in joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent, set forth the total amount to be paid in
cash in respect of such Payable Claim from the WC Escrow Fund.

The Escrow Agent shall have no duty or liability with regards to any such
calculations and shall be entitled to rely without investigation upon such
joint written instructions.

(g) Promptly following the date upon which any claim becomes a Payable
Claim, Parent (if such Payable Claim is an Unobjected Claim) shall deliver
written instructions, or Parent and the Securityholder Representative (if such
Payable Claim is a Settled Claim or a Resolved Claim) shall deliver joint
written instructions, in accordance with Section 1.3(f) to the Escrow Agent
to release to Parent (on behalf of the applicable Parent Indemnified Party)
the amount of cash and number of shares of Parent Common Stock, as applicable,
payable in respect of such Payable Claim. 

(h) The Escrow Agent shall release cash and shares of Parent Common Stock in
the Escrow Fund to Parent, for the benefit of the Parent Indemnified Parties,
solely under the following circumstances: (i) in respect of any Payable Claim
that is an Unobjected Claim, as set forth in written instructions of Parent in
accordance with Section 1.3(f), (ii) in respect of any Payable Claim that is
a Settled Claim or a Resolved Claim, as set forth in joint written
instructions of Parent and the Securityholder Representative in accordance
with Section 1.3(f), (iii) in respect of any release to Parent pursuant to
Section 1.4(a) or Section 1.4(b), as set forth in such sections, or (iv) as
set forth in any final, non-appealable court order or final non-appealable
arbitration decision accompanied by a certificate of the presenting Party to
the effect that such court order or arbitration decision is final and non-
appealable, upon which certificate the Escrow Agent shall be entitled
to conclusively rely without further investigation.

(i) The Parties, as applicable, shall provide the Escrow Agent with payment
instructions for the distribution of any WC Escrow Fund or Escrow Fund prior
to any such distribution. Any such instructions setting forth, claiming,
containing, objecting to, or in any way related to the transfer or
distribution of the WC Escrow Fund and/or the Escrow Fund must be in writing
or set forth in a Portable Document Format (" _PDF_ "), executed by the
appropriate Party or Parties as evidenced by the signatures of the person or
persons signing this Escrow Agreement or one of their designated persons as
set forth in Exhibits B-1 and B-2, and delivered to Escrow Agent only by
confirmed facsimile or attached to electronic mail (" _e-mail_ ") on a
Business Day only at the fax number or e-mail address set forth in Section 4.3
below. No instruction for or related to the transfer or distribution of the
WC Escrow Fund or the Escrow Fund shall be deemed delivered and effective
unless Escrow Agent actually shall have received it on a Business Day by
facsimile or as a PDF attached to an e-mail only at the fax number or e-mail
address set forth in Section 4.3 and as evidenced by a confirmed transmittal
to the Partys or Parties transmitting fax number or e-mail address and
Escrow Agent has been able to satisfy any applicable security procedures as
may be required hereunder. In any case under this Section 1.3 in which Escrow
Agent is to receive instructions to release, the Escrow Agent shall be
entitled to entirely rely on such instructions with no responsibility to
calculate or confirm amounts or percentages to release.

 

(j) In the event that Escrow Agent makes any payment to any other party
pursuant to this Escrow Agreement and for any reason such payment (or any
portion thereof) is required to be returned to the WC Escrow Fund or the
Escrow Fund or another party or is subsequently invalidated, declared to be
fraudulent or preferential, set aside and/or required to be repaid to a
receiver, trustee or other party under any bankruptcy or insolvency law,
other federal or state law, common law or equitable doctrine, then the
recipient shall repay to the Escrow Agent upon written request the amount so
paid to it.

 

(k) The Escrow Agent shall, in its sole discretion, comply with judgments or
orders issued or process entered by any court or arbitrator with respect to
the WC Escrow Fund or the Escrow Fund, including without limitation any
attachment, levy or garnishment, without any obligation to determine such
courts or arbitrators jurisdiction in the matter and in accordance with
its normal business practices. If the Escrow Agent complies with any such
judgment, order or process, then it shall not be liable to any Party or any
other person by reason of such compliance, regardless of the final disposition
of any such judgment, order or process. (l) In the event that a Party gives funds transfer instructions in writing at
the time of execution of this Escrow Agreement), whether in writing, by
facsimile, e-mail or otherwise, the Escrow Agent is authorized to seek
confirmation of such instructions by telephone call-back to the
authorized person or persons of such Party set forth on Exhibit B-1 or
Exhibit B-2 hereto (as applicable), and the Escrow Agent may rely upon the
confirmations of anyone purporting to be the person or persons so designated
provided no call back is required if the Escrow Agent receives original
instructions. The persons and telephone numbers for callbacks may be changed
only in a writing actually received and acknowledged by the Escrow Agent. All
funds transfer instructions must include the signature of the person(s)
authorizing said funds transfer. The Parties agree that such security
procedure is commercially reasonable.

 

(m) The Escrow Agent will furnish monthly statements to the Parties setting
forth the activity in the account(s) set forth on Exhibit A hereto.

(n) The Escrow Agent shall release to the Securityholder Representative for
further distribution to the Accredited Investors in accordance with the terms
of the Merger Agreement any dividends or other income earned on the Escrow
Stock as and when received by the Escrow Agent.

 

Section 1.4 _Release of Escrowed Property_.

 

(a) On the first Business Day following the fifteen-month anniversary of the
Closing Date (the " _Escrow Release Time_ "), if and to the extent the dollar
equivalent amount of the Escrow Fund (calculated in accordance with Section
1.3(a) and the Merger Agreement) exceeds the aggregate amount of Unresolved
Claims, then the amount of such excess shall be paid at the Escrow Release
Time, ratably in cash and shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with
Section 1.3(f), from the Escrow Fund to the account specified by Parent for
further distribution to the Company Securityholders in accordance with the
terms of the Merger Agreement.

(b) From and after the Escrow Release Time until the Escrow Fund has been
fully depleted pursuant to Section 1.3(f), Section 1.4(a) and this Section
1.4(b), as each Unresolved Claim becomes resolved as either a Payable Claim or
a claim that is not a Payable Claim, (i) if and to the extent such Unresolved
Claim has been resolved as a Payable Claim, cash and shares of Parent Common
Stock, ratably in accordance with Section 1.3(f), shall be paid to Parent (on
behalf of the applicable Parent Indemnified Party) from the Escrow Fund
pursuant to joint written instructions of Parent and the
Securityholder Representative, and (ii) if and to the extent such Unresolved
Claim has been resolved not as a Payable Claim, cash and shares of Parent
Common Stock, ratably in accordance with Section 9.4(e)(i) of the Merger
Agreement (unless otherwise adjusted as contemplated by Section 9.4(e)(ii) of
the Merger Agreement, and subject to the limitations on adjustment therein),
shall be paid from the Escrow Fund pursuant to joint written instructions of
Parent and the Securityholder Representative to the account specified by
Parent for further distribution to the Company Securityholders in accordance
with the terms of the Merger Agreement.

 

(c) Whenever a distribution of shares of Escrow Stock is to be made hereunder,
the Escrow Agent shall instruct Parents stock transfer agent, American Stock
Transfer and Trust Company, LLC (" _AST_ "), to transfer the appropriate number
of shares of Escrow Stock. For purposes of this Agreement, the Escrow Agent
shall be deemed to have delivered shares of Escrow Stock to the person
entitled to such shares when the Escrow Agent has delivered to AST one or more
stock certificates evidencing such shares of Escrow Stock with instructions to
deliver a stock certificate in the name of the appropriate person and
representing the appropriate number of shares of Parent Common Stock with a
stock certificate representing the residual shares of Escrow Stock to be
returned to the Escrow Agent. Following Escrow Agents delivery of such
certificate or certificates to AST, any person entitled to such shares of
Parent Common Stock shall deal directly with AST regarding delivery of such
shares of Parent Common Stock. Distributions of shares of Escrow Stock shall
be made to the persons entitled thereto at the respective addresses set forth
on the Spreadsheet.

(d) In the event of any stock split or other similar occurrence, Parent shall
deliver to Escrow Agent a revised version of the Spreadsheet setting forth the
new number of Escrow Shares held in the Escrow Fund. Unless and until the
Escrow Agent receives the certificates representing additional shares of the
Escrow Shares, the Escrow  Agent may assume without inquiry that no such stock or other property has
been or is required to be issued with respect to Escrow Shares.

 

(e) No fractional share of Escrow Stock or other securities shall be retained
in or released from the Escrow Account pursuant to this Agreement.

(f) On the fifth Business Day following (i) the twenty-four month anniversary
of the Closing Date, or (ii) the Escrow Agents receipt, following the WC
Adjustment Date, of joint written instructions by Parent and the
Securityholder Representative evidencing the final resolution of all matters
covered by the EC Special Indemnity as evidenced by the receipt of written
confirmation from each Governmental Entity to which a voluntary self-
disclosure has been made, whichever occurs first (the " _WC_ _Escrow Release
Time_ "), if and to the extent the remaining balance of the WC Escrow Fund
exceeds the aggregate amount of Unresolved Claims, then the amount of such
excess shall be paid at the WC Escrow Release Time from the WC Escrow Fund to
the account specified by Parent for further distribution to the
Company Securityholders in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement.

Section 1.5. _Income Tax Allocation and Reporting_.

 

(a) The Parties agree that, for U.S. federal income tax reporting purposes,
all interest and other income from investment of the Escrow Cash and WC
Escrow Fund shall, as of the end of each calendar year, be reported by the
Escrow Agent on Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") Form 1099 (or other
applicable or successor form) as having been earned by Parent (which shall be
treated as the owner of the Escrow Cash and WC Escrow Fund for U.S. federal
income tax purposes) regardless of whether such income was disbursed during
such calendar year. For the avoidance of doubt, the Escrow Agent shall make
Tax Distributions to Parent as required under Section 1.2(a). Parent shall be
responsible for paying taxes (including any penalties and interest thereon) on
all interest earned on the Escrow Cash and WC Escrow Fund and for filing all
necessary income tax returns with respect to such income. The Escrow Agent
shall be deemed the payor of any interest or other income paid upon investment
of the WC Escrow Fund and the Escrow Fund for purposes of performing tax
reporting. With respect to any other payments made under this Escrow
Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall not be deemed the payor and shall have no
responsibility for performing tax reporting to the extent the WC Escrow Fund
or the Escrow Fund is released hereunder. The Escrow Agents function of
making such payments is solely ministerial and at the direction of the
Parties as set forth or provided for in this Agreement.

(b) The Parties agree that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the
Accredited Investors shall be treated as the beneficial owners of the Escrow
Stock and as such shall be entitled to vote (through the Securityholder
Representative) the Escrow Stock and any and all dividends and other income
earned on the Escrow Stock shall be reported as having been earned by the
Accredited Investors, as allocable to each Accredited Investor in accordance
with the Merger Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, any dividends or other
income earned on the Escrow Stock shall be distributed to the Securityholder
Representative for further distribution to the Accredited Investors in
accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement as required under Section
1.3(n). The Escrow Agent shall comply will all information reporting
requirements imposed on it by applicable law with respect to any dividends or
other income earned on the Escrow Stock or distributed pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement; provided, however, that the Escrow Agent is not
responsible for any tax-reporting related to dividends or other income earned
on the Escrow Stock unless required by applicable law. The Securityholder
Representative, on behalf of and at the direction of the Accredited
Investors, shall be entitled, but not required, to exercise all voting rights
and all other rights with respect to the Escrow Stock. The Escrow Agent shall
not vote any of the Escrow Stock. As between the Parties, and notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Section 1.5(b), any holder of Phantom Share
Equivalents shall not be treated as the beneficial owner of the Escrow Stock
allocable to such holder under the Merger Agreement and such holder shall not
be entitled to vote such Escrow Stock or be entitled to receive any dividends
or other income earned on such Escrow Stock unless and until such Escrow Stock
is actually issued to such holder, and it is intended that such Escrow Stock
shall be eligible for installment sale treatment under Section 453 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and if and to the
extent such Escrow Stock is actually released to such holder, interest may be
imputed on such Escrow Stock, as required by Sections 483 or 1274 of the Code. (c) Prior to closing, the Parties shall provide the Escrow Agent with
certified tax identification numbers by furnishing appropriate IRS forms W-9
or W-8 and such other forms and documents that the Escrow Agent may reasonably
request in connection with its tax reporting obligations under applicable law
in connection with this Agreement. The Parties understand that if such tax
reporting documentation is not provided and certified to the Escrow Agent, the
Escrow Agent may be required by the Code and the regulations promulgated
thereunder, to withhold a portion of any interest or other income earned on
the investment of the Escrow Fund.

 

(d) To the extent that the Escrow Agent becomes liable for the payment of any
taxes in respect of income derived from the investment of the WC Escrow Fund
or the Escrow Fund, the Escrow Agent shall satisfy such liability to the
extent possible from the WC Escrow Fund or the Escrow Fund. The Parties,
jointly and severally, shall indemnify, defend and hold the Escrow Agent
harmless from and against any tax, late payment, interest, penalty or other
cost or expense that may be assessed against the Escrow Agent on or with
respect to the WC Escrow Fund or the Escrow Fund and the investment thereof
unless such tax, late payment, interest, penalty or other expense was
directly caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Escrow
Agent. The indemnification provided by this Section 1.5(d) is in addition to
the indemnification provided in Section 3.1 and shall survive the resignation
or removal of the Escrow Agent and the termination of this Escrow Agreement.

(e) If and to the extent any portion of the WC Escrow Fund or the Escrow Cash
is actually distributed to the Company Securityholders, interest may be
imputed on such amount, as required by Section 483 or Section 1274 of the
Code.

 

Section 1.6. _Termination_. Upon the disbursement of all of the WC Escrow Fund
and the Escrow Fund, including any interest and investment earnings thereon,
this Escrow Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
except that the provisions of Sections 1.5(d), 3.1 and 3.2 hereof shall
survive termination.

 

ARTICLE 2

DUTIES OF THE ESCROW AGENT

Section 2.1. _Scope of Responsibility_. Notwithstanding any provision to the
contrary, the Escrow Agent is obligated only to perform the duties
specifically set forth in this Escrow Agreement, which shall be deemed purely
ministerial in nature. Under no circumstances will the Escrow Agent be deemed
to be a fiduciary to any Party or any other person under this Escrow
Agreement. The Escrow Agent will not be responsible or liable for the failure
of any Party to perform in accordance with this Escrow Agreement. The Escrow
Agent shall neither be responsible for, nor chargeable with, knowledge of the
terms and conditions of any other agreement, instrument, or document other
than this Escrow Agreement, whether or not an original or a copy of such
agreement has been provided to the Escrow Agent; and the Escrow Agent shall
have no duty to know or inquire as to the performance or nonperformance of
any provision of any such agreement, instrument, or document. References in
this Escrow Agreement to any other agreement, instrument, or document are for
the convenience of the Parties, and the Escrow Agent has no duties
or obligations with respect thereto. This Escrow Agreement sets forth all
matters pertinent to the escrow contemplated hereunder, and no additional
obligations of the Escrow Agent shall be inferred or implied from the terms of
this Escrow Agreement or any other agreement.

Section 2.2. _Attorneys and Agents_. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to
rely on and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken
by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the reasonable advice of counsel or
other professionals retained or consulted by the Escrow Agent, provided that
the Escrow Agent shall provide written notice thereof to the Parties as soon
as reasonably practicable. The Escrow Agent shall be reimbursed as set forth
in Section 3.1 for any and all reasonable, documented out-of-pocket
fees, expenses and other costs paid and/or reimbursed to such counsel and/or
professionals. The Escrow Agent may perform any and all of its duties through
its agents, representatives, attorneys, custodians, and/or nominees.

 

Section 2.3. _Reliance_. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any action
taken or not taken by it in accordance with the direction or consent of the
Parties or their respective agents, representatives, successors, or assigns.
The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for acting or refraining from acting upon
any notice, request, consent, direction, requisition, certificate, order,
affidavit, letter, or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine
and correct and to have been signed or sent by the proper person or persons,
without further inquiry into the persons or persons authority. Section 2.4. _Security Procedure for Funds Transfer_. Concurrent with the
execution of this Escrow Agreement, the Parties shall deliver to the Escrow
Agent authorized signers forms in the form of _Exhibit B-1_ and _Exhibit B-2_
to this Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall confirm each funds transfer
instruction received in the name of Parties by confirming with an authorized
individual as evidenced in _Exhibit B-1_ and _Exhibit B-2_. Once delivered to
the Escrow Agent, _Exhibit B-1_ or _Exhibit B-2_ may be revised or rescinded
only in writing signed by an authorized representative of the Party. Such
revisions or rescissions shall be effective only after actual receipt and
following such period of time as may be necessary to afford the Escrow Agent a
reasonable opportunity to act on it. If a revised _Exhibit B-1_ or _Exhibit
B-2_ or a rescission of an existing _Exhibit B-1_ or _Exhibit B-2_ is
delivered to the Escrow Agent by an entity that is a successor-in-interest to
either party, such document shall be accompanied by additional documentation
satisfactory to the Escrow Agent showing that such entity has succeeded to the
rights and responsibilities of the Parties. The Parties understand that the
Escrow Agents inability to receive or confirm funds transfer instructions
may result in a delay in accomplishing such funds transfer, and agree that the
Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any loss caused by any such delay.

 

Section 2.5. _Right Not Duty Undertaken_. The permissive rights of the Escrow
Agent to do things enumerated in this Escrow Agreement shall not be construed
as duties.

Section 2.6. _No Financial Obligation_. No provision of this Escrow Agreement
shall require the Escrow Agent to risk or advance its own funds or otherwise
incur any financial liability or potential financial liability in the
performance of its duties or the exercise of its rights under this Escrow
Agreement unless the Escrow Agent is furnished with security and indemnity
which it deems, in its sole and absolute discretion, to be satisfactory.

ARTICLE 3

 

PROVISIONS CONCERNING THE ESCROW AGENT

 

Section 3.1. _Indemnification_.

(a) The Parties hereby agree, jointly and severally, to indemnify Escrow
Agent, its directors, officers, employees and agents (collectively, the "
_Indemnified Parties_ "), and hold the Indemnified Parties harmless from any
and against all liabilities, losses, actions, suits or proceedings at law or
in equity, and any other reasonable, documented out-of-pocket, expenses, fees
or charges, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses, which an Indemnified Party may incur or with which it may be
threatened by reason of acting as or on behalf of Escrow Agent under this
Escrow Agreement (collectively, " _Losses_ "), except to the extent the same
shall be caused by the Escrow Agents gross negligence or willful misconduct;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in all events (i) one-half of the Losses
specified in the foregoing provisions of this paragraph to be paid by Parent
and Securityholder Representative shall be paid by Parent and (ii) one-half
of the Losses specified in the foregoing provisions of this paragraph to be
paid by Parent and Securityholder Representative shall be paid by
Securityholder Representative (on behalf of the Company Securityholders). The
terms of this paragraph shall survive the resignation or removal of the Escrow
Agent and the termination of this Escrow Agreement.

 

(b) The Parties agree that neither the payment by Parent or Securityholder
Representative of any claim by the Escrow Agent for indemnification hereunder
nor the disbursement of any amounts to the Escrow Agent from the WC Escrow
Fund and the Escrow Fund in respect of a claim by the Escrow Agent for
indemnification shall impair, limit, modify, or affect, as between
Securityholder Representative and Parent, the respective rights and
obligations of Securityholder Representative, on the one hand, and Parent, on
the other hand, under the Merger Agreement.

 

Section 3.2. _Limitation of Liability_. THE ESCROW AGENT SHALL NOT BE LIABLE,
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, FOR ANY (I) __ DAMAGES, LOSSES OR EXPENSES ARISING
OUT OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED HEREUNDER, OTHER THAN DAMAGES, LOSSES OR EXPENSES
WHICH HAVE BEEN FINALLY ADJUDICATED TO HAVE DIRECTLY RESULTED FROM THE ESCROW
AGENTS GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT, OR (II) __ SPECIAL, INDIRECT
OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING WITHOUT
LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), EVEN IF THE ESCROW AGENT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES OR DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION. Section 3.3. _Resignation or Removal_. The Escrow Agent may resign by
furnishing written notice of its resignation to the Parties, and the Parties
may remove the Escrow Agent by furnishing to the Escrow Agent a joint written
notice of its removal along with payment of all fees and expenses to which it
is entitled through the date of termination. Such resignation or removal, as
the case may be, shall be effective thirty (30) days after the delivery of
such notice or upon the earlier appointment of a successor, and the Escrow
Agents sole responsibility thereafter shall be to safely keep the WC Escrow
Fund and the Escrow Fund and to deliver the same to a successor escrow agent
as shall be appointed by the Parties, as evidenced by a joint written notice
filed with the Escrow Agent or in accordance with a court order. If the
Parties have failed to appoint a successor escrow agent prior to the
expiration of thirty (30) days following the delivery of such notice of
resignation or removal, the Escrow Agent may petition any court of competent
jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor escrow agent or for other
appropriate relief, and any such resulting appointment shall be binding upon
the Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any successor Escrow Agent shall
be a financial institution organized under the laws of the United States of
America and having a combined capital and surplus of not less than Two Hundred
Fifty Million Dollars ($250,000,000). Any successor Escrow Agent, however
appointed, shall execute and deliver to the predecessor Escrow Agent, with a
copy to each of the Parties, an instrument accepting such appointment, and
thereupon such successor Escrow Agent shall, without further act, become fully
vested with all the rights, powers, obligations and duties of the predecessor
Escrow Agent hereunder with the same effect as if originally named the Escrow
Agent herein.

Section 3.4. _Compensation_. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to
compensation for its services as stated in the fee schedule attached hereto as
_Exhibit_ C, which compensation shall be borne 50% by Parent and 50% by
Securityholder Representative (on behalf of the Company Securityholders). The
fee agreed upon for the services rendered hereunder is intended as
compensation for the Escrow Agents services as contemplated by this Escrow
Agreement; provided, however, that in the event that the conditions for the
disbursement of funds under this Escrow Agreement are not fulfilled, or the
Escrow Agent renders any service not contemplated in this Escrow Agreement, or
there is any assignment of interest in the subject matter of this Escrow
Agreement, or any material modification hereof, or if any material
controversy arises hereunder, or the Escrow Agent is made a party to any
litigation pertaining to this Escrow Agreement or the subject matter hereof,
then the Escrow Agent shall be compensated for such extraordinary services
and reimbursed for all reasonable, documented out-of-pocket costs and
expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses, occasioned by any
such delay, controversy, litigation or event. If any amount due to the Escrow
Agent hereunder is not paid within thirty (30) days of the date due, the
Escrow Agent in its sole discretion may charge interest on such amount up to
the highest rate permitted by applicable law.

Section 3.5. _Disagreements_. If any conflict, disagreement or dispute arises
between, among, or involving any of the parties hereto concerning the meaning
or validity of any provision hereunder or concerning any other matter relating
to this Escrow Agreement, or the Escrow Agent is in doubt as to the action to
be taken hereunder, the Escrow Agent may, at its option, retain the WC Escrow
Fund or the Escrow Fund until the Escrow Agent (i) receives a final non-
appealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction or a final non-
appealable arbitration decision directing delivery of the WC Escrow Fund or
the Escrow Fund, (ii) receives a written agreement executed by each of the
parties involved in such disagreement or dispute directing delivery of the WC
Escrow Fund or the Escrow Fund, in which event the Escrow Agent shall be
authorized to disburse the WC Escrow Fund or the Escrow Fund in accordance
with such final court order, arbitration decision, or agreement, or (iii)
files an interpleader action in any court of competent jurisdiction, and upon
the filing thereof, the Escrow Agent shall be relieved of all liability as to
the WC Escrow Fund or the Escrow Fund and shall be entitled to recover
reasonable, documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses, including reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses, incurred in commencing and maintaining any such
interpleader action. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to act on any such
agreement, court order, or arbitration decision without further question,
inquiry, or consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any conflict, disagreement
or dispute not involving the Escrow Agent as a party shall be resolved
pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement.

Section 3.6. _Merger or Consolidation_. Any corporation or association into
which the Escrow Agent may be converted or merged, or with which it may be
consolidated, or to which it may sell or transfer all or substantially all of
its corporate trust business and assets as a whole or substantially as a
whole, or any corporation or  association resulting from any such conversion, sale, merger, consolidation
or transfer to which the Escrow Agent is a party, shall be and become the
successor escrow agent under this Escrow Agreement and shall have and succeed
to the rights, powers, duties, immunities and privileges as its predecessor,
without the execution or filing of any instrument or paper or the performance
of any further act. The Escrow Agent shall provide the Parties with prompt
written notice of such conversion, sale, merger, consolidation or transfer in
accordance with Section 4.3.

Section 3.7.  _Attachment of_ WC Escrow Fund and _Escrow Fund; Compliance
with Legal Orders_. __ In the event that any WC Escrow Fund or Escrow Fund
shall be attached, garnished or levied upon by any court order, or the
delivery thereof shall be stayed or enjoined by an order of a court, or any
order, judgment or decree shall be made or entered by any court order
affecting the WC Escrow Fund and the Escrow Fund, the Escrow Agent is hereby
expressly authorized, in its sole discretion, to respond as it deems
appropriate or to comply with all writs, orders or decrees so entered or
issued, or which it is advised by legal counsel of its own choosing is binding
upon it, whether with or without jurisdiction. In the event that the
Escrow Agent obeys or complies with any such writ, order or decree it shall
not be liable to any of the Parties or to any other person, firm or
corporation, should, by reason of such compliance notwithstanding, such writ,
order or decree be subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside or
vacated.

Section 3.8 _Force Majeure_. The Escrow Agent shall not be responsible or
liable for any failure or delay in the performance of its obligation under
this Escrow Agreement arising out of or caused, directly or indirectly, by
circumstances beyond its reasonable control, including, without limitation,
acts of God; earthquakes; fire; flood; wars; acts of terrorism; civil or
military disturbances; sabotage; epidemic; riots; interruptions, loss or
malfunctions of utilities, computer (hardware or software) or communications
services; accidents; labor disputes; acts of civil or military authority or
governmental action; it being understood that the Escrow Agent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts which are consistent with accepted practices
in the banking industry to resume performance as soon as reasonably
practicable under the circumstances.

Section 3.9 _Compliance with Legal Orders_. Escrow Agent shall be entitled to
consult with legal counsel in the event that a question or dispute arises
with regard to the construction of any of the provisions hereof, and shall
incur no liability and shall be fully protected in acting in accordance with
the advice or opinion of such counsel.

 

Section 3.10 _Disagreements_. In the event Escrow Agent receives conflicting
instructions hereunder, Escrow Agent shall be fully protected in refraining
from acting until such conflict is resolved to the satisfaction of Escrow
Agent.

Section 4.1. _Successors and Assigns_. This Escrow Agreement shall be binding
on and inure to the benefit of the Parties and the Escrow Agent and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. No other persons shall have any

Form of Stockholder Agreement STOCKHOLDER AGREEMENT

 

THIS STOCKHOLDER AGREEMENT is dated as of June 22, 2017 (this "Agreement"), by
and between Repligen Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), and Roy
T. Eddleman (the "Holder"). All capitalized terms not otherwise defined in
this Agreement shall have the meanings assigned thereto in the Merger
Agreement (as defined below). 

WHEREAS, Parent, Top Hat, Inc., a California corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent ("First Merger Sub"), Swing Time, LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Second
Merger Sub"), Spectrum, Inc., a California corporation (the "Company"), and
Roy T. Eddleman, an individual, solely in his capacity as the representative
of the Company securityholders, entered into that certain Agreement and Plan
of Merger and Reorganization, dated June 22, 2017 (the "Merger Agreement"),
pursuant to which (i) First Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company,
with the Company as the surviving entity and a direct subsidiary of Parent,
and (ii) thereafter as part of the same overall transaction, the Company will
merge with and into Second Merger Sub, with Second Merger Sub as the
surviving entity and a direct subsidiary of Parent (together, the "Merger");

 

WHEREAS, as partial consideration for the Merger, Parent intends to issue to
the Holder pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, inclusive of any
shares held in escrow following the Closing, an aggregate number of shares
(the "Consideration Shares") of Parents common stock, $0.01 par value per
share (the "Common Stock"), as determined in accordance with the terms of the
Merger Agreement; and

WHEREAS, entering into this Agreement is a condition to the Closing.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the mutual
covenants and agreements contained herein, and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
the parties, intending to be legally bound hereby, agree as follows:

 

1\. Nomination and Election of Director.

 

(a) Beginning on the date that is the fifteen (15) month anniversary of the
Closing Date and ending on the ninetieth (90th) calendar day thereafter (the
"Notice Date"), the Holder may, at his election, deliver written notice to the
Board of Directors of Parent (the "Board") of his desire to be elected to the
Board as a director (the "Acceptance Notice"). Subject to Sections 1.1(c) and
1(e), as promptly as practicable following receipt of the Acceptance Notice,
and in any event within thirty (30) days of Parents receipt of the
Acceptance Notice, the Board and all applicable committees and subcommittees
thereof shall take all necessary actions to (i) increase the then current size
of the Board by one (1) member and (ii) appoint the Holder to the Board to
fill the vacancy thereby created (the "Board Action").

(b) Subject to Sections 1.1(c) and 1(e), following the Board Action, the
Board and all applicable committees and subcommittees thereof shall take all
action necessary so that the Holder shall stand for election by Parents
stockholders (the "Stockholders") at Parents next annual meeting of
stockholders (the "Annual Meeting"), or, if earlier, at the next special
meeting of the Stockholders with respect to the election of directors
following the Board Action. Subject to Sections 1.1(c) and 1(e), Parent
agrees to (i) recommend and solicit proxies for the election of the Holder at
such Annual Meeting or special meeting of the Stockholders in the same manner
as for Parents other nominees, (ii) cause all Common Stock represented by
proxies granted to it (or any of its officers, directors or representatives)
to be voted in favor of each of Parents nominees (including the Holder), and
(iii) otherwise support the Holder for election in a manner no less rigorous
and favorable than the manner in which Parent supports its other nominees.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the
aggregate beneficial ownership of the Holder decreases to less than 5% of
Common Stock prior to his appointment to the Board following delivery of the
Acceptance Notice or otherwise (the "Holder Sell-Off Event"), then Parent
shall have no obligations pursuant to Sections 1(a) and 1(b) above. (d) As a condition to the appointment of the Holder to the Board in accordance
with this Section 1, the Holder shall provide any information that Parent
reasonably requires, including without limitation information required to be
disclosed in a proxy statement or other filing under applicable Law, stock
exchange rules or listing standards, information in connection with assessing
eligibility, independence and other criteria applicable to directors or
satisfying compliance and legal obligations, and shall consent to appropriate
background checks. If, at any time (including without limitation, prior to
his appointment to the Board following delivery of the Acceptance Notice), the
Board learns of a Disqualifying Event, then the Board may, in its sole
discretion, (i) not take any of the actions required by Sections 1(a) and
1(b) above following delivery of the Acceptance Notice (and Parent shall have
no obligations pursuant to Sections 1(a) and 1(b) above), or (ii) following
his appointment to the Board, request that the Holder resign from the Board
and any committees thereof (a "Resignation Request"). Immediately following
delivery of a Resignation Request to the Holder, the Holder shall take any and
all actions to resign from the Board and any committees thereof which shall
be effective immediately. "Disqualifying Event" means any of the following:
(x) conduct by the Holder that is or would reasonably be expected to be
materially harmful to the business, interests or reputation of Parent, it
being understood that the Holders commission of, being indicted or charged
with, or making a plea of _nolo contendere_ to a felony or a misdemeanor
involving moral turpitude, deceit, dishonesty or fraud shall be deemed
materially harmful to the business and Parent; (y) the Holders material
violation of any provision of any Parent Policy (as defined below) or any
agreement(s) between the Holder and Parent (and/or any of its Affiliates); or
(z) the existence of any action or proceeding (whether in court or
arbitration) between the Holder (or one of his Affiliates) and a Parent
Indemnified Party, other than an action relating to a claim for an
Indemnifiable Matter (other than any claim relating to fraud, Willful
Breach or a Related Party Transaction) commenced by a Parent Indemnified
Party. In connection with any annual meeting of the Stockholders (and any
adjournments or postponements thereof) or any special meeting of the
Stockholders, the Holder shall cause to be present for quorum purposes and
vote or cause to be voted all Common Stock beneficially owned the Holder or
his Affiliates and which he or such Affiliates are entitled to vote on the
record date for such annual or special meeting in favor of, (i) the election
of directors nominated by the Board and (ii) otherwise in accordance with the
Boards recommendation; _provided, however_ , that the Holders obligations
under this Section 1(d) shall terminate upon (x) the Holders failure to
deliver an Acceptance Notice by the end of the day on the Notice Date, or (y)
the occurrence of a Holder Sell-Off Event following the Holders appointment
to the Board in accordance with Section 1(a).

(e) The Holder and Parent acknowledge that, except as otherwise provided
herein, the Holder, upon election to the Board, shall serve as a member of
the Board and shall be governed by the same protections and obligations
regarding confidentiality, conflicts of interest, related-party transactions,
fiduciary duties, codes of conduct, trading and disclosure policies, director
resignation policies, and corporate governance policies of Parent (each, a
"Parent Policy" and collectively, "Parent Policies") as other directors, and
shall be required to preserve the confidentiality of, and not disclose to any
Person, non-public information of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, including
discussions or matters considered in meetings of the Board or any committees
or subcommittees thereof, and shall have the same rights and benefits,
including with respect to insurance, indemnification, compensation and fees,
as are applicable to all non-employee directors of Parent. As a condition to
the Holders election to the Board, the Holder agrees to sign all documents
required to be signed by members of the Board, consistent with past practices,
including without limitation Parents Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and
Statement of Parent Policy on Insider Trading and Disclosure and Trading
Procedure for Insiders. Parent represents and warrants that all Parent
Policies in effect as of the date hereof are publicly available on
Parents website or described in its proxy statement filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on April 21, 2017, or have
otherwise been provided to the Holder.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if a majority of the
directors of the Board reasonably determine in good faith that access to
information or attendance at a meeting of the Board by the Holder could result
in a conflict of interest between the Holder and Parent with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement, Parent reserves the right to withhold any such
information and to exclude the Holder from any such meeting of the Board or
portion thereof. 2\. Standstill Provisions.

 

1\. The Holder agrees that during the period commencing on the date of this
Agreement through the later of (x) the Notice Date, or (y) Holders removal,
resignation or failure to stand for reelection as a member of the Board (the
"Standstill Period"), unless specifically authorized in writing by the Board,
neither the Holder nor any of his controlled Affiliates will, directly or
indirectly, in any manner:

i) engage in any solicitation of proxies or consents or become
a "participant" in a "solicitation" (as such terms are defined in Regulation
14A under the Exchange Act) of proxies or consents (including, without
limitation, any solicitation of consents that seeks to call a special meeting
of the Stockholders), in each case, with respect to securities of Parent;

ii) form, join or in any way participate in any "group" (within the meaning
of Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) with respect to the Common Stock;

iii) deposit any Common Stock in any voting trust or subject any Common Stock
to any arrangement or agreement with respect to the voting of any Common
Stock, other than in accordance with this Agreement;

 

iv) acquire or seek to acquire any securities or rights or options to acquire
any securities of Parent, or any derivative securities or instruments, if
such acquisition would result in the Holder and his Affiliates having
aggregate beneficial ownership of more than 19.9% of the Common Stock
outstanding, or economic exposure to more than 19.9% of the Common Stock
outstanding;

 

v) seek, or encourage any Person, to submit nominations in furtherance of a
"contested solicitation" for the election or removal of directors with
respect to Parent or seek, encourage or take any other action with respect to
the election or removal of any directors;

 

vi) unless otherwise authorized by the Board, affirmatively solicit any third
party, on an unsolicited basis, to make an offer or proposal (with or without
conditions) with respect to any merger, acquisition, recapitalization,
restructuring, disposition or other business combination involving Parent, or
encourage, initiate or support any third party in making such an offer or
proposal (not including the Merger);

vii) make or be the proponent of any stockholder proposal (pursuant to
Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act or otherwise) for consideration by the
Stockholders;

viii) seek, alone or in concert with others, representation on the Board,
except as specifically permitted in this Agreement;

ix) knowingly advise, encourage, support or influence any Person with respect
to the voting or disposition of any securities of Parent at any Annual Meeting
or special meeting of the Stockholders, in each case, for the purpose of
facilitating, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, any action by
any Person, which, if taken by the Holder, would constitute a breach of this
Section 2; or

x) publicly disclose any intention, plan or arrangement inconsistent with any
provision of this Section 2\.

3\. Registration Statement for Parent Common Stock.

(a) Parent shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to either amend a
current Registration Statement on Form S-3 (or other available form of
Registration Statement) or file a new Registration Statement on Form S-3 (or
other available form of Registration Statement) (in either case, the
"Registration Statement") within forty-five (45) days after a request by the
Holder to provide for the resale of all or any of the Consideration Shares;
_provided, however_ , that if a Holder Sell-Off Event has occurred, then
Parent shall have no  obligation pursuant to this Section 3\. Parent shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause any such Registration Statement to become
effective as soon as practicable following the filing thereof.

(b) The Holder shall furnish all information reasonably requested by Parent
for inclusion in the Registration Statement and any related prospectus.
Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to have the Registration
Statement promptly declared effective by the SEC. Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Registration Statement
effective pursuant to Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act, and
available for sales of all of the Consideration Shares at all times until the
earlier of (i) the date as of which the Parent determines that the Holder may
sell all of the Consideration Shares without restriction pursuant to the last
sentence of Rule 144(b)(1)(i) promulgated under the Securities Act (or
successor thereto) or (ii) the date on which the Holder shall have sold all
the Consideration Shares (the "Registration Period"). The Registration
Statement (including any amendments or supplements thereto and prospectuses
contained therein) shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein, or necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they
were made, not misleading; _provided, however_ , that Parent shall not be
liable with respect to any information furnished to Parent by or on behalf of
the Holder or his representatives in writing specifically for use in the
preparation of such Registration Statement (including any amendments or
supplements thereto and prospectuses contained therein).

 

(c) Parent shall, as required by applicable securities regulations, from time
to time file with the SEC, pursuant to Rule 424 promulgated under the
Securities Act, the prospectus and prospectus supplements, if any, to be used
in connection with sale of the Consideration Shares under the Registration
Statement.

 

(d) Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC such amendments (including
post-effective amendments) and supplements to any registration statement and
the prospectus used in connection with such registration statement, which
prospectus is to be filed pursuant to Rule 424 promulgated under the
Securities Act, as may be necessary to keep the Registration Statement
effective at all times during the Registration Period, and, during such
period, comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the
disposition of all Consideration Shares covered by the Registration Statement
until such time as all of such Consideration Shares shall have been disposed
of in accordance with the intended methods of disposition by the Holder as set
forth in such registration statement.

 

(e) Upon request by the Holder, Parent shall furnish to the Holder, (i)
promptly after the same is prepared and filed with the SEC, at least one copy
of such Registration Statement and any amendment(s) thereto, including
financial statements and schedules, all documents incorporated therein by
reference and all exhibits, (ii) upon the effectiveness of any
Registration Statement, a copy of the prospectus included in such
registration statement and all amendments and supplements thereto (or such
other number of copies as the Holder may reasonably request) and (iii) such
other documents, including copies of any preliminary or final prospectus, as
the Holder may reasonably request from time to time.

(f) In connection with a request by the Holder under Section 3(a), Parent
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) register and qualify the
Consideration Shares covered by the Registration Statement under such other
securities or "blue sky" laws of such jurisdictions in the United States as
the Holder reasonably requests, (ii) prepare and file in those jurisdictions,
such amendments (including post-effective amendments) and supplements to such
registrations and qualifications as may be necessary to maintain the
effectiveness thereof during the Registration Period, (iii) take such other
actions as may be necessary to maintain such registrations and qualifications
in effect at all times during the Registration Period, and (iv) take all
other actions reasonably necessary or advisable to qualify the Consideration
Shares for sale in such jurisdictions; provided, that Parent shall not be
required in connection therewith or as a condition thereto to (x) qualify to
do business in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to
qualify but for this Section 3(a), or (y) subject itself to general taxation
in any such jurisdiction. Parent shall promptly notify the Holder of the
receipt by Parent of any notification with respect to the suspension of the
registration or qualification of any of the Consideration Shares for sale
under the securities or "blue sky" laws of any jurisdiction in the United
States or its receipt of actual notice of the initiation or threatening of
any proceeding for such purpose. (g) Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to prevent the
issuance of any stop order or other suspension of effectiveness of any
registration statement, or the suspension of the qualification of any
Consideration Shares for sale in any jurisdiction and, if such an order or
suspension is issued, to obtain the withdrawal of such order or suspension as
promptly as possible and to notify the Holder of the issuance of such order
and the resolution thereof or its receipt of actual notice of the initiation
or threat of any proceeding for such purpose.

 

(h) With a view to making available to the Holder the benefits of Rule 144
promulgated under the Securities Act ("Rule 144") or any other similar rule
or regulation of the SEC that may at any time permit the Holder to sell
securities of Parent to the public without registration, Parent will (i) make
and keep public information available, as those terms are understood
and defined in Rule 144; and (ii) file with the SEC in a timely manner all
reports and other documents required of Parent under the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act so long as Parent remains subject to such requirements and
the filing of such reports and other documents is required for the applicable
provisions of Rule 144.

4\. Lock-up of Consideration Shares.

The Holder hereby agrees, without Parents prior written consent and other
than as expressly contemplated by the Merger Agreement, that Holder shall
not, during each of the first and second consecutive twelve month periods,
beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the second anniversary of the
Closing Date (each such twelve month period, a "Lock-Up Period"), sell or
otherwise transfer, make any short sale of, grant any option for the purchase
of, encumber, or enter into any hedging or similar transaction with the same
economic effect as a sale of Common Stock, such that the aggregate number of
shares of Common Stock sold by the Holder during such Lock-Up Period would be
equal to or greater than one-half (1/2) of the Consideration Shares (as
adjusted for any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend,
reclassification or similar event with respect to the Common Stock after the
date hereof); _provided, however_ , that the forgoing restrictions shall not
apply in the case of transfers by the Holder by gift to a charitable trust or
charitable organization, solely for estate planning purposes, and, for the
avoidance of doubt, not by transfer for value, and of which the Holder has
provided to Parent prior to written notice, by will or the laws of descent
and distribution, or by transfers to a charitable remainder trust established
by the Holder, _provided_ that any shares of Common Stock transferred thereto
shall remain subject to this Section 4 for the duration of the Lock-Up
Period. Parent may impose stop-transfer instructions with respect to shares of
Common Stock subject to the foregoing restriction until the end of the Lock-Up
Period. In connection with any debt or equity financing of Parent, the Holder
agrees to promptly sign and return to Parent the Parents form of lock-up
agreement, to the extent other members of the Board are also required to sign
such form of lock-up agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, nothing in this Section 4 shall prohibit the establishment by the
Holder of a zero-cost collar investment position (a "Hedge Position") for so
long as the Holder is not a member of the Board; _provided, however_ , that
upon the Holders appointment to the Board, the Holder shall terminate and
unwind any such Hedge Position existing on such date. The Holder shall not
establish or maintain any Hedge Position for so long as the Holder is a member
of the Board.

 

5\. Specific Performance.

Each of the Holder, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand,
acknowledges and agrees that irreparable injury to the other would occur in
the event any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached and that such
injury would not be adequately compensable by the remedies available at law
(including the payment of money damages). It is accordingly agreed that the
Holder, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand (in either case, the
"Moving Party"), shall each be entitled to specific enforcement of, and
injunctive relief to prevent any violation of, the terms hereof, and the other
will not take action, directly or indirectly, in opposition to the Moving
Party seeking such relief on the grounds that any other remedy or relief is
available at law or in equity. This Section 5 is not the exclusive remedy for
any violation of this Agreement. 6\. Severability.

 

If any provision of this Agreement or the application thereof, becomes or is
declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or
unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and
effect and the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances
will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the parties
hereto. The parties further agree to replace such void or unenforceable
provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will
achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of
such void or unenforceable provision.

7\. Notices.

 

All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall
be deemed delivered, given and received (a) when delivered in person, (b)
when transmitted by email or facsimile (with written confirmation of completed
transmission), (c) on the third (3rd) Business Day following the mailing

(a) All disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of or relating to the
Agreement, or the negotiation, breach, validity or performance hereof or the
transactions contemplated hereby, including claims of fraud or fraud in the
inducement, and including as well the determination of the scope or
applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, shall be resolved solely and
exclusively by binding arbitration administered by JAMS in New York, New
York, before a single arbitrator (the "Arbitrator"). Except as modified in
this Section 8, the arbitration shall be administered pursuant to JAMSs
Comprehensive Rules and Procedures. The parties further agree that this
arbitration shall apply equally to requests for temporary, preliminary or
permanent injunctive relief, except that in the case of temporary or
preliminary injunctive relief any party may proceed in court without prior
arbitration for the purpose of avoiding immediate and irreparable harm or to
enforce its rights under any non-competition covenants.

 

(b) The parties covenant and agree that the arbitration hearing shall commence
within thirty (30) days of the date on which a written demand for arbitration
is filed by any party hereto (the "Filing Date"). The hearing shall be no more
than five (5) Business Days. In connection with the arbitration, the
Arbitrator shall have the power to order the production of documents by each
party and any third-party witnesses. In addition, each party may take up to
three (3) depositions as of right, with each deposition limited to eight (8)
hours, excluding breaks, and the Arbitrator may grant additional depositions
upon good cause shown. For purposes of determining the number of depositions
as of right, multiple petitioners or multiple respondents shall each
respectively be deemed one party. The Arbitrator shall not have the power to
order the answering of interrogatories or the response to requests for
admission. The Arbitrators award shall be made and delivered within ninety
(90) days of the Filing Date, shall be binding and final as between the
parties, and a judgment may be entered upon the award in any court having
jurisdiction thereof. The Arbitrators decision shall set forth a reasoned
basis for any award of damages or finding of liability. The parties covenant
and agree that the arbitration shall conclude within six (6) months of the
Filing Date, and the Arbitrator shall be provided notice of such six-month
limit (and agreed to abide by it) prior to his or her appointment as
Arbitrator.

 

(c) The parties will (i) bear their own attorneys fees, costs and expenses in
connection with the arbitration, and (ii) share equally in the fees and
expenses charged by the Arbitrator; provided, that the prevailing party shall
be awarded its share of the Arbitrators fees and expenses and all other costs
and expenses, including reasonable attorneys, consultants and experts
fees; provided further that any party unsuccessfully refusing to comply with
the award or an order of the Arbitrator shall be liable for costs and
expenses, including reasonable attorneys, consultants and experts fees,
incurred by the other party in enforcing the award or order. If the Arbitrator
determines a party to be the prevailing party under circumstances where the
prevailing party obtained relief on some but not all of the claims
and counterclaims, the Arbitrator may award the prevailing party an
appropriate percentage of the costs and expenses incurred by the prevailing
party.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

Reference is herein made to the Agreement and Plan of Merger and
Reorganization, dated as of June 22 2017, by and among Repligen Corporation, a
Delaware corporation ("Repligen"), Top Hat, Inc., a California corporation and
wholly-owned subsidiary of Repligen ("First Merger Sub"), Swing Time, LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Repligen
("Second Merger Sub"), Spectrum, Inc., a California corporation (the
"Company"), and Roy T. Eddleman, an individual, solely in his capacity as the
representative of the Companys securityholders (the "Merger Agreement"),
pursuant to which (i) First Merger Sub shall merge with and into the Company,
and the Company will survive as a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Repligen
(the " _First Merger_ "), and (ii) thereafter as part of the same overall
transaction, the Company will merge with and into Second Merger Sub and Second
Merger Sub will survive as a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Repligen. In
connection with, and conditioned on the effectiveness of, the First Merger,
the undersigned herewith surrenders any and all certificates (the
"Certificates"), which prior to the First Merger represented the Companys
shares of Class A Common Stock and the Companys shares of Class B Common
Stock (collectively, the "Shares") held by the undersigned immediately prior
to the effectiveness of the First Merger, in exchange for the consideration
contemplated by the Merger Agreement payable in respect of any such Shares. By
delivery of this Letter of Transmittal to Repligen and the Company, the
undersigned hereby (i) forever waives all dissenters rights under California
law and (ii) withdraws all written objections to the First Merger and/or
demands for appraisal, if any, with respect to the Shares owned by the
undersigned.

 

The undersigned represents that the undersigned has full authority to
surrender the Shares, free and clear of all liens, claims and encumbrances.
All authority conferred or agreed to be conferred in this Letter of
Transmittal shall be binding upon the successors, assigns, heirs, executors,
administrators and legal representatives of the undersigned and shall not be
affected by, and shall survive, the death or incapacity of the undersigned.
The surrender of Shares hereby is irrevocable at and following the
effectiveness of the First Merger.

 

The undersigned understands that surrender is not made in acceptable form
until the receipt by Repligen of this Letter of Transmittal duly completed
and signed, and of any applicable Certificate(s), it being understood that
surrender will not occur unless and until the effectiveness of the First
Merger. All questions as to validity, form and eligibility of any surrender of
Shares hereby will be determined by the Company (which may delegate power in
whole or in part to Repligen) and such determination shall be final and
binding. Note that if you have lost any Certificate(s), please follow the
instruction 6 in the instructions accompanying this Letter of Transmittal.

The undersigned understands that payment for surrendered Shares will be made
in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement following the
effectiveness of the First Merger and after the receipt by Repligen of a
properly completed copy of this Letter of Transmittal, any required tax forms
(follow the instruction 7 in the instructions accompanying this Letter of
Transmittal), the surrender of Certificate(s) representing any Shares and  such other documents required under the Merger Agreement. The undersigned
understands that by submitting this Letter of Transmittal, and surrendering
any applicable Certificate(s), the undersigned also surrenders any Shares
that may be issued to the undersigned after the Certificate(s) are surrendered
and prior to the closing of the First Merger.

 

If the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, this
Letter of Transmittal will be deemed null and void and have no further force
and effect (including without limitation with respect to the surrender of any
Shares).

Please issue the payment to which the undersigned is entitled in the name set
forth and deliver such payment by the method set forth, unless otherwise
indicated.

 _INSTRUCTIONS_

 

 _1\. Delivery of Letter of Transmittal and, if applicable, Certificate(s)._
This Letter of Transmittal filled in and signed, must be used in connection
with the surrender of the Shares at or following the effectiveness of the
First Merger, and the delivery and surrender of Certificate(s) for any Shares.
A Letter of Transmittal, and the Certificate(s) for any Shares, must be
received by Repligen, in satisfactory form, in order to make an effective
surrender. Delivery of Certificate(s) and other documents shall be effected,
and the risk of loss and title to the Certificate(s) shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificate(s) to Repligen. The method of delivery of
Certificate(s) and other documents is at the election and risk of the
shareholder. If such delivery is by mail, registered mail with return receipt
requested, properly insured, is recommended. Surrender may be made by mail,
by hand or by overnight courier to Repligen at the address shown above. Upon
receipt by Repligen of this Letter of Transmittal, and surrender of the
Certificate(s) for any Shares, any Shares issued subsequent to such surrender
and prior to the closing of the First Merger shall be deemed to be surrendered
for payment effective at the effective time of the First Merger.

 

 _2._ _Terms of Conversion of the Shares._ Each Share (as shown in the box on
the first page of this Letter of Transmittal) will be converted at the
effective time of the First Merger into the right to receive the consideration
contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

 

 _3\. Signatures on Letter of Transmittal and Endorsements._ The signature(s)
must correspond with the name(s) as written on the face of the Certificate(s)
without alteration, enlargement or any change whatsoever. If any of the Shares
surrendered hereby are held of record by two or more joint owners, all such
owners must sign this Letter of Transmittal. If this Letter of Transmittal is
signed by the registered holder(s) of the Shares listed and surrendered
hereby, no endorsements of Certificates or separate stock powers are required.

 

 _4\. Stock Transfer Taxes._ The shareholder will bear liability for any state
stock transfer taxes applicable to the delivery of checks in payment for
surrendered Shares. It shall be a condition of the issuance and delivery of
such check that the amount of any stock transfer taxes (whether imposed on the
registered holder(s) or such person(s)) payable on account of the transfer
(or transfers) of the surrendered Shares shall be delivered to Repligen or
satisfactory evidence of the payment of such taxes or nonapplicability thereof
shall be submitted to Repligen before such check will be issued.

 

 _5\. Validity of Surrender, Irregularities._ All questions as to validity,
form and eligibility of any surrender of Shares hereby will be reasonably
determined by Repligen. Repligen reserves the right to waive any
irregularities or defects in the surrender of any Shares, and its
interpretations of the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and of
this Letter of Transmittal (including these instructions) with respect to
such irregularities or defects shall be reasonably determined by Repligen. A
surrender will not be deemed to have been made until all irregularities have
been cured or waived.

 

 _6\. Letter of Transmittal Required; Surrender of Certificate(s); Lost
Certificate(s)._ You will not receive any cash for your Shares unless and
until you deliver this Letter of Transmittal duly completed and signed, to
Repligen, together with the Certificate(s) representing any Shares and any
required accompanying evidences of authority in form satisfactory to the
Company. If any Certificate(s) has (have) been lost or destroyed, such fact
should be indicated on the face of this Letter of Transmittal. In such event,
Repligen will forward additional documentation and instructions necessary to
be completed in order to effectively surrender the Shares represented by such
lost or destroyed Certificate(s) as contemplated by the Merger Agreement
(which may include an indemnity in the form provided by Repligen). No interest
will be paid on amounts due for the Shares. 

_7\. IRS Form W-9 or IRS Form W-8._ Each shareholder surrendering Shares for
payment is required to provide Repligen with a correct Taxpayer Identification
Number ("TIN") and certain other information on an appropriate Form W-9
(attached hereto), or an appropriate IRS Form W-8 (available online at
www.irs.gov). _Exhibit H_

 

Form of Director and Officer Resignation and Release Letter THIS RESIGNATION AND GENERAL RELEASE (the " _Release_ ") is being delivered by
the undersigned pursuant to Section 6.13 of the Agreement and Plan of Merger
and Reorganization, dated as of June 22, 2017, among Spectrum, Inc., a
California corporation (the " _Company_ "), Repligen Corporation, a
Delaware corporation (" _Repligen_ "), Top Hat, Inc., a California
corporation, Swing Time, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and Roy T.
Eddleman, as the Securityholder Representative (the " _Merger Agreement_ ").
All capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Release shall have the
meanings assigned thereto in the Merger Agreement.

(a) The undersigned hereby resigns as a director and officer (to the extent
the undersigned holds such positions or office)[, and from the undersigneds
position as an employee,] of the Company [and its Subsidiaries] effective as
of the Effective Time. 

(b) The undersigned, on behalf of himself and his descendants, ancestors,
heirs, executors, successors, assigns and administrators (collectively, "
_Releasor_ "), hereby releases, remises, acquits and forever discharges, and
agrees to indemnify and hold harmless, (i) the Company, (ii) each Affiliate of
the Company, (iii) Repligen and (iv) each of their respective predecessors,
successors, assigns, officers, directors, shareholders, manager, members,
representatives, insurers, attorneys, employees and agents, past, present and
future, in their respective capacities as such (collectively, " _Releasees_
"), from and against any and all claims, demands, obligations, causes of
action, debts, expenses, damages, judgments, orders and liabilities of
whatever kind or nature, in law, equity or otherwise, whether now known
or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, matured or unmatured, and whether
concealed or hidden, which the undersigned now owns or holds or has at any
time heretofore owned or held or had, or may at any time own or hold or have
(collectively, " _Claims_ "), against the Releasees or any of them, including
without limitation Claims arising out of or in any way connected to any
transactions, occurrences, acts or omissions regarding or relating to his
employment or service with the Company (including the Companys entering into
the Merger Agreement), or the end of his employment or service with the
Company, including but not limited to, the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, Americans With Disabilities
Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and/or the Civil Rights Act
of 1991, provided, however, that this Release shall not affect any of the
undersigneds rights with respect to (i) the consideration payable to him or
her in connection with the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement; (ii) any unpaid salary or other earned but unpaid
compensation accrued for the payroll period during which this Release becomes
effective; and (iii) to any other vested but unpaid benefits to which the
undersigned may be entitled under any Company benefit plan.

 

(c) Solely for those matters that are expressly stated above (collectively the
" _Release Matters_ "), the release set forth herein is intended as a release
of all Claims that the Releasor may have against the Releasees or any of them,
whether now known or unknown. The undersigned makes this waiver with full
knowledge of his rights, after consulting with legal counsel if he so
chooses, and with specific intent to release both his known and unknown claims
relating to the Release Matters. Accordingly, Releasor specifically waives all
rights and benefits, if any, afforded by California Civil Code Section 1542
and any corresponding provision of other applicable law, and does so
understanding and acknowledging the significance of such specific waiver of
such statutory protection, which provides, in effect, as follows:

 

"A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW
OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH
IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR."

Thus, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of the California Civil Code
or any corresponding provision of other applicable law, and for the purposes
of implementing a full and complete release and discharge of the Releasees
relating to the Release Matters, the undersigned expressly acknowledges that
the foregoing release is intended to include, without limitation, Claims, if
any, that the undersigned does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at
the time of the execution hereof relating to the Release Matters, and the
foregoing release contemplates the extinguishment of any such Claim or Claims
relating to the Release Matters except as otherwise expressly set forth
herein. The undersigned further acknowledges that he has been advised to
consult with legal counsel regarding the legal consequences to him of this
Release. (d) The undersigned acknowledges that the consideration payable to him or her
in connection with the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, including, without limitation, any additional director retainer
fees, provides good and sufficient consideration for every promise, duty,
release, obligation, agreement and right contained in this Release.

(e) The undersigned acknowledges and agrees that the Company and Repligen are
intended third party beneficiaries of and to this Release and each and all of
the undersigneds promises, covenants, obligations and restrictions hereunder.
Accordingly, all terms of this Release are intended for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, the Company and Repligen. Without limiting the
foregoing, and for avoidance of doubt, the Company and Repligen may enforce
this Release and/or seek any remedies under or for breach of this Agreement by
the undersigned (and may do so regardless of whether the Company or Repligen
also seeks enforcement or remedies and/or has been harmed or damaged).

(f) The undersigned represents and warrants that he has not filed or caused
to be filed any complaints or charges against any of the Releasees with or
before any local, state or federal governmental agency or court or any
arbitrator or other tribunal, and no such complaint or charge by or on behalf
of the undersigned is currently pending.

(g) This Release is being delivered in connection with, and is conditional
upon, the occurrence of the Effective Time, and shall be of no force or
effect if the Merger Agreement shall be terminated in accordance with the
provisions thereof prior to the Effective Time.

 

(h) No waiver of any breach of any term or provision of this Release shall be
construed to be, nor shall be, a waiver of any other breach of this Release.
No waiver shall be binding unless in writing and signed by the party waiving
the breach.
