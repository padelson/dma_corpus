in connection with the surrender of the Shares at or following the effectiveness of the First Merger, and the delivery and surrender of Certificate(s) for any Shares. A Letter of Transmittal, and the Certificate(s) for any Shares, must be received
by Repligen, in satisfactory form, in order to make an effective surrender. Delivery of Certificate(s) and other documents shall be effected, and the risk of loss and title to the Certificate(s) shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificate(s) to Repligen. The method of delivery of Certificate(s) and other documents is at the election and risk of the shareholder. If such delivery is by mail, registered mail with return receipt requested, properly insured, is recommended.
Surrender may be made by mail, by hand or by overnight courier to Repligen at the address shown above. Upon receipt by Repligen of this Letter of Transmittal, and surrender of the Certificate(s) for any Shares, any Shares issued subsequent to such
surrender and prior to the closing of the First Merger shall be deemed to be surrendered for payment effective at the effective time of the First Merger. </P>

the Certificate(s) without alteration, enlargement or any change whatsoever. If any of the Shares surrendered hereby are held of record by two or more joint owners, all such owners must sign this Letter of Transmittal. If this Letter of Transmittal
is signed by the registered holder(s) of the Shares listed and surrendered hereby, no endorsements of Certificates or separate stock powers are required. </P>

payment for surrendered Shares. It shall be a condition of the issuance and delivery of such check that the amount of any stock transfer taxes (whether imposed on the registered holder(s) or such person(s)) payable on account of the transfer (or
transfers) of the surrendered Shares shall be delivered to Repligen or satisfactory evidence of the payment of such taxes or nonapplicability thereof shall be submitted to Repligen before such check will be issued. </P>

reasonably determined by Repligen. Repligen reserves the right to waive any irregularities or defects in the surrender of any Shares, and its interpretations of the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and of this Letter of Transmittal
(including these instructions) with respect to such irregularities or defects shall be reasonably determined by Repligen. A surrender will not be deemed to have been made until all irregularities have been cured or waived. </P>

unless and until you deliver this Letter of Transmittal duly completed and signed, to Repligen, together with the Certificate(s) representing any Shares and any required accompanying evidences of authority in form satisfactory to the Company. If any
Certificate(s) has (have) been lost or destroyed, such fact should be indicated on the face of this Letter of Transmittal. In such event, Repligen will forward additional documentation and instructions necessary to be completed in order to
effectively surrender the Shares represented by such lost or destroyed Certificate(s) as contemplated by the Merger Agreement (which may include an indemnity in the form provided by Repligen). No interest will be paid on amounts due for the Shares.

(collectively, &#147;<U>Releasor</U>&#148;), hereby releases, remises, acquits and forever discharges, and agrees to indemnify and hold harmless, (i)&nbsp;the Company, (ii)&nbsp;each Affiliate of the Company, (iii)&nbsp;Repligen and (iv)&nbsp;each

he so chooses, and with specific intent to release both his known and unknown claims relating to the Release Matters. Accordingly, Releasor specifically waives all rights and benefits, if any, afforded by California Civil Code Section&nbsp;1542 and
any corresponding provision of other applicable law, and does so understanding and acknowledging the significance of such specific waiver of such statutory protection, which provides, in effect, as follows: </P>

the California Civil Code or any corresponding provision of other applicable law, and for the purposes of implementing a full and complete release and discharge of the Releasees relating to the Release Matters, the undersigned expressly acknowledges
that the foregoing release is intended to include, without limitation, Claims, if any, that the undersigned does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of the execution hereof relating to the Release Matters, and the foregoing release
