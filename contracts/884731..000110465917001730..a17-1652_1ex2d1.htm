the Merger or impair the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the
Offer, (v) extend or otherwise change the Offer Expiration Time (except as
required or permitted by the other provisions of this _Section 2.01_), (vi)

such Offer Conditions;

 



 

 _provided_ , that, without the Companys written consent, Merger Sub shall
not extend the Offer, and without Parents prior written consent, Merger Sub

Schedule TO and documents, together with any supplements or amendments
thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ ") and (ii) cause the Offer Documents to be

opportunity to review and comment upon the Offer Documents and any amendments
and supplements thereto prior to filing such documents with the SEC or
dissemination of such documents to the stockholders of the Company and Parent
and Merger Sub shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any
comments made by the Company and its counsel. Prior to any Change in
Recommendation, Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) provide the Company and its

receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly
after the receipt of such comments (and shall give the Company and its counsel
prompt telephonic notice of any material discussions with the SEC staff), (ii)
provide the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment upon the responses to any such comments and a copy of any proposed
written responses thereto prior to the filing thereof, and (iii) give

unless mutually agreed by Parent and the Company, any Shares subject to

Sub or by an agent of Merger Sub.

required by Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act and any other
Applicable Law, including by setting the Stockholder List Date as the record

DGCL. Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly furnish the Company with all
information concerning Parent and Merger Sub required by the Exchange Act to
be set forth in the Schedule 14D-9, and all other information concerning
Parent and Merger Sub as reasonably requested by the Company for inclusion in
the Schedule 14D-9. Except with respect to any amendments filed after a Change
in Recommendation, (i) Parent shall be given reasonable opportunity to review
and comment upon the Schedule 14D-9 and any amendments and supplements thereto
prior to filing such documents with the SEC or dissemination of such documents
to the stockholders of the Company and the Company shall give reasonable and
good faith consideration to any comments made by Parent and (ii) the Company
shall (A) provide Parent in writing any comments the Company may

Parent or Merger Sub in writing specifically for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Schedule 14D-9. The Company shall respond promptly to any
comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9. Each of
the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such
information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and
the Company shall take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the Schedule
14D-9 and to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so amended or supplemented to be
filed with the SEC and disseminated to the holders of Shares, in each case as
and to the extent required by Applicable Law.

 



 

(c) _Stockholder Lists_. In connection with the Offer, the Company shall
instruct its transfer agent to furnish Merger Sub (x) promptly (and in any
event no later than five (5) Business Days after the date of this Agreement)
and (y) from time to time thereafter as requested by Parent, with a list of
its stockholders and mailing labels containing the names and addresses of the

persons becoming record holders subsequent to such date, together with copies
of all lists of stockholders, security position listings and computer files
and all other information in the Companys possession regarding the beneficial
owners of the Shares, and shall furnish to Merger Sub such information and

listings and computer files) as Parent may reasonably request in communicating
the Offer to the holders of Shares (the date of the list used to determine the
Persons to whom the Offer Documents and the Schedule 14D-9 are first
disseminated, the " _Stockholder List Date_ "). Subject to Applicable Law, and
except for such steps as are necessary to communicate the Offer to the holders
of Shares, Parent and Merger Sub and their Representatives (i) shall hold in
confidence such lists, files and information and will use such information
only in connection with the Offer and the Merger and (ii) following the
termination of this Agreement, shall promptly either deliver to the Company or
destroy, and shall cause their Representatives to deliver to the Company or
destroy, all copies and any extracts or summaries of such information then in
their possession or control and notify the Company that all such material has
been so returned or destroyed. Unless the Company has received after the date
hereof and prior to the date of mailing an Acquisition Proposal that is
reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal (as contemplated in Section
6.02(b)), the Company and Parent shall use reasonable efforts to coordinate
the mailing of the Offer Documents and the Schedule 14D-9 so they can be

soon as practicable after (but on the same day as) the consummation of the
Offer, subject to satisfaction or, to the extent permitted hereunder, waiver
of all conditions set forth in _Article 7_ (other than those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted hereunder) of such
conditions), unless this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to its terms
or unless another time or date is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto.
The Closing shall be held at the offices of Cleary Gottlieb Steen and Hamilton
LLP, One Liberty Plaza, New York, New York, unless another place is agreed
upon in writing by the parties hereto.

(a) _Effecting the Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, as promptly as
practicable on the Closing Date, Parent and the Company shall cause a
certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed,
acknowledged and delivered to the Office of the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware for filing, all in accordance with the applicable provisions
of the DGCL and take all other necessary or appropriate action to cause the
Merger to be effected under Section 251(h) of the DGCL without the adoption of
this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company. The Merger shall be
governed by Section 251(h) of the DGCL.

 



 

(b) _Effective Time_. The Merger shall become effective on such date and at
such time as when the Certificate of Merger has been received for filing by
the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later
time and date as may be agreed by the parties in writing and specified in the
Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ ").

 



 

(c) _Surviving Corporation_. At the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged
with and into the Company in accordance with the DGCL, whereupon the separate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall be the surviving
corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ "), and the separate
corporate existence of the Company, with all its rights, privileges,
immunities, powers and franchises, shall continue unaffected by the Merger.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all of the properties, rights, privileges, immunities, powers
and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger
Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

 



 

(d) _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in
the applicable provisions of the DGCL, this Agreement and the Certificate of
Merger.

 



 

Section 2.05 _Conversion of Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
or the stockholders thereof or any other Person:

 



 

(a) except as otherwise provided in _Section 2.05(b)_, _Section 2.05(c)_, or
_Section 2.07_, each Share (including shares of Company Restricted Stock)
outstanding

 



      
 

 



 

immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted automatically into
the right to receive the Per Share Amount in cash, net of applicable
withholding taxes and without interest;

 



 

(b) each Share owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than Shares tendered and accepted for payment by Merger Sub in
connection with the Offer) shall be cancelled and cease to exist, and no
payment shall be made with respect thereto and each holder of a Certificate
representing any such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto;

 



 

(c) each Share owned by the Company or any direct or indirect wholly-owned
Subsidiary of the Company or held in the Companys treasury immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and cease to exist, and no payment
shall be made with respect thereto and each holder of a Certificate
representing any such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto; and

 



 

(d) each share of common stock of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid,
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation, which shall constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation as of immediately following the
Effective Time.

 



 

Section 2.06 _Surrender and Payment_.

 



 

(a) _Paying Agent and Payment Fund_. Prior to the expiration of the Offer,
Parent shall appoint a paying agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the
" _Paying Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging for the Per Share Amount
certificates representing Shares (the " _Certificates_ "; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any references herein to "Certificates" are deemed to include
references to effective affidavits of loss in accordance with _Section 2.12_
or to book-entry account statements relating to the ownership of Shares). As
promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall take
all steps necessary to enable and cause the Surviving Corporation to, deposit
with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, the cash necessary to pay for the
Shares converted into the right to receive the Per Share Amount to be paid in
respect of the Certificates of Shares being converted in the Merger pursuant
to _Section 2.05(a)_ (the " _Payment Fund_ "). To the extent such fund
diminishes for any reason below the level required to make prompt payment of
the Per Share Amount to be paid in exchange for the surrender of Certificates,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall promptly replace or restore the
lost portion of such fund so as to ensure that it is, at all times, maintained
at a level sufficient to make such payments. The Payment Fund shall be
invested by the Paying Agent as directed by the Surviving Corporation;
_provided_ , that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by
the United States of America in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1
or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively, in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion, or
in money market funds having a rating in the highest investment category
granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the time of acquisition or a
combination of the foregoing and, in any such case, no such instrument shall
have a maturity exceeding three (3) months. Promptly after the Effective Time
and in any event no later than five (5) Business Days after the

 



      
 

 



 

Effective Time, Parent shall send, or shall cause the Paying Agent to send, to
each record holder of Shares at the Effective Time, in each case whose shares
were converted into the right to receive the Per Share Amount pursuant to
_Section 2.05(a)_, a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall
specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall
pass, only upon proper delivery or transfer of the Certificates to the Paying
Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may
reasonably specify (after due consultation with the Company) prior to the
consummation of the Offer) for use in such payment.

 



 

(b) _Surrender of Shares_. Each holder of Shares that have been converted into
the right to receive the Per Share Amount shall be entitled to receive the Per
Share Amount in respect of the Shares represented by a Certificate promptly
upon (i) surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate, together with a duly
completed and validly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents
as may reasonably be requested by the Paying Agent, or (ii) receipt of an
"agents message" by the Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of
transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-
entry transfer of Shares. Until so surrendered or transferred each such
Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the
right to receive such Per Share Amount. No interest shall be paid or accrued
on the cash payable upon the surrender or transfer of such Certificate.

 



 

(c) _Unregistered Transferees_. If any portion of the Per Share Amount is to
be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i)
either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay
to the Paying Agent any transfer or other Tax required as a result of such
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid
or is not payable.

 



 

(d) _No Other Rights_. The Per Share Amount paid upon the surrender of
Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares formerly
represented by such Certificate and from and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall not permit any further registration of transfers
of Shares on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation. If, after
the Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation,
Parent or the Paying Agent for transfer, the holder of such Certificates shall
be given a copy of a letter of transmittal and instructed to comply with the
instructions therein in order to receive the Per Share Amount to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to the Merger. From and after the Effective Time,
the holders of the Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise
provided herein or by Applicable Law.

 



 

(e) _Termination of the Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains unclaimed by the holders of Shares twelve (12) months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand,
and any such holder who has not exchanged Shares for the Per Share Amount in
accordance with this _Section 2.06_ prior to that time shall thereafter look
only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to _Section 2.11_) as general
creditors thereof for payment of the Per Share Amount.

 



       
 

 



 

Section 2.07 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding _Section 2.06_ or any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Shares issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who is entitled
to appraisal and who has properly exercised appraisal rights for such shares
in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not
be converted into a right to receive the Per Share Amount but instead shall be
entitled only to such rights as are granted by the DGCL to a holder of
Dissenting Shares; _provided_ , _however_ , that if, after the Effective Time,
such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses such holders right to
appraisal, pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or if a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief
provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such Shares shall immediately cease to be
Dissenting Shares and shall be treated as if they had been Shares converted as
of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Per Share Amount in
accordance with _Section 2.05(a)_, without interest thereon, upon surrender
of such Certificate formerly representing such Shares. The Company shall
provide Parent with prompt written notice of any demands received by the
Company for appraisal of Shares, any withdrawal of any such demand and any
other demand, notice and/or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the
Effective Time pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL that relates to such
demand, and Parent shall have the opportunity and right to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the
prior written consent of Parent, or if required by Applicable Law, the Company
shall not make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any
such demands.

price of such Company Stock Option) in exchange for the right to receive a
lump-sum cash payment in the amount of the Option Consideration, if any, with
respect to such Company Stock Option.

 



 

(b) _Restricted Stock Units_. Each Company Restricted Stock Unit outstanding
immediately prior to the consummation of the Offer shall, automatically and

immediately prior to, and contingent upon, the consummation of the Offer into
a vested right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Per Share Amount for
each share of Company Common Stock underlying the Company Restricted Stock
Unit.

 



 

(c) _Performance Stock Units_. Immediately prior to, and contingent upon, the
consummation of the Offer, all vesting conditions applicable to each Company
Performance Stock Unit outstanding immediately prior to the consummation of
the Offer shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of
the holder thereof, lapse, and each such Company Performance Stock Unit shall
vest as of the consummation of the Offer, at the greater of (x) the target
level of vesting for such Company Performance Stock Unit and (y) the vesting
level determined based on the actual satisfaction of the performance metrics
applicable to such Company Performance Stock Unit measured by the Compensation
Committee of the Company Board as of immediately prior to the Offer Expiration
Time (assuming, for this

 



      
 

 



 

purpose, that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement have occurred)
and each such then-vested Company Performance Stock Unit shall be converted
immediately prior to, and contingent upon, the consummation of the Offer into
a vested right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Per Share Amount for
each share subject to the Company Performance Stock Unit.

 



 

(d) _Company ESPP_. As soon as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall take all reasonable actions, including adopting

the initial Offer Expiration Time, (iv) prohibit participants in the Company
ESPP from altering their payroll deductions from those in effect on the date
of this Agreement (other than to discontinue their participation in the
Company ESPP in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Company ESPP)
and (v) provide that the amount of the accumulated contributions of each
participant under the Company ESPP as of immediately prior to the Offer
Expiration Time shall, to the extent not used to purchase shares of Company
Common Stock in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Company ESPP
(as amended pursuant to this _Section 2.08(d)_), be refunded to such
participant as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time (without
interest).

 



 

(e) At or prior to the consummation of the Offer, the Company, the Company
Board and the Compensation Committee of the Company Board, as applicable,
shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions that are necessary to
effectuate the provisions of _Section 2.05(a)_ (in respect of Company
Restricted Stock) or this _Section 2.08_.

 



 

(f) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but no later
than the earlier of (x) five (5) days after the Effective Time and (y) the
second payroll date after the Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay the amounts

any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the payments
provided for under this _Section 2.08_.

 



 

Section 2.09 _Adjustments_. If, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company shall occur, including by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including reverse stock

dividend, all references herein to a specified number of shares affected
thereby, and any calculations that are based upon such numbers of shares
affected thereby, including the Per Share Amount and any other amounts payable
pursuant to this Agreement, shall be appropriately adjusted.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 2.10 _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled (i) to deduct and withhold (or cause to be

Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such amounts
shall (i) be paid to the appropriate Taxing Authorities and (ii) to the extent
paid to the appropriate Taxing Authorities, be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which Parent,
Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be,
made such deduction and withholding.

 



 

Section 2.11 _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in
respect of any cash from the Payment Fund delivered to a public official

Section 4.09 _Financial Statements; Internal Controls_.

complied as to form with the published rules and regulations of the SEC
applicable thereto, as of their respective filing dates with the SEC, in all
material respects, (ii) were prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis during the periods involved, and (iii) fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and their consolidated results of
operations and cash flows of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of
the dates or for the periods presented therein (subject, in the case of the
Unaudited Financial Statements, to normal year-end adjustments (the effect of
which would not be material, individually or in the

 



      
 

 



 

aggregate) and the absence of notes (which notes, if presented, would not
differ materially from those presented in the Audited Financial Statements)).

 



 

(b) The Company maintains, and since January 1, 2015 has maintained, a system
of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of the Companys financial reporting and the
preparation of the Financial Statements for external purposes in accordance
with GAAP, and includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the
maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and that receipts
and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and the Board of Directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of the assets of the Company that could have a material effect on
the financial statements. The Companys management has completed an assessment
of the effectiveness of the Companys system of internal controls over
financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, and, except as
set forth in the Company SEC Documents filed prior to the date of this
Agreement, that assessment concluded that those controls were effective. Since
January 1, 2015, neither the Company nor, to the Companys Knowledge, the
Companys independent registered public accounting firm has identified or been
made aware of any "significant deficiencies" or "material weaknesses" (as such
terms are defined by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board) in the
design or operation of such internal control over financial reporting utilized
by the Company that would reasonably be expected to be adverse to the
Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management
or other employees of the Acquired Companies who have a significant role in
the Companys internal control over financial reporting.

 



 

(c) The Companys "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are designed to provide
reasonable assurance that (i) all information (both financial and non-
financial) required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported to the individuals responsible for preparing such reports within the
time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and (ii) all such
information is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management or to
other individuals responsible for preparing such reports as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the
certifications of the principal executive officer and principal financial
officer of the Company required under the Exchange Act with respect to such
reports.

 



 

(d) Since January 1, 2015, to the Companys Knowledge the Company has not
received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the
accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of the
Company or its internal accounting controls, including any material complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim that the Company has engaged in questionable
accounting or auditing practices.

at the time it is first published, sent or given to the holders of Shares,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading. The Schedule 14D-9 and each document required to filed by the
Company with the SEC in connection with the Offer will comply as to form in
all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder. No representation or warranty is made by the
Company with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein

to the extent applicable to such Company Employee Plan, of: (A) the most
recent annual report on Form 5500 required to have been filed with the IRS,

income taxes under Sections 401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code, or
has pending or has time remaining in which to file an application for such
determination from the IRS, no such determination letter has been revoked and
revocation has not been threatened, and to the Companys Knowledge there
exists no reason why any such determination or opinion letter would reasonably
be expected to be revoked or not be issued or that would otherwise materially
adversely affect the qualified status of any such Company Employee Plan. To
the Companys Knowledge, no event has occurred with respect to any registered
International Employee Plan that would result in the revocation of the
registration of such International Employee Plan, or that would entitle any
Person (without the consent of the sponsor of such International Employee
Plan) to wind up or terminate any such International Employee Plan, in whole
or in part. Each Company Employee Plan has been maintained, operated and
administered in compliance with its terms and with the requirements prescribed
by Applicable Law, except where such noncompliance would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(d) To the Companys Knowledge, neither the Company nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers, employees or

Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA, that could reasonably be
expected to result in the imposition of a future penalty assessed pursuant to
Section 502(i) of ERISA or a tax imposed by Section 4975 of the Code, in each
case applicable to the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or any Company
Employee Plan or for which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries has
any future indemnification obligation, except, in each case, as would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(e) Neither the execution or delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the Transactions will (either alone or together with any other event, other
than events taken at the direction of Parent following the Effective Time),
other than on account of such Company Employees holding Shares, (i) cause any
payment or benefit to become due or payable, or required to be provided, to
any Company Employee; (ii) increase the amount or value of any benefit,
compensation or other material obligation otherwise payable or required to be

vesting of any such benefit or compensation; (iv) accelerate the time of or
otherwise trigger any funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of any

Companys "disqualified individuals" (within the meaning of Section 280G(c) of
the Code) in connection with the Transactions (the " _Section 280G
Information_") is accurate and complete as of the date provided, except as
would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Employee Plan with respect to the administration or operation of such plans,
before any arbitrator or any Governmental Authority, except as would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(h) With respect to the Company Employee Plans, there are no benefit
obligations for which contributions have not been made or properly accrued to
the extent required by GAAP.

 



 

(i) With respect to each Company Employee Plan that is subject to Section 409A
of the Code (i) such Company Employee Plan has been operated in material
compliance with such section and all applicable regulatory guidance, and (ii)

reportable transaction under Section 409A of the Code, except, in the case of
either clause (i) or (ii) above, for any noncompliance or any reportable
transaction that have not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary is a party to, or otherwise obligated under, any Contract, plan or

Section 6.02 _Unsolicited Proposals_.

 



 

(a) Except as permitted by this _Section 6.02_, from the date of this
Agreement until the consummation of the Offer or, if earlier, the termination
of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Acquired Companies shall
not, and shall direct their respective Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly (i) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage or knowingly
facilitate the making of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or
request for information that could reasonably be expected to lead to, or
result in, an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) other than informing Third Parties of
the existence of the provisions contained in this _Section _ _6.02_ , engage
in, continue or otherwise participate in negotiations or discussions with, or
furnish any non-public information concerning the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries to, any Third Party in connection with or for the purpose
of knowingly encouraging or knowingly facilitating an Acquisition Proposal or
any inquiry, proposal or request for information that could reasonably be
expected to lead to, or result in, an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) enter into
any letter of intent, acquisition agreement, agreement in principle or similar
agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or any proposal or offer
that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal or (iv)
resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing. Promptly following the execution
of this Agreement, on the date hereof, the Acquired Companies shall, and shall
direct their respective Representatives to, (A) cease and cause to be
terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted
heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, or request
for information that could reasonably be expected to lead to, or result in, an
Acquisition Proposal and (B) terminate access by any Third Party to any
physical or electronic data room relating to any potential Acquisition
Transaction. Within three (3) Business Days of the execution of this
Agreement, the Company shall request the prompt return or destruction of any
confidential information provided to any Third Party within the twelve (12)
months immediately preceding the date of this Agreement in connection with a
proposed Acquisition Transaction. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the Company shall be permitted to grant waivers of, and not enforce,
any standstill provision or similar provision that has the effect of
prohibiting the counterparty thereto from making a private Acquisition
Proposal to the Company Board.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
prior to the consummation of the Offer the Company receives a _bona fide_
written Acquisition Proposal (which Acquisition Proposal was made after the
date of this Agreement and did not result from a breach of this _Section
6.02_), and the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior
Proposal,

 



      
 

 



 

then the Company and its Representatives may, subject to compliance with this
_Section 6.02_, do any or all of the following: (i) furnish any information
and reasonable access to any Third Party making such Acquisition Proposal;
_provided_ , that (A) prior to furnishing any information, the Company
receives from such Third Party an executed Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement and (B) any such non-public information so furnished has been
previously provided or made available to Parent or is provided or made
available (including through the Data Room) to Parent promptly (and in any
event no later forty-eight (48) hours) after it is so furnished to such Third
Party or (ii) participate or engage in negotiations or discussions with the
Person or group making such Acquisition Proposal and its Representatives
regarding such Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(c) Except as set forth in this _Section 6.02_, neither the Company Board nor
any committee thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify, amend or qualify in a
manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), or propose publicly to withdraw (or
modify, amend or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), the
Board Recommendation, (B) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose
publicly to approve, recommend or declare advisable, any Acquisition Proposal
(it being understood that failing to recommend the rejection of any
Acquisition Proposal that is a tender offer or exchange offer within ten (10)
Business Days after the commencement of such tender offer or exchange offer
shall be considered an adverse modification), (C) after public announcement of
an Acquisition Proposal (other than in connection with the commencement of a
tender offer or exchange offer), fail to publicly confirm that the Company
Board has not changed the Board Recommendation within three (3) Business Days
after a written request by Parent to do so (or, if earlier, by the close of
business on the Business Day immediately preceding the scheduled date of the
consummation of the Offer) or (D) fail to include the Board Recommendation in
the Schedule 14D-9 when disseminated to the Companys stockholders (any action
described in this clause (i) being referred to as a " _Change in
Recommendation_ ") or (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to
approve or recommend, or enter into, any Contract, letter of intent, or
memorandum of understanding with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, other
than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (an " _Alternative Acquisition
Agreement_ ").

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time prior to the consummation of the Offer, the Company Board may make a
Change in Recommendation in response to an Intervening Event if (i) the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel, that the failure to do so would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties under Applicable Law,
(ii) (A) the Company shall have provided Parent four (4) Business Days prior
written notice prior to making any such Change in Recommendation, which notice
shall describe the Intervening Event in reasonable detail and which notice
shall not constitute a Change in Recommendation and (B) if requested by Parent
in good faith, during such four (4) Business Day period after providing such
notice, negotiate in good faith with respect to any revisions to the terms of
this Agreement or another proposal to the extent proposed by Parent so that a
Change in Recommendation would no longer be necessary, and (iii) after giving
effect to the revisions and proposals contemplated by the foregoing clause
(ii), if any, after consultation with outside legal counsel, the Company Board
shall have determined in good faith that failure to make the Change in
Recommendation in response to such Intervening Event would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law.
For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this _Section 6.02(d)_ shall
also apply to any material change in the

 



      
 

 



 

event, occurrence or fact relating to such Intervening Event and require a new
notice from the Company pursuant to _Section 6.02(d)(ii)_, except that the
references to four (4) Business Days in this _Section 6.02(d)_ shall be
deemed to be two (2) Business Days.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time prior to the consummation of the Offer if, (i) in response to a _bona
fide_ written Acquisition Proposal made after the date of this Agreement and
not withdrawn that did not result from a breach of this _Section 6.02_, the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside
counsel and financial advisors) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal and (ii) the failure to do so would reasonably be expected
to be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under Applicable Law, (A)
subject to compliance with _Section 6.02(f)_, the Company Board may make a
Change in Recommendation or (B) the Company may terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.01(d)(i)_ in order to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.01(d)(i)_ unless the Company (x) has complied with its obligations
under _Section 6.02(f)_, (y) pays, or causes to be paid, to Parent the
Termination Fee payable pursuant to _Section 9.04(b)_ prior to or
concurrently with to such termination and (z) concurrently with such
termination, enters into a definitive Alternative Acquisition Agreement that
documents the terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company shall not be entitled to make a Change in Recommendation pursuant to
_Section 6.02(e)_ or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.01(d)(i)_ unless (x) the Company shall have provided to Parent four (4)
Business Days prior written notice (the " _Superior Proposal Notice_ "),
which notice shall not constitute a Change in Recommendation, advising Parent
that the Company intends to take such action (and specifying, in reasonable
detail, the reasons for such action and the material terms and conditions of
any such Superior Proposal), and (y):

 



 

(i) during such four (4) Business Day period, if requested by Parent in good
faith, the Company and its Representatives shall have engaged in good faith
negotiations with Parent regarding changes to the terms of this Agreement
intended by Parent to cause such Acquisition Proposal to no longer constitute
a Superior Proposal; and

 



 

(ii) the Company Board shall have considered any adjustments to this Agreement
(including a change to the price terms hereof) and any other agreements that
may be proposed in writing by Parent (the " _Proposed Changed Terms_ ") no
later than 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the fourth (4th) Business Day of
such four (4) Business Day period and shall have determined in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors)
that the Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if
such Proposed Changed Terms were to be given effect, and that the failure to
make the Change in Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.01(d)(i)_ would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary obligations of the Company Board under Applicable Law.

 



      
 

 



 

For the avoidance of doubt, any (1) material revisions to the terms of a
Superior Proposal or (2) material revisions to an Acquisition Proposal that
the Company Board had determined no longer constitutes a Superior Proposal,
shall constitute a new Acquisition Proposal and shall in each case require the
Company to deliver to Parent a new Superior Proposal Notice, except that the
references to four (4) Business Days in this _Section 6.02(f)_ shall be
deemed to be two (2) Business Days.

 



 

(g) The Company shall promptly (and in any event no later than the earlier to
occur of (i) one (1) Business Day and (ii) forty-eight (48) hours after
receipt) advise Parent orally or in writing in the event that the Company
receives any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or request for
information that could reasonably be expected to lead to, or result in, an
Acquisition Proposal, and in connection with such notice, provide to Parent
the terms and conditions (including the identity of the Third Party making any
such Acquisition Proposal), other than immaterial terms and conditions, of any
such Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall (i) keep Parent reasonably
informed on a current basis of the status, details and terms (other than
immaterial details and terms) of any such Acquisition Proposal (including,
prior to furnishing any information or to participating in any discussions or
negotiations pursuant to _Section 6.02(b)_, advising Parent of any
determination by the Company Board pursuant to _Section 6.02(b)_) and any
discussions and negotiations concerning the terms and conditions (other than
immaterial terms and conditions) thereof and (ii) provide to Parent as soon as
practicable (and in any event no later than the earlier to occur of (i) one
(1) Business Day and (ii) forty-eight (48) hours after receipt or delivery
thereof) any written indication of interest (or amendment thereto) or any
written material that constitutes an offer (or amendment thereto) including
copies of any proposed Alternative Acquisition Agreements and any financing
commitments related thereto.

 



 

(h) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board, directly or indirectly through their respective
Representatives, from (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the
Company any position contemplated by Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a)
of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act, (ii) making any "stop,
look and listen" communication to the Companys stockholders pursuant to Rule
14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (iii) making any disclosure to
the stockholders of the Company that is required by Applicable Law; _provided_
, that this _Section 6.02(h)_ shall not be deemed to permit the Company Board
to make a Change in Recommendation except to the extent permitted by _Section
6.02(d)  (f)_.

 



 

Section 6.03 _Approval of Merger_. The Merger shall be governed by Section
251(h) of the DGCL and shall be effected by Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
as soon as practicable following the consummation of the Offer, without a
stockholder vote, pursuant to Section 251(h) of the DGCL.

 



 

Section 6.04 _Access to Information_.

 



 

(a) Upon reasonable notice to the Company, the Acquired Companies shall, and
shall cause their respective officers, directors, employees and agents to,

employees, properties, books, Contracts, records, reports (including draft and
final reports of Deloitte and Touche LLP relating to the 2016 audited financials
as and when furnished to the Company) and other documents and information
relating to the Acquired Companies in their possession and shall furnish
Parent and Merger Sub all financial, operating and other data and information
as Parent and Merger Sub through their officers, employees or agents, may
reasonably request; _provided_ _,_ _however_ _,_ that any such access shall be
conducted at Parents expense, at a reasonable time, under the supervision of
appropriate personnel of the Acquired Companies and in such a manner as not to
unreasonably interfere with the normal operation of the business of the
Acquired Companies. Nothing herein shall require any of the Acquired Companies
to disclose any information to Parent if such disclosure would, in the
Companys reasonable discretion (i) jeopardize any attorney-client or other
legal privilege (so long as the Acquired Companies have reasonably cooperated
with Parent to permit such inspection of or to disclose such information on a
basis that does not waive such privilege with respect thereto) or (ii)
contravene any Applicable Law, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered
into prior to the date of this Agreement (including any confidentiality
agreement to which an Acquired Companies or its Affiliate is a party) (so long
as the Company has used commercially reasonable efforts to make appropriate
substitute arrangements to permit reasonable disclosure not in violation of
such Applicable Law, agreement or duty); _provided_ _,_ _further_ _,_ that
information shall be disclosed subject to execution of a joint defense
agreement in customary form, and disclosure may be limited to external counsel
for Parent, to the extent that the Company determines doing so may be
reasonably required for the purpose of complying with applicable Antitrust
Laws.

 



 

(b) No information or knowledge obtained by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to
_Section 6.02_, this _Section 6.04_ or otherwise shall affect or be deemed
to affect or modify any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained herein, the conditions to the obligations of the parties to
consummate the Merger in accordance with the terms and provisions hereof or
otherwise prejudice in any way the rights and remedies of Parent or Merger Sub
hereunder, nor shall any such information, knowledge or investigation be
deemed to affect or modify Parents or Merger Subs reliance on the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements made by the Company in
this Agreement.

 



 

(c) Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that all information provided
to it or any of its Representatives by the Company or any of its
Representatives in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the
Transactions shall be deemed to be provided under, and shall be treated in
accordance with, the Confidentiality Agreement.

(d) any fact, event or circumstance known to it that would be reasonably
likely to result in the failure of any of the conditions set forth on _Exhibit
A_ or in _Article 7_ to be satisfied; _provided_ , that the failure to
deliver any notice pursuant to this _Section _ _6.05_ shall not be considered
in determining whether the conditions set forth on _Exhibit A_ or in _Article
7_ have been satisfied;

 



 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that that no notification given by any party
pursuant to this _Section 6.05_ shall (A) limit or otherwise affect any of
the representations, warranties, covenants, obligations or conditions
contained in this Agreement, (B) otherwise prejudice in any way the rights and
remedies contained in this Agreement, (C) be deemed to affect or modify such
partys reliance on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
made by the other parties in this Agreement or (D) be deemed to amend or
supplement the Company Disclosure Schedules or prevent or cure any
misrepresentation, breach of warranty or breach of covenant by such party.

 



 

Section 6.06 _Employee Benefit Plan Matters_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall honor, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to honor, all Company Employee Plans and all employment,
severance and termination plans and agreements, in each case in accordance
with their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective Time and shall
assume any Company Employee Plans that require or contemplate assumption by
their terms by an acquirer or successor. For (i) a period of one (1) year
following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be
provided, to each Continuing Employee base salary and base wages, short-term
cash incentive compensation opportunities and severance payments and severance
benefits, each in an amount no less favorable than that in effect immediately
prior to the execution of this Agreement and (ii) the calendar year 2017,
other benefits (other than equity compensation) that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to the benefits provided to such Continuing
Employees immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) From and after the Closing Date, with respect to Continuing Employees,
Parent shall cause the service of each such Continuing Employee with the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date to be
recognized for purposes of eligibility to participate, levels of benefits (but
not for benefit accruals or participation eligibility under any defined
benefit pension plan or plan providing post-retirement medical or other
similar benefits) and vesting under each compensation, vacation, fringe or
other welfare benefit plan, program or arrangement of the Surviving
Corporation, but not including any sabbatical or equity compensation plans,
programs, agreements or arrangements (collectively, the " _Parent Benefit
Plans_ ") in which any Continuing Employee is or becomes eligible to
participate, but solely to the extent that service was credited to such
employee for such purposes under a comparable Company Employee Plan
immediately prior to the Closing Date and to the extent that such credit would
not result in a duplication of benefits.

 



 

(c) From and after the Closing Date, with respect to each Parent Benefit Plan
that is an "employee welfare benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA
in

 



      
 

 



 

which any Continuing Employee is or becomes eligible to participate, Parent
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each such Parent Benefit
Plan to waive all limitations as to pre-existing conditions, waiting periods,
required physical examinations and exclusions with respect to participation
and coverage requirements applicable under such Parent Benefit Plan for such
Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents to the same extent that
such pre-existing conditions, waiting periods, required physical examinations
and exclusions would not have applied or would have been waived under the
corresponding Company Employee Plan in which such Continuing Employee was a
participant immediately prior to his commencement of participation in such
Parent Benefit Plan but only to the extent permitted under the terms and
conditions of Parents applicable insurance Contracts in effect as of the
Closing Date.

 



 

(d) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company will reasonably cooperate with
Parent to provide updates to the Section 280G Information, if any, following
the date hereof and to provide such other related information as reasonably
requested by Parent.

 



 

(e) With respect to any accrued but unused personal, sick or vacation time to
which any Continuing Employee is entitled pursuant to the personal, sick or
vacation policies applicable to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to
the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
and instruct its Affiliates to, as applicable (and without duplication of
benefits), assume the liability for such accrued personal, sick or vacation
time and allow such Continuing Employee to use such accrued personal, sick or
vacation time in accordance with the practice and policies of the Company, as
they may be amended from time to time.

 



 

(f) Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation acknowledge and agree
that all provisions contained in this _Section 6.06_ are included for the
sole benefit of the respective parties to this Agreement and shall not create
any right in any other Person, including any Company Employee, any participant
in any Company Employee Plan or Parent Benefit Plan or any beneficiary thereof
or any right to continued employment with Parent, Company, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Affiliates. Nothing in this _Section 6.06_ shall
be deemed to amend any Company Employee Plan, any Parent Benefit Plan or to
require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates to permit
any Person to participate in any particular benefit plan sponsored or
maintained by Parent or any of its Affiliates, or to continue or amend any
particular benefit plan, before or after the consummation of the Transactions,
and any such plan may be amended or terminated in accordance with its terms
and Applicable Law.

 



 

Section 6.07 _State Takeover Laws_. If any "control share acquisition,"
"business combination," "fair price," "moratorium" or other anti-takeover
Applicable Law may become or is deemed or purports to be applicable to any
Transaction, then each of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, and their
respective Boards of Directors shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to (i) take such actions as are necessary so that the Transactions may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and
(ii) otherwise act to render such anti-takeover Applicable Law (or, in the

Section 6.08 _Obligations of Parent_. Parent shall cause Merger Sub to perform
its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Offer and the
Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.09 _Director and Officer Liability_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
purchase a "tail" or "runoff" officers and directors liability insurance
policy in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time
covering each such person currently covered by the Companys officers and
directors liability insurance policy on terms with respect to coverage,
deductibles and amounts no less favorable than those of such policy in effect
on the date of this Agreement for the six (6) year period following the
Closing and at a price not to exceed 300% of the amount per annum the Company
paid in its last full fiscal year prior to the date of this Agreement (the "
_Current Premium_ "). If the Company or Parent obtains prepaid "tail" or
"runoff" policies prior to the Effective Time in accordance with this _Section
6.09(a)_, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, maintain such policies in full force and effect for
their full term, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder. If the
Company fails to purchase such "tail" or "runoff" policy prior to Closing,
then either (i) Parent may purchase such "tail" or "runoff" policy on behalf
of the Company or the Surviving Corporation or (ii) the Surviving Corporation
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain an
officers and directors liability insurance policy in respect of acts or
ommisions occuring prior to the Effective Time covering each such person
currently covered by the Companys officers and directors liability
insurance policy on terms with respect to coverage and amount no less
favorable than those of such policy in effect as of the date of this Agreement
for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time; _provided further_ ,
that in satisfying its obligation under this _Section 6.09(a)(ii)_, neither
Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to pay annual premiums
in excess of 300% of the Current Premium and if such premiums for such
insurance would at any time exceed 300% of the Current Premium, then Parent or
the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance
that, in Parent or the Surviving Corporations good faith judgment, provide
the maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to 300% of the
Current Premium.

 



 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries pursuant to (i) each indemnification
agreement in effect between the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries and
any individual who at the Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the
Effective Time was, a director or officer of the Company or of a Company
Subsidiary (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") Made Available to Parent; and
(ii) any indemnification provision and any exculpation provision set forth in
the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company as in effect on the
date of this Agreement. From the Effective Time through the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain, and
Parent shall cause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation to so contain, provisions no less favorable with respect
to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of each
Indemnified Party than are set forth in the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of the Company as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall
assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.09_.

 



 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.09_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her
heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such individual may have under the articles of organization or bylaws, by
Contract or otherwise.

 



 

Section 6.10 _Efforts_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company and
Parent shall each use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate

_Section 6.10_, each of Parent and the Company shall (i) prepare and file any
notification and report forms and related material required under the HSR Act
or other applicable Antitrust Laws with respect to the Transactions (if any),
and any additional filings or notifications and related material that are
necessary, proper or advisable to permit consummation of the Transactions, as

forms and related material required under the HSR Act except by mutual consent
confirmed in writing), (ii) provide or cause to be provided as promptly as

Governmental Authorities, including to cause to be lifted or vacated any
restraint, injunction or other legal impediment to any of the Transactions.

applicable Antitrust Laws (if any).

counsel shall (i) have the right to review in advance, and to the extent
practicable each shall consult the other on, any material filing made with, or
written materials to be submitted to, any Governmental Authority in connection
with the Transactions, (ii) promptly inform each other of any material
communication (or any other material correspondence or memoranda) received
from, or given to, the DOJ or the FTC and (iii) promptly furnish each other
with copies of all correspondence, filings and written communications between
them or their Subsidiaries or Affiliates, on the one hand, and any
Governmental Authority or its respective staff, on the other hand, with
respect to the Transactions. The Company and Parent shall (with respect to any
in-person discussion or meeting), and shall to the extent practicable (with
respect to any telephonic discussion or meeting), provide the other party and
its counsel with advance notice of and the opportunity to participate in any
material discussion or meeting with any Governmental Authority in respect of
any filing, investigation or other inquiry in connection with the
Transactions. Neither Parent nor the Company shall commit to or agree with any
Governmental Authority to stay, toll or extend any applicable waiting period
under the HSR Act without the prior written consent of the other. The Company
and Parent may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate
any competitively sensitive material provided to the other under this _Section
6.10_ as "Antitrust Counsel Only Material." Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Section 6.10_, materials provided to the other party or its
counsel may be redacted to remove references concerning the valuation of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries.

and subject to the terms of, the applicable provisions of the Company
Indenture, including the giving of any notices required by the Company
Indenture (including those notices that may be required pursuant to Section
11.02, Section 15.01(b), Section 15.02, Section 15.03, Section 15.06, 15.09

pursuant to the proviso in _Section 8.01(b)(i)_) and (i) at any time on or
after the date of this Agreement and prior to such termination a _bona fide_
Acquisition Proposal shall have been made to the Company Board or the Company
and publicly announced or publicly known (unless publicly withdrawn prior to
such termination), and (ii) within nine (9) months after the date of such
termination, (A) the Company enters into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement
or (B) any Acquisition Transaction is consummated, then the Company shall pay
Parent the Termination Fee prior to entry into an Alternative Acqusition
Agreement in respect of or consummation of an Acquisition Transaction;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, for purposes of this _Section 9.04(d)_, all
references to "20%" in the definition of "Acquisition Transaction" shall be
deemed to be references to "50%".

 



 

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, any payment made by the Company under this
_Section 9.04_ shall be payable only once with respect to this _Section
9.04_ and not in duplication even though such payment may be payable under one
or more provisions hereof.

 



 

(f) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section
9.04_ are an integral part of the Transactions and that without such
provisions Parent and Merger Sub would not have entered into this Agreement.

 



 

(g) If the Company fails to pay the Termination Fee or any portion thereof and
Parent or Merger Sub commences a suit which results in an Order against the
Company for the Termination Fee or any portion thereof, the Company shall pay
Parent and Merger Sub their costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees and disbursements) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on the Termination Fee (or any portion thereof that has not been paid
timely in accordance with this Agreement) and on the amount of such costs and
expenses, in each case from and including the date payment of such amount was
due to through the date of actual payment at the prime rate set forth in The
Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be
made. Parent shall promptly provide the Company upon request therefor the wire
transfer information required to make any payments pursuant to this _Section
9.04_.

 



 

(h) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, other than in the case of
a Willful and Intentional Breach by the Company, Parents right to receive
payment from the Company of the Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 9.04(b)
 (d)_ and any payments pursuant to _Section 9.04(g)_ shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of any of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates or representatives against the Company and any of its former,
current or future officers, directors, partners, stockholders, Company Stock
Option holders, Company Restricted Stock Unit holders, Company Performance
Stock Unit holders, managers, members or Affiliates (collectively, the "
_Company Related Parties_ ") for any loss suffered as a result of the failure
of the Transactions to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform
hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of the Termination Fee, none of the
Company Related

 



      
 

 



 

Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or the Transactions.

 



 

Section 9.05 _Assignment; Benefit_. This Agreement shall not be assigned by
any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without
the prior written consent of the other parties; _provided_ that Parent or
Merger Sub, upon prior written notice to the Company, may assign, in its sole
discretion ( _provided_ that such assignment shall not impede or delay the
consummation of the Offer or the Merger or otherwise impede the rights of
stockholders of the Company under this Agreement), any of or all its rights,
interests and obligations under this Agreement to Parent or to any direct or
indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent; _provided_ , _further_ , that no
such assignment shall relieve Parent or Merger Sub of any of its obligations
hereunder. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to
confer on any Person other than the parties hereto or their respective
successors, and permitted assigns any rights, remedies, obligations or
liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement, except (i) from and after
the acceptance of the Offer, the provisions of _Article 2_ relating to the
payment of the Per Share Amount, which shall be enforceable by the holders of
Shares immediately prior to the acceptance of the Offer who validly tendered
and did not withdraw Shares pursuant to the Offer, (ii) from and after the
Effective Time, (A) the provisions of _Article 2_ relating to the payment of
the Per Share Amount and the Option Consideration, which shall be enforceable
by the holders of Company Common Stock and Company Equity Awards, as
applicable, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the
provisions of _Section 6.10_ which shall be enforceable by the Persons or
entities benefiting therefrom and (iii) the provisions of _Section 9.04(h)_
which shall be enforceable by the Company Related Parties. In addition, the
Company shall have the right to pursue claims for damages suffered by holders
of Company Common Stock and Company Equity Awards (including the benefit of
the bargain lost by such holders, taking into account without limitation the
total amount payable to such holders under this Agreement, which shall be
deemed to be damages of the Company, but only to the extent such claims are
not pursued directly by such holders) and other relief, including equitable
relief, in connection with any Willful and Intentional Breach of this
Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub. For the avoidance of doubt, other than as
expressly set forth in this _Section 9.05_, no holder of Shares shall have
any third party beneficiary rights under this Agreement.

 



 

Section 9.06 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and any Proceedings arising out
of or related hereto or the Transactions or to the inducement of any party
thereto to enter into this Agreement, whether for breach of contract, tortious
conduct or otherwise and whether predicated on common law statute or
otherwise) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
the State of Delaware, without regard to the conflicts of law rules of such
state.

 



 

Section 9.07 _Jurisdiction_. The parties hereto agree that any Proceeding
seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or
in connection with, this Agreement or the Transactions shall be brought in the
Chancery Court of the State of Delaware and any state appellate court
therefrom, or, if no such state court has proper jurisdiction, the Federal
District Court for the District of Delaware located in Wilmington, Delaware,
and any appellate court therefrom. Each party hereby irrevocably submits to
the exclusive jurisdiction of such court in respect of any legal or equitable
Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions,
or relating to enforcement of any of the terms of this Agreement,

 



      
 

 



 

and hereby waives, and agrees not to assert, as a defense in any such
Proceeding, any claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of
such court, that the Proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the
venue of the Proceeding is improper or that this Agreement or the Transactions
may not be enforced in or by such courts. Each party agrees that notice or the
service of process in any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the Transactions shall be properly served or delivered if
delivered in the manner contemplated by _Section 9.01_ or in any other manner
permitted by law.

 



 

Section 9.08 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY.

 



 

Section 9.09 _Specific Performance; Remedies_. The parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur and that the parties would not have any
adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached, except as expressly provided in the following sentence. It
is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Chancery Court of the State
of Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom, or, if no such state
court has proper jurisdiction, the Federal District Court located in
Wilmington, Delaware, and any appellate court therefrom, and, in any action
for specific performance, each party waives the defense of adequacy of a
remedy at law and waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any
bond in connection with such remedy, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity (subject to the
limitations set forth in this Agreement).

 



 

Section 9.10 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the Offer, the
Merger and the other Transactions is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the parties agree to
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner, in order
that the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions be consummated as
originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 



 

Section 9.11 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, each Tender Agreement, the
Confidentiality Agreement, the exhibits to this Agreement, the Schedules, the
Company Disclosure Schedules and the Parent Disclosure Schedules and any

entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties with respect thereto.

 



 

Section 9.12 _Rules of Construction_. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges
that it has been represented by counsel of its choice throughout all
negotiations that have

 



      
 

 



 

preceded the execution of this Agreement, and that it has executed the same
with the advice of said independent counsel. Each party and its counsel
cooperated and participated in the drafting and preparation of this Agreement
and the documents referred to herein, and any and all drafts relating thereto
exchanged among the parties shall be deemed the work product of all of the
parties and may not be construed against any party by reason of its drafting
or preparation. Accordingly, any rule of law or any legal decision that would
require interpretation of any ambiguities in this Agreement against any party
that drafted or prepared it is of no application and is hereby expressly
waived by each of the parties hereto, and any controversy over interpretations
of this Agreement shall be decided without regards to events of drafting or
preparation. Any matter set forth on the Company Disclosure Schedules shall
not be deemed to constitute an admission by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, or to otherwise imply, that any such matter is material, is
required to be disclosed by the Company under this Agreement or falls within
relevant minimum thresholds or materiality standards set forth in this
Agreement, nor shall be construed as an admission or indication to any Third
Party that any breach or violation exists or has actually occurred.

 



 

Section 9.13 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be signed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have

being understood and agreed that all parties hereto need not sign the same
counterpart. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof
signed by each other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no

 **Exhibit A**

 



 

 **Conditions of the Offer**

 



 

The obligation of Merger Sub to accept for payment and pay for Shares validly
tendered (and not validly withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer is subject to the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in clauses "(a)" through "(h)" below.
Accordingly, notwithstanding any other term of the Offer, Merger Sub shall not
be required to accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and
regulations of the SEC, including Exchange Act Rule 14e-l(c) (relating to
Merger Subs obligation to pay for or return tendered Shares promptly after
the termination or withdrawal of the Offer), pay for, and may delay the
acceptance for payment of or, subject to such rules and regulations, the
payment for, any tendered Shares and, if permitted by the Merger Agreement,
may terminate the Offer: (i) upon termination of the Merger Agreement; and
(ii) at any scheduled Offer Expiration Time (subject to any requirements to
extend the Offer pursuant to _Section 2.01(c)_ of the Merger Agreement), if:
(A) the Minimum Tender Condition or the Termination Condition shall not be
satisfied by the Offer Expiration Time; or (B) any of the additional
conditions set forth below shall not be satisfied or (to the extent permitted
by Applicable Law) waived in writing by Parent:

 



 

(a) there shall have been validly tendered in the Offer and not withdrawn that
number of Shares that (together with any Shares owned by Parent and its
Affiliates and excluding any Shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery
procedures that have not yet been "received" (as such term is defined in
Section 251(h)(6)(f) of the DGCL)) represent at least a majority of the Shares
outstanding at the Offer Expiration Time (the " _Minimum Tender Condition_ ");

 



 

(b) any waiting period (or any extension thereof) under the HSR Act applicable
to the Offer and the Merger shall have expired or been terminated;

 



 

(c) no Order shall have been issued by a Governmental Authority and no
Applicable Law shall be in effect that would (A) make the Offer or the Merger
illegal or (B) otherwise prevent the consummation thereof; provided that
Parent and Merger Sub shall not be permitted to invoke this clause "(c)"
unless they shall have taken all actions required under this Agreement to lift
such Order;

 



 

(d) since the date of the Merger Agreement, there shall not have occurred a
Company Material Adverse Effect;

 



 

(e) (1) the representation and warranty of the Company set forth in _Section
4.11(b)_ shall be true and correct in all respects as of the date of the
Merger Agreement, (2) each of the representations and warranties of the
Company set forth in _Section 4.03_ of the Merger Agreement shall be true and
correct in all material respects as of the consummation of the Offer, as if
made at such time, except to the extent such representation or warranty
expressly relates to a specific date (in which case on and as of such specific
date), (3) the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
_Section 4.06(a)_ shall be true and correct except for _de minimis_
inaccuracies as of the consummation of the Offer, as if made at such time,
except to the extent any such representation or warranty expressly relates to
a specific date (in which case on

 



      
 

 



 

and as of such specific date), and (4) each of the other representations and
warranties of the Company set forth in the Merger Agreement shall be true and
correct as of the consummation of the Offer, as if made at such time, except
to the extent any such representation or warranty expressly relates to a
specific date (in which case on and as of such specific date), other than in
the case of clause (4) for such failures to be true and correct that have not
had a Company Material Adverse Effect (it being understood that for this
purpose all references to the term "Company Material Adverse Effect" and other
qualifications based on the word "material," set forth in any such
representations and warranties shall be disregarded);

 



 

(f) the Company shall have complied with or performed in all material respects
each of the covenants, obligations and agreements it is required to comply
with or perform at or prior to the Effective Time;

 



 

(g) Parent shall have received from the Company a certificate signed by the
Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer dated the date
on the which the Offer expires certifying that the conditions specified in
clauses (d), (e) and (f) have been satisfied; and

 



 

(h) the Merger Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with its
terms (the " _Termination Condition_ ").

 



 

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub
and, except for the Minimum Tender Condition and the Termination Condition
(which may only be waived with the prior written consent of the Company), may
be waived by Parent or Merger Sub in whole or in part at any time and from
time to time and in the sole discretion of Parent or Merger Sub, subject in
each case to the terms of the Merger Agreement and Applicable Law. Any
reference in this _Exhibit A_ or in the Merger Agreement to a condition or
requirement being satisfied shall be deemed met if such condition or
requirement is so waived. The foregoing conditions shall be in addition to,
and not a limitation of, the rights and obligations of Parent and Merger Sub
to extend, terminate and/or modify the Offer pursuant to the terms and
conditions of the Merger Agreement or Applicable Law. The failure by Parent,
Merger Sub or any other Affiliate of Parent at any time to exercise any of the
foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right, the waiver of
any such right with respect to particular facts and circumstances shall not be
deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and circumstances and each
such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time
and from time to time.

 



 

Capitalized terms used in this _Exhibit A_ but not defined herein shall have
the meanings set forth in the Agreement to which it is attached, except that
the term " _Merger Agreement_ " shall be deemed to refer to the Agreement to
which this _Exhibit A_ is attached.
