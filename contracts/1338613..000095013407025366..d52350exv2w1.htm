   ##### 

  

  

 1.3 _Headings_. The headings of the Articles and Sections of this Agreement and of the Schedules and Exhibits are included for convenience only and shall not be deemed to constitute part of this Agreement or to affect the construction or interpretation hereof or thereof. 

  

 1.4 _Other Terms_. Other terms may be defined elsewhere in the text of this Agreement and shall have the meaning indicated throughout this Agreement. 

  

ARTICLE 2 
 THE TRANSACTION  

  

 2.1 _The Transaction_. Subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing, each Seller shall sell or contribute, as the case may be, transfer, convey, assign and deliver to Buyer, and Buyer shall accept and acquire from each Seller, all of such Sellers Equity Interest in the Company, including all of such Sellers Interests, free and clear of all Liens. The Interests to be acquired by Buyer at Closing shall constitute all of the outstanding Equity Interests in the Company. At the Closing, each Seller shall deliver to Buyer assignments duly executed by such Seller transferring and assigning the Interests to Buyer in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 

  

 2.2 _Consideration_. 

  

 (a) At the Closing: 

   

 (i) the Buyer shall pay to EnergyOne, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated in writing by EnergyOne to Buyer at least two Business Days prior to Closing, an amount in Cash equal to the Cash Amount; 

  

 (ii) the Partnership shall issue to ASC the Transaction Units, free and clear of all Liens (except for such restrictions as may exist under the Partnership Agreement, the Lock-Up Agreement or applicable securities laws, and Liens created by ASC), on original issue and evidenced by a certificate or certificates duly executed and delivered by or on behalf of the Partnership; and 

  

 (iii) to the extent unpaid, the Buyer shall pay to the payees of any Expenses by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account(s) designated by such Persons in the applicable Payoff Letters, the amounts specified in the Payoff Letters less, to the extent applicable, any Medicaid, Social Security, income tax, unemployment tax and other amounts required to be withheld. 

  

 (b) Promptly after the Closing, Buyer shall pay to each holder of any Third-Party Debt, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account(s) designated by such Persons in the applicable Debt Payoff Letters, the amounts specified in the Debt Payoff Letters. 

   

 2.3 _Purchase Price Adjustments_. 

  

 (a) _Preparation of Estimated Closing Statement_. The Company shall prepare in good faith and deliver to Buyer, at least four Business Days prior to the Closing Date and at the sole expense of the Company, a statement as of the Closing Date (the " _Estimated Closing_  

    ##### 

  

    

 _Statement_ "), setting forth (i) a detailed determination of Estimated Net
Working Capital and Estimated Capital Expenditure Adjustment Amount and (ii)
based on such Estimated Net Working Capital and Estimated Capital Expenditure
Adjustment Amount, the Estimated Aggregate Consideration Adjustment Amount,
if any, and the number of Transaction Units. The Expenses and the Debt Payoff
Amount to be used in the calculation of Estimated Net Working Capital shall be
based on amounts set forth in the Payoff Letters, or, to the extent a Payoff
Letter has not been provided therefor, the Companys good faith estimate of
such amounts, and in each case, shall be subject to final determination in
the preparation of the Final Closing Statement. Each estimation shall be made
as of 11:59 p.m. on the Measurement Date. If Buyer has any questions or
disagreements regarding the Estimated Closing Statement, Buyer shall contact
the Sellers at least two Business Days prior to the Closing Date, and in such
case the Sellers and Buyer shall in good faith attempt to resolve any
disagreements. If Buyer and the Sellers agree on changes to the Companys
proposed Estimated Net Working Capital, the Companys proposed Estimated
Capital Expenditure Adjustment Amount, Estimated Aggregate Consideration
Adjustment Amount or the Companys calculation of the number of Transaction
Units based on such discussions, then the number of Transaction Units to
be issued at Closing shall be based on such changes. If Buyer and Sellers do
not agree on changes to such amounts, then such amounts shall be paid at the
Closing based on the amounts set forth in the Estimated Closing Statement. In
either such case, appropriate adjustments to the Purchase Price shall be made
after the Closing pursuant to _Sections 2.3(a)_, _2.3(b)_ , and  _2.3(c)_. 

   

 (b) _Preparation of Closing Statement_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date (and, in any event, within 90 days after the Closing Date), Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Sellers, at the sole expense of Buyer, a closing statement as of 11:59 p.m. on the Measurement Date (the " _Proposed Closing Statement_ "), setting forth the proposed final calculation of Net Working Capital, the Capital Expenditure Adjustment Amount and the Aggregate Consideration Adjustment Amount. Buyer shall provide Sellers access to the Records in accordance with _Section 6.4_ in order to confirm Buyers calculations. If Buyer fails to deliver to Sellers a Proposed Closing Statement within the allowed time periods, then the Estimated Closing Statement shall be deemed to be the Final Closing Statement for purposes of this Agreement. 

   

 (c) _Examination of Proposed Closing Statement_. Sellers shall review the Proposed Closing Statement to confirm the accuracy of the Proposed Closing Statement and Buyers calculations. If Sellers fail to give Buyer written notice of any disputed amounts within 30 days after Sellers receive the Proposed Closing Statement (the " _Review Period_ "), then the Proposed Closing Statement shall become the Final Closing Statement for purposes hereof. If Sellers give Buyer written notice of any disputed items within the Review Period, Buyer and Sellers shall attempt in good faith to agree on any adjustments that should be made to the Proposed Closing Statement. If Buyer and Sellers fail to resolve any disputed amounts within 60 days after Sellers receive the Proposed Closing Statement, Buyer and Sellers will engage the Audit Firm to resolve any such disputed matters in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and, in connection with such engagement Buyer, the Company and Sellers shall execute any engagement, indemnity and other agreements as the Audit Firm may require as a condition to such engagement. The Audit Firms engagement shall be limited to the resolution of disputed amounts set forth in the Proposed Closing Statement that have been identified by Sellers, and no other matter relating to the Final Closing Statement shall be subject to determination by the 

    ##### 

  

 

Audit Firm except to the extent affected by resolution of the disputed
amounts. The Parties shall cooperate diligently with any reasonable request
of the Audit Firm in an effort to resolve any disputed matter as soon as
reasonably possible after the Audit Firm is engaged. If possible, the
decision of the Audit Firm shall be made within 30 days after being engaged
and shall be final and binding on the Parties. The Proposed Closing Statement
shall be revised, if necessary, to reflect the final determination of Net
Working Capital (the final form of the Proposed Closing Statement, including
any revisions that are made thereto pursuant to this _Section 2.3(b)_, is
referred to herein as the " _Final Closing Statement_ "). 

   

 (d) _Adjustments_. 

   

 (i) If the Aggregate Consideration Adjustment Amount as reflected on the Final Closing Statement is less than the Estimated Aggregate Consideration Adjustment Amount (the amount of such shortfall, if any, being hereinafter referred to as the " _Aggregate Consideration Deficit_ "), each Seller shall transfer to the Partnership Cash (in the case of EnergyOne) or Transaction Units (in the case of ASC) with a value equal its Pro Rata Share of the Aggregate Consideration Deficit within five Business Days after the final determination of the Final Closing Statement. The number of Transaction Units to be transferred by ASC shall be (A) (i) ASCs Pro Rata Share of the Aggregate Consideration Deficit multiplied by 25% divided by (ii) $28.729, plus (B) (i) ASCs Pro Rata Share of the Aggregate Consideration Deficit multiplied by 75% divided by (ii) $26.952. 

  

 (ii) If the Aggregate Consideration Adjustment Amount as reflected on the Final Closing Statement is greater than the Estimated Aggregate Consideration Adjustment Amount (the amount of such excess being hereinafter referred to as the " _Aggregate Consideration Surplus_ "), Buyer shall pay each Seller an amount in Cash equal to its Pro Rata Share of the Aggregate Consideration Surplus within five Business Days after the final determination of the Final Closing Statement. 

  

 (e) _No Duplicative Effect_. The provisions of this _Section 2.3_ and of any other Transaction Document shall apply in such a manner so as not to give the components and calculations duplicative effect to any item of adjustment and, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or as described in the Sample Balance Sheet, the Parties covenant and agree that no amount shall be (or is intended to be) included, in whole or in part (either as an increase or reduction) more than once in the calculation of (including any component of) Net Working Capital, Capital Expenditure Adjustment Amount or the number of Transaction Units, or any other calculated amount pursuant to this Agreement if the effect of such additional inclusion (either as an increase or reduction) would be to cause such amount to be overstated or understated for purposes of such calculation. The Parties acknowledge and agree that, if there is a conflict between a determination, calculation or methodology set forth in the Sample Balance Sheet or the definitions contained in this Agreement, as applicable, on the one hand, and those provided by GAAP, on the other hand, (i) the determination, calculation or methodology set forth in the Sample Balance Sheet or the definitions contained in this Agreement, as applicable, shall control to the extent that the matter is included in the Sample Balance Sheet or the definitions contained in this Agreement, as applicable, as a line item or specific adjustment and (ii) the determination, calculation or methodology prescribed by GAAP shall control to the extent the matter is not so addressed in the Sample Balance Sheet or the definitions contained in 

    ##### 

  

 

this Agreement, as applicable, or requires reclassification as an asset or
liability to be included in a line item or specific adjustment. 

   

 (f) _Fees and Expenses of the Audit Firm_. If the Parties submit any disputed amounts to the Audit Firm for resolution as provided in _Section 2.3(c)_ above, the fees and expenses of the Audit Firm (the " _Audit Fees_ ") will be paid by and apportioned between Buyer and Sellers based on the aggregate dollar amount of the amount in dispute and inversely related to the relative recovery as determined by the Audit Firm of Sellers and Buyer, respectively. For example, if the aggregate dollar amount of the amount in dispute is $1,000,000 and the relative recovery of Sellers and Buyer as determined by the Audit Firm is $900,000 and $100,000, respectively, then Buyer will be apportioned 90% of the Audit Fees and Sellers will be apportioned 10% of the Audit Fees. Sellers and Buyer shall promptly, and in any event within five Business Days after the final determination of the Final Closing Statement, pay to the Audit Firm the amount of Audit Fees payable by Sellers and Buyer pursuant to this Section (with each Seller paying its Pro Rata Share of any such Audit Fees payable by the Sellers). 

   

 (g) _Performance_. To provide assurance to the Partnership and Buyer of the performance of ASCs obligations under _Section 2.3(c)_, _Section 2.3(e)_ and _Article 10_, until the first anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Indemnification Period_ "), Parent agrees to cause ASC to perform its obligations under _Section 2.3(c)_, _Section 2.3(e)_ and _Article 10_ hereof; provided, that Parents liability under this Section 2.3(g) shall not exceed the aggregate amount of $14,250,000. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Claim Notice is provided in accordance with _Article 10_ prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date and shall not have been finally resolved as of the end of the Indemnification Period (by final, nonappealable judgment or settlement), then Parent shall continue to cause ASC to perform its obligations with respect to such Claim Notice until the resolution of such claim by final, nonappealable judgment or settlement. 

   

 2.4 _Anti-Dilution Adjustments_. If the Partnership changes (or the Partnership sets a related record date that will occur before the Closing Date for a change in) the number or kind of Common Units outstanding by way of a unit split, reverse unit split, unit dividend, recapitalization, reclassification, reorganization, consolidation, extraordinary or special dividend or distribution with respect to Common Units (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include regular, quarterly cash distributions by the Partnership), or similar transaction, then the number of Transaction Units will be adjusted appropriately to account for such change.

ASC is not a party to or bound by, and does not intend or have any plans to enter into, any Contract with any Person to sell, transfer or pledge any part of the Transaction Units, except for bona fide pledges or sales or transfers made in compliance with all applicable securities laws. 

   

 (b) In connection with the acquisition of the Transaction Units hereunder, ASC has had the opportunity to examine all aspects of the Partnership, its operations, and its financial condition that ASC has deemed relevant, and has had access to all information with respect to the Partnership and its business in order to make an evaluation thereof. In connection with the acquisition of the Transaction Units hereunder, ASC has had the opportunity to ask such questions of and receive answers from directors, officers, employees and representatives of the Managing General Partner concerning the Partnership and to obtain such additional information about the Partnership as ASC deems necessary for an evaluation thereof. The investment decision of ASC to acquire the Transaction Units has been based solely upon the evaluation made by ASC of the Partnership.

 (b) Neither ASC nor anyone acting on ASCs behalf has offered or sold or will offer or sell any of the Transaction Units by means that would render the disposition of the Transaction Units a violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act or any state or other applicable securities law.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Claim Notice is provided in accordance with _Article 10_ before the termination of the applicable representation, warranty, covenant or agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1(a)_ or _Section 10.1(b)_, then (notwithstanding such termination) the representation, warranty, covenant or agreement giving rise to such claim will survive until, but only for the purpose of, the resolution of such claim by final, nonappealable judgment or settlement.

 (i) any Aggregate Consideration Deficit; 

  

 (ii) any Third-Party Debt (other than Third-Party Debt incurred to fund Required Capital Expenditures), Expenses, Change of Control Amounts and Severance Adjustment Amounts that do not result in a reduction in the Aggregate Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.3_; and

to which the Claim relates.

 (i) the Buyer Indemnitees, collectively, or the Seller Indemnitees, collectively, shall have suffered or incurred aggregate Losses otherwise recoverable under this _Article 10_ in an amount in excess of the Deductible, and then recovery shall be permitted only to the extent such Losses exceed $500,000 (i.e., $500,000 of the Deductible shall be recoverable); and 

  

 (ii) after the Deductible has been met, the Buyer Indemnitees, collectively, or the Seller Indemnitees, collectively, shall have suffered or incurred Losses with respect to the individual Claim or series of related Claims that arise out of substantially the same facts and circumstances for which recovery is sought in excess of $50,000, in which case the full amount of such Losses shall be recoverable, subject to the limitations imposed by the other provisions of this  _Section 10.4_. 

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any claim for indemnification (and the Losses
recoverable therefrom) that may be brought under both (A) _Section
10.3(b)(i)_ and/or _Section 10.3(b)(iii)_, on the one hand, and (B) any
other subsection of _Section 10.3_, on the other hand, shall not be subject
to any limitation specified in this _Section 10.4(e)_. 

   

 (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement: 

   

 (i) For purposes of determining whether a representation or warranty contained herein, other than those set forth in _Sections 4.12_, _4.16_ , _5.3_ and _5.4_ , has been breached for purposes of this _Article 10_ and determining the amount of Losses suffered thereby by any Buyer Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee, as the case may be, each representation and warranty set forth in this Agreement (other than as aforesaid), and any qualification with respect to any such representation or warranty set forth in the Disclosure Schedule in the case of representations or 

   ##### 

  

 

warranties by Sellers, shall be read without regard or giving effect to
any "material," "materiality," "Material Adverse Effect," and "substantial"
qualifications that may be contained in any such representation or warranty;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the defined term "Material Contract" and all
"material," "materiality," "Material Adverse Effect," and "substantial"
qualifications that are contained in any defined term shall be given effect; 

   

 (ii) No investigation or knowledge of any Party, whenever undertaken or however obtained, shall limit such Partys right to indemnification hereunder in any manner; and 

  

 (iii) The provisions of this _Article 10_ shall apply in such a manner as not to give duplicative effect to any item of adjustment and if there has been an adjustment to the Aggregate Consideration for any Loss, there shall not be any charge against the Deductible and no Indemnitee may claim a breach of any representation or warranty with respect to any Loss that gave rise to such adjustment in the Aggregate Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.3_ to the extent of the amount of such Loss given effect in such adjustment to the Aggregate Consideration. 

  

 (g) The amount of Losses required to be paid pursuant to this _Article 10_ shall be reduced to the extent of any tax benefits actually realized, or insurance proceeds directly or indirectly received by the Indemnified Party. 

   

 (h) Any Losses required to be paid by ACS hereunder may be paid in cash or in Transaction Units (valued at the Trailing Average Price as determined as of the date of payment of such Losses). 

   

 10.5 _Notice of Asserted Liability; Opportunity to Defend; Third Person Covered Claims_. 

  

 (a) All claims for indemnification hereunder shall be asserted and handled pursuant to this  _Section 10.5_. Any Person claiming indemnification hereunder is referred to herein as the " _Indemnified Party_ " or " _Indemnitee_ " and any Person against whom such claims are asserted hereunder is referred to herein as the " _Indemnifying Party_ " or " _Indemnitor_." 

   

 (b) If any Claim is asserted against or any Loss is sought to be collected from an Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall with reasonable promptness (and in any event prior to the expiration of the relevant survival period set forth in _Section 10.1(a)_) provide to the Indemnifying Party a Claim Notice. The failure to notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve it of any liability that it may have to any Indemnified Party with respect to such Claim or Loss except to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have been prejudiced by such failure or to the extent the Claim Notice was provided after the expiration of the relevant survival period set forth in _Section 10.1_. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if any Buyer Indemnitee asserts a Claim against or seeks to collect any Loss from an Indemnifying Party in respect of a Claim or Loss arising out of any breach of a representation or warranty for which WGP-KHC has a right to indemnification or reimbursement from any Third Person under any one or more of the Amoco Agreements (a " _Covered Third Person Claim_ "), then, the Buyer 

    ##### 

  

    

Indemnitee shall, promptly following the time at which it submits a Claim
Notice to the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this  _Section 10.5_, cause
WGP-KHC to assert a Claim for indemnification or reimbursement against such
Third Person pursuant to and in accordance with the applicable Contract(s)
under which such right(s) arise(s); _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure
to initiate such Claim promptly shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of
any liability that it may have to any Indemnified Party with respect to such
Claim or Loss except to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have been
prejudiced by such failure. If the Third Person rejects or denies liability
for a Covered Third Person Claim, or otherwise fails to satisfy in full the
Covered Third Person Claim on or before the date that is 60 days after the
initial Claim Notice is delivered to Sellers (the " _Applicable Time Period_
"), then the Buyer Indemnitee may thereafter pursue the Claim against the
Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Article 10_ by submitting a second
Claim Notice to the Indemnifying Party within 60 days after any such
rejection, denial or failure, notifying the Indemnifying Party thereof, in
which case time periods specified in this _Section 10.5_ in connection
therewith shall be deemed to have been tolled during the Applicable
Time Period and through the delivery of the second Claim Notice. 

   

 (d) The Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days from receipt of the initial Claim Notice (the " _Notice Period_ ") to notify the Indemnified Party in writing (i) whether or not the Indemnifying Party disputes the liability to the Indemnified Party hereunder with respect to the Claim or Loss, (ii) in any case in which Losses are asserted against or sought to be collected from an Indemnifying Party by an Indemnified Party, whether or not the Indemnifying Party desires at its own sole cost and expense to attempt to remedy such Losses or (iii) in any case in which Claims are asserted against or sought to be collected from an Indemnified Party by a Third Person (" _Third Person Claim_ "), whether or not the Indemnifying Party desires at its own sole cost and expense to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third Person Claim. 

   

 (e) If the Indemnifying Party satisfies in full any Covered Third Person Claim, then (1) from and after the date thereof, the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to WGP-KHCs rights to indemnification or reimbursement under the applicable Amoco Agreement with respect to such Covered Third Person Claim, (2) Buyer shall cause WGP-KHC to assign its rights to indemnification or reimbursement, as the case may be, under the applicable Amoco Agreement to the Indemnifying Party, and (3) Buyer shall cause WGP-KHC to cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in seeking to enforce any such rights and to collect any Losses relating to the Covered Third Person Claim,  _provided_ that the Indemnifying Party reimburses WGP-KHC for all costs and expenses incurred in connection therewith promptly following the receipt of a request for reimbursement therefor. 

   

 (f) Except as otherwise provided in _Section 6.8(a)_, if the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party within the Notice Period that it desires to defend the Indemnified Party against a Third Person Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend all appropriate Proceedings with counsel of its own choosing (but reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party) and such Proceedings shall be diligently prosecuted by it to settlement or a final conclusion. If the Indemnified Party desires to participate in any such defense or settlement, other than at the request of the Indemnifying Party, it may do so at its sole cost and expense. If the Indemnified Party joins in defending in any such Third Person Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have full authority to determine all action to be taken with respect thereto. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to defend the Indemnified Party against a Third 

    ##### 

  

    

Person Claim or does not provide an answer within the Notice Period, the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to assume the defense of all appropriate
Proceedings related thereto with counsel of its choosing and the Indemnifying
Party shall be responsible for paying for counsel for the Indemnified Party
if they are otherwise entitled to indemnification with respect to such
matter. If a Proceeding is asserted against both the Indemnifying Party and
the Indemnified Party and there are one or more defenses available to the
Indemnified Party that are not available to the Indemnifying Party or there is
a conflict of interest that renders it inappropriate for the same counsel to
represent both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall be responsible for paying for separate counsel for
the Indemnified Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that, if there is more than
one Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall not be responsible for
paying for more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to local
counsel) to represent the Indemnified Parties, regardless of the number of
Indemnified Parties. No compromise or settlement of any Proceeding may be
effected by the Indemnifying Party without the Indemnified Partys
written consent unless the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are
paid in full by the Indemnifying Party and such settlement includes the
granting by each claimant or plaintiff to each Indemnified Party of an
unconditional release from all liability in respect of such Third
Person Claim and the related Proceeding. 

   

 (g) If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party agrees to cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel, at the cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, in contesting any Third Person Claim, in making any counterclaim against the Third Person asserting the Third Person Claim or in making any cross-complaint against any Person. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no Third Person Claim may be settled or otherwise compromised without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party. 

   

 (h) The costs and expenses of a Buyer Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee, including the fees, costs and expenses of its separate counsel, experts (including expert witnesses), consultants and any other representatives engaged by it, incurred in connection with the defense and settlement or final resolution of any Third Person Claim as to which such Buyer Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee, as the case may be, has the right to control shall be treated as "Losses" for all purposes hereunder. 

   

 10.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. AS BETWEEN THE BUYER INDEMNITEES AND SELLERS, ON ONE HAND, AND THE SELLER INDEMNITEES AND THE PARTNERSHIP OR BUYER, ON THE OTHER, AFTER CLOSING, OTHER THAN WITH RESPECT TO CLAIMS FOR FRAUD, (A) THE PROVISIONS SET FORTH IN THIS _ARTICLE 10_ SHALL BE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS, OBLIGATIONS AND REMEDIES OF THE PARTIES WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE EVENTS GIVING RISE THERETO, AND THE TRANSACTIONS PROVIDED FOR HEREIN OR CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN THIS _ARTICLE 10_ THE BUYER INDEMNITEES RELEASE THE SELLER INDEMNITEES FROM ANY LIABILITIES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER ARISING AT ANY TIME IN CONNECTION IN ANY WAY WHATSOEVER WITH THE FRONTSTREET COMPANIES AND ARISING UNDER ANY ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS OR WITH REGARD TO ANY HAZARDOUS MATERIALS OR ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS AND (B) NO PARTY OR ANY OF ITS SUCCESSORS 

   ##### 

  

 

OR ASSIGNS SHALL HAVE ANY RIGHTS AGAINST ANY OTHER PARTY OR ITS AFFILIATES
OTHER THAN AS IS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS _ARTICLE 10_. 

   

 10.7 _Limitation on Damages_. SUBJECT TO _SECTION 10.6_ NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS AGREEMENT, IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY PARTY BE LIABLE AFTER THE CLOSING TO ANY OTHER PARTY, OR TO ANY INDEMNITEE, UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FOR ANY EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, REMOTE, SPECULATIVE, OR SPECIAL DAMAGES, AND NO CLAIM SHALL BE MADE OR AWARDED AGAINST ANY PARTY, FOR ANY SUCH DAMAGES; _PROVIDED_ , _HOWEVER_ , SUBJECT TO THE LIMITATIONS IN _SECTION 10.4_ , THIS _SECTION 10.7_ SHALL NOT LIMIT THE RIGHT OF THE BUYER TO RECOVER ANY LOSS TO THE EXTENT (a) ACTUALLY SUFFERED, INCURRED OR PAID BY THE BUYERS TO ANY THIRD PARTY OR WITH RESPECT TO ANY THIRD PARTY OBLIGATION OR (b) ARISING OR RESULTING FROM A BREACH OF _SECTION 4.12_ OR  _SECTION 4.16_. 

  

 10.8 _Bold and/or Capitalized Letters_. THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE BOLD AND CAPITALIZED LETTERS IN THIS AGREEMENT CONSTITUTE CONSPICUOUS LEGENDS. 

  

ARTICLE 11 
 MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS 

   

 11.1 _Expenses_. Each Party will bear its own respective costs and expenses (including legal fees and expenses) incurred in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 11.2 _Assignment_.

 11.16 _No Waiver of Claims for Fraud_. The liability of any Party under _Article 10_ shall be in addition to, and not exclusive of, any other liability that such Party may have at law or equity based on such Partys fraudulent acts or omissions. None of the provisions set forth in this Agreement shall be deemed a waiver by any Party of any right or remedy that such Party may have at law or equity based on any other Partys fraudulent acts or omissions, nor shall any such provisions limit, or be deemed to limit, (a) the amounts of recovery sought or awarded in any such claim for fraud, (b) the time period during which a claim for fraud may be brought, or (c) the recourse which any such Party may seek against another Party with respect to a claim for

that may be available in respect of actions or claims for fraud, including
defenses of statutes of limitations or limitations of damages. 

   

 11.17 _No Recovery_. Sellers shall not be entitled to, and effective as of the Closing do hereby waive any rights to, indemnification or contribution from each FrontStreet Company for any Losses that it is obligated to pay pursuant to any Claim brought by a Buyer Indemnitee. If any right of indemnification or contribution from either FrontStreet Company under the Organizational Documents of such FrontStreet Company relating to a Claim is ultimately determined to be unwaivable, Sellers shall indemnify the Buyer or the applicable FrontStreet Company to the full extent of such recovery. Sellers hereby waive and release any and all rights that it may have to assert claims of indemnification or contribution against either FrontStreet Company under this Agreement, any other Transaction Document, any other Contract or any provision of its Organizational Documents for any Losses that Sellers are obligated to pay pursuant to any Claim brought by a Buyer Indemnitee.

 WHEREAS, Section 13.1 of the Partnership Agreement provides that the General Partner, without the approval of any other Partner, may amend any provision of the Partnership Agreement necessary or advisable in connection with the authorization of issuance of any class or series of Partnership Securities pursuant to Section 5.6 of the Partnership Agreement; and

 (iii) " _Partnership Security_ " means any class or series of equity interest in the Partnership (but excluding any options, rights, warrants and appreciation rights relating to an equity interest in the Partnership), including without limitation Common Units, Class B Common Units, Class C Common Units, Class E Common Units, Subordinated Units and Incentive Distribution Rights. 

   

 (iv) " _Unit_ " means a Partnership Security that is designated as a " _Unit_ " and shall include Common Units, Class B Common Units, Class C Common Units, Class E Common Units and Subordinated Units but shall not include (i) General Partner Units (or the General Partner Interest represented thereby) or (ii) Incentive Distribution Rights. 

   

 (v) " _Unit Majority_ " means, during the Subordination Period, at least a majority of the Outstanding Common Units, Class B Common Units, Class C Common Units and Class E Common Units (excluding Common Units, Class B Common Units, Class C Common Units and Class E Common Units owned by the General Partner and its Affiliates) voting as a class and at least a majority of the Outstanding Subordinated Units voting as a single class and, after the end of the Subordination Period, at least a majority of the Outstanding Units. 

   

 (b) Section 4.8(c) is hereby amended to add the following sentence at the end of such section: 

   

 (i) The transfer of a Common Unit issued upon conversion of a Class E Common Unit shall be subject to restrictions imposed by _Section 6.7(e)_. 

   

 (c) Article V is hereby amended (1) add amend and restate the last sentence of Section 5.12(b)(v) to read in its entirety as follows: "Each reference in the Partnership Agreement to a vote of the holders of Common Units shall be deemed to be a reference to the holders of the Common Units, Class B Common Units, Class C Common Units, and Class E Common Units and (2) to add new Section 5.13 creating a new series of Units to read in its entirety: 

  

 Section 5.13 _Establishment of Class E Common Units_. 

   

 (a) _General_. The General Partner hereby designates and creates a series of the class of Common Units to be designated as "Class E Common Units" and consisting of a total of [ _ _] Class E Common Units, having the same terms and provisions as the Common Units, except as set forth in this Section 5.13: 

  

Exhibit C-3  ##### 

  

   

 (i) _Distributions_. The Class E Common Units shall not have the right to share in quarterly Partnership distributions from Operating Surplus. In no event shall this be construed as a limitation on distributions from Capital Surplus. 

   

 (ii) _Conversion_. The Class E Common Units shall be convertible into Common Units as provided in this Section 5.13; 

   

 (iii) _Voting Rights_. The Class E Common Units shall have voting rights that are identical to the voting rights of the Common Units and shall vote with the Common Units as a single class, so that each Class E Common Unit will be entitled to one vote on each matter with respect to which each Common Unit is entitled to vote. Each reference in this Agreement to a vote of holders of Common Units shall be deemed to be a reference to the holders of Common Units, Class B Common Units, Class C Common Units and Class E Common Units. 

   

 (iv) _Certificates; Registrar and Transfer Agent_. The Class E Common Units shall be evidenced by certificates in such form as the General Partner may approve and, subject to the satisfaction of any applicable legal and regulatory requirements, may be assigned or transferred in a manner identical to the assignment and transfer of other Units.

The certificates evidencing Class E Common Units shall be separately identified and shall not bear the same CUSIP number as the certificates evidencing Common Units. 

   

 (b) _Conversion of Class E Common Units_. Each Class E Common Unit shall be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, into Common Units on a one-for-one basis anytime from and after February 15, 2008. 

   

 (c) _Conversion Procedure_. Subject to Section 6.7(e), at any time and from time to time after the Class E Conversion Date, a holder of Class E Common Units may convert all or any part of such Class E Common Units into Common Units by surrendering the certificates evidencing such Class E Common Units for conversion at the office of the Partnership or of any transfer agent for the Class E Common Units. In such case, the Partnership shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to the Person in whose name the surrendered Class E Common Units were registered one or more certificates evidencing Common Units, registered in the name of such Person, for the number of Common Units to which such Person shall be entitled as provided above. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made as of the date of surrender of the Class E Common Unit certificates pursuant to this Section 5.13(c), and the Person entitled to receive the Common Units issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder of such Common Units on said date. 

   

 (d) Section 6.1(d)(iii) is hereby amended to add a new subsection 6.1(d)(iii)(C), which subsection shall read in its entirety: 

  

Exhibit C-4  ##### 

  

   

 (C) With respect to any taxable period ending upon, or after, the Class E Conversion Date, and after the application of Section 6.1(d)(iii)(A) and (B), all or a portion of the remaining items of Partnership income, gain, loss or deduction for such taxable period shall be allocated 100% to each Partner holding converted Class E Common Units that are Outstanding as of the Class E Conversion Date in the proportion to the number of converted Class E Common Units held by such Partner to the total number of converted Class E Common Units then Outstanding, until each such Partner has been allocated an amount of income, gain, loss or deduction that increases or decreases, as the case may be, the Capital Account maintained with respect to such converted Class E Common Unit to an amount equal to the product of (1) the number of converted Class E Common Units held by such Partner and (2) the Per Unit Capital Amount for a Common Unit. 

   

 (e) Section 6.7 is hereby amended to add a new subsection 6.7(e), which subsection shall read in its entirety: 

   

 (e) The Unitholder holding a Common Unit into which a Class E Common Unit has been converted pursuant to Section 5.13 shall not be issued a Common Unit certificate until such time as the General Partner determines, based on advice of counsel, that such Common Unit should have, as a substantive matter, the same intrinsic economic and federal income tax characteristics, in all material respects, to the intrinsic economic and federal income tax characteristics of an Initial Common Unit. In connection with the condition imposed by this Section 6.7(e), the General Partner may take whatever steps are required to provide economic uniformity to the converted Class E Common Units in preparation for a conversion of such Class E Common Units, including the application of Section 6.1(d)(iii)(C); _provided, however_ , that no such steps may be taken that would have a material adverse effect on the Unitholders holding Common Units represented by Common Unit Certificates. 

  

 Section 2\. _Ratification of Partnership Agreement_. Except as expressly modified and amended herein, all of the terms and conditions of the Partnership Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. 

  

 Section 3\. _General Authority_. The appropriate officers of the General Partner are hereby authorized to make such clarifying and conforming changes as they deem necessary or appropriate, and to interpret the Partnership Agreement, to give effect to the intent and purpose of this Amendment. 

  

 Section 4\. _Governing Law_. This Amendment shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to principles of conflicts of laws. 

  

Exhibit C-5  ##### 

  

 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the General Partner has executed this Amendment as of the
date first set forth above.

FORM OF LOCK-UP AGREEMENT 

   

 This Lock-Up Agreement (this "Lock-Up Agreement") is being delivered by ASC Hugoton LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("ASC"), to Regency Energy Partners LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the "Partnership"), this 10th day of December, 2007 (the "Effective Date") to be effective on the Closing Date as of the Closing (each as hereinafter defined). 

  

RECITALS 

   

 WHEREAS, the Partnership, Regency Gas Services LP, a Delaware limited partnership and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Partnership ("Gas Services"), ASC, FrontStreet EnergyOne LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("EnergyOne") and, solely for purposes of Section 2.3(g) thereof, Aircraft Services Corporation, entered into a Contribution Agreement, dated December 10, 2007 (the "Contribution Agreement"), pursuant to which Gas Services has agreed to acquire all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of FrontStreet Hugoton, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the "Company"), from ASC and EnergyOne subject to the terms and conditions therein (the "FrontStreet Acquisition"); and 

  

 WHEREAS, to induce the Partnership and Gas Services to enter into and perform their respective obligations under the Contribution Agreement, ASC has agreed to execute and deliver this Lock-Up Agreement, and it is a condition to the execution of the Contribution Agreement by the Partnership and Gas Services and the performance by the Partnership and Gas Services of their respective obligations under the Contribution Agreement that ASC execute and deliver this Lock-Up Agreement at or prior to the execution of the Contribution Agreement. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the reliance placed by the Partnership on the undertakings by ASC and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, ASC hereby agrees as follows: 

  

 1. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein and defined in the Contribution Agreement shall have the respective meanings ascribed thereto in the Contribution Agreement. 

  

 2. For a period beginning on the Closing Date and, with respect to 1,107,940 of the Transaction Units (the "90-day Units"), ending on the date that is 90 days following the Closing Date and, with respect to the remaining 3,542,965 Transaction Units (the "270-day Units"), ending on the date that is 270 days following the Closing Date, ASC shall not, directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of the Partnership, (i) sell, offer to sell, contract to sell, hypothecate, pledge, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase or otherwise dispose of, contract to dispose of, or enter into any transaction or device that is designed to, or could be expected to, result in the disposition by any person at any time in the future with respect to, any Transaction Units (or any securities into which the Transaction Units may be converted) (collectively the "Restricted Units") or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for Restricted Units, or (ii) enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, any of the economic consequences of ownership of such Restricted Units or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for Restricted Units, whether any such transaction is to be settled by delivery of 

  

Exhibit E-2 

    ##### 

  

 

Restricted Units or other securities, in cash or otherwise. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the event the number of Transaction Units is adjusted
following the Effective Date pursuant to the terms of the Contribution
Agreement, the number of 90-day Units and 270-day Units shall
be appropriately increased or decreased to reflect such adjustment. 

   

 3. Notwithstanding the foregoing, ASC may receive Common Units into which the Transaction Units are convertible upon the conversion of the Transaction Units in accordance with terms of the Partnership Agreement Amendment, provided that such Common Units shall remain Restricted Units for purposes of this Lock-Up Agreement. 

  

 4. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Partnership and its transfer agent are hereby authorized to decline to make any transfer of securities if such transfer would constitute a violation or breach of this Lock-Up Agreement. 

  

 5. ASC hereby represents and warrants that it has full limited liability company power and authority to enter into this Lock-Up Agreement and that, upon request, it will execute any additional documents reasonably necessary in connection with the enforcement hereof. Any obligations of ASC shall be binding upon its successors and assigns. 

  

 Intending to be legally bound hereby, the undersigned has executed this Lock-Up Agreement on and as of the date set forth above to be effective on the Closing Date as of the Closing.
