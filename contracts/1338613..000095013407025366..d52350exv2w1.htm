therefor, the Company&#146;s good faith estimate of such amounts, and in each case, shall be subject to
final determination in the preparation of the Final Closing Statement. Each estimation shall be
made as of 11:59&nbsp;p.m. on the Measurement Date. If Buyer has any questions or disagreements
regarding the Estimated Closing Statement, Buyer shall contact the Sellers at least two Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, and in such case the Sellers and Buyer shall in good faith attempt
to resolve any disagreements. If Buyer and the Sellers agree on changes to the Company&#146;s proposed
Estimated Net Working Capital, the Company&#146;s proposed Estimated Capital Expenditure Adjustment
Amount, Estimated Aggregate Consideration Adjustment Amount or the Company&#146;s calculation of the
number of Transaction Units based on such discussions, then the number of Transaction Units to be
issued at Closing shall be based on such changes. If Buyer and Sellers do not agree on changes to
such amounts, then such amounts shall be paid at the Closing based on the amounts set forth in the
Estimated Closing Statement. In either such case, appropriate adjustments to the Purchase Price
shall be made after the Closing pursuant to <U>Sections&nbsp;2.3(a)</U>, <U>2.3(b)</U>, and
<U>2.3(c)</U>.

deliver to Sellers, at the sole expense of Buyer, a closing statement as of 11:59&nbsp;p.m. on the
Measurement Date (the &#147;<U>Proposed Closing Statement</U>&#148;), setting forth the proposed final
calculation of Net Working Capital, the Capital Expenditure Adjustment Amount and the Aggregate
Consideration Adjustment Amount. Buyer shall provide Sellers access to the Records in accordance
with <U>Section&nbsp;6.4</U> in order to confirm Buyer&#146;s calculations. If Buyer fails to deliver to
Sellers a Proposed Closing Statement within the allowed time periods, then the Estimated Closing
Statement shall be deemed to be the Final Closing Statement for purposes of this Agreement.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) <U>Examination of Proposed Closing Statement</U>. Sellers shall review the Proposed
Closing Statement to confirm the accuracy of the Proposed Closing Statement and Buyer&#146;s
calculations. If Sellers fail to give Buyer written notice of any disputed amounts within 30&nbsp;days
after Sellers receive the Proposed Closing Statement (the &#147;<U>Review Period</U>&#148;), then the
Proposed Closing Statement shall become the Final Closing Statement for purposes hereof. If
Sellers give Buyer written notice of any disputed items within the Review Period, Buyer and Sellers
shall attempt in good faith to agree on any adjustments that should be made to the Proposed Closing
Statement. If Buyer and Sellers fail to resolve any disputed amounts within 60&nbsp;days after Sellers
receive the Proposed Closing Statement, Buyer and Sellers will engage the Audit Firm to resolve any
such disputed matters in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and, in connection with such
engagement Buyer, the Company and Sellers shall execute any engagement, indemnity and other
agreements as the Audit Firm may require as a condition to such engagement. The Audit Firm&#146;s
engagement shall be limited to the resolution of disputed amounts set forth in the Proposed Closing
Statement that have been identified by Sellers, and no other matter relating to the Final Closing
Statement shall be subject to determination by the

Closing the Interests owned by it. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and

authorized by all requisite limited liability company action on the part of such Seller. This
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which such Seller is or shall be a party have been
or will be duly executed and delivered by such Seller, and (assuming due authorization, execution
and delivery hereof and thereof by the other parties hereto and thereto) such Transaction Documents
constitute or, if not yet executed, will at Closing constitute, legal, valid and binding

and beneficial title to Interests as set forth on <U>Exhibit&nbsp;D</U>, free and clear of any and all
Liens, and such Interests constitute all of the Equity Interests of the Company held of record or
beneficially by such Seller. Immediately prior to the Closing, such Seller shall have good and
valid record and beneficial title to such Interests, free and clear of any Liens, and such
Interests shall constitute all of the Equity Interests of the Company held of record or
beneficially by such Seller. Upon the Closing, Buyer will acquire good title to all of the Equity
Interests of the Company, free and clear of any Liens, other than any Liens created by Buyer.
Neither such Seller nor the Company is a party to (a)&nbsp;any option, warrant, purchase right or other
Contract (other than this Agreement) that could require such Seller or, after the Closing, Buyer,

Transaction Units hereunder, ASC has had the opportunity to ask such questions of and receive
answers from directors, officers, employees and representatives of the Managing General Partner
concerning the Partnership and to obtain such additional information about the Partnership as ASC
deems necessary for an evaluation thereof. The investment decision of ASC to acquire the
Transaction Units has been based solely upon the evaluation made by ASC of the Partnership. In
evaluating the suitability of an investment in the Partnership, ASC has not been furnished and has
not relied upon any representations or other information (whether oral or written) other than as
contained in the representations and warranties of the Partnership and the Buyer in this Agreement.

intrinsic economic and federal income tax characteristics, in all material respects,
to the intrinsic economic and federal income tax characteristics of an Initial
Common Unit. In connection with the condition imposed by this Section&nbsp;6.7(e), the
General Partner may take whatever steps are required to provide economic uniformity
