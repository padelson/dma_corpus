Section 2.01 _Sale and Purchase_. Contemporaneously with the consummation of
the Acquisition and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at
the Closing, Atlas Pipeline Partners hereby agrees to issue and sell to each
Purchaser, and each Purchaser hereby agrees, severally and not jointly, to

Purchased Unit as set forth opposite its name on Schedule 2.01.

Section 2.02 _Independent Nature of Purchasers  Obligations_. The respective
obligations of each Purchaser under this Agreement and the Registration
Rights Agreement are several and not joint with the obligations of any other
Purchaser, and no Purchaser shall be responsible in any way for the
performance of the obligations of any other Purchaser under this Agreement or

this Agreement or the Registration Rights Agreement by any Purchaser, or on
its behalf, does not excuse performance by any other Purchaser. Nothing
contained herein or in the Registration Rights Agreement, and no action taken
by any Purchaser pursuant thereto, shall be deemed to constitute the
Purchasers as a partnership, an association, a joint venture or any other kind
of entity, or create a presumption that the Purchasers are in any way acting
in concert or as a group with respect to such obligations or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Registration Rights Agreement. Except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement or the Registration Rights Agreement,
each Purchaser shall be entitled to independently protect and enforce its
rights, including the rights arising out of this Agreement or the Registration
Rights Agreement, and it shall not be necessary for any other Purchaser to be
joined as an additional party in any proceeding for such purpose.

Section 2.03 _Purchased Units_. The Purchased Units shall have those rights,
preferences, privileges and restrictions governing the Common Units as set
forth in the Limited Partnership Agreement.

Section 2.04 _Funding into Escrow_. Each Purchaser shall deposit its
Commitment Amount into an escrow account established under the Escrow
Agreement no later than one Business Day prior to the Closing Date. On the
Closing Date, upon receipt of satisfactory evidence that the conditions set
forth in Article VI have been satisfied or waived, pursuant to Section 2.05,
each such Purchaser shall deliver notice to the Escrow Agent (as such term is
defined in the Escrow Agreement) to promptly and timely release the funds
escrowed under the Escrow Agreement to Atlas Pipeline Partners.

Section 2.05 _Closing_. Subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth
in Article VI, the execution and delivery of the Basic Documents (other than
this Agreement and the Anadarko Agreements), the delivery of certificates
representing the Purchased Units, the release of the funds escrowed under the
Escrow Agreement to Atlas Pipeline Partners pursuant to the terms of the
Escrow  



 

6  Agreement, and the execution and delivery of all other instruments,
agreements and other documents required by this Agreement (the " _Closing_ ")
shall take place on a date (the " _Closing Date_ ") concurrent with the
Acquisition Closing Date, provided that Atlas Pipeline Partners shall take
reasonable efforts to provide each Purchaser five Business Days (or such
shorter period as shall be agreeable to each such Purchaser but in any event
no less than two Business Days) prior written notice of such designated
Closing Date.

ARTICLE III

_REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF ATLAS PIPELINE PARTNERS _

material governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals,
necessary to own, lease, use and operate its Properties and carry on its
business as its business is now being conducted as described in the Atlas

expected to have an Atlas Pipeline Partners Material Adverse Effect. Each of
Atlas Pipeline Partners and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed
and in good standing as a foreign limited partnership, limited liability
company or corporation, as applicable, and is authorized to do business in
each jurisdiction in which the ownership or leasing of its
respective Properties or the character of its respective operations makes

qualification, license, authorization or good standing would not reasonably be
expected to have an Atlas Pipeline Partners Material Adverse Effect.

Section 3.02 _Capitalization and Valid Issuance of Purchased Units_.

(a) As of the date of this Agreement, and prior to the issuance and sale of
the Purchased Units, the issued and outstanding limited partnership
interests of Atlas Pipeline Partners consist of 13,080,418 Common Units,

Partners has no outstanding indebtedness having the right to vote (or
convertible into or exchangeable for securities having the right to vote) on
any matters on which the Unitholders may vote. Except as set forth in the
first sentence of Section 3.02(a) and (b), as contemplated  



 

7  by this Agreement or as are contained in the Limited Partnership Agreement,
there are no outstanding or authorized (i) options, warrants,
preemptive rights, subscriptions, calls or other rights, convertible
securities, agreements, claims or commitments of any character obligating
Atlas Pipeline Partners or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, transfer or sell
any limited partnership interests or other equity interests in Atlas Pipeline
Partners or any of its Subsidiaries or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for such limited partnership interests or other equity interests,
(ii) obligations of Atlas Pipeline Partners or any of its Subsidiaries to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any limited partnership interests or
other equity interests in Atlas Pipeline Partners or any of its Subsidiaries

(iii) voting trusts or similar agreements to which Atlas Pipeline Partners or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the voting of the equity
interests of Atlas Pipeline Partners or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(c)(i) All of the issued and outstanding equity interests of each of Atlas
Pipeline Partners Subsidiaries are owned, directly or indirectly, by Atlas
Pipeline Partners free and clear of any Liens (except for such restrictions as
may exist under applicable Law and except for such Liens as may be imposed
under Atlas Pipeline Partners or its Subsidiaries credit facilities filed
as exhibits to the Atlas Pipeline Partners SEC Documents), and all such
ownership interests have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully
paid (to the extent required by applicable Law and the organizational
documents of Atlas Pipeline Partners Subsidiaries, as applicable) and non-
assessable (except as non-assessability may be affected by Section 17-607 of
the Delaware LP Act or the organizational documents of Atlas Pipeline
Partners Subsidiaries, as applicable) and free of preemptive rights, with no
personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof, and (ii) except as
disclosed in the Atlas Pipeline Partners SEC Documents, neither Atlas Pipeline
Partners nor any of its Subsidiaries owns any shares of capital stock or
other securities of, or interest in, any other Person, or is obligated to make
any capital contribution to or other investment in any other Person.

(d) The offer and sale of the Purchased Units and the limited partnership
interests represented thereby are duly authorized by Atlas Pipeline
Partners pursuant to the Limited Partnership Agreement prior to and as at the
Closing and, when issued and delivered to the Purchasers against payment
therefor in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, will be validly
issued, fully paid (to the extent required by applicable Law and the Limited
Partnership Agreement) and non-assessable (except as such non-assessability
may be affected by Section 17-607 of the Delaware LP Act) and will be free of
any and all Liens and restrictions on transfer, other than restrictions on
transfer under the Limited Partnership Agreement, the Registration Rights
Agreement and applicable state and federal securities Laws and other than such
Liens as are created by the Purchasers.

(e) The Purchased Units will be issued in compliance with all applicable rules
of The New York Stock Exchange. Prior to the Closing Date, Atlas

York Stock Exchange with respect to the Purchased Units. Atlas Pipeline

having applicability to Atlas Pipeline Partners or any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective Properties, (b) conflict with or result in a violation
of any provision of the Certificate of Limited Partnership of Atlas Pipeline
Partners or the Limited Partnership Agreement or any organizational documents
of any of Atlas Pipeline Partners Subsidiaries, (c) require any consent,
approval or notice under or result in a violation or breach of or constitute
(with or without due notice or lapse of time or both) a default (or give rise

Partners or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which Atlas Pipeline
Partners or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Properties may

in or require the creation or imposition of any Lien upon or with respect to

and (d) where such violation, default, breach, termination, cancellation,

Atlas Pipeline Partners, enforceable in accordance with their terms, except as
such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent

principles of equity. No approval by the Unitholders is required as a result
of Atlas Pipeline Partners issuance and sale of the Purchased Units.

Section 3.08 _Compliance with Laws_. Neither Atlas Pipeline Partners nor any
of its Subsidiaries is in violation of any judgment, decree or order or any
Law applicable to Atlas Pipeline Partners or its Subsidiaries, except as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have an Atlas Pipeline Partners
Material Adverse Effect. Atlas Pipeline Partners and its Subsidiaries possess
all certificates, authorizations and permits issued by the appropriate
regulatory authorities necessary to conduct their respective businesses,
except where the failure to possess such certificates, authorizations or
permits would not have, individually or in the  



 

10  aggregate, an Atlas Pipeline Partners Material Adverse Effect, and neither
Atlas Pipeline Partners nor any such Subsidiary has received any notice
of proceedings relating to the revocation or modification of any such
certificate, authorization or permit, except where such potential revocation
or modification would not have, individually or in the aggregate, an Atlas
Pipeline Partners Material Adverse Effect. Neither Atlas Pipeline Partners
nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any director, officer, agent, employee or
other person acting on behalf of Atlas Pipeline Partners or any of its
Subsidiaries has, in the course of its actions for, or on behalf of, Atlas

Agreement, no authorization, consent, approval, waiver, license, qualification
or written exemption from, nor any filing, declaration, qualification or
registration with, any Governmental Authority or any other Person is required
in connection with the execution, delivery or performance by Atlas Pipeline
Partners of any of the Basic Documents to which it is a party, except where
the failure to receive such authorization, consent, approval, waiver, license,

reasonably be expected to have an Atlas Pipeline Partners Material Adverse
Effect.

ended December 31, 2006, and Atlas Pipeline Partners expects to meet for the
taxable year ending December 31, 2007, the gross income requirements of

Purchasers from and against any and all claims, demands or liabilities for
brokers, finders, placement or other similar fees or commissions incurred
by Atlas Pipeline Partners or alleged to have been incurred by Atlas Pipeline

with respect to any differences.

Section 3.15 _Insurance_. Atlas Pipeline Partners and its Subsidiaries are
insured against such losses and risks and in such amounts as Atlas Pipeline
Partners believes in its sole discretion to be prudent for its businesses.
Atlas Pipeline Partners does not have any reason to believe that it or any
Subsidiary will not be able to renew its existing insurance coverage as and
when such coverage expires or to obtain similar coverage from similar
insurers as may be necessary to continue its business.

Partners has concluded that such participation is in Atlas Pipeline Partners
best interest and is consistent with Atlas Pipeline Partners objectives and

length purchaser. Atlas Pipeline Partners further acknowledges that, other

with respect to this Agreement or the other Basic Documents and any advice
given by any Purchaser or any of its respective Representatives in connection
with this Agreement or the other Basic Documents is merely incidental to the

12 ARTICLE IV

_REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF EACH PURCHASER_

Each Purchaser, severally and not jointly, represents and warrants to Atlas
Pipeline Partners with respect to itself, on and as of the date of this
Agreement and on and as of the Closing Date, as follows:

Section 4.01 _Valid Existence_. Such Purchaser (i) is duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of
organization and (ii) has all requisite power, and has all material
governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals, necessary to
own its Properties and carry on its business as its business is now being
conducted, except where the failure to obtain such licenses, authorizations,
consents and approvals would not have and would not reasonably be expected to
have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.02 _No Breach_. The execution, delivery and performance by such
Purchaser of the Basic Documents to which it is a party and all other
agreements and instruments in connection with the transactions contemplated by
the Basic Documents to which it is a party, and compliance by such Purchaser
with the terms and provisions hereof and thereof and the purchase of the
Purchased Units by such Purchaser do not and will not (a) violate any
provision of any Law, governmental permit, determination or award
having applicability to such Purchaser or any of its Properties, (b) conflict
with or result in a violation of any provision of the organizational documents
of such Purchaser or (c) require any consent (other than standard internal
consents), approval or notice under or result in a violation or breach of or
constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of time or both) a default (or
give rise to any right of termination, cancellation or acceleration) under (i)
any note, bond, mortgage, license, or loan or credit agreement to which such
Purchaser is a party or by which such Purchaser or any of its Properties may
be bound or (ii) any other such agreement, instrument or obligation, except in
the case of clauses (a) and (c) where such violation, default, breach,
termination, cancellation, failure to receive consent or approval, or
acceleration with respect to the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.02
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.03 _Investment_. The Purchased Units are being acquired for such
Purchasers own account, or the accounts of clients for whom such Purchaser
exercises discretionary investment authority (all of whom such Purchaser
represents and warrants are "accredited investors" within the meaning of Rule
501 of Regulation D promulgated by the Commission pursuant to the Securities
Act), not as a nominee or agent, and with no present intention of distributing
the Purchased Units or any part thereof, and such Purchaser has no present
intention of selling or granting any participation in or otherwise
distributing the same in any transaction in violation of the securities Laws
of the United States of America or any state, without prejudice, however, to
such Purchasers right at all times to sell or otherwise dispose of all or
any part of the Purchased Units under a registration statement under the
Securities Act and applicable state securities Laws or under an exemption from
such registration available thereunder (including, if available, Rule  



 

13  144 promulgated thereunder). If such Purchaser should in the future decide
to dispose of any of the Purchased Units, such Purchaser understands and
agrees (a) that it may do so only (i) in compliance with the Securities Act
and applicable state securities Law, as then in effect, or pursuant to an
exemption therefrom or (ii) in the manner contemplated by any registration
statement pursuant to which such securities are being offered, and (b) that
stop-transfer instructions to that effect will be in effect with respect to
such securities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Purchaser may at any time
enter into one or more total return swaps with respect to such Purchasers
Purchased Units with a third party provided that such transactions are exempt
from registration under the Securities Act; _provided_ , _however_ , the above
shall not apply, in the case of a Purchaser that is a large multi-unit
investment or commercial banking organization, to activities in the normal
course of trading units of such Purchaser other than the unit participating in
this transaction (the " _Participating Unit_ ") so long as such other units
are not acting on behalf of the Participating Unit and have not been provided
with confidential information regarding Atlas Pipeline Partners by the
Participating Unit.

Section 4.04 _Nature of Purchaser_. Such Purchaser represents and warrants to,
and covenants and agrees with, Atlas Pipeline Partners that (a) it is
an "accredited investor" within the meaning of Rule 501 of Regulation D
promulgated by the Commission pursuant to the Securities Act and (b) by reason
of its business and financial experience it has such knowledge, sophistication
and experience in business and financial matters so as to be capable of
evaluating the merits and risks of the prospective investment in the Purchased
Units, is able to bear the economic risk of such investment and, at the
present time, would be able to afford a complete loss of such investment.

Section 4.05 _Receipt of Information; Authorization_. Such Purchaser
acknowledges that it has (a) had access to the Atlas Pipeline Partners SEC
Documents, (b) had access to information regarding the Acquisition and its
potential effect on Atlas Pipeline Partners operations and financial results
and (c) been provided a reasonable opportunity to ask questions of and
receive answers from Representatives of Atlas Pipeline Partners regarding such
matters.

Section 4.06  _Restricted Securities_. Such Purchaser understands that the
Purchased Units it is purchasing are characterized as "restricted securities"
under the federal securities Laws inasmuch as they are being acquired from
Atlas Pipeline Partners in a transaction not involving a public offering and
that under such Laws and applicable regulations such securities may be resold
without registration under the Securities Act only in certain limited
circumstances. In this connection, Purchaser represents that it is
knowledgeable with respect to Rule 144 of the Commission promulgated under the
Securities Act; _provided_ , _however_ , the above shall not apply, in the
case of a Purchaser that is a large multi-unit investment or commercial
banking organization, to activities in the normal course of trading units of
such Purchaser other than the Participating Unit, so long as such other units
are not acting on behalf of the Participating Unit and have not been provided
with confidential information regarding Atlas Pipeline Partners by the
Participating Unit.

Section 4.07 _Certain Fees_. No fees or commissions will be payable by such
Purchaser to brokers, finders or investment bankers with respect to the sale
of any of the Purchased Units or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Atlas Pipeline Partners will not be liable
for any such fees or commissions. Such Purchaser agrees, severally and not
jointly with the other Purchasers, that it will indemnify and hold harmless
Atlas Pipeline Partners from and against any and all claims, demands or  



 

14  liabilities for brokers, finders, placement or other similar fees or
commissions incurred by such Purchaser or alleged to have been incurred
by such Purchaser in connection with the purchase of Purchased Units or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 4.08 _Legend_. It is understood that the certificates evidencing the
Purchased Units initially will bear the following legend:

"These securities have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended. These securities may not be sold, offered for sale, pledged
(except in connection with a bona fide margin account or other loan or
financing arrangement secured by these securities) or hypothecated in the
absence of a registration statement in effect with respect to the securities
under such Act or pursuant to an exemption from registration thereunder and,
in the case of a transaction exempt from registration, unless sold pursuant
to Rule 144 under such Act or the issuer has received documentation reasonably
satisfactory to it that such transaction does not require registration under
such Act."

 

For the avoidance of doubt, the Purchased Units may be pledged in connection
with a bona fide margin account or other loan or financing arrangement secured
by such Purchased Units and such pledge shall not be deemed to be a transfer,
sale or assignment of such Purchased Units, and no buyer effecting such a
pledge shall be required to provide Atlas Pipeline Partners with any notice
thereof or otherwise make any delivery to Atlas Pipeline Partners pursuant to
this Agreement or any other Basic Document.

Section 4.09 _Short Selling_. Such Purchaser represents that it has not
entered into any Short Sales of the Common Units owned by it between the time
it first began discussions with the Issuer or the Placement Agent about the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the date hereof (it being
understood that the entering into of a total return swap should not be
considered a short sale of Common Units); _provided_ , _however_ , the above
shall not apply, in the case of a Purchaser that is a large multi-unit
investment or commercial banking organization, to activities in the normal
course of trading units of such Purchaser other than the Participating Unit,
so long as such other units are not acting on behalf of the Participating Unit
and have not been provided with confidential information regarding Atlas
Pipeline Partners by the Participating Unit.

Section 4.10 _No Side Agreements_. Except for the confidentiality agreements
entered into by and between any Purchaser and Atlas Pipeline Partners and the
agreement between UBS Securities LLC and Atlas Pipeline Partners regarding the
Placement Agent Fees (it being understood that Atlas Pipeline Partners will
reimburse the fees of counsel for the lead investor), there are no other
agreements by, among or between Atlas Pipeline Partners or its Affiliates, on
the one hand, and such Purchaser or its Affiliates, on the other hand, with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby nor promises or inducements
for future transactions between or among any of such parties.

Section 4.11  _Acknowledgment Regarding Distributions on Purchased Units_.
Such Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that it shall not be entitled to
receive any distribution on the Purchased Units relating to Atlas Pipeline
Partners second fiscal quarter of 2007.



 

15 ARTICLE V

_COVENANTS_

Section 5.01 _Anti-dilution Protection_. If Atlas Pipeline Partners issues
additional Common Units (or any security convertible into or exchangeable or
exercisable for Common Units (other than pursuant to its Long Term Incentive
Plan or other existing management compensation plans and the conversion of
outstanding options or outstanding Preferred Units)) for an initial purchase
price of less than the Unit Price (the " _New Units_ ") prior to the effective
date of the Registration Statement (as defined in the Registration Rights
Agreement), Atlas Pipeline Partners will issue to each Purchaser under this
Agreement additional Common Units (rounded up or down to the nearest whole
Unit) in an amount equal to the difference between:

(a) the number of Units obtained by (i) multiplying (A) the Purchased Units by
(B) the Unit Price and (ii) dividing the result by the Weighted Average as
determined by the formula listed below, and

(b) the Purchased Units.



     |  | 
---|---|--- 
  

Weighted Average =

 |  | _(X)(A) + (Y)(B)_ 
   |  |

A + B 

   
  

X = Unit Price 

   
  

Y = the initial purchase price paid per New Unit 

   
  

A = the number of Units issued hereunder 

   
  

B = the number of New Units issued 

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if the New Units issued by
Atlas Pipeline Partners are securities convertible into or exchangeable or
exercisable for Common Units, then for purpose of this Section 5.01, the
"initial purchase price" per New Unit shall equal the (i) initial purchase
price paid for each such New Unit, plus (ii) conversion or exercise price for
each such New Unit and any additional consideration required to be paid in
connection with the exercise, conversion or exchange of such New Unit into
Common Unit.

Section 5.02 _Purchaser Lock-Up_. Without the prior written consent of Atlas
Pipeline Partners, each Purchaser severally agrees that from and after the
Closing it will not sell any of its Purchased Units prior to the Lock-Up
Date; provided, however, that each Purchaser may: (i) enter into one or more
total return swaps or similar transactions at any time with respect to the
Purchased Units purchased by such Purchaser; (ii) transfer its Purchased
Units to an Affiliate of such Purchaser or to any other Purchaser or an
Affiliate of such other Purchaser provided that such Affiliate agrees to the
restrictions in this Section 5.02; or (iii) sell its Purchased Units to an
accredited investor (as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the
Securities Act) in a transaction exempt from registration under the Securities
Act; _provided_ , _however_ , the above shall not apply, in the case of a
Purchaser that is a large multi-unit investment or commercial banking
organization, to activities in the normal course of trading units of such
Purchaser other than the Participating Unit, so long as such other units
are not acting on behalf of the Participating Unit and have not been provided
with confidential information regarding Atlas Pipeline Partners by the
Participating Unit.



 

16 Section 5.03 _Short Selling Acknowledgement and Agreement_. Each Purchaser
understands and acknowledges, severally and not jointly with any other
Purchaser, that the Commission currently takes the position that coverage of
short sales of securities "against the box" prior to the effective date of a
registration statement is a violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act.
Each Purchaser agrees, severally and not jointly, that it will not engage in
any Short Sales that result in the disposition of the Purchased Units acquired
hereunder by the Purchaser until such time as the Registration Statement (as
defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) is declared effective (it being
understood that the entering into of a total return swap should not be
considered a short sale of Common Units). No Purchaser makes
any representation, warranty or covenant hereby that it will not engage in
Short Sales in the securities of Atlas Pipeline Partners otherwise owned by
such Purchaser or borrowed from a broker after the date the press release
contemplated by Section 5.05 is issued by Atlas Pipeline Partners; _provided_
, _however_ , the above shall not apply, in the case of a Purchaser that is a
large multi-unit investment or commercial banking organization, to activities
in the normal course of trading units of such Purchaser other than the
Participating Unit, so long as such other units are not acting on behalf of
the Participating Unit and have not been provided with confidential
information regarding Atlas Pipeline Partners by the Participating Unit.

Section 5.04 _Taking of Necessary Action_. Each of the Parties hereto shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts promptly to take or cause to be taken
all action and promptly to do or cause to be done all things necessary, proper
or advisable under applicable Law and regulations to consummate and make

the foregoing, Atlas Pipeline Partners and each Purchaser will, and Atlas
Pipeline Partners shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, use its
commercially reasonable efforts to make all filings and obtain all consents of
Governmental Authorities that may be necessary or, in the reasonable opinion
of the Purchasers or Atlas Pipeline Partners, as the case may be, advisable
for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the other Basic Documents.

Section 5.05 _Non-Disclosure; Interim Public Filings_. Atlas Pipeline Partners
shall, on or before 8:30 a.m., New York time, on the first Business
Day following execution of this Agreement, issue a press release acceptable
to the Purchasers disclosing all material terms of the transactions
contemplated herein and in the other Basic Documents. Before 8:30 a.m., New

such 8-K Filing this Agreement and the other Basic Documents, in the form
required by the Exchange Act. Thereafter, Atlas Pipeline Partners shall timely
file any filings and notices required by the Commission or applicable Law
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby. Atlas Pipeline Partners
and the Purchasers shall consult with each other in issuing any press releases
or otherwise making public statements or filings and other
communications with the Commission or any regulatory agency or The New York
Stock Exchange with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, and
neither Party shall issue any such press release or otherwise make any such
public statement, filing or other communication without the prior consent of
the other, except if  



 

17  such disclosure is required by Law, in which case the disclosing Party shall
promptly provide the other Party with prior notice of such public
statement, filing or other communication. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Atlas Pipeline Partners shall not publicly disclose the name of any Purchaser,
or include the name of any Purchaser in any press release, without the prior
written consent of such Purchaser except to the extent the names of the
Purchasers are included in this Agreement as filed as an exhibit to the 8-K
Filing and the press release referred to in the first sentence above. Atlas
Pipeline Partners shall not, and shall cause each of its respective
Representatives not to, provide any Purchaser with any material non-public
information regarding Atlas Pipeline Partners from and after the issuance of
the above-referenced press release without the express written consent of
such Purchaser.

Section 5.06 _Use of Proceeds_. Atlas Pipeline Partners shall use the
collective proceeds from the sale of the Purchased Units to partially finance
the Acquisition.

ARTICLE VII

_INDEMNIFICATION, COSTS AND EXPENSES_

Section 7.01 _Indemnification by Atlas Pipeline Partners_. Atlas Pipeline
Partners agrees to indemnify each Purchaser and its Representatives
(collectively, " _Purchaser Related Parties_ ") from, and hold each of them
harmless against, any and all actions, suits, proceedings (including any
investigations, litigation or inquiries), demands and causes of action, and,
in connection therewith, and promptly upon demand, pay and reimburse each of
them for all costs, losses, liabilities, damages or expenses of any kind or
nature whatsoever, including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel
and all other reasonable expenses incurred in connection with investigating,
defending or preparing to defend any such matter that may be incurred by them
or asserted against or involve any of them as a result of, arising out of or
in any way related to (i) any actual or proposed use by Atlas Pipeline
Partners of the proceeds of any sale of the Purchased Units or (ii) the
breach of any of the representations, warranties or covenants of Atlas
Pipeline Partners contained herein; provided that such claim for
indemnification relating to a breach of a representation or warranty is made
prior to the expiration of such representation or warranty.

Section 7.02 _Indemnification by Purchasers_. Each Purchaser agrees,
severally and not jointly, to indemnify Atlas Pipeline Partners and its
Representatives (collectively, " _Atlas Pipeline Partners Related Parties_ ")
from, and hold each of them harmless against, any and all actions,
suits, proceedings (including any investigations, litigation or inquiries),
demands and causes of action, and, in connection therewith, and promptly upon
demand, pay and reimburse each of them for all costs, losses, liabilities,
damages or expenses of any kind or nature whatsoever, including the
reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel and all other reasonable expenses
incurred in connection with investigating, defending or preparing to defend
any such matter that may be incurred by them or asserted against or involve
any of them as a result of, arising out of or in any way related to the breach
of any of the covenants of such Purchaser contained herein.



 

21 Section 7.03 _Indemnification Procedure_. Promptly after any Atlas Pipeline
Partners Related Party or Purchaser Related Party (hereinafter, the "
_Indemnified Party_ ") has received notice of any indemnifiable claim
hereunder, or the commencement of any action or proceeding by a third party,
which the Indemnified Party believes in good faith is an indemnifiable claim
under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall give the indemnitor
hereunder (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") written notice of such claim or the
commencement of such action or proceeding, but failure to so notify the
Indemnifying Party will not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability
it may have to such Indemnified Party hereunder except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure. Such notice
shall state the nature and the basis of such claim to the extent then known.
The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend and settle, at its own
expense and by its own counsel who shall be reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnified Party, any such matter as long as the Indemnifying Party pursues
the same diligently and in good faith. If the Indemnifying Party undertakes to
defend or settle, it shall promptly notify the Indemnified Party of its
intention to do so, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the
Indemnifying Party and its counsel in all commercially reasonable respects in
the defense thereof and the settlement thereof. Such cooperation shall include
furnishing the Indemnifying Party with any books, records and
other information reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party and in the
Indemnified Partys possession or control. Such cooperation of the Indemnified
Party shall be at the cost of the Indemnifying Party. After the Indemnifying
Party has notified the Indemnified Party of its intention to undertake to
defend or settle any such asserted liability, and for so long as the
Indemnifying Party diligently pursues such defense, the Indemnifying Party
shall not be liable for any additional legal expenses incurred by the
Indemnified Party in connection with any defense or settlement of such
asserted liability; provided, however, that the Indemnified Party shall be
entitled (i) at its expense, to participate in the defense of such asserted
liability and the negotiations of the settlement thereof and (ii) if (A) the
Indemnifying Party has failed to assume the defense or employ counsel
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party or (B) if the defendants in
any such action include both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party
and counsel to the Indemnified Party shall have concluded that there may be
reasonable defenses available to the Indemnified Party that are different from
or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Party or if the
interests of the Indemnified Party reasonably may be deemed to conflict with
the interests of the Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party shall have
the right to select a separate counsel and to assume such legal defense and
otherwise to participate in the defense of such action, with the expenses and
fees of such separate counsel and other expenses related to such participation
to be reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party as incurred. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not settle any
indemnified claim without the consent of the Indemnified Party, unless the
settlement thereof imposes no liability or obligation on, involves
no admission of wrongdoing or malfeasance by, and includes a complete release
from liability of, the Indemnified Party.

ARTICLE VIII 

_MISCELLANEOUS_

Section 8.01 _Interpretation_. Article, Section, Schedule and Exhibit
references are to this Agreement, unless otherwise specified. All references
to instruments, documents, contracts and agreements are references to
such instruments, documents, contracts and agreements as the same may be
amended, supplemented and otherwise modified from time to time, unless

perpetually. The covenants made in this Agreement or any other Basic Document
shall survive the Closing of the transactions described herein and remain
operative and in full force and effect regardless of acceptance of any of the
Purchased Units and payment therefor and repayment, conversion, exercise or
repurchase thereof. All indemnification obligations of Atlas Pipeline Partners
and the Purchasers pursuant to Section 3.13, Section 4.07 and Article VII of
this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect unless such
obligations are expressly terminated in a writing by the Parties referencing
the particular Article or Section, regardless of any purported general
termination of this Agreement.

Section 8.03 _No Waiver; Modifications in Writing_. 

(a) _Delay_. No failure or delay on the part of any Party in exercising any
right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall
any single or partial exercise of any such right, power or remedy preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right, power or
remedy. The remedies provided for herein are cumulative and are not
exclusive of any remedies that may be available to a Party at law or in
equity or otherwise.

(b) _Specific Waiver_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or the
Registration Rights Agreement, no amendment, waiver, consent, modification or
termination of any provision of this Agreement or any other Basic Document
shall be effective unless signed by each of the Parties or each of the
original signatories thereto affected by such amendment, waiver, consent,
modification or termination. Any amendment, supplement or modification of or
to any provision of this Agreement or any other Basic Document, any waiver of
any provision of this Agreement or any other Basic Document and any consent
to any departure by Atlas Pipeline Partners from the terms of any provision of
this Agreement or any other Basic Document shall be effective only in the
specific instance and for the specific purpose for which made or given.
Except where notice is specifically required by this Agreement, no notice to
or demand on any Party in any case shall entitle any Party to any other or
further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.



 

23 Section 8.04 _Binding Effect; Assignment_.

(a) _Binding Effect_. This Agreement shall be binding upon Atlas Pipeline
Partners, each Purchaser, and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, this
Agreement shall not be construed so as to confer any right or benefit upon any
Person other than the Parties to this Agreement and as provided in Article
VII, and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

(b) _Assignment of Purchased Units_. All or any portion of a Purchasers
Purchased Units purchased pursuant to this Agreement may be sold, assigned or
pledged by such Purchaser, subject to compliance with applicable securities
Laws and the lock-up contained in Section 5.02.

(c) _Assignment of Rights_. Each Purchaser may assign all or any portion of
its rights, subject to an express assumption of each of the obligations under
this Agreement without the consent of Atlas Pipeline Partners (i) to any
Affiliate of such Purchaser or (ii) in connection with a total return swap or
similar transaction with respect to the Purchased Units purchased by
such Purchaser, and in each case the assignee shall be deemed to be a
Purchaser hereunder with respect to such assigned rights or obligations and
shall agree to be bound by the provisions of this Agreement. Except as
expressly permitted by this Section 8.04(c), such rights and obligations may
not otherwise be transferred except with the prior written consent of Atlas
Pipeline Partners (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), in which
case the assignee shall be deemed to be a Purchaser hereunder with respect to
such assigned rights or obligations and shall agree to be bound by the
provisions of this Agreement. Schedule 2.01 shall be revised to reflect the
actual Purchasers and allocations at the Closing.

Section 8.05 _Aggregation of Purchased Units_. All Purchased Units held or
acquired by Persons who are Affiliates of one another shall be aggregated
together for the purpose of determining the availability of any rights under
this Agreement.

Section 8.06 _Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure_. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, each Purchaser that has executed a confidentiality

communications shall be deemed to have been duly given: at the time delivered
by hand, if personally delivered; upon actual receipt if sent by registered
or certified mail, return receipt requested, or regular mail, if mailed; when
receipt acknowledged, if sent via facsimile; and upon actual receipt when
delivered to an air courier guaranteeing overnight delivery or via electronic

Section 8.08 _Removal of Legend_. Atlas Pipeline Partners shall remove the
legend described in Section 4.08 from the certificates evidencing the
Purchased Units at the request of a Purchaser submitting to Atlas Pipeline
Partners such certificates, together with such other documentation as may be
reasonably requested by Atlas Pipeline Partners or required by its transfer
agent, unless Atlas Pipeline  



 

24  Partners, with the advice of counsel, reasonably determines that such
removal is inappropriate; provided that no opinion of counsel shall be
required in the event a Purchaser is effecting a sale of such Purchased Units
pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act or an effective registration
statement. Atlas Pipeline Partners shall cooperate with such Purchaser to
effect removal of such legend. Subject to Section 4.5 and Section 5.6 of the
Limited Partnership Agreement, the legend described in Section 4.08 shall be
removed and Atlas Pipeline Partners shall issue a certificate without such
legend to the holder of Purchased Units upon which it is stamped, if, unless
otherwise required by state securities Laws, (i) such Purchased Units are sold
pursuant to an effective registration statement, (ii) in connection with a
sale, assignment or other transfer, such holder provides Atlas Pipeline
Partners with an opinion of a law firm reasonably acceptable to Atlas Pipeline
Partners, in a generally acceptable form, to the effect that such sale,
assignment or transfer of such Purchased Units may be made
without registration under the applicable requirements of the Securities Act,
or (iii) such holder provides Atlas Pipeline Partners with reasonable
assurance that such Purchased Units can be sold, assigned or transferred
pursuant to Rule 144 or Rule 144A under the Securities Act. Atlas Pipeline
Partners shall bear all costs and expenses associated with the removal of a
legend pursuant to this Section 8.08.

Section 8.09 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the other Basic Documents
are intended by the Parties as a final expression of their agreement and
intended to be a complete and exclusive statement of the agreement
and understanding of the Parties hereto and thereto in respect of the subject
matter contained herein and therein. There are no restrictions, promises,
warranties or undertakings, other than those set forth or referred to herein
or therein with respect to the rights granted by Atlas Pipeline Partners or a
Purchaser set forth herein or therein. This Agreement and the other Basic
Documents supersede all prior agreements and understandings between the
Parties with respect to such subject matter. 

Section 8.10 _Governing Law_. This Agreement will be construed in accordance
with and governed by the Laws of the State of New York without regard to
principles of conflicts of Laws.

Section 8.11 _Execution in Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in

together, shall constitute but one and the same Agreement.

Section 8.12 _Termination_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this Agreement may be
terminated on or any time prior to the Closing by (i) any Purchaser, with
respect to itself or (ii) with the written consent of the Purchasers entitled
to purchase a majority of the Purchased Units based on their Commitment
Amounts or (iii) by Atlas Pipeline Partners, (A) if any representation or
warranty of the other Party set forth in this Agreement shall be untrue in any
material respect when made, or (B) upon a breach in any material respect of
any covenant or agreement on the part of the other Party set forth in this
Agreement (either (A) or (B) above being a " _Terminating Breach_ ");

Breach is not cured within 20 days after written notice from the non-breaching
Party.



 

25 (b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this Agreement shall

date specified in the Anadarko Agreements;

(ii) if the Acquisition has not closed by September 1, 2007; or

(iii) if a Law shall have been enacted or promulgated, or if any Action shall
have been taken by any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction which
permanently restrains, precludes, enjoins or otherwise prohibits the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or makes the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement illegal.

(c) In the event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in Section
8.12(a) or Section 8.12(b), this Agreement shall forthwith become null
and void. In the event of such termination, there shall be no liability on
the part of any Party hereto, except as set forth in Article VII of this
Agreement and except with respect to the requirement to comply with any
confidentiality agreement in favor of Atlas Pipeline Partners; provided that
nothing herein shall relieve any Party from any liability or obligation with
respect to any willful breach of this Agreement.

Section 8.13 _Recapitalization, Exchanges, Etc. Affecting the Purchased
Units_. The provisions of this Agreement shall apply to the full extent set
forth herein with respect to any and all equity interests of Atlas Pipeline
Partners or any successor or assign of Atlas Pipeline Partners (whether by

shall be appropriately adjusted for combinations, unit splits,
recapitalizations and the like occurring after the date of this Agreement.

Section 8.14  _Obligations Limited to Parties to Agreement_. Each of the
parties hereto covenants, agrees and acknowledges that no Person other than

shall have any obligation hereunder and that, notwithstanding that one or

under any documents or instruments delivered in connection herewith or
therewith shall be had against any former, current or future director,
officer, employee, agent, general or limited partner, manager, member,
stockholder or Affiliate of any of the Purchasers or Atlas Pipeline Partners
or any former, current or future director, officer, employee, agent, general
or limited partner, manager, member, stockholder or Affiliate of any of the
foregoing, whether by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or
equitable proceeding, or by virtue of any applicable Law, it being expressly
agreed and acknowledged that no personal liability whatsoever shall attach to,
be imposed on or otherwise be incurred by any former, current or future
director, officer, employee, agent, general or limited partner, manager,
member, stockholder or Affiliate of any of the  



 

26  Purchasers or Atlas Pipeline Partners or any former, current or future
director, officer, employee, agent, general or limited partner, manager,
member, stockholder or Affiliate of any of the foregoing, as such, for any
obligations of the Purchasers and Atlas Pipeline Partners under this Agreement
or the other Basic Documents or any documents or instruments delivered in

by reason of such obligation or its creation.

Ex. A _EXHIBIT B_

FORM OF LEGAL OPINION

_Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meaning assigned
to such terms in the Common Unit Purchase Agreement dated as of June 1, 2007
(the " _Agreement_ "). Atlas Pipeline Partners shall furnish to the Purchasers
at the Closing an opinion of Ledgewood Law Firm, counsel for Atlas
Pipeline Partners, addressed to the Purchasers and dated the Closing Date in
form satisfactory to the Purchasers, stating that_:

(i) Each of Atlas Pipeline Partners and its Subsidiaries (i) is a
corporation, limited partnership or limited liability company, as applicable,
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
state or other jurisdiction of its organization; (ii) has all requisite power
and authority, and has all governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and
approvals, necessary to own, lease, use and operate its Properties and carry
on its business as its business is now being conducted as described in the
Atlas Pipeline Partners SEC Documents, except where the failure to obtain such
licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals would not reasonably be
expected to have an Atlas Pipeline Partners Material Adverse Effect; and
(iii) is duly qualified or licensed and in good standing as a foreign limited
partnership, limited liability company or corporation, as applicable, and is
authorized to do business in the jurisdictions listed in Annex A hereto. 

(ii) As of the date hereof, and prior to the sale and issuance of the
Purchased Units, the issued and outstanding limited partnership interests of
Atlas Pipeline Partners consist of 13,080,418 Common Units, 40,000 Preferred
Units and Incentive Distribution Rights. All of the outstanding Common Units,
Preferred Units and Incentive Distribution Rights have been duly authorized
and validly issued in accordance with applicable Law and the Limited
Partnership Agreement and are fully paid (to the extent required by the
Limited Partnership Agreement) and non-assessable (except as such non-
assessability may be affected by Section 17-607 of the Delaware LP Act ).

(iii) To our knowledge, except as described in the Atlas Pipeline Partners SEC
Documents filed prior to the date hereof, for options granted pursuant to
Atlas Pipeline Partners existing Long-Term Incentive Plan or other existing
compensation arrangements, or as contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, Atlas
Pipeline Partners has no outstanding or authorized (i) options, warrants,
preemptive rights, subscriptions, calls or other rights, convertible
securities, agreements, claims or commitments of any character obligating
Atlas Pipeline Partners or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, transfer or sell
any limited partnership interests or other equity interests in Atlas Pipeline
Partners or any of its Subsidiaries or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for such limited partnership interests or other
equity interests, (ii) obligations of Atlas Pipeline Partners or any of its
Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any limited
partnership interests or other equity interests in Atlas Pipeline Partners or
any of its Subsidiaries or any such securities or agreements listed in clause
(i) of this sentence or (iii) voting trusts or similar agreements to which
Atlas Pipeline Partners or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to
the voting of the equity interests of Atlas Pipeline Partners or any of its
Subsidiaries.



 

Ex. B (iv) All of the issued and outstanding equity interests of each of Atlas
Pipeline Partners Subsidiaries are owned, directly or indirectly, by Atlas
Pipeline Partners free and clear of any Liens (A) in respect of which a
financing statement under the Uniform Commercial Code naming Atlas Pipeline
Partners or any of its Subsidiaries as debtors is on file in the office of
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, (B) otherwise known to such
counsel without independent investigation, other than those created under
applicable Law and (C) except for such Liens as may be imposed under Atlas
Pipeline Partners or its Subsidiaries credit facilities, and all such
ownership interests have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully
paid (to the extent required by the organizational documents of Atlas
Pipeline Partners Subsidiaries, as applicable) and nonassessable (except as
non-assessability may be affected by matters described in Section 17-607 of
the Delaware LP Act or the organizational documents of Atlas
Pipeline Partners Subsidiaries, as applicable) and free of preemptive
rights, and, to our knowledge, except as disclosed in the Atlas Pipeline
Partners SEC Documents, neither Atlas Pipeline Partners nor any of its
Subsidiaries owns any shares of capital stock or other securities of, or
interests in, any other Person or is obligated to make any capital
contribution to or other investment in any other Person.

(v) The Purchased Units and the limited partnership interests represented
thereby have been duly authorized by Atlas Pipeline Partners pursuant to the
Limited Partnership Agreement and, when issued and delivered to the
Purchasers against payment therefor in accordance with the terms of the
Purchase Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid (to the extent required
by the Limited Partnership Agreement) and non-assessable (except as such non-
assessability may be affected by Section 17-607 of the Delaware LP Act) and
will be free of any and all Liens and restriction on transfer, other than
restrictions on transfer under the Limited Partnership Agreement, the
Registration Rights Agreement and applicable state and federal securities
Laws and other than such Liens as are created by the Purchasers.

(vi) None of the offering, issuance and sale by Atlas Pipeline Partners of
the Purchased Units or the execution, delivery and performance of the Basic
Documents by Atlas Pipeline Partners (A) constitutes or will constitute a
violation of Atlas Pipeline Partners Certificate of Limited Partnership or
Limited Partnership Agreement, or any organizational documents of any of Atlas
Pipeline Partners Subsidiaries, (B) without duplication of clause (A),
constitutes or will constitute a breach or violation of, or a default under
(or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute
such an event), any agreement filed as an exhibit to the Atlas Pipeline
Partners SEC Documents, or (C) will result in a breach or violation (and, to
such counsels knowledge, no event has occurred that, with notice or lapse of
time or otherwise, would constitute such an event) or imposition of any Lien
upon any Property of Atlas Pipeline Partners or its Subsidiaries pursuant to
(i) any agreement, lease or other instrument known to such counsel (excluding
any agreement filed as an exhibit to the Atlas Pipeline Partners SEC
Documents) or (ii) to the knowledge of such counsel, any order, judgment,
decree or injunction of any federal or Delaware court or government agency or
body directed to any of Atlas Pipeline Partners or its Subsidiaries or any of
its respective Properties in a proceeding to which any of them or such
Property is a party, or (D) results or will result in any violation of the
Delaware LP Act, the Laws of the State of New York or U.S. federal Law, which
in the case of clause (B), (C) or (D) of this paragraph (vi) would be
reasonably expected to have an Atlas Pipeline Partners Material Adverse
Effect; provided, however, that no opinion is expressed pursuant to this
paragraph (vi) with respect to federal or state securities or anti-fraud
statutes, rules or regulations.



 

Ex. B (vii) Each of the Basic Documents to which Atlas Pipeline Partners is a party
has been duly authorized and validly executed and delivered on behalf of
Atlas Pipeline Partners, and is enforceable against Atlas Pipeline Partners in
accordance with its respective terms, except as such enforceability may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer and similar
Laws affecting creditors rights generally and by general principles of
equity.

(viii) Except as required by the Commission in connection with Atlas Pipeline
Partners obligations under the Registration Rights Agreement, no
authorization, consent, approval, waiver, license, qualification or written
exemption from, nor any filing, declaration, qualification or registration
with, any Governmental Authority or any other Person is required in connection
with the execution, delivery or performance by Atlas Pipeline Partners of any
of the Basic Documents to which it is a party, except where the failure to
receive such authorization, consent, approval, waiver, license, qualification
or written exemption or to make such filing, declaration, qualification or
registration would not individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have an Atlas Pipeline Partners Material Adverse Effect or those
that have been obtained or may be required under the state securities or "blue
sky" laws, as to which we do not express any opinion.

(ix) Atlas Pipeline Partners is not an "investment company" within the meaning
of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

 

(x) Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of each
Purchaser contained in the Purchase Agreement, the issuance and sale of
the Purchased Units pursuant to the Purchase Agreement are exempt from
registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

(xi) Atlas Pipeline Partners is treated as a partnership for federal income
tax purposes.

(xii) None of the offering, issuance and sale by Atlas Pipeline Partners of
the Purchased Units or the execution, delivery and performance of the Basic
Documents by Atlas Pipeline Partners gives rise to any rights for or relating
to the registration of any securities of Atlas Pipeline Partners, other than
pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement.

2 ARTICLE II

_REGISTRATION RIGHTS_

Section 2.01 _Registration_.

(a) _Registration_.

(i) _Deadline To Become Effective_. As promptly as practicable (but in no
event later than 120 days following the Closing Date), Atlas Pipeline Partners
shall prepare and file a registration statement under the Securities Act to
permit the resale of the Registrable Securities from time to time, including
as permitted by Rule 415 under the Securities Act (or any similar provision
then in force), with respect to all of the Registrable Securities (the "
_Registration Statement_ "). Atlas Pipeline Partners shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement to become
effective no later than 195 days following the Closing Date (the " _Target
Effective Date_ "). A Registration Statement filed pursuant to this Section
2.01 shall be on such appropriate registration form of the Commission as shall
be selected by Atlas Pipeline Partners. Atlas Pipeline Partners will use
its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement filed
pursuant to this Section 2.01 to be continuously effective under the
Securities Act until the earlier of (i) the date as of which all such
Registrable Securities are sold by the Purchasers and (ii) two years
following the Closing Date (the " _Effectiveness Period_ "). The Registration
Statement when declared effective (including the documents incorporated
therein by reference) shall comply as to form with all applicable
requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and shall not contain
an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading.

(ii) _Failure To Become Effective_. If the Registration Statement required by
this Section 2.01 is not effective by the Target Effective Date, then each
Purchaser shall be entitled to a payment with respect to such Purchasers
Registrable Securities, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, of 0.25%
of the Liquidated Damages Multiplier per 30-day period for the first 30 days
following the Target Effective Date, increasing by an additional 0.25% of the
Liquidated Damages Multiplier per 30-day period for each subsequent 30 days,
up to a maximum of 1.00% of the Liquidated Damages Multiplier per 30-day
period (the " _Liquidated Damages_ "). The Liquidated Damages payable pursuant
to the immediately preceding sentence shall be payable within ten Business
Days of the end of each such 30-day period. Liquidated Damages for any period
of less than 30 days shall be prorated by multiplying Liquidated Damages to be
paid in a full 30-day period by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of days for which Liquidated Damages are owed, and the denominator of
which is 30. Any Liquidated Damages shall be paid to each Purchaser in cash or
immediately available funds; _provided_ , _however_ , if Atlas Pipeline
Partners certifies that it is unable to pay Liquidated Damages in cash or
immediately available funds because such payment would result in a breach
under any of Atlas Pipeline Partners or Atlas Pipeline Partners
Subsidiaries credit facilities or other indebtedness filed as exhibits
to the Atlas Pipeline Partners SEC Documents, then Atlas Pipeline Partners
may pay the Liquidated Damages in kind in the form of the issuance of
additional Common Units. Upon  



 

3  any issuance of Common Units as Liquidated Damages, Atlas Pipeline Partners
shall promptly prepare and file an amendment to the Registration Statement
prior to its effectiveness adding such Common Units to such Registration
Statement as additional Registrable Securities. The determination of the
number of Common Units to be issued as Liquidated Damages shall be equal to
the amount of Liquidated Damages divided by the volume weighted average
closing price of the Common Units (as reported by The New York Stock Exchange)
for the ten trading days immediately preceding the date on which the
Liquidated Damages payment is due, less a discount of 2%. Any obligation of
Atlas Pipeline Partners to pay Liquidated Damages (other than Liquidated
Damages owing but not yet paid) to a Purchaser shall cease two years following
the Closing Date. As soon as practicable following the date that the
Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto becomes
effective, but in any event within two Business Days of such date, Atlas
Pipeline Partners shall provide the Purchasers with written notice of the
effectiveness of the Registration Statement.

(iii) _Waiver of Liquidated Damages_. If Atlas Pipeline Partners is unable to
cause a Registration Statement to become effective by the Target Effective
Date as a result of an acquisition, merger, reorganization, disposition or
other similar transaction, then Atlas Pipeline Partners may request a waiver
of the Liquidated Damages, which may be granted or withheld by the consent of
the Holders of two-thirds of Purchased Units, voting as a single class, in
their sole discretion.

(b) _Delay Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
Atlas Pipeline Partners may, upon written notice to all of the Selling Holders
whose Registrable Securities are included in the Registration
Statement, suspend such Selling Holders use of any prospectus which is a
part of the Registration Statement (in which event each such Selling Holder
shall cease offers and sales of the Registrable Securities pursuant to the
Registration Statement) but such Selling Holder may settle any previously
made sales of Registrable Securities, if (i) Atlas Pipeline Partners is
pursuing an acquisition, merger, reorganization, disposition or other similar
transaction and Atlas Pipeline Partners determines in good faith that Atlas
Pipeline Partners ability to pursue or consummate such a transaction would be
materially adversely affected by any required disclosure of such transaction
in the Registration Statement or (ii) Atlas Pipeline Partners has experienced
some other material non-public event, the disclosure of which at such time, in
the good faith judgment of Atlas Pipeline Partners, would materially adversely
affect Atlas Pipeline Partners; _provided_ ,  _however_ , in no event shall
such Selling Holders be suspended from selling Registrable Securities pursuant
to the Registration Statement for a period that exceeds an aggregate of 30
days in any 90-day period or 90 days in any 365-day period. Upon disclosure
of such information or the termination of the condition described above, Atlas
Pipeline Partners shall (i) provide prompt notice to the Selling Holders whose
Registrable Securities are included in the Registration Statement, (ii)
promptly terminate any suspension of sales it has put into effect and (iii)
take such other reasonable actions to permit sales of Registrable Securities
as contemplated in this Agreement.

(c) _Additional Rights to Liquidated Damages_. If (i) the Holders shall be
prohibited from selling their Registrable Securities under the Registration
Statement as a result of a suspension pursuant to Section 2.01(b) of this
Agreement in excess of the periods permitted therein or (ii) the Registration
Statement is filed and effective but, during the Effectiveness Period, shall
thereafter cease to  



 

4  be effective or fail to be usable for its intended purpose without being
succeeded by a post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement, a
supplement to the prospectus or a report filed with the Commission pursuant
to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or l5(d) of the Exchange Act, then, until the
suspension is lifted or a post-effective amendment, supplement or report is
filed with the Commission and effective, but not including any day on which a
suspension is lifted or such amendment, supplement or report is filed and
effective, if applicable, the Holders shall be entitled to receive an amount
equal to the Liquidated Damages, following (x) the date on which the
suspension period exceeded the permitted period under Section 2.01(b) of this
Agreement or (y) the date after the Registration Statement ceased to be
effective or failed to be useable for its intended purposes, as liquidated
damages and not as a penalty. For purposes of this Section 2.01(c), a
suspension shall be deemed lifted on the date that notice that the suspension
has been lifted or that a post-effective amendment is effective is delivered
to the Holders pursuant to Section 3.01 of this Agreement.

(d) _S-1 Filing_. In addition to the rights provided in Section 2.01(a), if
Atlas Pipeline Partners is not eligible to file a shelf registration statement
on Form S-3 for all Registrable Securities within the time periods referenced
in Section 2.01(a), one or more Holders collectively holding greater than $25
million of Registrable Securities, based on the Unit Price, may thereafter
deliver written notice to Atlas Pipeline Partners that such Holders wish to
register under the Securities Act an aggregate of at least $25 million
of Registrable Securities, based on the Unit Price, specifying the amount and
intended method of disposition of such Registrable Securities. Atlas Pipeline
Partners will promptly give written notice of such requested registration to
all other Holders, and thereupon will, as expeditiously as possible, use its
reasonable best efforts to effect the registration under the Securities Act of
(i) such Registrable Securities which Atlas Pipeline Partners has been so
requested to register by such Holders and (ii) all other Registrable
Securities which Atlas Pipeline Partners has been requested to register by any
other Holder (which request shall specify the amount and intended method of
disposition of such Registrable Securities, including an Underwritten
Offering) to the extent necessary to permit the disposition (in accordance
with the intended method thereof as aforesaid) of the Registrable Securities
so to be registered.

Section 2.02 _Piggyback Rights_.

(a) _Participation_. If at any time Atlas Pipeline Partners proposes to file
(i) a shelf registration statement other than the Registration Statement (in
which event Atlas Pipeline Partners covenants and agrees to include thereon a
description of the transaction under which the Purchasers acquired the
Registrable Securities), (ii) a prospectus supplement to an effective shelf
registration statement, other than the Registration Statement contemplated
by Section 2.01 of this Agreement and Holders may be included without the
filing of a post-effective amendment thereto, or (iii) a registration
statement, other than a shelf registration statement, in either case, for the
sale of Common Units in an Underwritten Offering for its own account and/or
another Person, then as soon as practicable but not less than three Business
Days prior to the filing of (x) the initial preliminary prospectus supplement
relating to such Underwritten Offering pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the
Securities Act, (y) the prospectus supplement relating to such Underwritten
Offering pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act (if no preliminary
prospectus supplement is used) or (z) such registration statement, as the
case may be, then Atlas Pipeline Partners shall give notice (including, but
not limited to, notification by electronic mail) of such proposed Underwritten
Offering to the Holders and such notice shall offer the Holders the  



 

5  opportunity to include in such Underwritten Offering such number of Common
Units (the " _Included Registrable Securities_ ") as each such Holder may
request in writing; _provided_ , _however_ , that if Atlas Pipeline Partners
has been advised by the Managing Underwriter that the inclusion of Registrable
Securities for sale for the benefit of the Holders will have a material
adverse effect on the price, timing or distribution of the Common Units in
the Underwritten Offering, then the amount of Registrable Securities to be
offered for the accounts of Holders shall be determined based on the
provisions of Section 2.02(b) of this Agreement. The notice required to be
provided in this Section 2.02(a) to Holders shall be provided on a Business
Day pursuant to Section 3.01 hereof and receipt of such notice shall be
confirmed by such Holder. Each such Holder shall then have three Business
Days after receiving such notice to request inclusion of Registrable
Securities in the Underwritten Offering. If no request for inclusion from a
Holder is received within the specified time, such Holder shall have no
further right to participate in such Underwritten Offering. If, at any time
after giving written notice of its intention to undertake an Underwritten
Offering and prior to the closing of such Underwritten Offering, Atlas
Pipeline Partners shall determine for any reason not to undertake or to delay
such Underwritten Offering, Atlas Pipeline Partners may, at its election, give
written notice of such determination to the Selling Holders and, (x) in the
case of a determination not to undertake such Underwritten Offering, shall be
relieved of its obligation to sell any Included Registrable Securities in
connection with such terminated Underwritten Offering, and (y) in the case of
a determination to delay such Underwritten Offering, shall be permitted to
delay offering any Included Registrable Securities for the same period as the
delay in the Underwritten Offering. Any Selling Holder shall have the right to
withdraw such Selling Holders request for inclusion of such Selling Holders
Registrable Securities in such offering by giving written notice to Atlas
Pipeline Partners of such withdrawal up to and including the time of pricing
of such offering. Each Holders rights under this Section 2.02(a) shall
terminate when such Holder (together with any Affiliates of such Holder) holds
less than $15 million, in aggregate, of Registrable Securities, based on the
Unit Price. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Holder may deliver written
notice (an " _Opt Out Notice_ ") to Atlas Pipeline Partners requesting that
such Holder not receive notice from Atlas Pipeline Partners of any proposed
Underwritten Offering; _provided_ , that such Holder may later revoke any
such notice.

(b) _Priority of Rights_. If the Managing Underwriter or Underwriters of any
proposed Underwritten Offering of Common Units included in an Underwritten
Offering involving Included Registrable Securities advises Atlas Pipeline
Partners, or Atlas Pipeline Partners reasonably determines, that the total
amount of Registrable Securities that the Selling Holders and any other
Persons intend to include in such offering exceeds the number that can be sold
in such offering without being likely to have a material adverse effect on the
price, timing or distribution of the Common Units offered or the market for
the Common Units, then the Registrable Securities to be included in such
Underwritten Offering shall include the number of Registrable Securities that
such Managing Underwriter or Underwriters advises Atlas Pipeline Partners, or
Atlas Pipeline Partners reasonably determines, can be sold without having such
adverse effect, with such number to be allocated (i) first, to Atlas Pipeline
Partners, and (ii) second, pro rata among the Selling Holders who have
requested participation in such Underwritten Offering and any other securities
of Atlas Pipeline Partners having rights of registration on parity with the
Registrable Securities (the " _Parity Securities_ "). The pro
rata allocations for each such Selling Holder shall be the product of (a) the
aggregate number of Registrable Securities proposed to be sold by all Selling
Holders in  



 

6  such Underwritten Offering multiplied by (b) the fraction derived by
dividing (x) the number of Registrable Securities owned on the Closing Date
by such Selling Holder by (y) the aggregate number of Registrable Securities
owned on the Closing Date by all Selling Holders and holders of Parity
Securities participating in the Underwritten Offering.

Section 2.03 _Sale Procedures_. In connection with its obligations under this
Article II, Atlas Pipeline Partners will, as expeditiously as possible:

(a) prepare and file with the Commission such amendments and supplements to
the Registration Statement and the prospectus used in connection therewith as
may be necessary to cause the Registration Statement to become effective and
to keep the Registration Statement effective for the Effectiveness Period and
as may be necessary to comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with
respect to the disposition of all securities covered by the Registration
Statement;

(b) furnish to each Selling Holder (i) as far in advance as reasonably
practicable before filing the Registration Statement or any other registration
statement contemplated by this Agreement or any supplement or amendment
thereto, upon request, copies of reasonably complete drafts of all such
documents proposed to be filed (including exhibits and each document
incorporated by reference therein to the extent then required by the rules and
regulations of the Commission), and provide each such Selling Holder
the opportunity to object to any information pertaining to such Selling
Holder and its plan of distribution that is contained therein and make the
corrections reasonably requested by such Selling Holder with respect to such
information prior to filing the Registration Statement or such other
registration statement or supplement or amendment thereto, and (ii) such
number of copies of the Registration Statement or such other registration
statement and the prospectus included therein and any supplements and
amendments thereto as such Persons may reasonably request in order to
facilitate the public sale or other disposition of the Registrable Securities
covered by such Registration Statement or other registration statement;

 

(c) if applicable, use its commercially reasonable efforts to register or
qualify the Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement
or any other registration statement contemplated by this Agreement under the
securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as the Selling Holders or,
in the case of an Underwritten Offering, the Managing Underwriter, shall
reasonably request;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Atlas Pipeline Partners
will not be required to qualify generally to transact business in any
jurisdiction where it is not then required to so qualify or to take any action
which would subject it to general service of process in any such jurisdiction
where it is not then so subject;

(d) promptly notify each Selling Holder, at any time when a prospectus
relating thereto is required to be delivered by any of them under the
Securities Act, of (i) the filing of the Registration Statement or any other
registration statement contemplated by this Agreement or any prospectus to be
used in connection therewith, or any amendment or supplement thereto, and,
with respect to such Registration Statement or any other registration
statement or any post-effective amendment thereto, when the same has become
effective; and (ii) the receipt of any written comments from the Commission
with respect to any filing referred to in clause (i) and any written request
by the Commission for amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement
or any other registration statement or any prospectus or prospectus
supplement thereto;



 

7 (e) immediately notify each Selling Holder, at any time when a prospectus
relating thereto is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, of (i)
the happening of any event as a result of which the prospectus or prospectus
supplement contained in the Registration Statement or any other registration
statement contemplated by this Agreement, as then in effect, includes an
untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading in the light of the circumstances then existing; (ii) the issuance
or express threat of issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending
the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any other registration
statement contemplated by this Agreement, or the initiation of
any proceedings for that purpose; or (iii) the receipt by Atlas Pipeline
Partners of any notification with respect to the suspension of the
qualification of any Registrable Securities for sale under the applicable
securities or blue sky laws of any jurisdiction. Following the provision of
such notice, Atlas Pipeline Partners agrees to as promptly as practicable
amend or supplement the prospectus or take other appropriate action so that
the prospectus does not include an untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances
then existing and to take such other action as is necessary to remove a stop
order, suspension or proceedings related thereto. Each Selling Holder, upon
receipt of notice from Atlas Pipeline Partners of the happening of any event
of the kind described in this Section 2.03(e), shall forthwith discontinue
offers and sales of the Registrable Securities until such Selling Holders
receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated
by this Section 2.03(e) or until it is advised in writing by Atlas Pipeline
Partners that the use of the prospectus may be resumed and has received
copies of any additional or supplemental filings incorporated by reference in
the prospectus, and, if so directed by Atlas Pipeline Partners, such Selling
Holder will deliver to Atlas Pipeline Partners (at Atlas Pipeline Partners
expense) all copies in their possession or control, other than permanent file
copies then in such Selling Holders possession, of the prospectus covering
such Registrable Securities current at the time of receipt of such notice;

(f) upon request and subject to appropriate confidentiality obligations,
furnish to each Selling Holder copies of any and all transmittal letters or
other correspondence with the Commission or any other governmental agency or
self-regulatory body or other body having jurisdiction (including any domestic
or foreign securities exchange) relating to such offering of Registrable
Securities;

(g) otherwise use its commercially reasonable efforts to comply with all
applicable rules and regulations of the Commission, and make available to its
security holders, as soon as reasonably practicable, an earnings statement,
which earnings statement shall satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the
Securities Act and Rule 158 promulgated thereunder;

(h) cause all such Registrable Securities registered pursuant to this
Agreement to be listed on each securities exchange or nationally recognized
quotation system on which similar securities issued by Atlas Pipeline Partners
are then listed;



 

8 (i) use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registrable
Securities to be registered with or approved by such other governmental
agencies or authorities as may be necessary by virtue of the business and
operations of Atlas Pipeline Partners to enable the Selling Holders to
consummate the disposition of such Registrable Securities; 

(j) provide a transfer agent and registrar for all Registrable Securities
covered by such registration statement not later than the effective date of
such registration statement;

(k) enter into customary agreements, take such other actions, and provide
reasonable cooperation and access to management, as are reasonably requested
by the Selling Holders or the underwriters, if any, in order to expedite or
facilitate the disposition of such Registrable Securities;

(l) if requested by a Purchaser: (i) incorporate in a prospectus supplement or
post-effective amendment such information as such Purchaser reasonably
requests to be included therein relating to the sale and distribution of
Registrable Securities, including information with respect to the number of
Registrable Securities being offered or sold, the purchase price being paid
therefor and any other terms of the offering of the Registrable Securities to
be sold in such offering; (ii) make all required filings of such prospectus
supplement or post-effective amendment after being notified of the matters to
be incorporated in such prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment;
and (iii) supplement or make amendments to any Registration Statement; and

(m) include in the plan of distribution section of a registration statement
the following language with respect to the selling unitholders:

"The selling unitholders may enter into derivative transactions with third
parties, or sell securities not covered by this prospectus to third parties in
privately negotiated transactions. If the applicable prospectus
supplement indicates, in connection with those derivatives, the third parties
may sell securities covered by this prospectus and the applicable prospectus
supplement, including in short sale transactions. If so, the third party may
use securities pledged by the selling unitholders or borrowed from the
selling unitholders or others to settle those sales or to close out any
related open borrowings of Units, and may use securities received from the
selling unitholders in settlement of those derivatives to close out any
related open borrowings of Units."

(n) if the Purchasers are deemed to be "underwriters," as defined in Section
2(a)(11) of the Securities Act, in connection with the registration statement
in respect of any registration of Registrable Securities pursuant to this
Agreement, and any amendment or supplement thereof, then for a period of two
years following the Closing Date, Atlas Pipeline Partners will cooperate with
the Purchasers in allowing the Purchasers to conduct customary "underwriters
due diligence" with respect to Atlas Pipeline Partners and  



 

9  satisfy their obligations in respect thereof. In addition, for a period of
one year following the Closing Date at the request of a Purchaser seeking to
offer or sell Registrable Securities, Atlas Pipeline Partners will furnish to
such Purchaser, on the date of the effectiveness of any Registration Statement
covering the sale of such Purchasers Registrable Securities and thereafter no
more often than on a quarterly basis, (i) a letter, dated such date, from
Atlas Pipeline Partners independent certified public accountants in form and
substance as is customarily given by independent certified public accountants
to underwriters in an underwritten public offering, addressed to such
Purchaser, (ii) an opinion, dated as of such date, of counsel representing
Atlas Pipeline Partners in form, scope and substance as is customarily given
in an underwritten public offering, including a standard "10b-5" opinion for
such offering, addressed to such Purchaser and (iii) a standard officers
certificate from the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of
Atlas Pipeline Partners addressed to such Purchaser. Atlas Pipeline Partners
will also permit one legal counsel to such Purchaser(s) to review and comment
upon any such Registration Statement at least five Business Days prior to its
filing with the Commission and all amendments and supplements to any such
Registration Statement within a reasonable number of days prior to their
filing with the Commission and not file any such Registration Statement or
amendment or supplement thereto in a form to which such Purchasers legal
counsel reasonably objects.

Section 2.04 _Cooperation by Holders_. Atlas Pipeline Partners shall have no
obligation to include in the Registration Statement Registrable Securities of
a Holder, or in an Underwritten Offering pursuant to Section 2.02 Registrable
Securities of a Selling Holder, who has failed to timely furnish such
information that Atlas Pipeline Partners determines, after consultation with
counsel, is reasonably required to be furnished or confirmed in order for the
registration statement or prospectus supplement, as applicable, to comply with
the Securities Act.

Section 2.05 _Restrictions on Public Sale by Holders of Registrable
Securities_. For a period of 365 days from the Closing Date, each Holder
of Registrable Securities agrees not to effect any public sale or
distribution of the Registrable Securities for a period of up to 30 days
following completion of an Underwritten Offering of equity securities by Atlas
Pipeline Partners (except as provided in this Section 2.05); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the duration of the foregoing restrictions shall be no longer
than the duration of the shortest restriction generally imposed by the
underwriters on the executive officers or directors of Atlas Pipeline
Partners on whom a restriction is imposed in connection with such public
offering. In addition, the provisions of this Section 2.05 shall not apply
with respect to a Holder that (A) owns less than $15 million, in aggregate,
of Registrable Securities based on the Unit Price or (B) has delivered an Opt
Out Notice to Atlas Pipeline Partners pursuant to Section 2.02(a) hereof;
_provided_ , _further_ , the above shall not apply, in the case of a
Purchaser that is a large multi-unit investment or commercial banking
organization, to activities in the normal course of trading units of such
Purchaser other than the Participating Unit, so long as such other units are
not acting on behalf of the Participating Unit and have not been provided
with confidential information regarding Atlas Pipeline Partners by the
Participating Unit.

Section 2.06 _Expenses_.

(a) _Certain Definitions_. " _Registration Expenses_ " means all expenses
incident to Atlas Pipeline Partners performance under or compliance with this
Agreement to effect the registration of Registrable Securities on the
Registration Statement pursuant to  



 

10  Section 2.01 hereof or an Underwritten Offering covered under this
Agreement, and the disposition of such securities, including, without
limitation, all registration, filing, securities exchange listing and The New
York Stock Exchange fees, all registration, filing, qualification and other
fees and expenses of complying with securities or blue sky laws, fees of the
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., transfer taxes and fees of
transfer agents and registrars, all word processing, duplicating and printing
expenses and the fees and disbursements of one counsel to the Holders and the
independent public accountants for Atlas Pipeline Partners, including the
expenses of any special audits or "cold comfort" letters required by or
incident to such performance and compliance. " _Selling Expenses_ " means all
underwriting fees, discounts and selling commissions allocable to the sale of
the Registrable Securities.

(b) _Expenses_. Atlas Pipeline Partners will pay all reasonable Registration
Expenses as determined in good faith, including, in the case of an
Underwritten Offering, whether or not any sale is made pursuant to such
Underwritten Offering. In addition, except as otherwise provided in Section
2.07 hereof, Atlas Pipeline Partners shall not be responsible for legal fees
incurred by Holders in connection with the exercise of such Holders rights
hereunder. Each Selling Holder shall pay its pro rata share of all Selling
Expenses in connection with any sale of its Registrable Securities hereunder.

Section 2.07 _Indemnification_.

(a) _By Atlas Pipeline Partners_. In the event of an offering of any
Registrable Securities under the Securities Act pursuant to this
Agreement, Atlas Pipeline Partners will indemnify and hold harmless each
Selling Holder thereunder, its Affiliates that own Registrable Securities and
their respective directors and officers, and each underwriter, pursuant to the
applicable underwriting agreement with such underwriter, of Registrable
Securities thereunder and each Person, if any, who controls such Selling
Holder or underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act, and its directors and officers (collectively, the " _Selling
Holder Indemnified Persons_ "), against any losses, claims, damages, expenses
or liabilities (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses)
(collectively, " _Losses_ "), joint or several, to which such Selling Holder
Indemnified Person may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange
Act or otherwise, insofar as such Losses (or actions or proceedings, whether
commenced or threatened, in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon
any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact
contained in the Registration Statement or any other registration statement
contemplated by this Agreement, any preliminary prospectus, free writing
prospectus or final prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or
supplement thereof, arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged
omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of a prospectus, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading or arise
out of or are based upon a Selling Holder being deemed to be an "underwriter,"
as defined in Section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act, in connection with the
registration statement in respect of any registration of Atlas Pipeline
Partners securities, and will reimburse each such Selling Holder Indemnified
Person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in
connection with investigating or defending any such Loss or actions or
proceedings; _provided_ , _however_ , that Atlas Pipeline Partners will not be
liable in any such case if and to the extent that any such Loss arises out of
or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission
or alleged  



 

11  omission so made in strict conformity with information furnished by such
Selling Holder Indemnified Person in writing specifically for use in
the Registration Statement or such other registration statement, or
prospectus supplement, as applicable. Such indemnity shall remain in full
force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of such
Selling Holder or any such Selling Holder, its directors or officers or any
underwriter or controlling Person, and shall survive the transfer of such
securities by such Selling Holder.

(b) _By Each Selling Holder_. Each Selling Holder agrees severally and not
jointly to indemnify and hold harmless Atlas Pipeline Partners, its directors
and officers, and each Person, if any, who controls Atlas Pipeline Partners
within the meaning of the Securities Act or of the Exchange Act, and its
directors and officers, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from
Atlas Pipeline Partners to the Selling Holders, but only with respect
to information regarding such Selling Holder furnished in writing by or on
behalf of such Selling Holder expressly for inclusion in the Registration
Statement or any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus included therein,
or any amendment or supplement thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
liability of each Selling Holder shall not be greater in amount than the
dollar amount of the proceeds (net of any Selling Expenses) received by such
Selling Holder from the sale of the Registrable Securities giving rise to
such indemnification.

(c) _Notice_. Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party hereunder of
notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a
claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party
hereunder, notify the indemnifying party in writing thereof, but the omission
so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability
which it may have to any indemnified party other than under this Section 2.07.
In any action brought against any indemnified party, it shall notify the
indemnifying party of the commencement thereof. The indemnifying party shall
be entitled to participate in and, to the extent it shall wish, to assume and
undertake the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such
indemnified party and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such
indemnified party of its election so to assume and undertake the defense
thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party
under this Section 2.07 for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by such
indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable
costs of investigation and of liaison with counsel so selected; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, (i) if the indemnifying party has failed to assume the
defense or employ counsel reasonably acceptable to the indemnified party or
(ii) if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party
and the indemnifying party and counsel to the indemnified party shall have
concluded that there may be reasonable defenses available to the indemnified
party that are different from or additional to those available to the
indemnifying party, or if the interests of the indemnified party reasonably
may be deemed to conflict with the interests of the indemnifying party, then
the indemnified party shall have the right to select a separate counsel and to
assume such legal defense and otherwise to participate in the defense of such
action, with the reasonable expenses and fees of such separate counsel and
other reasonable expenses related to such participation to be reimbursed by
the indemnifying party as incurred. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, no indemnifying party shall settle any action brought against
an indemnified party with respect to which the indemnified party is entitled
to indemnification hereunder without the consent of the indemnified party,
unless the settlement thereof imposes no liability or obligation on, and
includes a complete and unconditional release from all liability of, the
indemnified party.



 

12 (d) _Contribution_. If the indemnification provided for in this Section 2.07
is held by a court or government agency of competent jurisdiction to be
unavailable to any indemnified party or is insufficient to hold them harmless
in respect of any Losses, then each such indemnifying party, in lieu of
indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or
payable by such indemnified party as a result of such Loss in such proportion
as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on
the one hand and of such indemnified party on the other in connection with
the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses, as well as any
other relevant equitable considerations; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no
event shall such Selling Holder be required to contribute an aggregate amount
in excess of the dollar amount of proceeds (net of Selling Expenses) received
by such Selling Holder from the sale of Registrable Securities giving rise to
such indemnification. The relative fault of the indemnifying party on the
one hand and the indemnified party on the other shall be determined by
reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a
material fact has been made by, or relates to, information supplied by such
party, and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The parties
hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions
pursuant to this paragraph were to be determined by pro rata allocation or by
any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable
considerations referred to herein. The amount paid by an indemnified party as
a result of the Losses referred to in the first sentence of this paragraph
shall be deemed to include any legal and other expenses reasonably incurred by
such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any Loss
which is the subject of this paragraph. No person guilty of fraudulent
misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act)
shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who is not guilty of
such fraudulent misrepresentation.

(e) _Other Indemnification_. The provisions of this Section 2.07 shall be in
addition to any other rights to indemnification or contribution which an
indemnified party may have pursuant to law, equity, contract or otherwise.

Section 2.08 _Rule 144 Reporting_. With a view to making available the
benefits of certain rules and regulations of the Commission that may permit
the sale of the Registrable Securities to the public without registration,
Atlas Pipeline Partners agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to:

(a) make and keep public information regarding Atlas Pipeline Partners
available, as those terms are understood and defined in Rule 144 under the
Securities Act, at all times from and after the date hereof;

(b) file with the Commission in a timely manner all reports and other
documents required of Atlas Pipeline Partners under the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act at all times from and after the date hereof; and

(c) so long as a Holder owns any Registrable Securities, furnish, unless
otherwise not available at no charge by access electronically to
the Commissions EDGAR filing system, to such Holder forthwith upon request a
copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of Atlas Pipeline Partners,
and such other reports and documents so filed as such Holder may reasonably
request in availing itself of any rule or regulation of the Commission
allowing such Holder to sell any such securities without registration.



 

13 Section 2.09 _Transfer or Assignment of Registration Rights_. The rights to
cause Atlas Pipeline Partners to register Registrable Securities granted to
the Purchasers by Atlas Pipeline Partners under this Article II may be
transferred or assigned by any Purchaser to one or more transferee(s) or
assignee(s) of such Registrable Securities or by total return swap;
_provided, however_ , that, except with respect to a total return swap, (a)
unless such transferee is an Affiliate of such Purchaser or another Purchaser,
each such transferee or assignee holds Registrable Securities in the amount
of $15 million, based on the Unit Price, (b) Atlas Pipeline Partners is given
written notice prior to any said transfer or assignment, stating the name and
address of each such transferee and identifying the securities with respect
to which such registration rights are being transferred or assigned, and (c)
each such transferee assumes in writing responsibility for its portion of the
obligations of such Purchaser under this Agreement.

 

Section 2.10 _Limitation on Subsequent Registration Rights_. From and after
the date hereof, Atlas Pipeline Partners shall not, without the prior written
consent of the Holders of Registrable Securities, (i) enter into any agreement
with any current or future holder of any securities of Atlas Pipeline Partners
that would allow such current or future holder to require Atlas
Pipeline Partners to include securities in any registration statement filed
by Atlas Pipeline Partners on a basis that is superior in any way to the
piggyback rights granted to the Purchasers hereunder or (ii) grant
registration rights to any other Person that would be superior to the
Purchasers registration rights hereunder.

Section 3.06 _Specific Performance_. Damages in the event of breach of this
Agreement by a party hereto may be difficult, if not impossible, to
ascertain, and it is therefore agreed that each such Person, in addition to
and without limiting any other remedy or right it may have, will have the
right to an injunction or other equitable relief in any court of competent
jurisdiction, enjoining any such breach, and enforcing specifically the terms
and provisions hereof, and each of the parties hereto hereby waives any and
all defenses it may have on the ground of lack of jurisdiction or competence

other rights and remedies at law or in equity which such Person may have.

of _ _, 2007, is entered into and effectuated by Atlas
Pipeline Partners GP, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the "
_General Partner_ ") and the general partner of Atlas Pipeline Partners, L.P.,
a Delaware limited partnership (the " _Partnership_ "), pursuant to authority
granted to it in Sections 5.6 and 13.1 of the Second Amended and Restated
Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Partnership, dated as of March 9,
2004, as amended (the " _Limited Partnership Agreement_ "). Capitalized terms
used but not defined herein are used as defined in the Limited Partnership
Agreement.

WHEREAS, Section 13.1(d) of the Limited Partnership Agreement provides that
the General Partner, without the approval of any Partner or Assignee, may
amend any provision of the Limited Partnership Agreement to reflect a change
that, in the discretion of the General Partner, does not adversely affect the
Limited Partners in any material respect, and the General Partner has
determined that the amendments contemplated hereby do not adversely affect the
Limited Partners in any material respect;

WHEREAS, Section 13.1(j) of the Limited Partnership Agreement provides that
the General Partner, without the approval of any Partner or Assignee, may
amend any provision of the Limited Partnership Agreement that, in the
discretion of the General Partner, is necessary or advisable to reflect,
account for and deal with appropriately the formation by the Partnership of,
or investment by the Partnership in, any corporation, partnership, joint
venture, limited liability company or other entity, in connection with the
conduct by the Partnership of its business, and the General Partner has
determined that the amendments contemplated hereby are necessary or advisable
in connection therewith; and

WHEREAS, the General Partner deems it in the best interest of the Partnership
to effect this Amendment.

NOW, THEREFORE, it is hereby agreed as follows:

A. _Amendment_. The Limited Partnership Agreement is hereby amended as
follows:

1\. Section 1.1 of the Limited Partnership Agreement is hereby amended to add
or amend or restate the following definitions in appropriate alphabetical
order: "Available Cash" means, with respect to any Quarter ending prior to
the Liquidation Date,

(a) the sum of (i) all cash and cash equivalents of the Partnership Group on
hand at the end of such Quarter, and (ii) all additional cash and cash
equivalents of the Partnership Group on hand on the date of determination of
Available Cash with respect to such Quarter resulting from Working Capital
Borrowings made subsequent to the end of such Quarter, less

(b) the amount of any cash reserves that is necessary or appropriate in the
reasonable discretion of the General Partner to (i) provide for the proper
conduct of the business of the Partnership Group (including reserves for
future capital expenditures and for anticipated future credit needs of the
Partnership Group) subsequent to such Quarter, (ii) comply with applicable
law or any loan agreement, security agreement, mortgage, debt instrument or
other agreement or obligation to which any Group Member is a party or by which
it is bound or its assets are subject or (iii) provide funds for
distributions under Section 6.4 or 6.5 in respect of any one or more of the
next four Quarters; provided, however, that the General Partner may not
establish cash reserves pursuant to (iii) above if the effect of such
reserves would be that the Partnership is unable to distribute the Minimum
Quarterly Distribution on all Common Units, plus any Cumulative Common Unit
Arrearage on all Common Units, with respect to such Quarter; and, provided
further, that disbursements made by a Group Member or cash reserves
established, increased or reduced after the end of such Quarter but on or
before the date of determination of Available Cash with respect to such
Quarter shall be deemed to have been made, established, increased or reduced,
for purposes of determining Available Cash, within such Quarter if the General
Partner so determines, plus

(c) the Permitted Western Gas Resources Distributions.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, "Available Cash" with respect to the Quarter
in which the Liquidation Date occurs and any subsequent Quarter shall equal
zero.

"Permitted Western Gas Resources Distributions" means (a) those distributions
and payments to the Class A Member of Atlas Pipeline Mid-Continent WestOk, LLC
that are made pursuant to the Operating Agreement of Atlas Pipeline Mid-
Continent WestOk, LLC dated as of [INSERT CLOSING DATE], 2007, as it may be
amended, supplemented or restated from time to time, and (b) those
distributions and payments to the Class A Member of Atlas Pipeline Mid-
Continent WestTex, LLC that are made pursuant to the Operating Agreement of
Atlas Pipeline Mid-Continent WestTex, LLC dated as of [INSERT CLOSING DATE],
2007, as it may be amended, supplemented or restated from time to time.

2\. Section 6.3(a) of the Limited Partnership Agreement is hereby amended and
restated as follows:



 

2 Within 45 days following the end of each Quarter commencing with the Quarter
ending on March 31, 2000, an amount equal to 100% of Available Cash less the
Permitted Western Gas Resources Distributions with respect to such Quarter
shall, subject to Section 17-607 of the Delaware Act, be distributed in
accordance with this Article VI by the Partnership to the Partners as of the
Record Date selected by the General Partner in its reasonable discretion.
Available Cash constituting the Permitted Western Gas Resources Distributions
shall be distributed as provided in the definition thereof. All amounts of
Available Cash distributed by the Partnership on any date from any source
shall be deemed to be Operating Surplus until the sum of all amounts of
Available Cash theretofore distributed by the Partnership pursuant to Section
6.4 equals the Operating Surplus from the Initial Closing Date through the
close of the immediately preceding Quarter. Any remaining amounts of Available
Cash distributed by the Partnership or pursuant to the Permitted Western Gas
Resources Distributions on such date shall, except as otherwise provided in
Section 6.5, be deemed to be "Capital Surplus." All distributions required to
be made under this Agreement shall be made subject to Section 17-607 of the
Delaware Act.

3\. Section 6.4(b) of the Limited Partnership Agreement is hereby amended and
restated as follows:

(b) _After Subordination Period_. Available Cash (less the Permitted Western
Gas Resources Distributions) with respect to any Quarter after
the Subordination Period that is deemed to be Operating Surplus pursuant to
the provisions of Section 6.3 or 6.5, subject to Section 17-607 of the
Delaware Act, shall be distributed as follows, except as otherwise required
by Section 5.6(b) in respect of additional Partnership Securities issued
pursuant thereto:

(i) First, 98.9899% to the Unitholders holding Common Units, Pro Rata, and
1.0101% to the General Partner until there has been distributed in respect of
each Common Unit then Outstanding an amount equal to the Minimum Quarterly
Distribution for such Quarter;

(ii) Second, 98.9899% to the Unitholders holding Common Units, Pro Rata, and
1.0101% to the General Partner until there has been distributed in respect of
each Common Unit then Outstanding an amount equal to the Cumulative Common
Unit Arrearage existing with respect to such Quarter;

(iii) Third, 85% to all Unitholders, Pro Rata, 13.9899% to the holders of the
Incentive Distribution Rights, Pro Rata, and 1.0101% to the General Partner
until there has been distributed in respect of each Unit then Outstanding an
amount equal to the excess of the First Target Distribution over the Minimum
Quarterly Distribution for such Quarter;

(iv) Fourth, 75% to all Unitholders, Pro Rata, 23.9899% to the holders of the
Incentive Distribution Rights, Pro Rata, and 1.0101% to the General Partner

Target Distribution for such Quarter; and



 

3 (v) Thereafter, 50% to all Unitholders, Pro Rata, 48.9899% to the holders of

pursuant to the second sentence of Section 6.6(a), the distribution of
Available Cash that is deemed to be Operating Surplus with respect to any
Quarter will be made solely in accordance with Section 6.4(b)(v) and the
Permitted Western Gas Resources Distributions.

4\. Article VI of the Limited Partnership Agreement is hereby amended to add
a new Section 6.4(c) as follows:

(c) _Special Subordination after the Quarter Ended June 30, 2007_.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.4(b), amounts distributable to the
holders of Incentive Distribution Rights shall be subject to reduction as
follows:



     | (i) | For each Quarter from the Quarter beginning July 1, 2007
until the Quarter ending December 31, 2007, after the holders of the Incentive
Distribution Rights have received an aggregate of $3.7 million with respect
to such Incentive Distribution Rights, they shall not be entitled to further
distributions with respect to such Incentive Distribution Rights until the
amount distributable pursuant to Section 6.4(b), but for the application of
this subparagraph to the holders of the Incentive Distribution Rights, would
have been $8.7 million. Any amounts not distributed to the holders of
Incentive Distribution Rights because of the operation of this

Rights because of the operation of this subparagraph shall be distributed
