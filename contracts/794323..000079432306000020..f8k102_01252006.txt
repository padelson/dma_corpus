         FORM OF REGISTRATION RIGHTS AND TRANSFER RESTRICTION AGREEMENT

     This AGREEMENT  (this  "Agreement"),  dated as of [ ], 2006,  among Level 3
Communications,  Inc., a Delaware  corporation  ("Company"),  PT Holding Company
LLC,   a   Delaware   limited    liability    Company    ("Seller"),    Progress
Telecommunications  Corporation, a Florida corporation ("PTC"), Caronet, Inc., a
North Carolina corporation ("Caronet") and EPIK Communications  Incorporated,  a
Delaware  corporation  ("EPIK" and together  with PTC and  Caronet,  the "Seller
Owners").

                              W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS,  Company,  Seller  and the  Seller  Owners  are  parties  to a Purchase
Agreement, dated as of January 25, 2006 (the "Purchase Agreement"),  pursuant to
which  Company will  acquire  from the Seller all of the issued and  outstanding
membership  units  ("Units")  of  Progress  Telecom,  LLC,  a  Delaware  limited
liability company (the "Acquisition");

     WHEREAS,  in  connection  with the  Acquisition,  Seller  will  receive  an
aggregate of [ ] shares (such shares,  the "Shares") of common stock,  par value
$.01 per share of Company ("Company Common Stock");

     WHEREAS,  it is a condition to consummation of the Acquisition that Company
enter  into this  Agreement  providing  for the  registration  of the  shares of
Company Common Stock to be received by Seller in the Acquisition; and

     WHEREAS,  the  Company  is  willing  to  prepare  and  file a  registration
statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  "Securities  Act"),
with the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (the "SEC") with respect to the
Shares and to maintain the  effectiveness of such registration  statement,  upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein;

     NOW  THEREFORE,  in  consideration  of the  foregoing  and  the  respective
covenants and  agreements  hereinafter  contained,  the parties  hereby agree as
follows:

     SECTION 1. Definitions.  All terms used in this Agreement which are defined
in the  Purchase  Agreement  shall have the  meanings  specified in the Purchase
Agreement unless the context otherwise requires.

     SECTION 2.  Registration  of the Shares.  The Company shall on the later of
five (5) business days  following,  (i) the  consummation of the Acquisition and
(ii) March 1, 2006, file with the SEC a shelf registration statement relating to
the offer and sale by Seller and the Seller  Owners at any time and from time to
time on a delayed  or  continuous  basis in  accordance  with Rule 415 under the
Securities  Act and in accordance  with this  Agreement,  of all the Shares (the
"Registration Statement").  The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
have the Registration  Statement  declared  effective as promptly as practicable
(with such date on which the Registration  Statement becomes effective  referred
to  as  the  "Effective  Date"),   including  but  not  limited  to  filing  the
Registration  Statement as an automatic shelf registration statement pursuant to
Rule 462(e)  under the  Securities  Act, if  available.  Promptly  upon  receipt
thereof,  Company  shall  deliver to Seller and the Seller  Owners a copy of the
order of the SEC declaring the  Registration  Statement  effective and a copy of
such Registration  Statement and any


<PAGE>

amendments thereto together with an opinion of counsel  representing the Company
for  the  purposes  of  such  Registration,  in form  and  substance  reasonably
acceptable  to Seller and the  Seller  Owners,  addressed  to the Seller and the
Seller  Owners,  including,   confirming  that  the  Registration  Statement  is
effective and that all of the Shares have been duly registered  and,  subject to
the transfer restrictions  contained in this Agreement,  are freely transferable
and that all of the shares have been  admitted  for listing on the NASDAQ  Stock
Market.

     SECTION 3. Maintenance of Registration Statement and Prospectuses.

     (a) The  Company  shall  use  its  reasonable  best  efforts  to  keep  the
Registration  Statement  and the  prospectus  contained  therein  (as amended or
supplemented  from time to time,  the  "Prospectuses"  and each a  "Prospectus")
continuously  effective  until the Termination  Date (as defined below).  In the
event the Registration  Statement cannot be kept effective for such period,  the
Company shall,  use its reasonable best efforts to prepare and file with the SEC
and have  declared  effective as promptly as  practicable  another  registration
statement on the same terms and conditions as the initial Registration Statement
and such registration  statement shall be considered the Registration  Statement
for purposes hereof.  The Company shall furnish to Seller and Seller Owners such
number of copies of a Prospectus in conformity with the requirements of the Act,
and an electronic  copy of the Prospectus to facilitate  the  disposition of the
Shares owned by the Seller and Seller Owners.

     (b) The  Company  shall  advise  Seller and the Seller  Owners  promptly in
writing  when  the  Registration  Statement,  or  any  post-effective  amendment
thereto, has been declared effective by the SEC. The Company shall advise Seller
and the Seller Owners in writing of the receipt by the Company of any stop order
from the SEC suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement,  and if
at any time there  shall be a stop order  suspending  the  effectiveness  of the
Registration  Statement,  the Company shall use its  reasonable  best efforts to
obtain  promptly the  withdrawal of such order.  The Company shall advise Seller
and the Seller  Owners  promptly in writing of the existence of any fact and the
happening of any event that makes any  statement of a material  fact made in the
Registration  Statement or Prospectus untrue, or that requires the making of any
additions to or changes in the Registration  Statement or Prospectus in order to
make the  statements  therein not misleading and in such event the Company shall
prepare and file with the SEC, as soon as reasonably  practicable,  an amendment
to such Registration  Statement or an amendment or supplement to such Prospectus
so that, as so amended or  supplemented,  such  Registration  Statement and such
Prospectus  will not contain an untrue  statement of a material  fact or omit to
state a material  fact  required to be stated  therein or  necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances then existing, not misleading.
Upon receipt of such written advice,  each of Seller and the Seller Owners shall
discontinue and refrain from making any sales of Shares,  until such time as the
Company advises Seller and the Seller Owners that such Registration Statement or
such Prospectus no longer contains an untrue statement or omission of a material
fact.

     (c) Each of Seller and the Seller  Owners shall furnish to the Company such
information  regarding  such  party and the  distribution  of the  Shares as the
Company may from time to time  reasonably  request in writing in order to comply
with the  Securities  Act. Each of Seller and the Seller Owners shall notify the
Company as promptly as  practicable  of any  inaccuracy or change in information
previously  furnished  by such party to the Company or of the

                                       2
<PAGE>

happening  of any  event in  either  case as a result  of which  any  Prospectus
relating  to the  Registration  Statement  contains  an  untrue  statement  of a
material fact regarding such party or the distribution of such Shares,  or omits
to state any material  fact  regarding  such party or the  distribution  of such
Shares required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not  misleading  in light of the  circumstances  then  existing,  and to furnish
promptly to the Company any additional information required to correct or update
any previously  furnished  information or required so that such Prospectus shall
not contain,  with respect to such party or the  distribution  of such Shares an
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements  therein not misleading in
light of the circumstances then existing.

     (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, for a period
not to  exceed  forty-five  (45)  consecutive  calendar  days and not to  exceed
seventy (70) aggregate  calendar days in any twelve-month  period (each a "Black
Out  Period"),  the  Company  will  not be  required  to file  any  registration
statement pursuant to this Agreement,  file any amendment  thereto,  furnish any
supplement to a prospectus included in a registration statement pursuant to this
Agreement,  make  any  other  filing  with  the SEC  required  pursuant  to this
Agreement,  cause any  registration  statement  or other  filing with the SEC to
become effective, or take any similar action, and any and all sales of Shares by
Seller and the Seller  Owners  pursuant to an effective  registration  statement
shall be  suspended:  (i) if an event has occurred and is continuing as a result
of which any such  registration  statement or prospectus would, in the Company's
good faith judgment,  contain an untrue  statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material  fact  required to be stated  therein or  necessary to make the
statements  therein not misleading,  (ii) if the Company notifies Seller and the
Seller Owners that such actions  would,  in the Company's  good faith  judgment,
require the  disclosure of material  non-public  information  which the Board of
Directors of the Company has  determined  would be seriously  detrimental to the
Company to disclose  and which the Company  would not  otherwise  be required to
disclose or (iii) if the Company  notifies Seller and the Seller Owners that, in
the Company's good faith judgment, it is necessary to suspend sales of Shares by
Seller and the Seller Owners, to facilitate a pending or proposed public or Rule
144A offering by the Company of Company Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents
(as defined below),  provided,  however, that any such suspension of sales shall
be  not  longer  than  twenty-one  (21)  consecutive  calendar  days.  Upon  the
termination  of the condition  described in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of above,
the Company shall  promptly give written  notice to Seller and the Seller Owners
and shall promptly file any registration statement or amendment thereto required
to be filed by it pursuant to this Agreement,  furnish any prospectus supplement
or amendment required to be furnished pursuant to this Agreement, make any other
filing with the SEC required of it or terminate  any  suspension of sales it has
put into effect and shall take such other actions to permit  registered sales of
Shares as  contemplated  by this  Agreement.  For  purposes  of this  Agreement,
"Common Stock Equivalents" shall mean any rights, warrants, options, convertible
securities or indebtedness,  exchangeable  securities or indebtedness,  or other
rights,  exercisable  for or  convertible  or  exchangeable  into,  directly  or
indirectly, Company Common Stock and securities convertible or exchangeable into
Company  Common  Stock,  whether at the time of  issuance or upon the passage of
time or the occurrence of any future event.

                                       3
<PAGE>

     (e) Company shall take all actions  necessary to execute such documents and
cause all of the Shares to be admitted for listing on the NASDAQ  Stock  Market,
which listing shall be effective on the Effective Date.

     SECTION 4.  Restrictions  on Transfer.  On or prior to the Effective  Date,
none of Seller or the Seller  Owners  shall,  nor shall they permit any of their
Affiliates  to sell,  contract to sell,  pledge,  grant any option to  purchase,
acquire any option to sell,  hypothecate,  loan,  make a short sale or otherwise
transfer to any Person or dispose of (each a  "Transfer")  any shares of Company
Common  Stock.  For a period  of 180 days  following  the  Effective  Date  (the
"Transfer Period"), Seller and the Seller Owners shall not, and shall not permit
any of their  Affiliates  to,  Transfer  in the  aggregate  on any  given day (a
"Transfer  Date") such number of shares of Company Common Stock that exceeds (i)
the product of (x) [Number  equal to 20% of the Company's  average daily trading
volume during the 30-day trading period  immediately  preceding the Closing]/1/
shares of Company  Common Stock and (y) the number of trading days in the period
from and including  the  Effective  Date to and including the Transfer Date less
(ii) the  aggregate  number of shares of Company  Common  Stock  Transferred  by
Seller,  the Seller Owners and any of their  Affiliates in accordance  with this
section  during  the  period  from and  including  the  Effective  Date to,  but
excluding,  the Transfer  Date;  provided,  however,  that Seller and the Seller
Owners shall not,  and shall not permit any of their  Affiliates  to,  Transfer,
whether directly or indirectly,  more than [Number equal to 60% of the Company's
average  daily  trading  volume  during the 30-day  trading  period  immediately
preceding the  Closing]/2/  shares of Company  Common Stock on any such Transfer
Date, and provided, further, that in determining the maximum number of shares of
Company Common Stock that may be  Transferred in any one day as provided  above,
any Transfers permitted by the succeeding sentence shall not be included in such
calculation.  Notwithstanding  anything  herein to the  contrary,  the  transfer
restriction  set forth in this  section  shall not apply to: (1) any Transfer of
shares of Company Common Stock by Seller to either of the Seller Owners; (2) any
Transfer to holders of membership  units in Seller other than the Seller Owners,
provided,  however,  that such  holders  shall agree with the Company in writing
prior to such Transfer to be bound by the terms of this  Agreement;  and (3) any
Transfer  of all or part of the  Shares to one or more  persons  (a  "Negotiated
Transaction"),  provided,  however, that such person or persons shall agree with
the Company in writing  prior to such  Transfer to be bound by the terms of this
Agreement  and  provided  further  that the maximum  number of shares of Company
Common Stock that may be sold by all such  persons,  together with Seller Owners
and  Affiliates,  shall not exceed in the aggregate the maximum number of shares
of Company Common Stock that may be sold as provided  above.  In addition to the
foregoing,  (i) at any time after the Effective Date and prior to June 30, 2006,
Seller  and the  Seller  Owners  shall  not,  and shall not  permit any of their
Affiliates  to knowingly  make any direct  Transfer in a Negotiated  Transaction
that would result in the acquirer holding economic or voting ownership in excess
of five percent (5%) or more of Company  Common Stock and (ii) at any time after
the Effective Date,  Seller and the Seller Owners shall not knowingly (after due
inquiry  of the  transferee)  and  shall  not  knowingly  permit  any  of  their
Affiliates to knowingly  (after due inquiry of the  transferee)  make any direct
Transfer in a Negotiated  Transaction  that would result in the acquirer holding
economic or voting  ownership in excess of ten percent  (10%) or more of Company
Common Stock.  For purposes of this Section 4, neither  Seller nor

                                       4
<PAGE>

Seller  Owners shall be deemed to have made a transfer  that would result in the
acquirer  holding economic or voting ownership in excess of five percent (5%) or
ten percent  (10%) of Company  Common  Stock as provided in clauses (i) and (ii)
above,  if such  transfer  is made in an open  market  broker  sale  transaction
without  knowledge  of the  identity  of the  acquiror  at the  time of the sale
transaction by Seller or Seller Owners.

     Seller and Seller Owners (and any  subsequent  transferee  who agrees to be
bound by the terms of this Section 4) agree that within five business days after
the  consummation  of  any  Transfer   referred  to  in  this  Section  4,  such
transferring party shall deliver  documentation to the Purchaser that identifies
the transferee, the number of shares of Company Common Stock transferred and the
date of such Transfer.

     SECTION 5. Blue Sky. In connection  with the  registration  under Section 2
hereof,  the Company  shall take all actions  necessary  to permit the resale by
Seller and the Seller Owners of any Company Common Stock under the blue sky laws
of the several states, except that the Company shall not for any such purpose be
required to qualify  generally  to do business as a foreign  corporation  in any
jurisdiction  wherein it would not but for the requirements of this Section 5 be
obligated  to  be  so  qualified,   subject  itself  to  taxation  in  any  such
jurisdiction   or  to  consent  to  general  service  of  process  in  any  such
jurisdiction.

     SECTION 6. Expenses.  All expenses incident to the Company's performance of
or  compliance  with this  Agreement  will be borne by the  Company,  including,
without  limitation,  all: (i) registration  and filing fees and expenses;  (ii)
expenses of printing;  (iii) fees and  expenses of counsel for the Company;  and
(iv) fees and  expenses of one counsel for Seller and Seller  Owners,  provided,
however,  such fees  pursuant  to this  clause  (iv)  shall not  exceed  $5,000.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be liable for and shall not
pay any  expenses  or fees of more than one  counsel  for  Seller or the  Seller
Owners or any  commissions to be paid in connection  with any sale of the Shares
by Seller or the Seller Owners.

     SECTION 7.  Termination.  The  obligations of the Company  hereunder,  with
respect to the Shares, shall terminate upon the earlier of (i) the date on which
all Shares covered by the Registration Statement have been disposed of by Seller
and the Seller Owners and (ii) the second  anniversary of the  Acquisition.  The
date on which such  obligations  shall  terminate  shall be  referred  to as the
"Termination Date."

     SECTION 8. Indemnification.

     (a) The Company will, and does hereby agree to, indemnify and hold harmless
each of Seller and the Seller  Owners,  and each of their  directors,  officers,
employees and agents and each person  controlling  Seller or a Seller Owner with
respect to any  registration  effected  pursuant to this  Agreement  against all
claims,  losses,  damages,  and  liabilities  (or  actions in  respect  thereto)
including  any  of the  foregoing  incurred  in  settlement  of any  litigation,
commenced  or  threatened,  to which  Seller  and the  Seller  Owners may become
subject  under the  Securities  Act,  the  Securities  Exchange Act of 1934 (the
"Exchange  Act"), or other federal or state law insofar as such claims,  losses,
damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereto) arise out of or are based
on any untrue  statement  (or  alleged  untrue  statement)  of a  material  fact
contained in any registration statement or prospectus relating to the Shares, or
other  document,  or

                                       5
<PAGE>

any amendment or supplement  thereto,  or any omission (or alleged  omission) to
state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements  therein not  misleading,  and will reimburse each such party for
any  legal  and any  other  expenses  reasonably  incurred  in  connection  with
investigating or defending any such claim, loss, damage,  liability,  or action;
provided that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that
any such claim, loss, damage,  liability or expense arises out of or is based on
any untrue statement or omission based upon written information furnished to the
Company by such party and stated to be specifically for use therein and provided
further,  that the Company  shall only  reimburse  such parties for the fees and
expenses of a single legal counsel for all such parties.

     (b) Each of Seller and the Seller  Owners will,  severally  based on Shares
sold pursuant to a registration  effected  pursuant to this  Agreement,  but not
jointly,  if  Shares  held  by or  issuable  to such  party  are  included  in a
registration effected pursuant to this Agreement, indemnify the Company, each of
its directors and officers, each person controlling the Company and the officers
and  directors  of each such  controlling  person  against all  claims,  losses,
damages,  and liabilities (or actions in respect  thereof)  including any of the
foregoing  incurred in settlement of any  litigation,  commenced or  threatened,
arising out of or based on any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of
a material  fact  contained  in the  Registration  Statement  or the  Prospectus
included  therein,  or any  omission (or alleged  omission)  to state  therein a
material fact required to be stated  therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading,  and will reimburse the Company, and each such director,
officer and controlling  person, for any legal or any other expenses  reasonably
incurred in connection  with  investigating  or defending any such claim,  loss,
damage, liability, or action, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent
that such untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) or omission (or alleged
omission) was made in such  Registration  Statement or  Prospectus,  in reliance
upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such
party  and  stated  to be  specifically  for use  therein.  Notwithstanding  the
foregoing,  the  liability  of each Seller and Seller  Owners under this Section
shall be  limited  in an amount  equal to the per share  sales  price  (less any
underwriting discounts and commissions)  multiplied by the number of Shares sold
by such party pursuant to the Registration Statement.

     (c) Each  party  entitled  to  indemnification  under  this  Section 8 (the
"Indemnified  Party") shall give written notice to the party required to provide
such  indemnification  (the  "Indemnifying  Party")  of any  claim  as to  which
indemnification  may be sought promptly after such Indemnified  Party has actual
knowledge thereof, and shall permit the Indemnifying Party to assume the defense
of any such claim or any litigation resulting  therefrom;  provided that counsel
for the  Indemnifying  Party,  who shall  conduct  the  defense of such claim or
litigation,  shall be  subject  to  approval  by the  Indemnified  Party  (whose
approval shall not be unreasonably  withheld) and after the  Indemnifying  Party
assumes the defense thereof,  the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to such
Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses  subsequently  incurred by the
latter in connection with the defense thereof, unless in the reasonable judgment
of the  Indemnified  Party,  representation  of such  Indemnified  Party by such
counsel would be inappropriate  due to actual or potential  differing  interests
between such Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying  Party in such proceeding in
which  case such  Indemnified  Party  shall  have the  right to employ  separate
counsel to participate in such defense at the expense of the Indemnifying Party;
it being  understood that the  Indemnifying  Party shall not, in connection with
any one such action or separate but substantially  similar or related actions

                                       6
<PAGE>

in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations,  be liable
for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys
at any  time  for all  such  Indemnified  Parties  provided,  however,  that the
Indemnifying  Party  shall bear the  expenses  of  independent  counsel  for the
Indemnified   Party  if  the  Indemnified   Party  reasonably   determines  that
representation of more than one party by the same counsel would be inappropriate
due to actual or potential  conflicts of interest between the Indemnified  Party
and the  Indemnifying  Party;  and  provided  further  that the  failure  of any
Indemnified  Party to give  notice as  provided  herein  shall not  relieve  the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this Section 8, except to the extent
that  such  failure  to  give  notice  shall  materially  adversely  affect  the
Indemnifying  Party in the defense of any such claim or any such litigation.  No
Indemnifying  Party,  in the  defense  of any such claim or  litigation,  shall,
except  with the  consent  of each  Indemnified  Party,  consent to entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement that does not include as an  unconditional
term  thereof  the  giving  by  the  claimant  or  plaintiff  therein,  to  such
Indemnified  Party,  of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or
litigation.

     (d) If the  indemnification  provided for in subsection  (a) or (b) of this
Section  8 is for any  reason  unavailable  to a party  to be  indemnified  with
respect to any claims, actions, demands, losses, damages, liabilities,  costs or
expenses  referred  to  therein,  then each  Indemnifying  Party  under any such
subsection,  in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified  Party thereunder,  hereby
agrees to contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified  Party as
a result of such claims, actions, demands, losses, damages, liabilities, cost or
expenses in such  proportion as is  appropriate to reflect the relative fault of
the Indemnifying Party on the one hand and of the Indemnified Party on the other
in connection  with the  statements or omissions  which resulted in such claims,
actions,  demands, losses, damages,  liabilities,  costs or expenses, as well as
any  other  relevant  equitable  considerations.   The  relative  fault  of  the
Indemnifying Party and of the Indemnified Party shall be determined by reference
to,  among other  things,  whether the untrue or alleged  untrue  statement of a
material  fact or the  omission  or alleged  omission  to state a material  fact
relates to information  supplied by the Indemnifying Party or by the Indemnified
Party and the parties'  relative  intent,  knowledge,  access to information and
opportunity  to correct or prevent such  statement or omission.  Notwithstanding
the foregoing,  the amount any of Seller or the Seller Owners shall be obligated
to  contribute  pursuant  to this  subsection  (d) shall be limited to an amount
equal  to  the  per  share  sale  price  (less  any  underwriting  discount  and
commissions)  multiplied by the number of Shares sold by such party  pursuant to
the  Registration  Statement  which gives rise to such  obligation to contribute
(less  aggregate  amount of any  damages  which  such party has  otherwise  been
required  to pay in  respect  of  such  claim,  action,  demand,  loss,  damage,
liability,  cost or expense or any substantially similar claim, action,  demand,
loss, damage,  liability, cost or expense arising from the sale of such Shares).
No person guilty of fraudulent  misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section
11(f) of the Securities  Act) shall be entitled to  contribution  hereunder from
any  person  who  was  not  guilty  of such  fraudulent  misrepresentation.  The
obligations of Seller and the Seller Owners under this paragraph will be several
(based on Shares  sold  pursuant  to a  registration  effected  pursuant to this
Agreement) and not joint.

     SECTION 9. Rule 144  Reporting.  With a view to making  available to Seller
and the Seller Owners the benefits of certain rules and  regulations  of the SEC
which may permit the sale of the Shares to the public without registration,  the
Company agrees to use its best efforts to:



                                       7
<PAGE>

     (a) comply,  on a timely basis with all the reporting  requirements  of the
Exchange   Act,  and  comply  with  all  other  public   information   reporting
requirements of the SEC as a condition to the  availability of an exemption from
the Securities Act under Rule 144  thereunder,  as amended from time to time, or
successor rule thereto, for the sale of Shares by Seller or the Seller Owners;

     (b) provide,  at the Company's  expense,  such opinion of counsel as may be
reasonably  requested by the transfer  agent for the Shares in  connection  with
each  sale  of  Registrable   Securities  pursuant  to  an  exemption  from  the
registration  requirements of the Securities Act (under Rule 144 thereunder,  as
amended from time to time, or successor rule thereto or otherwise) or otherwise,
so long as Seller  Owners have  furnished  to counsel  documentation  reasonably
acceptable to such counsel related to the transfer and the Shares; and

     (c) whenever  Seller or the Seller  Owners are able to  demonstrate  to the
Company that the  provisions  of Rule 144(k) (or any  successor  rule) under the
Securities  Act are  available  to them and have  furnished  to the Company such
documentation  in connection  therewith as the Company may  reasonably  request,
provide,  at  the  Company's  expense,  new  certificates  that  do  not  bear a
restrictive legend.

     (d) So long as any of Seller and the Seller Owners own any Shares,  furnish
to such  party  forthwith  upon  request,  a copy of the most  recent  annual or
quarterly  report of the Company,  and such other  reports and documents as such
party may reasonably request in availing itself of any rule or regulation of the
SEC allowing it to sell any such Shares without registration; provided that such
reports are not otherwise  available to Seller or the Seller Owners on the SEC's
Edgar web site.

     SECTION  10.  Amendments.  This  Agreement  may not be amended  without the
written consent of the Company and the holders of at least  two-thirds  (2/3rds)
of the aggregate of the Shares.

     SECTION 11. Miscellaneous.

     (a) Benefits of Agreement.  Except as otherwise provided herein, nothing in
this  Agreement,  expressed  or implied,  shall give or be construed to give any
person,  firm or  corporation,  other  than the  parties  hereto,  any  legal or
equitable  right,  remedy or claim under any  covenant,  condition  or provision
contained in this Agreement being for the sole benefit of the parties hereto.

     (b)  Successors  and  Assigns.  This  Agreement  shall be binding  upon the
Company and its  successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of Seller
