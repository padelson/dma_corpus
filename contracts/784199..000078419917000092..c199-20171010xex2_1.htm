 \t\t

 \t\t\tG.Contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,

Employees any of the Company Subsidiaries pursuant to this Section 2.2 and pay
such withheld amounts on behalf of the Employees receiving such bonuses or
change of control payments to the relevant Company Subsidiary at the latest
one (1) Business Day following the Closing to satisfy any associated Required
Withholding Tax. In the event that the amount so withheld and paid falls short
of the amount required to be paid to the applicable Governmental Authority
with respect to (A) a Shareholder Option or (B) a bonus or change of control
amounts payable by the Bonus Payors, the shortfall of such Required
Withholding Tax shall be paid upon demand of the Buyer at the option of the
Buyer either to the Company or applicable Company Subsidiary directly by the
former holder of a Shareholder Option or the applicable Employee to the
applicable Governmental Authority. The Company will cause the relevant Company
Subsidiary to release any excess amount not used to pay the Required
Withholding Tax (the "Excess Withholding Amount") to the applicable Employee
or former holder of a Shareholder Option upon the relevant Company
Subsidiary's receipt of reasonable satisfactory evidence as to the existence
and calculation of an Excess Withholding Amount. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t2.3Closing. Unless the Securityholders holding a majority of the
Shares Representative and Buyer mutually agree in writing to a different date
and time, the Acquisition will take place at 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time on the
fifth (5th) Business Day following the date on which the satisfaction or
written waiver (to the extent legally permissible) of the conditions precedent
set forth in Article VIII occurs and continues. The Acquisition shall take
place remotely by facsimile, e-mail or other electronic communication, unless
another method is mutually agreed upon in writing by Buyer and the
Securityholder Representative. The consummation of the Acquisition is referred
to as the "Closing." The date and time upon which the Closing is effective
shall be referred to herein as the "Closing Date."  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t2.4Purchase Price. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)Payments of Closing Consideration and Consideration for Shareholder
Loans. On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement,
including the provisions of Section 2.2 and Section 2.4(b) and the adjustment
set forth in Section 3.1, in full consideration for the transfer of all of the
Sold Shares to Buyer and the purchase of the Shareholders Loans by Buyer, at
the Closing, CryoLife shall pay or cause Buyer to pay to the Paying Agent for
further distribution by the Paying Agent to each of the Securityholders their
respective portion of (i) the Closing Consideration and (ii) the Consideration
for Shareholder Loans as set forth on the Consideration Schedule and, in the
case of the CryoLife Common Stock comprising a portion of the Closing
Consideration, CryoLife shall irrevocably instruct American Stock Transfer and
Trust Company, LLC (the "Transfer Agent") to reflect in book entry form the
issuance of shares of CryoLife Common Stock to such Securityholders, as set
forth on the Consideration Schedule.  \t\t \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-4-  \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

The Paying Agent shall distribute the cash portion of the Closing
Consideration and the Consideration for Shareholder Loans by an irrevocable
bank wire transfer of immediately available funds to accounts designated in
writing by the Securityholders, as set forth on the Consideration Schedule.
For the avoidance of doubt, when the parties determined the Closing
Consideration, they agreed that the items mentioned in Schedule 12 are already
reflected in the Closing Consideration and shall thus not be further
considered whatsoever, neither for purposes of the net debt Acquisition
Consideration adjustment, nor for any breach of representation or warranty,
nor for any indemnification or otherwise.

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)Escrow. On the Closing Date and subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, including the provisions of Section 9.3,
CryoLife shall or shall cause Buyer to deposit with the Escrow Agent an amount
in cash equal to the Escrow Amount. The Securityholders' respective Pro Rata
Portions of the Escrow Amount shall equal in the aggregate the Escrow
Amount. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c)Withholding Taxes. Notwithstanding any other provision in this
Agreement, Buyer, the Company, the Paying Agent and the Escrow Agent shall
have the right to deduct and withhold from any payments to be made hereunder
such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under any
provision of applicable Law, and to reasonably request any necessary Tax
forms, as applicable, and any similar information. To the extent that any such
amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental
Authority, such withheld and paid amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made. To the extent that any payment pursuant to
this Agreement is not reduced by such required deductions or withholdings,
such Person shall indemnify Buyer, the Company and the Escrow Agent for any
liability to any Governmental Authority for such required deductions or
withholdings together with all related Losses. None of the Company or any
other Party shall be liable to a holder of the Shareholder Loans or the
Shareholder Options or any bonuses or change of control payments for any
amount properly paid to a Governmental Authority pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section 2.4(c), the Buyer shall be responsible for any
deductions or withholdings from payments to be made to Securityholders
pursuant to this Agreement that are imposed by a jurisdiction other than
Switzerland or Germany (or, in each case, any political subdivision thereof)
solely as a result of the Buyer acquiring, or being deemed to have acquired,
the Company through an entity organized under the laws of the jurisdiction
imposing such deduction or withholding and, for the avoidance of doubt, not as
the sole result of the status of any Securityholder as a citizen or Tax
resident of the jurisdiction imposing such deduction or withholding, and in
such case the amount of the payment due shall be increased to an amount which
(after making any Tax deductions) leaves an amount equal to the payment which
would have been due if the Tax deductions made had not been required. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t2.5Consideration Schedule. No later than three (3) Business Days
before the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Buyer and Paying Agent the
updated Consideration Schedule (to reflect the purchase by one or several of
the Securityholders of Shares from the Minority Shareholders) setting forth
(i) the name and mailing address of each Securityholder; (ii)  \t\t \t\t

  \t\t\t-5-  \t\t

each case as of immediately prior to the Closing; (iii) each Securityholder's
Pro Rata Portion of the Escrow Amount; (iv) the Estimated Net Debt and each
Securityholder's Pro Rata Portion of Estimated Net Debt; (v) each
Securityholder's Pro-Rata Portion of the Closing Consideration (including the
amount of cash and number of shares of CryoLife Common Stock to which such
Securityholder is entitled), payable to each such Securityholder with respect
to their respective Sold Shares; (vi) each Securityholders' share of the
Consideration for the Shareholder Loans and (vii) as applicable, with respect
to any Shares issued on or after January 1, 2011 or any other Shares, in each
case constituting a "covered security" under Treasury Regulation §
1.6045-1(a)(15), the cost basis and date of issuance of such Shares or Shares.
The Paying Agent shall be responsible for the distribution of such amounts
delivered to the Paying Agent. Upon (i) paying the Escrow Amount to the Escrow
Agent, (ii) payment of the Consideration for the Shareholder Loans and the
cash portion of the Closing Consideration to the Paying Agent, and (iii)
instructing the Transfer Agent to reflect in book entry form the issuance of
the CryoLife Common Stock issuable as Closing Consideration to the
Securityholders as set forth in the Consideration Schedule, CryoLife, Parent
and Buyer shall have fulfilled their respective obligations with respect to
the Closing, subject to the Acquisition Consideration adjustment set forth in
Article III.

of the Company if necessary, confirming that Buyer is entered in the register
as sole owner of the Sold Shares, accompanied by a copy of such register duly
signed by the Company's board of directors (the "Board of Directors") or such

Closing Date, duly signed by the Board of Directors, in which the Buyer is
registered as the owner of the Sold Shares with full voting rights, free and
clear of any Liens. Upon Closing, the Buyer shall be recorded as the sole
owner of all Sold Shares in the Company's share register, and in accordance
with the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each
Securityholder shall receive from Buyer in exchange therefor the Pro Rata
Portion of the Closing Consideration to which each such Securityholder is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.5, as set forth on the Consideration Schedule,
which for purposes of clarification shall be subject to adjustment as provided
in Section 3.1.  \t\t

deliver to the Company a notification of beneficial ownership regarding the
Sold Shares in accordance with article 697j of the Swiss Code of

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d)Joint Closing Actions / Deemed Occurrence of the Closing Actions.
All actions to be taken and documents to be delivered by the Parties at
Closing as set forth in this Agreement are deemed to have (i) been taken,
executed and delivered simultaneously and (ii) occurred only if and when all
such actions and documents have been taken, executed and delivered. In case
Closing does not occur, the Parties undertake to use their commercially
reasonable best efforts to unwind all Closing actions initiated or taken.

 \t\t\tArticle III 

ACQUISITION CONSIDERATION ADJUSTMENT \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t3.1Acquisition Consideration Adjustment. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)No later than three (3) Business Days prior to Closing, the Company
shall deliver to Buyer a written statement of its reasonable good faith
estimate of the Net Company Debt as at the Closing Date (the "Estimated Net
Debt"), together with a reasonably detailed explanation of the calculation
thereof. The amount of the Estimated Net Debt shall be reflected in the
calculation of the Closing Consideration to be paid by Buyer at Closing
pursuant to Section 2.4. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, CryoLife shall cause
to be prepared and delivered to the Securityholder Representative a statement
setting forth the calculation of the Net Company Debt as of the Closing Date,
together with a reasonably detailed explanation of the calculation thereof
(the "Company Net Debt Statement") and a statement setting forth the
calculation of the adjustment amount to the Acquisition Consideration (if any)
based on the difference between the Estimated Net Debt and the Company Net
Debt determined pursuant to the Company Net Debt Statement (this statement,
collectively with the Company Net Debt Statement, the "Closing Adjustment
Statement").  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c)Within sixty (60) days following receipt by the Securityholder
Representative of the Closing Adjustment Statement, the Securityholder
Representative shall deliver written notice to CryoLife of any dispute it has
with respect to the preparation or content of the Closing Adjustment
Statement. If the Securityholder Representative does not notify CryoLife in
writing of a dispute with respect to the Closing Adjustment Statement within
such sixty (60)-day period, pursuant to a written notice describing in
reasonable detail the specific calculations that are disputed and the basis
for such dispute, such Closing Adjustment Statement will be final, conclusive
and binding on the Parties. If the Securityholder Representative notifies
CryoLife in writing of a dispute with respect to the Closing Adjustment
Statement within such sixty (60)-day period, pursuant to a written statement
describing in reasonable detail the specific  \t\t \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-7-  \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

calculations that are disputed and the basis for such dispute, CryoLife and
the Securityholder Representative shall negotiate in good faith to resolve
such dispute. If CryoLife and the Securityholder Representative,
notwithstanding such good faith effort, fail to resolve such dispute within
thirty (30) days after the Securityholder Representative advises CryoLife of
its objections, then CryoLife and the Securityholder Representative jointly
shall be entitled to engage the Arbitration Firm to resolve such dispute. As
promptly as practicable thereafter (and, in any event, within fifteen (15)
days after the Arbitration Firm's engagement), the Securityholder
Representative shall submit any unresolved elements of its objection to the
Arbitration Firm in writing (with a copy to CryoLife), supported by any
documents and arguments upon which it relies. As promptly as practicable
thereafter (and, in any event, within fifteen (15) days following the
Securityholder Representative's submission of such unresolved elements),
CryoLife shall submit its response to the Arbitration Firm (with a copy to the
Securityholder Representative) supported by any documents and arguments upon
which it relies. CryoLife and the Securityholder Representative shall request
that the Arbitration Firm render its determination within fifteen (15) days
following its receipt of CryoLife's response. The scope of the disputes to be
resolved by the Arbitration Firm shall be limited to the unresolved items to
which the Securityholder Representative objected. In resolving any disputed
item, the Arbitration Firm may not assign a value to any item greater than the
greatest value claimed for such item by either Party or less than the smallest
value claimed for such item by either Party. All determinations made by the
Arbitration Firm will be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties. The
Arbitration Firm shall have the authority to allocate all fees and costs of
the Arbitration Firm in resolving any disputed item to the non-prevailing
party, as determined by the Arbitration Firm.

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d)If Net Company Debt (as finally determined after the Closing
pursuant to Section 3.1(c)) exceeds the Estimated Net Debt delivered prior to
the Closing by the Company to Buyer pursuant to Section 3.1(a), then the
Acquisition Consideration will be adjusted downward by such excess amount and
the Securityholders shall, within (10) Business Days, pay Buyer an amount of
cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds an amount equal to (i)
the Net Company Debt (as finally determined after the Closing pursuant to
Section 3.1(c)) minus (ii) the Estimated Net Debt (such amount described in
clauses (i) and (ii) collectively, the "Downward Adjustment Amount") in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Portion of the Downward Adjustment
Amount or, at Buyer's request, the Securityholder Representative and Buyer
shall deliver a joint written authorization to the Escrow Agent within two (2)
Business Days from the date on which Net Company Debt is finally determined
pursuant to Section 3.1(c) authorizing the Escrow Agent to release to Buyer
from the Indemnity Escrow Fund, within three (3) Business Days from the date
of such authorization an amount equal to the Downward Adjustment Amount. Any
fees and costs of the Arbitration Firm to be borne by the Securityholders
pursuant to Section 3.1(c) shall be paid directly by the Securityholders in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Portion.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e)If Net Company Debt (as finally determined after the Closing
pursuant to Section 3.1(c)) is below the Estimated Net Debt delivered prior
to the Closing by the Company to Buyer pursuant to Section 3.1(a), then the
Acquisition Consideration will be adjusted upward by such excess amount and
CryoLife shall or shall cause Buyer to, within ten (10) Business  \t\t \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

Days, pay the Paying Agent for further distribution to each of the
Securityholders, as if such amount had been distributed at Closing, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds an amount equal to (i) the Estimated
Net Debt Net minus (ii) Net Company Debt (as finally determined after the
Closing pursuant to Section 3.1(c)) (such amount described in clauses (i) and
(ii) collectively, the "Upward Adjustment Amount") in accordance with their
respective Pro Rata Portions of the Upward Adjustment Amount, or at Buyer's
request (ii) the Securityholder Representative and Buyer shall deliver a joint
written authorization to the Escrow Agent within two (2) Business Days from
the date on which Net Company Debt is finally determined pursuant to Section
3.1(c) authorizing the Escrow Agent to release from the Indemnity Escrow Fund,
within three (3) Business Days from the date of such authorization to the
Paying Agent, for further distribution to each of the Securityholders in
proportion to their respective Pro Rata Portions, an amount of cash equal to
the Upward Adjustment Amount. Any fees and costs of the Arbitration Firm to
be borne by the Securityholders pursuant to Section 3.1(c) shall be paid
directly by the Securityholders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata
Portion.

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f)The adjusted payment obligations contemplated in this Section 3.1
shall be treated for all purposes as adjustments to the Acquisition
Consideration, except as otherwise required by applicable Law. \t\t

do business and (to the extent such phrase is recognized in the applicable
jurisdiction) in good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction

Laws. All certificates representing Shares have been correctly and validly
issued and not been cancelled. Neither the Company nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries has or will have suffered or incurred any Liability, arising out
of the issuance, redemption, or repurchase of any Company Securities or the
repayment, conversion or purported conversion of the Company Promissory Notes,
or out of any Contracts or arrangements relating to any of the Company
Securities (including any amendment of the terms of any such Contract or
arrangement). Except as contemplated in this Agreement, there are no declared
or accrued but unpaid dividends with respect to any of the Shares. A complete
and detailed description of the capitalization of each of the Company
Subsidiaries, including the names and amounts held by the holders of interests
in each of the Company Subsidiaries as of the date hereof, is set forth on
Section 5.2(a)(iv) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. All issued and
outstanding shares or equity interests in the Company Subsidiaries are duly

Contracts of any character, written or oral, to which the Company or any
Company Subsidiary is a party or by which the Company or any Company

deliver, sell, repurchase or redeem, or cause to be issued, delivered, sold,
repurchased or redeemed, any shares of the share capital of the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries. Other than the Shareholder Options to be
redeemed as provided in Section 2.2(c), there are no outstanding or authorized
stock appreciation, phantom stock, profit participation, or other rights,
rights of any type, the value of which is determined by reference in whole or

registration, sale or transfer (including Contracts relating to rights of
first refusal, co-sale rights or "drag-along" rights) of any Company
Securities or any securities of any of the Company Subsidiaries. The
Consideration Schedule is complete and correct. At the Closing, the allocation
of Acquisition Consideration set forth in the Consideration Schedule will
comply with the Charter Documents of the Company and applicable Law and will
not result in any violation of any Contract between the Company on the one
hand and any of the Securityholders, on the other hand. All Securityholders
that hold a share of the share capital of the Company are parties to the
Shareholders Agreement. To the Knowledge of the Company, none of the
Securityholders has breached or violated any provision of the Shareholders
Agreement. As a result of the Acquisition, and assuming the satisfaction of
the payment obligations of CryoLife, Parent and Buyer herein, Buyer will be
the sole record and beneficial holder of all Sold Shares of the

Registered Intellectual Property Rights or Company Intellectual
Property. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c)Section 5.14(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule accurately and
fully identifies each Company Product that is, has been, or is currently
proposed to be made commercially available or otherwise provided to end users
and each research and development project that the Company has proposed to

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d)To the Knowledge of the Company, each item of Company Registered

Company Registered Intellectual Property Rights have been filed with the
relevant patent, copyright, trademark or other authorities in Europe, the
United States, or foreign jurisdictions, as the case may be, for the purposes
of maintaining such Company Registered Intellectual Property Rights. During
the prosecution of any Patents within the Company Registered Intellectual

all right, title, and interest in that Intellectual Property to the Company or
the Company Subsidiary, as applicable, and, to the extent that Intellectual
Property constitutes Registered Intellectual Property, to the Knowledge of the
Company, in accordance with, applicable Laws, the Company has recorded each
such assignment with each relevant Governmental Authority, including the PTO,
EPO, the U.S. Copyright Office, or their respective equivalents in any
relevant jurisdiction, as the case may be.

and complete copies of all documents in effect from and after the date of this
Agreement embodying each Company Employee Plan and all related trust
documents, including all amendments thereto (ii) all material written

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

correspondence to or from any Governmental Authority relating to any Company
Employee Plan, in each case with respect to this clause (iii) in the five (5)
years preceding the date of this Agreement. Each Company Employee Plan is not
subject to United States Law and is maintained primarily in respect to
Employees who are located outside the United States (each, a "Foreign Benefit
Plan"). Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has made any plan or
commitment to establish any new Company Employee Plan, to modify any Company
Employee Plan (except to the extent required by Law or to conform any such
Company Employee Plan to the requirements of any applicable Law, in each case
as previously disclosed to Buyer, or as required by this Agreement), or to
enter into any Company Employee Plan.

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c)Employee Plan Compliance. Each Company Employee Plan has been
established, maintained and administered in material compliance with its terms
and conditions and with the requirements prescribed by any and all statutory
or regulatory Laws that are applicable to such Company Employee Plan. No
Company Employee Plan has unfunded liabilities that, as of the Closing, will
not be offset by insurance or fully accrued. Except as required by Law, no
condition exists that, would prevent the Company or any Company Subsidiary
from terminating or amending any Company Employee Plan at any time for any
reason without liability to the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
(other than ordinary administration expenses or routine claims for benefits).
All employer and employee contributions to each Foreign Benefit Plan required
by its terms or by applicable Law have been made or, if applicable, accrued in
accordance with generally accepted accounting practices in the applicable
jurisdiction and any other payments (including insurance premiums) otherwise
due in respect to a Foreign Benefit Plan have been paid in full or will be
paid in full prior to the Closing. The fair market value of the assets of
each funded Foreign Benefit Plan, the liability of each insurer for any
Foreign Benefit Plan funded through insurance or the book reserve established
for any Foreign Benefit Plan, together with any accrued contributions, is, to
the Knowledge of the Company, sufficient to procure or provide for the accrued
benefit obligations, as of the date of this Agreement, with respect to all
current and former participants in such plan according to the actuarial
assumptions and valuations most recently used to determine employer
contributions to such Foreign Benefit Plan, and no transaction contemplated in
this Agreement shall cause such assets or insurance obligations to be less
than such benefit obligations. Each Foreign Benefit Plan required to be
registered has been registered and has been maintained in good standing with
applicable regulatory authorities.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d)No U.S. Employees or Plans. Neither the Company nor any of the
Company Subsidiaries has ever maintained, established sponsored, participated
in or contributed to any "employee benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(3)
of ERISA) subject to ERISA or any other Company Employee Plan benefiting
Employees located in the United States or subject to United States Law.
Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries have any Employees
located in the United States or subject to any Law of the United States or any
state or locality within the United States.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e)No Post-Employment Obligations. No Company Employee Plan or
Employee Agreement provides, or reflects or represents any liability to
provide, retiree life insurance, retiree health or other retiree employee
welfare benefits to any person for any reason,  \t\t \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-41-  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

except as may be required by applicable Law, and neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary has ever represented, promised or contracted (whether in
oral or written form) to any Employee (either individually or to Employees as
a group) or any other person that such Employee(s) or other person would be
provided with retiree life insurance, retiree health or other retiree employee
welfare benefits, except to the extent required by applicable Law.

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f)Effect of Transaction. The execution of this Agreement and the
Related Agreements and the consummation of the transactions contemplated in
this Agreement and the Related Agreements will not (either alone or upon the
occurrence of any additional or subsequent events) constitute an event under
any Company Employee Plan, Employee Agreement, trust, loan or Law that will or
may result in any payment (whether of severance pay, bonus or otherwise),
acceleration, forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in
compensation, increase in benefits or obligation to fund benefits with respect

applicable Law). Except as set forth in Section 5.23(g) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, since December 31, 2016, there have been no and there are

 \t\t

 \t\t\t6.1Organization, Standing and Power. CryoLife is a corporation duly
organized and validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
State of Florida. CryoLife has the corporate power to own its properties and
to carry on its business as now being conducted and is duly qualified or
licensed to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which
the failure to be so qualified or licensed would not reasonably be expected to
have a CryoLife Material Adverse Effect. Parent is a German GmbH duly

 \t\t

delivery of this Agreement and any Related Agreements to which it is a party
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement and
the Related Agreements have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate
action on the part of each of CryoLife, Parent and Buyer. This Agreement and
any Related Agreements to which CryoLife, Parent or Buyer is a party have been
duly executed and delivered by CryoLife, Parent or Buyer, as applicable, and
constitute the valid and binding obligations of CryoLife, Parent or Buyer, as
applicable, enforceable against CryoLife, Parent or Buyer, as applicable, in
accordance with their terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by
principles of public policy and subject to the laws of general application
relating to bankruptcy, insolvency and the relief of debtors and rules of law
governing specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable remedies.
At the Closing, CryoLife shall have authorized the issuance of CryoLife Common
Stock to be delivered to the Securityholders.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t6.3No Conflict. The execution and delivery by CryoLife, Parent, and

and Buyer, or (ii) any Law applicable to CryoLife, Parent, and Buyer or any of
their respective properties (whether tangible or intangible) or assets, except

hereof, each of CryoLife, Parent and Buyer is in compliance with and has not
breached, violated or defaulted under, or received written notice that it has
breached, violated or defaulted under, any of the terms or conditions of any
of its material contracts (as filed with the SEC and referenced as exhibits to
CryoLife's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, or as subsequently filed in
SEC Documents filed by CryoLife prior to the date of this Agreement), nor has
any event occurred or become likely to occur that could reasonably be expected
to constitute such a breach, violation or default with the lapse of time,
giving of notice or both. As of the date hereof, to the Knowledge of
CryoLife, Parent and Buyer, no party obligated to CryoLife, Parent or Buyer
pursuant to any such material contract is in default thereunder.

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t6.4Capitalization. CryoLife's Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on July
25, 2017 accurately describes CryoLife's authorized and issued and outstanding
capital stock as of June 30, 2017 and shares of common stock reserved for
issuance pursuant to CryoLife's incentive equity plans and other similar
arrangements. There have been no material changes in CryoLife's capitalization
since June 30, 2017. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t6.5Litigation. Except as described in the SEC Documents, there are no

are available on the EDGAR system. As of their respective filing dates, the
SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements of the

applicable to the SEC Documents, and none of the SEC Documents, at the time
they were filed with the SEC, contained any untrue statement of a material
fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. As of their
respective filing dates, the financial statements of CryoLife included in the
SEC Documents complied as to form in all material respects with applicable
accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC
with respect thereto. Such financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, consistently

related fees and expenses, CryoLife, the CryoLife Subsidiaries, Parent and
Buyer, taken together as a whole, will be Solvent as of the Closing and
immediately after the consummation of the Closing. For purposes of the
foregoing, the term "Solvent", when used with respect to any Person, means
that, as of any date of determination, (i) the amount of the "fair saleable
value" of the assets of such Person will, as of such date, exceed the sum of
(A) the value of all "liabilities of such Person, including contingent and
other liabilities," as of such date, as such quoted terms are generally
determined in accordance with applicable Laws governing determinations of the
insolvency of debtors, and (B) the amount that will be required to pay the
probable liabilities of such Person, as of the Closing Date, on its existing
debts (including contingent and other liabilities) as such debts become
absolute and mature, (ii) such Person will not have, as of such date, an
unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in
which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged following such date, and (iii)
such Person will be able to pay its liabilities, as of such date, including
contingent and other liabilities, as they mature. For purposes of the
definition of "Solvent", "not have an unreasonably small amount of capital for
the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be
engaged" and "able to pay its liabilities, as of such date, including
contingent and other liabilities, as they mature" means that such Person will
be able to generate enough cash from operations, asset dispositions or
refinancing, or a combination thereof, to meet its obligations as they become
due. No transfer of property is being made and no obligation is being incurred
in connection with the transactions contemplated in this Agreement with the
intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of
CryoLife, Parent or Buyer.

applicable Law. CryoLife and the Company shall issue a press release
following the Closing that is mutually agreeable to CryoLife and the
Securityholder Representative. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t7.8Consents. The Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries shall
use reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary consents, waivers and approvals

 \t\t\t7.10Section 338(g) Election. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)The parties acknowledge and agree that the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement are fully taxable transactions for U.S. federal
income Tax purposes. CryoLife, in its sole discretion, may make or cause to

 \t\t

 \t\t\t7.11Indirect Partial Liquidation.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)CryoLife, Parent and the Buyer covenant and undertake to the
Securityholders and Minority Shareholders who sold their Shares between the
date hereof and the Closing Date to one or several Securityholders that they
will refrain, and will cause their Affiliates and any purchaser of any Sold
Shares after the Closing Date to refrain, from any action which could
reasonably be expected to result in a so-called "indirect partial liquidation"
in accordance with Swiss tax law and the practice of the Swiss tax
authorities. In particular, and without limitation, from the Closing Date
until the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing Date, CryoLife, Parent and
the Buyer shall not, and shall not permit their Affiliates or any purchaser of
any Sold Shares after the Closing Date to take any action that results in an
"indirect partial liquidation". \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)CryoLife's, Parent's and the Buyer's obligations in accordance with
this Section 7.11 do not apply if and to the extent the Buyer provides to the
Securityholder Representative binding tax rulings for the three Swiss tax
resident Securityholders and the Minority Shareholders who are Swiss tax
resident in Aargau and Waadt (also known as Vaud) from the competent tax
authorities confirming that the relevant transaction does not result in an
"indirect partial liquidation" at the federal and cantonal/communal level in
accordance with the practice of the Swiss tax authorities; provided that
CryoLife's, Parent's and Buyer's obligations shall remain in effect under
Section 7.11(c) with respect to each of the Minority Shareholders who are
Swiss tax resident in cantons other than Aargau and Waadt (also known as Vaud)
until the Buyer provides to the Securityholder Representative binding tax
rulings for each such Minority Shareholder from the competent tax authorities
confirming that the relevant transaction  \t\t \t\t

  \t\t\t-59-  \t\t

 \t\t

does not result in an "indirect partial liquidation" at the federal and
cantonal/communal level for such Minority Shareholder in accordance with the
practice of the Swiss tax authorities. The Buyer is entitled to file tax
rulings for all Securityholders and Minority Shareholders with respect to the
"indirect partial liquidation" as per this Section 7.11. For that purpose, the
Securityholders (also on behalf of the Minority Shareholders who sold their
Shares between the date hereof and the Closing Date to one or several
Securityholders) hereby agree to sign all necessary powers of attorney, when
reasonably requested by the Buyer to do so in writing. Buyer shall only
communicate with the competent tax authorities on behalf of Securityholders
and the Minority Shareholders who sold their Shares between the date hereof
and the Closing Date to one or several Securityholders upon prior written
approval by the Securityholders and such Minority Shareholders, such approval,
if any, shall not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed by Securityholders or
such Minority Shareholders.

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) If during the period from the Closing Date until the fifth (5th)
anniversary of the Closing Date, CryoLife, Parent, Buyer or any of their
respective Affiliates engages in any transaction that results in an "indirect
partial liquidation", CryoLife, Parent and Buyer shall, regardless of whether
there was any fault of CryoLife, Parent, Buyer or any of their respective
Affiliates, jointly and severally fully indemnify the Securityholders and the
Minority Shareholders who sold their Shares between the date of this Agreement
and the Closing Date to one or several Securityholders for, and hold them
harmless from, all Swiss income taxes, including default interest and all
reasonable legal fees, cost and expenses incurred in connection therewith and
in cooperation between the Parties as per this Section 7.11.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d)In case an "indirect partial liquidation" issue as defined above
arises, the respective Securityholder or Minority Shareholder will inform the
Buyer without delay and within five (5) Business Days after the earlier of (i)
receipt or (ii) knowledge of the written or oral information of the Tax
authorities on such issue in order to afford the Buyer reasonable opportunity
to take note of all relevant facts in connection with the relevant Tax claims
and to direct the respective Securityholder or Minority Shareholder to
reasonably contest such Tax claims under reasonable direction and at the cost
of the Buyer. Securityholders and Minority Shareholders acknowledge the
sensitivity of the timing, in particular in case of formal assessments and/or
running time limits to respond or appeal. If an unjustified or excessive Tax
claim cannot be defended (as would be reasonably expected) because the
respective time limit has elapsed due to late notice of the respective
Securityholder or Minority Shareholder, the liabilities of CryoLife, Parent
and the Buyer under this Section 7.11 shall be reduced or eliminated if and to
the extent the failure of the respective Securityholder or Minority
Shareholder is not excusable in the individual case and/or if and to the
extent the failure of the respective Securityholder or Minority Shareholder
increased the liabilities of CryoLife, Parent, Buyer or any of their
respective Affiliates under this Section 7.11. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e)CryoLife, Parent and Buyer undertake to fully impose their
obligations as per this Section 7.11 on any subsequent buyer of the Sold
Shares and remains jointly and severally liable for any and all claims arising
out of, relating to or in connection with the tax indemnity in accordance with
this Section 7.11.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i)the Company and each Company Subsidiary to hold an extraordinary
shareholders\' meeting; and \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii)a resolution to be passed at such extraordinary meeting granting
unconditional discharge, except for any fraud or willful misconduct, to the
directors and officers of the Company and each Company Subsidiary for their
known and disclosed acts or omissions as directors and officers of the Company
or Company Subsidiary before the Closing Date (the "Discharge"). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c)Granting of the Discharge to the directors and officers of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall be repeated on the occasion of the
next ordinary shareholders' meeting of the Company or the respective Company
Subsidiary following the Closing and any further ordinary shareholders'
meeting covering the period until Closing Date. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d)A copy of each resolution of the shareholders of the Company and
each Company Subsidiary granting Discharge shall be delivered to the
Securityholder Representative within ten (10) Business Days after the date of
the relevant meeting. \t\t

necessary to satisfy any unsatisfied claims specified in any Officer's
Certificate delivered to the Escrow Agent and the Securityholder
Representative in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement prior to
12:01 a.m. Eastern Time on the Expiration Date (each, an "Unsatisfied Claim").
Any distribution of all or a portion of the cash in the Indemnity Escrow Fund

equal to the amount of cash being distributed, and if to the Securityholders
shall be made to the Paying Agent for further distribution to each of the

Parties agree to provide the Paying Agent with a certified Tax identification

to the contrary, except as set forth in the second sentence of this Section

Section 9.2(a) in excess of $2,500,000 (the "Threshold Amount") has or have

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-70-  \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

be entitled to recover all Losses so identified without regard to the
Threshold Amount from the first dollar of such Losses, and (ii) a Seller
Indemnified Person may not recover any Losses under clause (i) of Section
9.2(b) unless (a) one or more Claim Certificates (as defined below)
identifying Losses under Section 9.2(b) exceed on a stand-alone basis the
amount of a Qualifying Claim have been delivered; provided that the Qualifying
Claim limitation shall no longer apply once one or more Claim Certificates (as
defined below) identifying Losses under Section 9.2(b) exceed in the aggregate
the amount of $1,000,000 have been delivered, and (b) until one or more Claim
Certificates (as defined below) identifying Losses under Section 9.2(b) in
excess of the Threshold Amount has or have been delivered to CryoLife as
provided in Section 9.4(b) hereof, in which case the Seller Indemnified
Persons shall be entitled to recover all Losses so identified without regard
to the Threshold Amount from the first dollar of such Losses. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, (i) a Buyer Indemnified Person shall be entitled to recover
for, and the Qualifying Claim or the Threshold Amount shall not apply as a
limit or threshold to, any and all claims or payments made with respect to
Losses paid, incurred or sustained arising out of or resulting from or related
to clauses (ii) through (v) of Section 9.2(a) or any breach or inaccuracy of a
representation or warranty contained in any of the Fundamental
Representations, and (ii) a Seller Indemnified Person shall be entitled to
recover for, and the Threshold Amount shall not apply as a threshold to, any
and all claims or payments made with respect to Losses paid, incurred or
sustained arising out of or resulting from or related to clauses (ii) through
(iii) of Section 9.2(b).

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)Claims for Indemnification. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i)In order to seek indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2(a)
(including with regard to a Third Party Claim (as defined below)), CryoLife
shall or shall cause Buyer to deliver an Officer's Certificate to the
Securityholder Representative and, if such claim involves a claim against the
Indemnity Escrow Fund, to the Escrow Agent, and such Officer's Certificate
must be delivered prior to the applicable Survival Date; CryoLife shall or
shall cause Buyer to deliver an Officer's Certificate promptly upon CryoLife
concluding it intends to assert a claim for indemnification provided, however,
the failure to promptly deliver an Officer's Certificate shall not affect the
Buyer Indemnified Persons' right to recover Losses under Section 9.2(a),
except to the extent the Seller Indemnifying Parties are prejudiced by such
failure. For the purposes hereof, "Officer's Certificate" shall mean a
certificate signed by any officer of CryoLife or Buyer: (x) stating that a
Buyer Indemnified Person has paid, sustained or incurred or reasonably
anticipates that it will have to pay, sustain or incur Losses, and (y)
specifying in reasonable detail the individual items of Losses included in the
amount so stated, the date each such item was paid, sustained or incurred, or
the basis for such anticipated liability, and the nature of the (1)
misrepresentation, (2) breach or inaccuracy of a representation or warranty,
(3) breach or failure to perform a covenant or other agreement, or (4) other
basis for indemnity to which such item is related, but in each case only to
the extent such information is reasonably available to CryoLife as of the date
of such Officer's Certificate.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii)In order to seek indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2(b), the
Securityholder Representative shall deliver a Claim Certificate to CryoLife at
any time prior to the applicable Survival Date; the Securityholder
Representative shall deliver a Claim Certificate  \t\t \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-71-  \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

promptly upon the Securityholder Representative (on behalf of the Seller
Indemnified Persons) concluding he intends to assert a claim for
indemnification; provided, however, the failure to promptly deliver a Claim
Certificate shall not affect the Seller Indemnified Persons' right to recover
Losses under Section 9.2(b), except to the extent the Buyer Indemnifying
Parties are prejudiced by such failure. For the purposes hereof, "Claim
Certificate" shall mean a certificate signed by the Securityholder
Representative: (x) stating that a Seller Indemnified Person has paid,
sustained or incurred or reasonably anticipates that it will have to pay,
sustain or incur Losses, and (y) specifying in reasonable detail the
individual items of Losses included in the amount so stated, the date each
such item was paid, sustained or incurred, or the basis for such anticipated
liability, and the nature of the (1) misrepresentation, (2) breach or
inaccuracy of a representation or warranty, (3) breach or failure to perform a
covenant or other agreement, or (4) other basis for indemnity to which such
item is related, but in each case only to the extent such information is
reasonably available to the Securityholder Representative as of the date of
such Claim Certificate.

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iii)If a Buyer Indemnified Person is entitled to recover a Loss
pursuant to Section 9.2(a) then, subject to the limitations set forth in this
Agreement, the Buyer Indemnified Person shall, except for indemnification (a)
pursuant to Sections 9.2(a)(ii) through 9.2(a)(v), and (b) for breach or
misrepresentation of a Fundamental Representation, first receive proceeds from
the Indemnity Escrow Fund, and then, if the Indemnity Escrow Fund is
insufficient to the cover the Loss, the Securityholders shall be directly
liable for the remaining excess amount of such Loss, in which case the
Securityholders shall make payment directly to such Buyer Indemnified Person
by wire transfer of immediately available cash funds to an account designated
by such Buyer Indemnified Person. If a Seller Indemnified Person is entitled
to recover a Loss pursuant to Section 9.2(b), then, subject to the limitations
set forth in this Agreement, CryoLife shall or shall cause Buyer to pay the
amount of such Loss directly to such Seller Indemnified Person by wire
transfer of immediately available cash funds to an account designated by such
Seller Indemnified Person.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c)Securityholders Right to Cure. With respect to any claim for
indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2(a) notified by CryoLife pursuant to
Section 9.4(b)(i), CryoLife shall use commercially reasonable efforts to give
the Securityholder Representative the reasonable opportunity to cure the
source of the potential Losses in connection with such claim. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d)Objections to Claims for Indemnification. The payment of any
amount under Section 9.4(b) shall be delayed pending resolution pursuant to
Section 9.4(e) if (i) with respect to any claim for indemnification pursuant
to Section 9.2(a), the Securityholder Representative shall object to the claim
made in the Officer's Certificate in a written statement labeled "Objection
Notice" (an "Objection Notice"), and such Objection Notice shall have been
received by CryoLife and the Escrow Agent prior to 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time on
the sixty-fifth (65th) Business Day after its receipt of the Officer's
Certificate, or (ii) with respect to any claim for indemnification pursuant to
Section 9.2(b), CryoLife shall object to the claim made in the Claim
Certificate in an Objection Notice, and such Objection Notice shall have been
received by the Securityholder Representative prior to 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time
on the sixty-fifth (65th) Business Day after its receipt of the Claim
Certificate. If the Securityholder Representative  \t\t \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-72-  \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

(with respect to any claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2(a)) or
CryoLife (with respect to any claim for indemnification pursuant to Section
9.2(b)) (as applicable, the "Responding Party") does not object in writing
within such sixty-five (65) Business Day period, such failure to so object
shall be an irrevocable acknowledgment by the Responding Party that the Buyer
Indemnified Person or Seller Indemnified Person, as applicable, is entitled to
the full amount of the claim for Losses set forth in such Officer's
Certificate or Claim Certificate, and payment in respect of such Losses shall
thereafter be made in accordance with Section 9.4(b).

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e)Resolution of Conflicts. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i)In case the Responding Party delivers an Objection Notice in
accordance with Section 9.4(c), the Securityholder Representative and CryoLife
shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective Persons
with respect to each of such claims. If the Securityholder Representative and
CryoLife should so agree, and such claim involves a claim against the
Indemnity Escrow Fund, a document setting forth such agreement shall be
prepared and signed by both the Securityholder Representative and CryoLife or
Buyer and furnished to the Escrow Agent in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii)At any time following delivery of an Objection Notice by the
Responding Party or in the event of any dispute arising pursuant to this
Article IX, either CryoLife, on the one hand, or the Securityholder
Representative, on the other hand, may pursue any and all legal or equitable
remedies available to them under applicable Law. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f)Third-Party Claims. If CryoLife becomes aware of a third party
claim (a "Third Party Claim") that CryoLife reasonably believes may result in
a demand for indemnification pursuant to this Article IX, CryoLife shall or
shall cause Buyer to notify the Escrow Agent (if the Third Party Claim is made
by CryoLife or a Buyer Indemnified Person prior to the release of the
Indemnity Escrow Fund and may result in a claim against the Indemnity Escrow
Fund) and the Securityholder Representative in writing of such claim. If the
Third Party Claim may result in a claim against the Indemnity Escrow Fund, the
Securityholder Representative, on behalf of the Securityholders, shall be
entitled, at its expense, to participate in, but not to determine or conduct,
the defense of such Third Party Claim; provided, however, that the
Securityholders agree and consent, as a condition of such entitlement of
participation, that CryoLife's legal counsel in the Third Party Claim shall
not be precluded from representing CryoLife as against the Securityholders in
the event that the Securityholders dispute the fact or amount of CryoLife's
claim of a Loss related to such matter. CryoLife shall have the right in its
sole discretion to conduct the defense of, and to settle, any such claim;
provided, that, in the event that any claim is settled without the written
consent of the Securityholder Representative, such settlement shall not be
dispositive of the existence of an indemnifiable claim or the amount of
Losses. In the event that the Securityholder Representative has consented to
any such settlement, the Securityholders shall have no power or authority to
object to the amount of any Third Party Claim. If CryoLife does not use
commercially reasonable efforts to conduct or assume the defense of a Third
Party Claim, then the Securityholder Representative, on behalf of the
Securityholders, may, by providing written notice to CryoLife, assume the
defense of such  \t\t \t\t

the Securityholders.

 \t\t\t9.5Securityholder Representative. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)By virtue of the approval of the Acquisition and this Agreement by
each of the Securityholders, each of the Securityholders shall be deemed to
have agreed to appoint Lars Sunnanvader as his, her or its, as applicable,
agent and attorney-in-fact, as the Securityholder Representative for and on
behalf of the Securityholders to take all actions under this Agreement that
are to be taken by the Securityholder Representative, including to amend this
Agreement, to waive any provision of this Agreement, to negotiate payments due
pursuant to this Article IX, to give and receive notices and communications,
to authorize payment to any Buyer Indemnified Person from the Indemnity Escrow
Fund in satisfaction of claims by any Buyer Indemnified Person, to object to
such payments, to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises
of, and comply with orders of courts with respect to such claims, to assert,
negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and comply with orders
of courts with respect to, any other claim by any Buyer Indemnified Person
against any of the Securityholders or by any of the Securityholders against
any Buyer Indemnified Person or any dispute between any Buyer Indemnified
Person and any of the Securityholders, in each case relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, and to take all other
actions that are either (i) necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the
Securityholder Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing or (ii)
specifically mandated by the terms of this Agreement. Such agency may be
changed by the Securityholders from time to time upon not less than thirty
(30) days prior written notice to CryoLife, Parent and Buyer; provided,
however, that the Securityholder Representative may not be removed unless
Securityholders representing the holders of at least a two-thirds interest of
the Indemnity Escrow Fund agree to such removal and to the identity of the
substituted agent. A vacancy in the position of Securityholder Representative
may be filled by the Securityholders representing the holders of a majority in
interest of the Indemnity Escrow Fund. In the event a vacancy in the position
of Securityholder Representative exists for thirty (30) or more days or
Securityholder Representative breaches or fails to perform its obligations
under this Agreement (after a 30 calendar day advance notice period to cure,
which period shall not apply in exigent circumstances), CryoLife, Parent and
Buyer shall have the right to petition a court of competent jurisdiction to
appoint a replacement Securityholder Representative, and Securityholder
Representative shall not receive any compensation for its services from
CryoLife, Parent, Buyer or the Company. No bond shall be required of the
Securityholder Representative. Notices or communications to or from the
Securityholder Representative shall constitute notice to or from the
Securityholders. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)Each of the Securityholders represents and warrants to CryoLife,
Parent and Buyer that the Securityholder Representative has the irrevocable
right, power and authority (i) to enter into and perform this Agreement and to
bind each of the Securityholders to its terms, (ii) to give and receive
directions and notices hereunder and (iii) to make all determinations that may
be required or that it deems appropriate under this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

(c)Until notified in writing by the Securityholder Representative that it has
resigned, or that it has been removed by at least two-thirds in interest of
the Indemnity Escrow Fund, CryoLife, Parent, Buyer and the Escrow Agent may
rely conclusively and act upon the directions, instructions and notices of the
Securityholder Representative named above and, thereafter, upon the
directions, instructions and notices of any successor named in a writing
executed by a majority-in-interest of the Indemnity Escrow Fund filed with the
Escrow Agent or a successor appointed by a court of competent
jurisdiction. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d)The Securityholders each hereby authorize the Securityholder
Representative to: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i)Receive all notices or documents given or to be given to the
Securityholders pursuant hereto or in connection herewith and to receive and
accept service of legal process and file pleadings on behalf of the
Securityholders in connection with any suit or proceeding arising under this
Agreement; provided, however, that the Securityholders acknowledge and agree
that even if Securityholder Representative is unable, unwilling, refuses,
resists or objects to receiving notice or receiving or accepting service of
process, notice to and service of process with respect to each of the
Securityholders shall be effective if made pursuant to Section 11.1; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii)Engage counsel, and such accountants and other advisors and incur
such other expenses in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement as the Securityholder Representative may in its
sole discretion deem appropriate; and \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iii)Take such action as the Securityholder Representative may in its
sole discretion deem appropriate in respect of: (A) waiving any inaccuracies
in the representations or warranties of CryoLife, Parent or Buyer contained in
this Agreement or in any document delivered by Buyer pursuant hereto; (B)
taking such other action as the Securityholder Representative is authorized to
take under this Agreement; (C) receiving all documents or certificates and
making all determinations, in its capacity as Securityholder Representative,
required under this Agreement; and (D) all such actions as may be necessary to
carry out any of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, including
the defense and/or settlement of any claims for which indemnification is
sought pursuant to this Article IX and any waiver of any obligation of
Buyer. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e)A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Securityholder
Representative, including an amendment, extension or waiver of this Agreement,
shall constitute a decision of the Securityholders and shall be final, binding
and conclusive upon the Securityholders; and the Escrow Agent and CryoLife,
Parent and Buyer may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction
of the Securityholder Representative as being the decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Securityholders. The Escrow Agent and CryoLife, Parent and
Buyer are hereby relieved from any liability to any person for any decision,
act, consent or instruction of the Securityholder Representative.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f)The Securityholders shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Securityholder Representative and its directors, officers, agents and
employees from and against  \t\t \t\t

  \t\t\t-75-  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

any and all Losses arising out of or in connection with the Securityholder
Representative's execution and performance of this Agreement, or otherwise in
connection with acting as the Securityholder Representative, in each case as
such Losses are incurred. Any such Losses shall be recovered (i) first from
any distribution of the Indemnity Escrow Fund, but only if and when required
to be distributed to the Securityholders, pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement at the time of distribution in accordance with written instructions
delivered by the Securityholder Representative to the Escrow Agent (the
"Distributable Funds"), and (ii) secondly, directly from the Securityholders
severally and not jointly and in accordance with their respective Pro Rata
Portion.

 \t\t

 \t\t\t9.6Maximum Payments; Remedy. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)Except as set forth in Sections 9.6(b) through 9.6(d) hereof, the

Section 9.2(a), shall be limited, in the aggregate, to the Pro Rata Portion
of the Acquisition Consideration; and (ii) the maximum amount Seller

 \t\t\t(c)The liability of a Securityholder in respect of Losses paid,
incurred, or sustained, arising out of, resulting from, or related to the
matters described in Section 9.2(a)(v) shall be limited in the aggregate, to
the Pro Rata Portion amount of the Acquisition Consideration. The liability of

9.2(b)(iii) shall be limited to an amount equal to the Acquisition
Consideration.  \t\t

 \t\t

(e)The Parties' respective liability for indemnification for a claim for
Losses under this Agreement shall be reduced or excluded to the extent the
party seeking indemnification:  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i)has recovered any amount in respect of such claim for Losses under

 \t\t\t9.8Sole Remedy. Following the Closing, the Parties agree that, except
for (i) the availability of injunctive or other equitable relief, (ii) the
provisions of Section 3.1, and (iii) fraud, the rights to indemnification

Person or Seller Indemnified Person will have in connection with the
transactions under this Agreement.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t9.9Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
the Closing: \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)With the mutual written consent of each of the Securityholder
Representative (on behalf of the Securityholders) and CryoLife; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c)By the Securityholder Representative (on behalf of the
Securityholders), if CryoLife, Parent, or Buyer shall have breached or failed

other agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to

to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 8.3 and (B) has not been or
is incapable of being cured by such Party prior to the earlier of the (x)
Termination Date and (y) thirtieth (30th) calendar day after such Party's

(d)By CryoLife, if the Company or any of the Securityholders shall have
breached or failed to perform any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or
failure to perform (A) would give rise, if occurring or continuing on the
Closing Date, to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 8.2 and (B)
has not been or is incapable of being cured by the Company prior to the
earlier of the (x) Termination Date and (y) thirtieth (30th) calendar day
after its receipt of written notice thereof from Buyer; or \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e)By the Securityholder Representative (on behalf of the
Securityholders) or CryoLife, if (i) any Governmental Authority shall have
enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any Law (whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent) which is then in effect and which has the effect of
making the Acquisition illegal or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the
Acquisition; or (ii) any temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent
injunction or other order issued by any court of competent jurisdiction or
other legal restraint or prohibition preventing the consummation of the
Acquisition shall then be in effect, or any proceeding brought by any
Governmental Authority, seeking any of the foregoing shall be then threatened
or pending. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tNotwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement, the right
to terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.9 shall not be available to
any Party whose breach of its representations or warranties set forth herein
or whose failure to fulfill its obligations or to comply with its covenants
under this Agreement has been the primary cause of, or primarily resulted in,
the failure to satisfy any condition to the obligations of the other Party or
Parties hereunder. \t\t

11.2Interpretation. The words "include," "includes" and "including" when used
herein shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without
limitation." Except for the section references or headings in the Company
Disclosure Schedule or Parent Disclosure Schedule, the table of contents and
headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall
not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t11.3Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same Contract and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the Parties and delivered to the other Party, it being understood that all
Parties need not sign the same counterpart. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t11.4Entire Agreement; Assignment. This Agreement, the Related
Agreements, the Exhibits and Schedules hereto, the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the Parent Disclosure Schedule and the Confidentiality Agreement:
(a) constitute the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings
both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof, (b) are not intended to confer upon any other person any rights or
remedies hereunder, and (c) shall not be assigned by operation of law or
otherwise without the consent of the Parties; provided, however, that each of
CryoLife Parent and Buyer may assign this Agreement and any of the Related
Agreements to which CryoLife, Parent or Buyer is a party to an Affiliate of
CryoLife or Parent; provided further that no such assignment by CryoLife will
relieve CryoLife of its obligations hereunder. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t11.5Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement
or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties. The Parties further agree to
replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid
and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t11.6Other Remedies; Specific Performance. Except as otherwise provided
in Section 9.8 of this Agreement, any and all remedies herein expressly
conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any
other remedy conferred in this Agreement, or by law or equity upon such Party,
and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise
of any other remedy and nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed a waiver by
any Party of any right to specific performance or injunctive relief. The
Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
Parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity. \t\t

11.7Governing Law; Venue. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the Laws
that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws
thereof. Each of the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally consents to and
submits, for itself and its assets and properties, to the exclusive
jurisdiction (including personal jurisdiction) and venue of any court within
the State of Delaware in connection with any matter based upon or arising out
of this Agreement or the matters contemplated herein, agrees that process may
be served upon them in any manner authorized by the Laws of the State of
Delaware for such persons and waives and covenants not to assert or plead any
objection which they might otherwise have to such jurisdiction, venue and such
process. Each of the Parties irrevocably consents to service of process in
the manner provided for notices in Section 11.1. NOTWITHSTANDING THE
FOREGOING, EACH PARTY AGREES THAT SUCH PARTY SHALL NOT BRING OR SUPPORT ANY
DISPUTE, CONTROVERSY, CLAIM OR ACTION OF ANY KIND OR DESCRIPTION, WHETHER IN
LAW OR IN EQUITY, AGAINST ANY MEMBER OF THE FINANCING GROUP IN ANY WAY
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE COMMITMENT LETTER, THE FEE LETTER OR THE
FINANCING AGREEMENTS OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY
(INCLUDING THE FINANCING), INCLUDING ANY DISPUTE, CONTROVERSY, CLAIM OR ACTION
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE FINANCING OR THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF, IN ANY
FORUM OTHER THAN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, COUNTY OF NEW
YORK, OR IF UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION IS VESTED IN THE
FEDERAL COURTS, THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF
NEW YORK (AND THE APPELLATE COURTS THEREOF). EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS
AGREEMENT (I) IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF EACH SUCH
COURT IN ANY SUCH DISPUTE, CONTROVERSY, CLAIM OR ACTION, (II) WAIVES ANY
OBJECTION IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO VENUE OR TO AN INCONVENIENT FORUM,
(III) AGREES THAT ALL SUCH DISPUTES, CONTROVERSIES, CLAIMS AND ACTIONS SHALL
BE HEARD AND DETERMINED ONLY IN SUCH COURTS AND (IV) WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL
BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUCH DISPUTE, CONTROVERSY, CLAIM OR ACTION. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t11.8Rules of Construction. The Parties agree that they have been
represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefore, waive the application of any Law, regulation, holding or rule
of construction providing that ambiguities in a Contract or other document
will be construed against the Party drafting such Contract or document. For
purposes of this Agreement, references to the terms "delivered to Buyer",
"delivered to Parent", "made available to Buyer" or "made Available to Parent"
will mean that the Company has posted true, complete and accurate copies of
such materials to the appropriate folder that corresponds with the subject
matter of such materials of the VDR and has given CryoLife, Parent, Buyer and
each of their representatives access to the materials so posted, no later than
11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on October 9, 2017. The Parties intend that each
representation, warranty and covenant contained herein shall have independent
significance. If any Party has breached any representation, warranty or
covenant contained in this Agreement or any of the Related Agreements in any
respect, the fact that there exists another representation,  \t\t \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-82-  \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

warranty or covenant relating to the same subject matter (regardless of the
relative levels of specificity) that the Party has not breached shall not
detract from or mitigate the fact that the Party is in breach of the first
representation, warranty or covenant. In addition, each of the Parties
acknowledges and agrees that any purchase price adjustment as a result of the
application of any provision of this Agreement, the Related Agreements or any
of the other Contracts contemplated in this Agreement or the Related
Agreements does not prejudice or limit in any respect whatsoever any Person's
rights to indemnification under any other provision of this Agreement, the
Related Agreements or any other Contracts contemplated in this Agreement or
the Related Agreements. All references to dollars or "$" shall refer to United
States Dollars unless otherwise indicated. All references to Euros or "€"
shall refer to Eurozone Euros unless otherwise indicated. Unless otherwise
specified in this Agreement, cash payments made by the Parties pursuant to
this Agreement first will be calculated in United States Dollars and then
converted prior to payment into Euros as of the close of business in New York
two Business Days prior to the date such payment is made based on the foreign-
exchange rate published by the Wall Street Journal on its website at
http://online.wsj.com on the "Exchange Rates: New York Closing Snapshot" page
(or such other page as may replace such page on such service for the purpose
of displaying the New York Closing foreign-exchange rate for the conversion of
United States Dollars into Euros or Euros into United States Dollars);
provided, however, that the cash portion of the Closing Consideration shall be
paid to the Paying Agent in Dollars by wire transfer of immediately available
funds.

 \t\t

 \t\t

binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t11.10Taking of Necessary Action. If at any time after the Closing,
any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement and to vest the Buyer with full right, title and possession to all
assets, property, rights privileges, powers and franchises of the
Securityholders, the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, CryoLife, Parent, and
Buyer and the officers and directors of the Company and Buyer are fully
authorized in the name of their respective entities or otherwise to take, and
together with their respective subsidiaries, will take, all such lawful and
necessary action. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t11.11Third Party Beneficiaries. Except for the provisions of Section
7.10(a) and Article IX relating to the Buyer Indemnified Persons, Seller
Indemnified Persons, and the Securityholders, the provisions of Section 7.11
relating to the Minority Shareholders that sell their Shares to the
Securityholders for delivery by the Securityholders to Buyer at the Closing,
and the immediately following proviso, this Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure solely to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors
and permitted assigns and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to
or shall confer upon any other person, any legal or equitable right, benefit
or remedy of any nature whatsoever, including any rights of employment for any
specified period, under or by reason of this Agreement; provided, however,
that each agent, arranger, bookrunner, lender, letter of credit issuer or
other financing party that is a party to the Commitment Letter (including the

11.11 (Third Party Beneficiaries), Section 11.12 (No Recourse; Certain
Limitations on Remedies), and Section 11.13 (Waiver of Jury Trial), and each
such Section will be enforceable by each member of the Financing Group.

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t11.12No Recourse; Certain Limitations on Remedies Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, no member of the Financing Group shall have
any liability to the Company or the Securityholders for any obligation or
liability, or for any claim for any loss suffered as a result of CryoLife's,
Parent's or Buyer's breach of this Agreement or the Commitment Letter, or any
document related thereto (including any willful breach thereof) or the failure
of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby to be consummated, or in
respect of any oral or written representation made or alleged to have been
made, in connection herewith or therewith, whether at equity, at law, in
contract, in tort or otherwise. In no event shall any member of the Financing
Group have liability to the Company or any Securityholder under this Agreement
for any consequential, special, incidental, indirect or punitive damages or
for any damages of a tortious nature. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company and each of the
Securityholders acknowledges and agrees that (i) none of the Securityholders
derive, and neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries derive,
any contractual rights, whether as third party beneficiary or otherwise, under
the Commitment Letter and will not be entitled to enforce the Commitment
Letter against any member of the Financing Group, (ii) the Company and each
Company Subsidiary and each Securityholder waives and agrees not to pursue any

Group with respect to the failure of the Financing to close, (iii) no member
of the Financing Group shall have any liability to the Company, any Company
Subsidiary or any of their respective Affiliates or any of the Participating
Securityholders hereunder, and (iv) the members of the Financing Group will
have no obligation to provide any Financing except in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the Commitment Letter.  \t\t

 \t\t

IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR

ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF. \t\t
