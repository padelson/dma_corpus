The Merger Agreement has been provided solely to inform investors of its
terms. The Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and
covenants, which were made for the purposes of such agreement and as of
specific dates, were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger
Agreement and may be intended not as statements of fact, but rather as a way
of allocating risk to one of the parties if those statements prove to be
inaccurate. In addition, such representations, warranties and covenants may be
subject to important qualifications and limitations agreed to by the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub in connection with the negotiated terms or with certain
disclosures not reflected in the text of the Merger Agreement, may not be
accurate or complete as of any specified date or may be subject to a
contractual standard of materiality different from those generally applicable
to stockholders or other investors in the Company. The Company's stockholders
and other investors are not third-party beneficiaries under the
Merger Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties and
covenants or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual
state of facts or conditions of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their respective subsidiaries or affiliates.

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

  



  

This Agreement and Plan of Merger (" _Agreement_ ") is made and entered into
as of September 23, 2013, by and among: VCG Holdings, LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company (" _Parent_ "); Crestview Acquisition Corp, a
Delaware corporation and a wholly owned direct subsidiary of Parent ("
_Merger Sub_ "); and Greenway Medical Technologies, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the " _Company_ "). Certain capitalized terms used in this
Agreement are defined in Exhibit A.

  



  

Recitals

  



  

A. Parent has agreed to cause Merger Sub to commence a cash tender
offer (as it may be amended from time to time as permitted under
this Agreement, the " _Offer_ ") to acquire all of the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock (the " _Shares_ ") for $20.35 per share (such amount, or
any other amount per share paid pursuant to the Offer, being the " _Offer
Price_ "), net to the seller in cash, without interest, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions of this Agreement.

  



  

B. Regardless of whether the Offer is consummated, Merger Sub will
merge with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), with the Company
continuing as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving
Corporation_ "), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, whereby, except as expressly provided in Section 2.5, (i) each
issued and outstanding Share not owned by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company as
of the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive the Offer
Price, in cash, without interest, and (ii) the Company shall become a wholly
owned Subsidiary of Parent as a result of the Merger.

  



  

C. The Board of Directors of the Company has (i) determined that this
Agreement and the Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, are
advisable to, and in the best interest of, the Company and its stockholders,
(ii) approved the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, including the Offer and
the Merger, (iii) authorized and approved the Top-Up Option and the issuance
of the Top-Up Option Shares, and (iv) resolved to recommend that the
stockholders of the Company tender their Shares to Parent pursuant to the
Offer, and, if applicable, approve the adoption of this Agreement and the
Merger (the " _Company Board Recommendation_ ").

  



  

D. The Board of Directors of each of Parent and Merger Sub have
approved this Agreement and declared it advisable for Parent and Merger Sub,
respectively, to enter into this Agreement.

  



  

E. Immediately prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
and as a condition and inducement to the willingness of Parent and Merger Sub
to enter into this Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company have
delivered to Parent and Merger Sub tender and support agreements (the "
_Support Agreements_ "), dated as of the date hereof, providing that such
stockholders of the Company have, among other things, agreed to (i) tender
the Shares beneficially owned by them, including the Shares
underlying Company Options that such stockholder may acquire at any time in
the future during the term of the Support

Agreements, including pursuant to any exercise of any Company Options, in the
Offer, and (ii) support the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby, each on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the
Support Agreements.

  



  

F. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a
condition and inducement to the Company's willingness to enter into
this Agreement, Parent has delivered to the Company the Equity Funding Letter
(as defined below), pursuant to which Vista Equity Partners Fund IV, L.P.
(the " _Equity Investor_ ") has, subject to the terms and conditions set forth
therein, committed to provide all of the funds to Parent that are necessary
to finance all of the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

G. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a
condition and inducement to the Company's willingness to enter into
this Agreement, the Equity Investor is entering into a limited guaranty in
favor of the Company (the " _Guaranty_ ") with respect to certain obligations
of Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement.

  



  

Agreement

  



  

The Parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as
follows:

  



  

SECTION 1. The Offer

  



  

1.1 The Offer.

  



  

(a) _Commencement of the Offer_. Provided that this Agreement shall
not have been terminated in accordance with Section 8, on a date that is nine
(9) business days after the date of this Agreement, or as promptly as
practicable thereafter, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub
to) commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the
Offer.

  



  

(b) _Terms and Conditions of the Offer_. The obligations of Merger
Sub to, and of Parent to cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment, and pay
for, any Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer are subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in Annex I (the " _Offer Conditions_ "). The Offer shall
be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to Purchase_ ") that
contains the terms set forth in this Agreement, the Minimum Condition and the
other Offer Conditions. Merger Sub expressly reserves the right to (i)
increase the Offer Price, (ii) waive any Offer Condition and (iii) make any
other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer not inconsistent with
the terms of this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that unless
otherwise provided by this Agreement, without the prior written consent of
the Company, Merger Sub shall not (A) decrease the Offer Price, (B) change
the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (C) decrease the maximum
number of Shares sought to be purchased in the Offer, (D) impose conditions
or requirements to the Offer in addition to the Offer Conditions, (E) amend or
modify any of the Offer Conditions in a manner that adversely affects, or
reasonably could adversely affect, any holder of Shares, (F) change or waive
the Minimum Condition, (G) extend or otherwise change the Expiration Date in a

(c) _Expiration and Extension of the Offer_. The Offer shall
initially be scheduled to expire at 12:00 midnight Eastern Time on the date
that is twenty (20) business days following the Offer Commencement Date
(determined as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) and Rule 14e-1(a) under the
Exchange Act) (the " _Initial Expiration Date_ ," such date or such subsequent
date to which the expiration of the Offer is extended in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, the " _Expiration Date_ "). Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, but subject to the Parties'
respective termination rights under Section 8: (i) if, as of the scheduled
Expiration Date, any Offer Condition is not satisfied and has not
been waived, Merger Sub may, in its discretion (and without the consent of
the Company or any other Person), extend the Offer on one or more occasions,
for an additional period of up to ten (10) business days per extension, to
permit such Offer Condition to be satisfied; (ii) Merger Sub shall extend the
Offer from time to time for any period required by any Legal Requirement,
any interpretation or position of the SEC, the staff thereof or NYSE
applicable to the Offer; (iii) Merger Sub shall have the right in its sole
discretion to extend the Offer beyond any then-scheduled expiration of the
Offer for one or more consecutive increments of up to five (5) business days
each, the length of each such period to be determined by Parent in its sole
discretion (or such longer period as Parent and the Company may mutually
agree) to the extent the Marketing Period shall not have been completed as of
any such then-scheduled Expiration Date; and (iv) if, as of the scheduled
Expiration Date, any Offer Condition is not satisfied and has not been
waived, at the request of the Company, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall
cause Merger Sub to) extend the Offer on one or more occasions for an
additional period of up to ten (10) business days per extension, to permit
such Offer Condition to be satisfied or waived. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Section 1.1(c), in no event shall Merger Sub: (1)
be required to accept for payment, and pay for, Shares validly tendered (and
not withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer until the Marketing Period shall have
been completed; (2) be required to extend the Offer beyond the earliest to
occur of (the " _Extension Deadline_ ") (x) the valid termination of this
Agreement in compliance with Section 8, (y) three (3) business days after the
Proxy Statement Clearance Date and (z) the End Date; or (3) be permitted to
extend the Offer beyond the Extension Deadline without the prior written
consent of the Company. Merger Sub shall not terminate the Offer prior to any
scheduled Expiration Date without the prior written consent of the Company
except in the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.

  



  

(d) _Termination of Offer; Continuing Pursuit of Merger_. If at any
then-scheduled Expiration Date (i) any Offer Condition shall not have been
satisfied or, to the extent waivable by Parent or Merger Sub, waived and (ii)
three (3) business days have elapsed since the Proxy Statement Clearance
Date, then (x) Merger Sub may irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the
Offer or (y) from and after the close of business on November 20, 2013, the
Company shall have the right, exercisable by delivering written notice to
Parent and Merger Sub to cause Merger Sub to, and upon receipt of such notice,
Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to), irrevocably and
unconditionally terminate the Offer at the then-scheduled Expiration Date
following the receipt of such notice from the Company (delivered no less than
two (2) business days prior to the then-scheduled Expiration Date of the
Offer). If the Offer is terminated pursuant to this Section 1.1(d), the
Company shall proceed with and take all actions necessary to hold the Company
Stockholders' Meeting in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The
termination of the Offer pursuant to this Section 1.1(d) is referred to in
this Agreement as the " _Offer Termination_ ". Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Section 1.1(d), if this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to Section 8, then Merger Sub shall

--- 

    



  

promptly (and, in any event, within one (1) business day of such
termination), irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer and shall
not acquire any Shares pursuant to the Offer. If the Offer is terminated or
withdrawn by Merger Sub in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, including Section 1.1(d), or this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with Section 8, Merger Sub shall promptly return, and shall cause
any depository acting on behalf of Merger Sub to return, all tendered Shares
to the registered holders thereof to the extent required by the terms of the
Offer. The Parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the Offer Termination
shall not give rise to a right of termination of this Agreement unless to the
extent expressly provided for in Section 8 and that, absent such termination
of this Agreement, the obligations of the Parties hereunder other than those
related to the Offer shall continue to remain in effect, including those
obligations with respect to the Merger.

  



  

(e) _Offer Documents_. On the date of commencement of the Offer
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act), Parent and Merger
Sub shall (i) file with the SEC a tender offer statement on Schedule TO with
respect to the Offer (together with all amendments and supplements thereto
and including exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ ") that will contain or
incorporate by reference the Offer to Purchase and form of the related letter
of transmittal and (ii) cause the Offer to Purchase and related documents to
be disseminated to holders of Shares. Parent and Merger Sub agree that they
shall cause the Schedule TO and all exhibits, amendments or supplements
thereto (which together constitute the " _Offer Documents_ ") filed by either
Parent or Merger Sub with the SEC to comply in all material respects with the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and other applicable
Legal Requirements. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees to
promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer
Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become false
or misleading in any material respect, and Parent and Merger Sub further
agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so
corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of
Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal
securities laws. The Company shall promptly furnish or otherwise make
available to Parent and Merger Sub or Parent's legal counsel all information
concerning the Acquired Corporations and the Company's stockholders that may
be required in connection with any action contemplated by this Section 1.1(e).
The Company and its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the Offer Documents prior to the filing thereof with the SEC.
Parent and Merger Sub agree to provide the Company and its counsel with any
comments Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel may receive from the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after receipt of such
comments. Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall respond promptly to any
comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents or the
Offer. Parent and Merger Sub shall use reasonable best efforts to respond as
promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments of the SEC or the staff
of the SEC with respect to the Offer Documents, and Parent and Merger Sub
shall provide the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to
participate in the formulation of any written response to any such written
comments of the SEC or its staff. Prior to the filing of the Offer Documents
(or any amendment or supplement thereto) or the dissemination thereof to the
holders of Company Common Stock, or responding to any comments of the SEC or
the staff of the SEC with respect thereto, Parent and Merger Sub
shall provide the Company a reasonable opportunity to review and to propose
comments on such document or response.

be no more than three (3) business days) after the Expiration Date, all
Shares validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer that
Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer (such
acceptance, the " _Offer Closing_ ", the time on which the Offer Closing
occurs, the " _Acceptance Time_ "). Without limiting the generality of
Section 9.10, Parent shall cause to be provided to Merger Sub all of the
funds necessary to purchase any Shares that Merger Sub becomes obligated to
purchase pursuant to the Offer, and shall cause Merger Sub to perform, on a
timely basis, all of Merger Sub's obligations under this Agreement.

that all of their respective affiliates shall, tender any Shares held by them
into the Offer.

(a) _Schedule 14D-9_. As promptly as practicable following the
filing of the Schedule TO but in no event later than one (1) business
day after the date of the filing of the Schedule TO (or such other date as
mutually agreed upon by the Parties), the Company shall file with the SEC and
disseminate to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required
by applicable federal securities laws, a Tender Offer
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with any
exhibits, amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ ") that,
subject to Section 6.1(b), shall reflect the Company Board
Recommendation. The Company agrees that it will cause the Schedule 14D-9 to
comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act and other
applicable Legal Requirements. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
agrees to respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff and to
promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9
if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect, and the Company further agrees to take all
steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with
the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and
to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. Parent and
Merger Sub shall promptly furnish or otherwise make available to the Company
or the Company's legal counsel all information concerning Parent and Merger
Sub that may be required in connection with any action contemplated by this
Section 1.2(a). Parent and its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 and any amendment thereto prior
to the filing thereof with the SEC. The Company agrees to provide Parent and
its counsel with any comments the Company or its counsel may receive from the
SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of

with a list of its stockholders, mailing labels and any available listing or
computer file containing the names and addresses of all record holders of
Shares and lists of securities positions of Shares held in stock
depositories, in each case true and correct as of the most recent practicable
date, and shall provide to Parent such additional information (including
updated lists of stockholders, mailing labels and lists of securities
positions) and such other assistance as Parent may reasonably request in
connection with the Offer. Parent and Merger Sub and their agents shall
hold in confidence the information contained in any such labels, listings and

Merger and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, shall deliver, and shall

1.3 Directors.

  



  

(a) _Merger Sub Designees_. Upon the Acceptance Time and all times
thereafter, subject to compliance with applicable Legal
Requirements, including the applicable rules and regulations of NYSE, Merger
Sub shall be entitled to elect or designate such number of directors, rounded
up to the next whole number, on the Board of Directors of the Company as is
equal to the product of (i) the total number of directors on the Board of
Directors of the Company (after giving effect to the directors elected or
designated by Merger Sub pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by (ii) the
percentage that the aggregate number of Shares beneficially owned by
Parent, Merger Sub and any of their Affiliates bears to the total number of
Shares then outstanding. The Company shall, upon Merger Sub's request at any
time following the purchase of and payment for Shares pursuant to the Offer,
take all such actions necessary to (A) appoint to the Board of Directors of
the Company the individuals designated by Merger Sub and permitted to be so
designated by the first sentence of this Section 1.3(a), including, but not
limited to, promptly filling vacancies or newly created directorships on the
Board of Directors of the Company, promptly increasing the size of the Board
of Directors of the Company (including by amending the bylaws of the Company
if necessary so as to increase the size of the Board of Directors of the
Company) and/or promptly securing the resignations of such number of its
incumbent directors as are necessary or desirable to enable Merger
Sub's designees to be so elected or designated to the Board of Directors of
the Company, and (B) cause Merger Sub's designees to be so appointed at such
time. The Company shall, upon Merger Sub's request following the Acceptance
Time, also cause Persons elected or designated by Merger Sub to constitute
the same percentage (rounded up to the next whole number) as is on the Board
of Directors of the Company of each committee of the Board of Directors of the
Company to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, including
the applicable rules and regulations of NYSE. From and after the Acceptance
Time, the Company shall take all action necessary to elect to be treated as a
"controlled company" as defined by NYSE Listing Rule 303A.00 and make all
necessary filings and disclosures associated with such status. The Company's
obligations under this Section 1.3(a) shall be subject to Section 14(f) of
the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The Company shall
promptly upon execution of this Agreement take all actions required pursuant
to Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its obligations under
this Section 1.3(a), including mailing to stockholders (together with the
Schedule 14D-9) the information required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 as
is necessary to enable Merger Sub's designees to be elected or designated to
the Board of

Directors of the Company. Merger Sub shall supply the Company with, and be
solely responsible for, information with respect to Merger Sub's
designees and Parent's and Merger Sub's respective officers, directors and
Affiliates to the extent required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1. The
provisions of this Section 1.3(a) are in addition to and shall not limit any
rights that any of Merger Sub, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates
may have as a record holder or beneficial owner of Shares as a matter of
applicable Legal Requirements with respect to the election of directors or
otherwise.

  



  

(b) _Independent Directors_. In the event that Merger Sub's
designees are elected or designated to the Board of Directors of the
Company pursuant to Section 1.3(a), then, until the Effective Time, the
Company shall cause the Board of Directors of the Company to maintain three
(3) directors who are members of the Board of Directors of the Company on or
prior to the date hereof and who are not officers, directors or employees of
Parent, Merger Sub, or any of their Affiliates, each of whom shall be an
"independent director" as defined by NYSE Listing Rule 303A.02 and eligible
to serve on the Company's audit committee under the Exchange Act and rules
and regulations of NYSE, and at least one of whom shall be an "audit committee
financial expert" as defined in Items 407(d)(5)(ii) and (iii) of Regulation
S-K (the " _Continuing Directors_ "); _provided, however, _ that if any
Continuing Director is unable to serve due to death, disability or
resignation, the Company shall take all necessary action (including creating
a committee of the Board of Directors of the Company) so that the Continuing
Director(s) shall be entitled to elect or designate another Person (or
Persons) to fill such vacancy, and such Person (or Persons) shall be deemed to
be a Continuing Director for purposes of this Agreement. If no Continuing
Director then remains, the other directors shall designate three Persons who
are not officers, directors or employees of Parent, Merger Sub, or any of
their Affiliates to fill such vacancies and such Persons shall be deemed
Continuing Directors for all purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if Merger Sub's designees
constitute a majority of the Board of Directors of the Company after the
Acceptance Time and prior to the Effective Time, then the affirmative vote of
a majority of the Continuing Directors shall (in addition to the approval
rights of the Board of Directors of the Company or the stockholders of the
Company as may be required by the Company Charter Documents or applicable
Legal Requirements) be required (i) for the Company to amend or terminate this
Agreement, (ii) to exercise or waive any of the Company's rights, benefits or
remedies hereunder, if such action would adversely affect, or would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect, the holders of Shares (other than
Parent or Merger Sub), (iii) to amend the Company Charter Documents if such
action would adversely affect the holders of Shares (other than Parent or
Merger Sub), or (iv) to take any other action of the Board of Directors of
the Company under or in connection with this Agreement if such action
would adversely affect, or would reasonably be expected to adversely affect,
the holders of Shares (other than Parent or Merger Sub). The Continuing
Directors shall have, and Parent shall cause the Continuing Directors to have,
the authority to retain such counsel (which may include current counsel to
the Company or the Board of Directors of the Company) and other advisors at
the expense of the Company as determined by the Continuing Directors, and the
authority to institute any action on behalf of the Company to enforce
performance of this Agreement.

1.4 Top-Up Option.

  



  

(a) _Top-Up_. The Company grants to Parent and Merger Sub an option
(the " _Top-Up Option_ ") to purchase from the Company the number of newly-
issued Shares (such newly-issued shares, the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ") equal
to the lesser of (i) the number of Shares that, when added to the number of
Shares owned by Parent and Merger Sub at the time of exercise of the Top-Up
Option, constitutes one share more than 90% of the number of Shares that would
be outstanding immediately after the issuance of all Shares subject to the
Top-Up Option on a fully diluted basis (determined in accordance with Annex
I) or (ii) the aggregate number of Shares that the Company is authorized to
issue under its certificate of incorporation but that are not issued and
outstanding (and are not subscribed for or otherwise committed to be issued)
at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option. The Top-Up Option shall
terminate upon the earlier to occur of (A) the Effective Time and (B) the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

  



  

(b) _Exercise of Top-Up_. If there shall have not been validly
tendered and not validly withdrawn that number of Shares which, when added to
the Shares owned by Parent and its affiliates, would represent at least one
share more than ninety percent (90%) of the number of Shares that would be
outstanding immediately after the issuance of all Shares subject to the Top-Up
Option on a fully diluted basis (determined in accordance with Annex I) at
the Acceptance Time, Acquisition Sub shall be deemed to have exercised the
Top-Up Option on such date; _provided, however,_ that the obligation of the
Company to deliver Top-Up Option Shares upon the exercise of the Top-Up
Option is subject to the conditions, unless waived by the Company, that (i)
immediately following the exercise of the Top-Up Option, the number of Shares
owned in the aggregate by Parent and Merger Sub constitutes at least one
share more than 90% of the number of Shares that would be outstanding
immediately after the issuance of all Top-Up Option Shares on a fully diluted
basis (determined in accordance with Annex I) and (ii) the Minimum Condition
shall have been satisfied. The parties shall cooperate to ensure that the
issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares is accomplished consistent with
applicable Legal Requirements (other than any Legal Requirements that require
shareholder approval for the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares).

  



  

(c) _Top-Up Closing_. The aggregate purchase price payable for the
Top-Up Option Shares shall be determined by multiplying the number of Top-Up
Option Shares by the Offer Price. Such purchase price may be paid by Parent or
Merger Sub, at its election, either (i) entirely in cash, (ii) by payment in
cash of the aggregate par value of the Top-Up Option Shares and payment of the
balance by executing and delivering to the Company a promissory note (with
full recourse to Parent) having a principal amount equal to such purchase
price or (iii) any combination thereof. Any such promissory note shall bear
simple interest at the rate of 6% per annum, shall mature on the first
anniversary of the date of execution and delivery of such promissory note and
may be prepaid without premium or penalty; _provided_ , _however_ , upon any
default under the promissory note, all principal and accrued
interest thereunder shall immediately become due and payable. The promissory
note shall have no other material terms.

  



  

(d) _Top-Up Notice_. In the event Parent or Merger Sub wishes to
exercise or is deemed to exercise the Top-Up Option, Parent or Merger Sub
shall deliver to the Company a notice setting forth (i) the number of Top-Up
Option Shares that Parent or Merger Sub intends to

  



    

8 
--- 

 

Table of Contents 
--- 

    



  

purchase pursuant to the Top-Up Option, (ii) the manner in which Parent or
Merger Sub intends to pay the applicable exercise price and (iii) the
place and time at which the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option
Shares is to take place. At the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option
Shares, Parent or Merger Sub shall cause to be delivered to the Company the
consideration required to be delivered in exchange for the Top-Up Option
Shares, and the Company shall cause to be issued and delivered to Parent or
Merger Sub (as the case may be) a certificate or certificates representing
the Top-Up Option Shares or, at Parent's or Merger Sub's request or otherwise
if the Company does not then have certificated Shares, the applicable number
of Book-Entry Shares. Such certificates or Book-Entry Shares may include any
legends required by applicable Legal Requirements.

  



  

(e) _Exemption from Registration_. Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledge that the Top-Up Option Shares that Merger Sub may acquire upon
exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be registered under the Securities Act
and will be issued in reliance upon an exemption thereunder for transactions
not involving a public offering. Parent and Merger Sub represent and warrant
to the Company that Merger Sub is, and will be upon the purchase of the Top-
Up Option Shares, an "Accredited Investor," as defined in Rule 501 of
Regulation D under the Securities Act. Merger Sub agrees that the Top-Up
Option and the Top-Up Option Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-
Up Option, if any, are being and will be acquired by Merger Sub for the
purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection
with, any distribution thereof in violation of the Securities Act.

  



  

(f) _No Effect on Appraisal Rights_. The Parties agree that any
dilutive impact on the value of the Shares as a result of the issuance of the
Top-Up Option Shares will not be taken into account in any determination of
the fair value of any Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL
as contemplated by Section 2.7 and that none of the Parties shall take any
position to the contrary in any appraisal proceeding.

or waiver of the conditions set forth in Section 7 hereof, if an Offer
Termination has occurred and the Marketing Period has not ended at the time of
the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions (other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at such time), the Closing shall

conditions that is the earliest to occur of (A) any business day during the

2.5 Conversion of Shares.

  



  

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or
any stockholder of the Company:

  



  

 (i) any Shares then held by the Company or any wholly owned
Subsidiary of the Company (or held in the Company's treasury) shall be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor;

  



  

 (ii) any Shares then held by Parent, Merger Sub or any other wholly
owned Subsidiary of Parent shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

  



  

 (iii) except as provided in clauses "(i)" and "(ii)" above and
subject to Section 2.5(b), each Share then outstanding (other than any
Dissenting Shares, as defined below) shall be converted into the right to
receive the Offer Price in cash, without interest (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "), subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable
Legal Requirements in accordance with Section 2.6(e); and

  



  

 (iv) each share of the common stock, $.0001 par value per share, of
Merger Sub then outstanding shall be converted into one share of common stock
of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

(b) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time,
the outstanding Shares are changed into a different number or class of shares
by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock
dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification,
recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the Offer Price and Merger
Consideration, as applicable, shall be appropriately adjusted.

  



  

2.6 Surrender of Certificates; Stock Transfer Books.

  



  

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or
trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the  _"
Paying Agent"_) for the holders of Shares to receive the funds to which
holders of such shares shall become entitled pursuant to Section 2.5. At the
Effective Time (subject to Section 2.8(b)), Parent shall deposit, or shall
cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent cash sufficient to make payment
of the cash consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.5 (the " _Payment
Fund_ "). The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The
Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by the
Surviving Corporation; _provided_ , that such investments shall be in
obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America in commercial
paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody\'s Investors Service,
Inc. or Standard and Poor\'s Corporation, respectively, in certificates of
deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker\'s acceptances of commercial
banks with capital exceeding $1 billion, or in money market funds having a

rating agency at the time of acquisition or a combination of the foregoing
and, in any such case, no such instrument shall have a maturity exceeding
three (3) months.

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than
five (5) business days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall cause to
be mailed to each Person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of
the Shares entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section
2.5 a form of letter of transmittal (which shall be in reasonable and
customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the certificates evidencing such shares (the _"
Certificates"_) shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or
effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent) and
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares pursuant to such letter of transmittal. Upon surrender to the
Paying Agent of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof)
or Book-Entry Shares, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions,
the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each share of
Company Common Stock formerly evidenced by such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares, and such Certificates and Book-Entry Shares shall then be canceled. No
interest shall accrue or be paid on the Merger Consideration payable upon the
surrender of any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the benefit of the
holder thereof. If the payment of any Merger Consideration is to be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificates
formerly evidencing the shares of Company Common Stock is registered on the
stock transfer books of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that
the Certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed properly or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall
have paid all transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall have established to the
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been
paid or are not applicable. Payment of the applicable Merger Consideration
with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose
name such Book-Entry Shares are registered.

  



  

(c) At any time following twelve (12) months after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent
to deliver to it any funds which had been made available to the Paying Agent
and not disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (including,
without limitation, all interest and other income received by the Paying Agent
in respect of all funds made available to it), and, thereafter, such holders
shall be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat and other similar Legal Requirements) only as general
creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration that may be
payable upon due surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares held by
them. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor
the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares for the Merger Consideration delivered in respect of such share
to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other
similar Legal Requirements. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at
such time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property
of any Governmental Body shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable
Legal Requirements, the property of the Surviving Corporation or its
designee, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

  



  

(d) At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of the Company with respect to the shares of Company
Common Stock shall be

  



    

12 
--- 

 

Table of Contents 
--- 

    



  

closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of
Shares on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time,
the holders of the Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares except as
otherwise provided herein or by applicable Legal Requirements.

  



  

(e) Each of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold (or cause the Paying Agent to deduct and
withhold) from the Merger Consideration payable to any holder of the Shares
or any other consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as it is required by any Legal Requirement to deduct and withhold with
respect to Taxes. Each such payor shall take all action that may be necessary
to ensure that any such amounts so withheld are promptly and properly remitted
to the appropriate Governmental Body. If any withholding obligation may be
avoided by a payee providing information or documentation to the applicable
payor, such payor shall request such information from such payee and use
commercially reasonable efforts to avoid such withholding obligation. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the
Shares or other recipient of consideration hereunder in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

  



  

(f) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving
Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount
as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such Certificate (which shall not exceed the Merger
Consideration payable with respect to such Certificate), the Paying
Agent will pay (less any amounts entitled to be deducted or withheld pursuant
to Section 2.6(e)), in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the
Shares formerly represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this
Section 2.

  



  

2.7 Dissenters' Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
held by holders who are entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the
DGCL and have properly exercised and perfected their respective demands for
appraisal of such shares in the time and manner provided in Section 262 of the
DGCL and, as of the Effective Time, have neither effectively withdrawn nor
lost their rights to such appraisal and payment under the DGCL (the _"
Dissenting Shares"_), shall not be converted into the right to receive Merger
Consideration, but shall, by virtue of the Merger, be entitled to only such
consideration as shall be determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL;
_provided, that_ if any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall
have effectively withdrawn or lost such holder's right to appraisal
and payment under the DGCL, such holder's Shares shall be deemed to have been
converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (less any amounts entitled to be deducted or withheld pursuant
to Section 2.6(e)), and such shares shall not be deemed to be Dissenting
Shares. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any written demands
received by the Company for appraisal of any Shares and any withdrawals of
such demands, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall
not, without the prior written consent of Parent or as required by applicable
Legal Requirements, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demands.

2.8 Treatment of Company Options.

  



  

(a) As of the Acceleration Time, each Company Option that is then
outstanding and unexercised, whether or not vested, shall be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to (i) the total
number of Shares subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the
Acceleration Time (without regard to vesting) multiplied by (ii) the excess,
if any, of (x) the Offer Price or the Merger Consideration (as the case may
be) over (y) the exercise price payable per Share under such Company
Option, which amount shall be paid in accordance with Section 2.8(b). No
holder of a Company Option that has an exercise price per Share that is equal
to or greater than the Offer Price or the Merger Consideration (as the case
may be) shall be entitled to any payment with respect to such cancelled
Company Option before or after the Acceleration Time.

  



  

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Acceleration Time
(but no later than seven (7) days after the Acceleration Time), the Merger
Sub or the Surviving Corporation (as the case may be) shall pay the aggregate
Offer Price or Merger Consideration (as the case may be), net of any
applicable withholding Taxes, payable with respect to Company Options through,
to the extent applicable and as the case may be, the Company's or Surviving
Corporation's payroll (subject to any required tax withholdings) to the
holders of Company Options.

  



  

2.9 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is reasonably determined by Parent to be necessary
or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the
Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession of and to all
rights and property of Merger Sub and the Company, the officers and directors
of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the
name of Merger Sub, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such
action.

required to be filed or furnished by the Company with the SEC (the " _Company
SEC Documents_ "). As of their respective dates, the Company SEC Documents
complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities
Act, the Exchange Act or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, and the
rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such
Company SEC Documents and, except to the extent that information contained in
such Company SEC Document has been revised, amended, modified or superseded
(prior to the date of this Agreement) by a later filed Company SEC Document,
none of the Company SEC Documents when filed or furnished contained any
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

  



  

(b) The consolidated financial statements (including any related
notes and schedules) contained or incorporated by reference in the
Company SEC Documents: (i) complied as to form in all material respects with
the published rules and regulations of the SEC applicable thereto; (ii) were
prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
principles (" _GAAP_ " _) _ applied on a consistent basis throughout the

financial statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q, Form 8-K or any successor
form under the Exchange Act); and (iii) fairly present, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company and its

adjustments that are not, individually or in the aggregate, material). No
financial statements of any Person other than the Acquired Corporations are
required by GAAP to be included in the consolidated financial statements of
the Company.

  



  

(c) The Company maintains, and at all times since February 1, 2012
has maintained, a system of internal controls over financial reporting (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) which is
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP, and includes those policies and procedures
that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the Acquired Corporations; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are
being made only in

accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company;
and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the assets of
the Acquired Corporations that could have a material effect on the financial
statements. The Company's management has completed an assessment of the
effectiveness of the Company's system of internal controls over financial
reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, and, except as set forth
in the Company SEC Documents filed prior to the date of this Agreement, such
assessment concluded that such controls were effective. To the knowledge of
the Company, except as set forth in the Company SEC Documents filed prior to
the date of this Agreement, since February 1, 2012, none of the Acquired
Corporations nor the Company's independent registered accountant has
identified or been made aware of: (1) any significant deficiency or material
weakness in the design or operation of internal control over financial
reporting utilized by the Acquired Corporations; (2) any illegal act or
fraud, whether or not material, that involves the management or other
employees of any Acquired Corporation; or (3) any claim or allegation
regarding any of the foregoing.

reasonably designed to ensure that all information required to be disclosed
in the Company's reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the rules and forms of the SEC and that all such information is
accumulated and communicated to the Company's management as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to enable each of
the principal executive officer of the Company and the principal financial
officer of the Company to make the certifications required under the Exchange
Act with respect to such reports. The Company is in compliance in all
material respects with all current listing and corporate governance
requirements of NYSE.

including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose Entity,
on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in
Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act)) where the result,
purpose or intended effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any
material transaction involving, or material liabilities of, any Acquired
Corporation in any Acquired Corporation's published financial statements or
other Company SEC Documents.

  



  

(f) As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or
unresolved comments in comment letters received from the SEC with respect to
the Company SEC Documents. To the knowledge of the Company, none of the

4.9 Financing.

  



  

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company true, correct and complete
copies, as of the date of this Agreement, of (i) an executed
commitment letter dated as of the date of this Agreement (the " _Equity
Funding Letter_ ") from the Equity Investor to invest, subject to the terms
and conditions therein, cash in the aggregate amount set forth therein to
Parent (the " _Equity Financing_ ") and (ii) an executed commitment letter
and Redacted Fee Letters from Jefferies Finance LLC and Bank of Montreal
(collectively, the " _Lenders_ "), each dated as of the date of this Agreement
(collectively, the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ " and, together with the Equity
Funding Letter, the " _Financing Letters_ ") to provide, subject to the terms
and conditions therein, debt financing in the amounts set forth
therein (being collectively referred to as the " _Debt Financing_ ", and
together with the Equity Financing collectively referred to as the "
_Financing_ ") for the purpose of consummating the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. As of the date hereof, none of the Equity Funding Letter
or the Debt Commitment

  



    

36

Table of Contents 
--- 

    



  

Letter has been amended or modified, no such amendment or modification is
contemplated, and the respective loan obligations and commitments
contained in such Financing Letters have not been withdrawn or rescinded in
any respect. As of the date hereof, Parent or Co-Borrower has fully paid any
and all commitment fees or other fees in connection with the Equity Funding
Letter and the Debt Commitment Letter that are due and payable. The net
proceeds of the Financing, when funded in accordance with the Financing
Letters (including after giving effect to all applicable fees, expenses,
original issue discount and similar premiums and charges and after giving
effect to the maximum amount of "flex" (including original issue discount and
"flex")) will, in the aggregate, be sufficient for Merger Sub and the
Surviving Corporation to pay the Offer Price in respect of each Share validly
tendered and accepted for payment in the Offer, the aggregate Merger
Consideration, all amounts required to be paid pursuant to Section 2.8 (and
any repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated by this Agreement or
required as a result of the consummation of the transactions hereunder, the
Equity Funding Letter or the Debt Commitment Letter) and any other amounts
required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the Transactions
and to pay all related fees and expenses. The Financing Letters, in the form
delivered to the Company, are in full force and effect as of the date hereof
and constitute a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and Co-
Borrower, as applicable, enforceable in accordance with their terms and, to
the knowledge of each of Parent and Co-Borrower, as applicable, of the other
parties thereto. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred
which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would
reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent
or Co-Borrower or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other parties thereto,
under the Equity Funding Letter or the Debt Commitment Letter; provided that
Parent and Merger Sub are not making any representation or warranty regarding
the effect of any inaccuracy of the representations and warranties set forth
in Section 3, or the Company's compliance hereunder; provided, further that
neither Parent nor Merger Sub is aware of any fact, occurrence or condition
that would reasonably be expected to make any of the assumptions,
statements, representations or warranties in the Financing Letters inaccurate
in any material respect or that would reasonably be expected to cause the
commitments provided in the Financing Letters to be terminated or ineffective
or any of the conditions contained in the Financing Letters not to be met. As
of the date of this Agreement, Parent does not have any reason to believe that
any of the conditions precedent of Parent to the Financing will not be
satisfied on a timely basis or that the Financing will not be available to
Parent or Merger Sub at the Acceptance Time or on the date of the Closing if
an Offer Termination occurs; _provided that_ Parent is not making any
representation regarding the accuracy of the representations and warranties
set forth in Section 3, or compliance by the Company with its obligations
hereunder; provided, further that neither Parent nor Merger Sub is aware of
any fact, occurrence or condition that would reasonably be expected to make
any of the assumptions, statements, representations or warranties in the
Financing Letters inaccurate in any material respect or that would reasonably
be expected to cause the commitments provided in the Financing Letters to be
terminated or ineffective or any of the conditions contained in the Financing
Letters not to be met. The Financing Letters contain all of the conditions
precedent of Parent and Merger Sub to the obligations of the Equity Provider
and the Financing Sources thereunder to make Financing available to Parent or
the Merger Sub on the terms therein. There are no contingencies that would
permit the Equity Investor or the Lenders either to reduce the total amount of
the Financing contemplated by the Financing Letters or to impose any
additional conditions precedent or contingency to the availability of
the Financing contemplated by the

  



    

37 
--- 

 

Table of Contents 
--- 

    



  

Financing Letters. As of the date hereof, there are no side letters or other
agreements, Contracts or arrangements related to the funding or investing, as
applicable, of the full amount of the Financing other than any customary
engagement letters and non-disclosure agreements that do not impact the
conditionality for the Financing to occur or amount of the Financing. The
Equity Funding Letter provides, and will continue to provide, that the
Company is a third party beneficiary thereof in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Equity Funding Letter as of the date hereof.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the net proceeds of the Equity Financing, when funded in accordance
with the Equity Funding Letter, will be sufficient for Merger Sub and the
Surviving Corporation to pay the Offer Price in respect of each Share validly
tendered and accepted for payment in the Offer, the aggregate Merger
Consideration, all amounts required to be paid pursuant to Section 2.8 (and
any repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated by this Agreement or
required as a result of the consummation of the transactions hereunder or the
Equity Funding Letter) and any other amounts required to be paid in
connection with the consummation of the Transactions and to pay all related
fees and expenses.

  



  

4.10 Solvency. Assuming (a) satisfaction of the conditions to Parent's
obligation to consummate the Offer and/or the Merger (as applicable), and

all of such Financing may be amended or replaced in compliance with Section
6.11 hereof), (b) any repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated in this
Agreement or the Financing Letters, (c) the accuracy of the representations

all related fees and expenses, each of Parent and the Acquired Corporations
(taken as a whole) will be Solvent as of the Effective Time and immediately
after the consummation of the Transactions. For the purposes of this
Agreement, the term " _Solvent_ " when used with respect to any Person and
its Subsidiaries, means that, as of any date of determination (x) the amount
of the "fair saleable value" of the assets of such Person and its
Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) will, as of such date, exceed (i) the value
of all liabilities of such Person and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole),
including contingent and other liabilities, as of such date, as such quoted
terms are generally determined in accordance with applicable Legal
Requirements governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors, and (ii)
the amount that will be required to pay the probable liabilities of such
Person and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) on their existing debts
(including contingent and other liabilities) as such debts become absolute
and mature, (y) such Person and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) will not
have, as of such date, an "unreasonably small amount of capital" for the
operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged
following such date, and (z) such Person and its Subsidiaries (taken as a
whole) will be able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and other
liabilities, as they mature.

receive consideration of a different amount or nature than the Merger
Consideration or pursuant to which any stockholder of the Company agrees to
vote to approve this Agreement or the Merger or agrees to vote against any
Superior Offer.

its Subsidiaries except for Persons, if any, whose fees and expenses will be
paid by Parent.

dissolution, merger, consolidation, restructuring, recapitalization or other
reorganization of the Company or any of the other Acquired Corporations; or

  



  

(xxi) authorize any of, or agree or commit to take, any of the actions
described in clauses "(i)" through "(xx)" of this Section 5.2(b).

  



  

During the Pre-Closing Period, without the written consent of the Company
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), Parent and Merger Sub shall not, and shall cause the Equity
Investor, the Co-Borrower and their respective Affiliates to not, (i) enter
into discussions or negotiations of any Contracts or other agreements,
arrangements or understandings (whether oral or written) or commitments to
enter into agreements, arrangements or understandings (whether oral or
written) or (ii) amend or otherwise supplement any agreements, arrangements
or understandings (whether oral or written) in existence on the date of
this Agreement, in the case of clauses "(i)" and "(ii)" that are between
Parent, Merger Sub, the Co-Borrower, the Equity Investor or any of their
respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and any officer or director of the
Company, on the other hand, that relate in any way to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or the Transaction.

  



  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall give to Parent
or Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, rights to control or direct the
operations of the Acquired Corporations prior to the Effective Time, and
nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to give the Company, directly
or indirectly, the right to control or direct Parent's or its Subsidiaries'
operations. Prior to the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Company shall
exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions hereof, complete control
and supervision of its and its Subsidiaries' respective operations.

  



  

5.3 No Solicitation.

  



  

(a) For the purposes of this Agreement, " _Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement_ " means any customary confidentiality and standstill agreement
that contains provisions that are no less favorable in the aggregate to the
Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_
that an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement may permit the submission of
Acquisition Proposals to the Company's Board of Directors on a private and
confidential basis.

  



  

(b) Except as permitted by this Section 5.3, during the Pre-Closing
Period the Company shall not and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries not to
and shall direct its Representatives not to (i) continue any solicitation,
knowing encouragement, discussions or negotiations with any Persons that may
be ongoing with respect to an Acquisition Proposal and (ii) directly or
indirectly, (A) solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage
(including by way of furnishing non-public information) any inquiries
regarding, or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or could
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (B) engage
in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any other Person any non-public information in
connection with or for the purpose of knowingly encouraging or facilitating,
an Acquisition Proposal or any proposal or offer that could reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal or (C) enter into any

letter of intent, acquisition agreement, agreement in principle or similar
agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or any proposal or offer
that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal. The
Company shall promptly deliver a written notice to each Person that entered
into a confidentiality agreement in anticipation of potentially making an
Acquisition Proposal, to the effect that the Company is ending all
discussions and negotiations with such Person with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal, effective on the date hereof, and the notice shall also request
such Person to promptly return or destroy all confidential information
concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(c) If at any time on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to
the Acceptance Time (or, if the Offer Termination shall occur, at any time
prior to obtaining the Required Company Stockholder Vote), the Company or any
of its Representatives receives an unsolicited  _bona fide_ written
Acquisition Proposal from any Person or group of Persons, which Acquisition
Proposal was made or renewed on or after the date of this Agreement and did
not result from any breach of this Section 5.3, (i) the Company and its
Representatives may contact such Person or group of Persons to clarify the
terms and conditions thereof and (ii) if the Company's Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with independent financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Offer, then
the Company and its Representatives may (x) furnish, pursuant to (but only
pursuant to) an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, information (including
non-public information) with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to
the Person or group of Persons who has made such Acquisition Proposal;
_provided that_ the Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours)
provide to Parent any non-public information concerning the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries that is provided to any Person given such access which was
not previously provided to Parent or its Representatives and (y) engage in or
otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person or group
of Persons making such Acquisition Proposal.

  



  

(d) Following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall promptly
(and in any event within 24 hours) notify Parent if any inquiries,
proposals or offers with respect to an Acquisition Proposal are received by
the Company or any of its Representatives and provide to Parent a summary of
the material terms and conditions of any Acquisition Proposal and keep Parent
reasonably informed of any material developments, discussions or negotiations
regarding any Acquisition Proposal on a prompt basis (and in any event within
24 hours) and upon the request of Parent shall reasonably inform Parent of
the status of such Acquisition Proposal. The Company agrees that it and its
Subsidiaries will not enter into any confidentiality agreement with any Person
subsequent to the date hereof which prohibits the Company from providing any
information to Parent in accordance with this Section 5.3 or otherwise
prohibit the Company from complying with its obligations under this Section
5.3.

  



  

(e) Nothing in this Section 5.3 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of
the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making
any disclosure to the stockholders of the Company that is required by
applicable Legal Requirements; _provided_ , that making such disclosure under
clause (i) or (ii) shall not in any way limit or modify the effect, if any,
that any such action has under Sections 5.3 or 6.1.

(f)   The Company agrees that in the event any Subsidiary or
Representative of the Company takes any action which, if taken by the
Company, would constitute a breach of this Section 5.3, the Company shall
be deemed to be in breach of this Section 5.3.

  



  

SECTION 6. Additional Covenants of the Parties

  



  

6.1 Company Board Recommendation; Proxy Statement; Stockholder
Approval.

  



  

(a) The Company hereby consents to the Offer and represents that its
Board of Directors, at a meeting duly called and held, has made the Company
Board Recommendation. Subject to Section 6.1(b), the Company hereby consents
to the inclusion of a description of the Company Board Recommendation in the
Offer Documents. During the Pre-Closing Period, neither the Board of Directors
of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i)(A) withdraw (or modify in
a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), or publicly propose to withdraw
(or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), the Company Board
Recommendation or (B) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose
publicly to approve, recommend or declare advisable, any Acquisition Proposal
(any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a " _Company
Adverse Change Recommendation_ ") or (ii) approve, recommend or declare
advisable, or propose to approve, recommend or declare advisable, or allow any
Acquired Corporation to execute or enter into any Contract with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal, or requiring, or reasonably expected to cause, the
Company to abandon, terminate, delay or fail to consummate, or that would
otherwise materially impede, interfere with or be inconsistent with, the
Transactions (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement).

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time and, at any time prior to
the receipt of the Required Stockholder Vote:

  



  

(i) if the Company has received a bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal (which Acquisition Proposal did not arise out of a breach of Section
5.3) from any Person that has not been withdrawn and after consultation with
outside legal counsel, the Company's Board of Directors shall have
determined, in good faith, that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Offer,
(x) the Company's Board of Directors may make a Company Adverse Change
Recommendation, or (y) the Company may terminate this Agreement to enter into
a Specified Agreement with respect to such Superior Offer, if and only if: (A)
the Company's Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation
with the Company's outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would
reasonably constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Board of
Directors of the Company to the Company's stockholders under applicable Legal
Requirements; (B) the Company shall have given Parent prior written notice of
its intention to consider making a Company Adverse Change Recommendation
pursuant to this Section 6.1(b)(i) or terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(f) at least four (4) business days prior to making any such
Company Adverse Change Recommendation or termination (a "
_Determination Notice_ ") (which notice shall not constitute a Company
Adverse Change Recommendation); and (C) (1) the Company shall have provided
to Parent the material terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal in
accordance with Section 5.3(d), (2) the Company shall have given Parent the
four (4) business days after the Determination Notice to propose revisions to
the terms of this Agreement or make another proposal so that such Acquisition

  



    

46 
--- 

 

Table of Contents 
--- 

    



  

Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Offer, and shall have
negotiated in good faith with Parent with respect to such proposed revisions
or other proposal, if any, and (3) after considering the results of such
negotiations and giving effect to the proposals (including the Financing
Letters and Guaranty) made by Parent, if any, after consultation with outside
legal counsel, the Company's Board of Directors shall have determined, in
good faith, that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Offer and that the
failure to make the Company Adverse Change Recommendation or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(f) would reasonably constitute a breach of
fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of the Company to the Company's
stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements. Issuance of any "stop, look
and listen" communication by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to
Rule 14d-9(f) shall not be considered a Company Adverse Change Recommendation
and shall not require the giving of a Determination Notice or compliance with
the procedures set forth in this Section 6.1. For the avoidance of doubt, the
provisions of this Section 6.1(b)(i) shall also apply to any material
amendment to any Acquisition Proposal and require a new Determination Notice,
except that the references to four (4) business days shall be deemed to be
two (2) business days; and

  



  

(ii) other than in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, the
Company's Board of Directors may make a Company Adverse Change
Recommendation in response to a Change in Circumstance, if and only if: (A)
the Company's Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation
with the Company's outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would
reasonably constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Board of
Directors of the Company to the Company's stockholders under applicable Legal
Requirements; (B) the Company shall have given Parent a Determination Notice
at least four (4) business days prior to making any such Company Adverse
Change Recommendation; and (C) (1) the Company shall have specified the Change
in Circumstance in reasonable detail, (2) the Company shall have given Parent
the four (4) business days after the Determination Notice to propose revisions
to the terms of this Agreement or make another proposal so that such Change
in Circumstance would no longer necessitate a Company Adverse
Change Recommendation, and shall have negotiated in good faith with Parent
with respect to such proposed revisions or other proposal, if any, and (3)
after considering the results of such negotiations and giving effect to the
proposals (including the Financing Letters and Guaranty) made by Parent, if
any, after consultation with outside legal counsel, the Company's Board of
Directors shall have determined, in good faith, that the failure to make the
Company Adverse Change Recommendation in response to such Change in
Circumstance would reasonably constitute a breach of fiduciary duties of the
Board of Directors of the Company to the Company's stockholders under
applicable Legal Requirements. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of
this Section 6.1(b)(ii) shall also apply to any material change to the facts
and circumstances relating to such Change in Circumstance and require a new
Determination Notice, except that the references to four (4) business days
shall be deemed to be two (2) business days.

  



  

(c) As soon as practicable following the date hereof, the Company
shall prepare the Proxy Statement in preliminary form and file it with the
SEC and the Company and Parent shall timely cooperate with and assist the
Company in connection with the preparation of the foregoing. Subject to
Section 6.1(b), the Proxy Statement shall reflect the Company Board
Recommendation. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments of the SEC or
its staff concerning the Proxy Statement. Parent and Merger Sub will provide
to the Company upon request any information

  



    

47

Table of Contents 
--- 

    



  

with respect to Parent and Merger Sub and their respective officers,
directors, Affiliates and agents required to be provided in the Proxy
Statement under applicable Legal Requirements or as reasonably requested by
the Company. The Company shall notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any
comments from the SEC or its staff or any other governmental officials and of
any request by the SEC or its staff or any other governmental officials for
amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional information
and will supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company
or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff or
any other governmental officials, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy
Statement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated above, prior to
filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto)
or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company
shall give Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such
document or response and the Company shall give due consideration to all
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent. The
Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, agree
to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Proxy
Statement if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading
in any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable Legal
Requirements, and the Company further agrees to cause the Proxy Statement, as
so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and, if any such correction is made
following the mailing of the Proxy Statement, mailed to holders of Shares, in
each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act or the SEC (or its
staff). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company assumes no responsibility
with respect to information supplied in writing by or on behalf of Parent or
Merger Sub specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Proxy Statement.

  



  

(d) If the adoption of this Agreement by the Company's stockholders
is required by applicable Legal Requirements, then the Company shall have the
right, at any time after the latest of (i) the Initial Expiration Date, (ii)
three (3) business days after the Proxy Statement Clearance Date and (iii)
November 20, 2013, to (and Parent and Merger Sub shall have the right, at any
time beginning three (3) business days after the Proxy Statement Clearance
Date, to request in writing that the Company, and upon receipt of such
written request, the Company shall), as promptly as reasonably practicable,
take all action necessary under all applicable Legal Requirements, the
Company's Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws and the rules of NYSE to
establish a record date for (and the Company shall not change such record
date without the prior written consent of Parent), and as soon as
practicable after the Offer Termination, call, and give notice of a meeting
of the holders of the Shares to vote on the adoption of this Agreement and
approval of the Merger (including any adjournment or postponement thereof, the
" _Company Stockholders ' Meeting_") and mail to the holders of Company
Common Stock as of the record date established for the Company Stockholders'
Meeting a Proxy Statement. The Company shall ensure that all proxies
solicited by the Company in connection with the Company Stockholders' Meeting
are solicited in compliance in all material respects with all applicable Legal
Requirements. Subject to Sections 5.3 and 6.1, and the Offer Termination, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Required Company
Stockholder Vote. The Company in its sole discretion may adjourn or postpone
the Company Stockholders' Meeting after consultation with Parent, and with
Parent's consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
(A) to the extent necessary to ensure that any legally required supplement or
amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the stockholders of the
Company within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the Company
Stockholders' Meeting or (B) if as of the time for which the
Company Stockholders' Meeting is

  



    

48

Table of Contents 
--- 

    



  

originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are
insufficient Shares represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a
quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholders'
Meeting. Unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with
Section 8.1, the Company shall submit this Agreement and the Merger to its
stockholders at the Company Stockholders' Meeting even if the Company's Board
of Directors shall have made a Company Adverse Change Recommendation.

  



  

(e) Parent agrees to cause all Shares owned by Parent or any
subsidiary of Parent to be voted in favor of the adoption of the Agreement
at the Company Stockholders' Meeting.

  



  

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, if, at any time after the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer
by Merger Sub, the number of actually outstanding Shares owned by Merger Sub,
together with any outstanding Shares owned by Parent and Parent's other
affiliates, shall collectively represent at least 90% of the actually
outstanding Shares, then Parent shall take all actions necessary and
appropriate to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable
without a meeting of the holders of Shares in accordance with Section 253 of
the DGCL.

  



  

6.2 Filings, Consents and Approvals.

  



  

(a) The Parties agree to use their reasonable best efforts to take
promptly any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment under the Antitrust Laws, that may be asserted by any Governmental
Body or other person, so as to enable the Closing to occur expeditiously, but
in no case later than the End Date, including (i) negotiating, committing to
and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale,
lease, license, divestiture or disposition of any assets, rights, product
lines, or businesses of Parent or its Subsidiaries and/or those of the
Acquired Corporations, _provided that_ the Acquired Corporations will only be
required to take or commit to take any such action, or agree to any such
condition or restriction, if such action, commitment, agreement, condition or
restriction is binding on the Acquired Corporations only in the event
the Closing occurs; and (ii) provide as promptly as reasonably practicable
all information required by any Governmental Body pursuant to its evaluation
of the Transactions under the HSR Act (or other applicable Antitrust Laws). By
way of illustration and not limitation, the Parties agree to promptly take,
and cause their affiliates to take, all actions and steps requested or
required by any Governmental Body as a condition to granting any consent,
permit, authorization, waiver, clearance and approvals, and to cause the
prompt expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period and to
resolve such objections, if any, as the FTC and the DOJ, or other
Governmental Bodies of any other jurisdiction for which consents, permits,
authorizations, waivers, clearances, approvals and expirations
or terminations of waiting periods are sought with respect to the
Transactions, so as to obtain termination of the waiting period under the HSR
Act or other Antitrust Laws, and to avoid the commencement of a lawsuit by the
FTC, the DOJ or other Governmental Bodies under Antitrust Laws, and to avoid
the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary
restraining order or other order in any suit or proceeding which would
otherwise have the effect of preventing the Closing or materially
delaying the Closing. The Parties shall defend through litigation on the
merits any claim asserted in court by any party under Antitrust Laws in order
to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any decree, order or
judgment (whether

  



     

49 
--- 

 

Table of Contents 
--- 

    



  

temporary, preliminary or permanent) that could restrain, delay, or prevent
the Closing by the End Date.

  



  

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the
Parties hereto shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates, if
applicable, to): (i) promptly, but in no event later than five (5) business
days after the date hereof, make an appropriate filing of all Notification
and Report forms as required by the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions;
and (ii) cooperate with each other in determining whether, and promptly
preparing and making, any other filings, notifications or other consents are
required to be made with, or obtained from, any other Governmental Bodies in
connection with the Transactions.

  



  

(c) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this
Section 6.2, during the Pre-Closing Period, each Party hereto shall use its
reasonable best efforts to (i) give the other Parties prompt notice of the
making or commencement of any request, inquiry, investigation, action or
Legal Proceeding brought by a Governmental Body or brought by a third party
before any Governmental Body, in each case, with respect to the Transactions,
(ii) keep the other Parties reasonably informed as to the status of any such
request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding, (iii) promptly
inform the other Parties of any communication to or from the FTC, DOJ or any
other Governmental Body in connection with any such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or Legal Proceeding, (iv) promptly furnish to the other
Party, subject to an appropriate confidentiality agreement to limit disclosure
to counsel and outside consultants, with copies of documents provided to or
received from any Governmental Body in connection with any such
request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding (other than "4(c)
documents" as that term is used in the rules and regulations under the HSR
Act), (v) subject to an appropriate confidentiality agreement to limit
disclosure to counsel and outside consultants, and to the extent reasonably
practicable, consult and cooperate with the other Parties and will
consider in good faith the views of the other Parties in connection with any
analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or
proposal made or submitted in connection with any such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or Legal Proceeding, and (vi) except as may be
prohibited by any Governmental Body or by any Legal Requirement, in connection
with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding in
respect of the Transactions, each Party hereto will permit authorized
Representatives of the other Party to be present at each meeting or
conference relating to such request, inquiry, investigation, action or
Legal Proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in connection with
any argument, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Body
in connection with such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal
Proceeding.

  



  

6.3 Company Options.

  



  

(a) Prior to the Acceleration Time, the Company shall take all actions
(including obtaining any necessary determinations and/or resolutions of the
Board of Directors of the Company or a committee thereof) that may be
necessary (under the Company Equity Plans and award agreements pursuant to
which Company Options are outstanding or otherwise) to (i) accelerate the
vesting and exercisability of each unexpired and unexercised Company Option
then outstanding as of immediately prior to the Acceleration Time so that each
such Company Option shall be fully vested and exercisable prior to the
Acceleration Time, (ii) terminate each Company Equity Plan (except as
otherwise agreed by Parent and the Company) and (iii) cause,

  



    

50 
--- 

 

Table of Contents 
--- 

    



  

as of the Acceleration Time, each unexpired and unexercised Company Option
then outstanding as of immediately prior to the Acceleration Time, whether
vested or unvested (and each plan, if any, under which any Company Option may
be granted except, with respect to any such plan, as otherwise agreed by
Parent and the Company) to be cancelled, terminated and extinguished, subject,
if applicable, to payment pursuant to Section 2.8.

  



  

6.4 Employee Benefits. For a period of one year following the Effective
Time, Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, to those employees of
the Acquired Corporations who are employed by the Acquired Corporations as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time and who continue to be actively
employed by the Surviving Corporation (or any Subsidiary thereof) during such
one year period (the " _Continuing Employees_ ") base salary and base wages,
short-term cash incentive compensation opportunities and benefits (excluding
equity based compensation) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate
to such base salary and base wages, short-term cash incentive compensation
opportunities and benefits (excluding equity based compensation) provided to
such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the execution of this
Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing:

  



  

(a) With respect to any accrued but unused personal, sick or vacation
time to which any Continuing Employee is entitled pursuant to the personal,
sick or vacation policies applicable to such Continuing Employee immediately
prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to and instruct its Subsidiaries to, as applicable (and without
duplication of benefits), assume the liability for such accrued personal,
sick or vacation time and allow such Continuing Employee to use such accrued
personal, sick or vacation time in accordance with the practice and policies
of the applicable Acquired Corporation.

  



  

(b) Parent agrees that all Continuing Employees shall be eligible to
continue to participate in the Surviving Corporation's health and welfare
benefit plans (to the same extent such Continuing Employees were eligible to
participate under the Acquired Corporations' health and welfare benefit plans
immediately prior to the Effective Time); _provided, however_ , that (i)
nothing in this Section 6.4 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall limit the
right of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to amend or terminate any such
health or welfare benefit plan at any time, and (ii) if Parent or the
Surviving Corporation terminates any such health or welfare benefit plan,
then (upon expiration of any appropriate transition period), the Continuing
Employees shall be eligible to participate in the Surviving Corporation's
health and welfare benefit plans to the extent that coverage under such
plans is replacing comparable coverage under an Employee Plan in which such
Continuing Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time. To
the extent that service is relevant for eligibility or vesting purposes or for
the purpose of determining future paid time off accruals under any
retirement, health or welfare benefit plan of Parent and/or the Surviving
Corporation, then Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
ensure that such retirement, health or welfare benefit plan shall, for
purposes of eligibility or vesting purposes or for the purpose of determining
future paid time off accruals but not for purposes of benefit accrual, credit
Continuing Employees for service prior to the Effective Time with the Acquired
Corporations to the same extent that such service was recognized prior to the
Effective Time under the corresponding health or welfare benefit plan of the
Company. Nothing in this Section 6.4 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be
construed to create a right in any employee to employment with Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any other Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation and
the employment of each Continuing Employee shall be "at will" employment.

(c) The provisions of this Section 6.4 are solely for the benefit of
the Parties to this Agreement, and no provision of this Section 6.4 is
intended to, or shall, constitute the establishment or adoption of or an
amendment to any employee benefit plan for purposes of ERISA or otherwise and
no current or former employee or any other individual associated therewith
shall be regarded for any purpose as a third party beneficiary of the
Agreement or have the right to enforce the provisions hereof.

  



  

6.5 Indemnification of Officers and Directors.

  



  

(a) All rights to indemnification by the Acquired Corporations
existing in favor of those Persons who are directors and officers of
any Acquired Corporation as of the date of this Agreement (the " _Indemnified
Persons_ ") for their acts and omissions occurring prior to the Effective
Time, as provided in the Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws of the
Acquired Corporations (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) and as
provided in the indemnification agreements between the Acquired
Corporations and said Indemnified Persons (as set forth on Part 6.5(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule and in effect as of the date of this Agreement)
in the forms made available by the Company to Parent or Parent's
Representatives prior to the date of this Agreement, shall survive the Merger
and shall be observed by the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to the
fullest extent available under Delaware law for a period of six years from
the Effective Time, and any claim made requesting indemnification pursuant
to such indemnification rights within such six-year period shall continue to
be subject to this Section 6.5(a) and the indemnification rights provided
under this Section 6.5(a) until disposition of such claim.

  



  

(b) From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the date on
which the Effective Time occurs, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation (together with its successors and assigns, the " _Indemnifying
Parties_ ") shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Legal
Requirements, indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Person in his or
her capacity as an officer or director of an Acquired Corporation against all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, fees, expenses, judgments or fines
incurred by such Indemnified Person as an officer or director of an Acquired
Corporation in connection with any pending or threatened Legal Proceeding
based on or arising out of, in whole or in part, the fact that such
Indemnified Person is or was a director or officer of an Acquired Corporation
at or prior to the Effective Time and pertaining to any and all matters
pending, existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, including any
such matter arising under any claim with respect to the transactions
contemplated herein. Without limiting the foregoing, from the Effective Time
until the sixth anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs,
the Indemnifying Parties shall also, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Legal Requirements, advance reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys' fees)
incurred by the Indemnified Persons in connection with matters for which such
Indemnified Persons are eligible to be indemnified pursuant to this Section
6.5(b) within fifteen days after receipt by Parent of a written request for

the existing policy of directors' and officers' liability insurance
maintained by the Company as of the date of this Agreement (a true and
correct copy of which has been made available by the Company to Parent or

existing policy effective as of the Effective Time) and if such "tail policy"
has been obtained, it shall be deemed to satisfy all obligations to obtain
and/or maintain insurance pursuant to this Section 6.5(c); _provided, however_
, that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in
any one year an amount in excess of 250% of the annual premium currently

being able to be satisfied prior to the End Date. Parent will give prompt

flex provisions) described in the Financing Letters, and shall not permit any
amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision
under, the Financing Letters if such amendment, modification or waiver (A)
with respect to the Financing Letters, reduces (or would reasonably be
expected to have the effect of reducing) the aggregate amount of the Financing
(including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue
discount unless (x) the Debt Financing or the Equity Financing is increased
by a corresponding amount or the Debt Financing is otherwise made available to
fund such fees or original issue discount and (y) after giving effect to any
of the transactions referred to in clause "(x)" above, the representation and
warranty set forth in Section 4.10 shall be true and correct) or (B) imposes
new or additional conditions precedent or otherwise expands, amends or
modifies any of the conditions precedent to the receipt of the Financing or
otherwise expands, amends or modifies any other provision of the Financing
Letters, in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (x) delay or prevent
or make less likely the funding of the Financing (or satisfaction of the
conditions precedent to the Financing) at the Acceptance Time or the
Effective Time, as applicable, or (y) adversely impacts the ability of Parent
or Co-Borrower or the Company, as applicable, to enforce its rights against
other parties to the Financing Letters or the definitive agreements with
respect thereto (provided that, subject to compliance with the other
provisions of this Section 6.11(a), Parent and Co-Borrower may amend the Debt

(taken as a whole) to Parent or Co-Borrower than the terms and conditions
(including flex provisions) in the Debt Commitment Letter), (C) to satisfy on
a timely basis all conditions precedent to funding in the Debt Commitment
Letter and such definitive agreements thereto and in the Equity Funding
Letter and to consummate the Financing at or prior to the earlier to occur of

circumstances and available sources of cash are not otherwise available to
consummate the transactions contemplated herein, enforce its rights under the
Financing Letters (including, if appropriate, through litigation pursued in
good faith). Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed on a current

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent and Co-Borrower
shall give the Company prompt (but in any event within two (2) business days)
written notice (x) of any breach or default by any party to any of the
Financing Letters or definitive agreements related to the Financing of which
Parent or Co-Borrower become aware, (y) of the receipt of (A) any written
notice or (B) other written communication, in each case from any Financing
Source with respect to any (1) actual or potential breach, default,
termination or repudiation by any party to any of the Financing Letters or
definitive agreements related to the Financing of any provisions of the
Financing Letters or definitive agreements related to the Financing or (2)
material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to any of the
Financing Letters or definitive agreements related to the Financing with
respect to the obligation to fund the Financing or the amount of the
Financing to be funded at Closing, and (z) if at any time for any reason
Parent or Co-Borrower believes in good faith that it will not be able to
obtain all or any portion of the Financing on the terms and conditions, in
the manner or from the sources contemplated by any of the Financing Letters or
definitive agreements related to the Financing. As soon as reasonably
practicable, but in any event within two (2) business days of the date the
Company delivers to Parent or Co-Borrower a written request, Parent and Co-
Borrower shall provide any information reasonably requested by the Company
relating to any circumstance referred to in clause "(x)", "(y)" or "(z)" of
the immediately preceding sentence; _provided_ , that they need not provide
any information believed to be privileged or that is requested for
purposes of litigation. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, upon the occurrence of any circumstance referred to in
clause "(x)", "(y)" or "(z)" of the second preceding sentence or if any
portion of the Debt Financing otherwise becomes unavailable, and such portion
is reasonably required to pay the Offer Price in respect of each Share
validly tendered and accepted for payment in the Offer, the aggregate Merger
Consideration, and all fees, expenses and other amounts contemplated to be
paid by Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation or Co-Borrower, as
applicable, pursuant to this Agreement, Parent and Co-Borrower shall (x)
promptly notify the Company of such unavailability and the reason therefor and
(y) use their reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain in replacement
thereof alternative debt financing from alternative sources in an amount
sufficient to consummate the Transactions with terms and conditions not
materially less favorable (taken as a whole) to Parent and Co-Borrower than
the terms and conditions (taken as a whole) set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter and which

would not reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or materially delay the
consummation of the Financing or the transactions contemplated by this

letters evidencing such Available Financing (collectively, the " _Available
Financing Letters_ ") also being referred to herein as a Financing Letter and
any debt financing contemplated thereby being referred to herein as Debt
Financing); provided that such Available Financing Letters shall be subject to
the same restrictions set forth in Section 6.11(a) hereof as if the entering
into of such Available Financing Letters were an amendment, modification or
waiver to the existing Debt Financing Letters. Parent shall deliver to the
Company true and complete copies of all Available Financing Letters
(including Redacted Fee Letters) pursuant to which any such alternative source
shall have committed to provide any portion of the Debt Financing at least
three (3) business days prior to execution thereof, with executed copies being
delivered upon execution thereof.

  



  

(iii) Without the prior written consent of the Company, other than
with respect to the Merger, the Financing, and the other Transactions
contemplated hereby, Parent shall not, nor shall it permit any of its

venture, disposition or debt or equity financing that would reasonably be
expected to impair, delay or prevent consummation of all or any portion of
the Debt Financing.

  



  

(iv) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent and
Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that obtaining the Financing or any
alternative financing is not a condition to their obligations to close the
Offer and the Merger, and reaffirm their obligation to consummate the
Offer and the Merger and their other obligations under this Agreement
irrespective and independently of the availability of the Financing, subject
to (i) the Company's compliance in all material respects with its obligations
pursuant to this Section 6.11, (ii) the Marketing Period shall have been
completed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and (iii) the

Required Company Stockholder Vote, except as otherwise expressly noted):

  



  

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company at any time
prior to the Acceptance Time or if an Offer Termination occurs, at any time
thereafter;

  



  

(b) by either the Company or Parent, if the (i) Offer Termination
occurs and (ii) the Company Stockholders' Meeting (including any adjournments
and postponements thereof) shall have been held and completed and the
Company's stockholders shall have taken a final vote on a proposal to approve
this Agreement and the Merger, and this Agreement and the Merger shall not
have been approved at the Company Stockholders' Meeting (and shall not have
been approved at any adjournment or postponement thereof) by the Required
Company Stockholder Vote; _provided that_ the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b) shall not be available to a Party
if such Party is in breach of its obligations under Section 6.1(c) or (d);

  



  

(c) by either Parent or the Company if a court of competent
jurisdiction or other Governmental Body shall have issued a decree or
ruling, or shall have taken any other action, having the effect of
permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
acceptance for payment of Shares pursuant to the Merger or making
consummation of the Merger illegal, which order, decree, ruling or
other action shall be final and nonappealable; _provided_ , _however_ , that
a Party shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 8.1(c) if the issuance of such final and nonappealable order, decree,
ruling or other action is primarily attributable to a failure on the part of
such Party to perform in any material respect any covenant or obligation in
this Agreement required to be performed by such Party at or prior to the
Effective Time;

  



  

(d) by Parent at any time prior to the earlier to occur of the

days, _provided_ , _further_ , _that_ if an Acquisition Proposal shall have
been publicly disclosed, Parent may make such request up to three (3) times
every thirty (30) days; or (C) in the case of a tender offer or exchange

rejection of such tender offer or exchange offer within ten (10) business
days of the commencement of such tender offer or exchange offer or (ii)
there has occurred a material breach of Section 5.3;

  



  

(e) by either Parent or the Company if the Effective Time shall not
have occurred on or prior to the close of business on March 22, 2014 (the "
_End Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that a Party shall not be permitted to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(e) if the failure of
the Effective Time to occur prior to the End Date was primarily due to the
failure of such Party to perform in all material respects any of its
obligations under this Agreement;

  



  

(f) by the Company, at any time prior to the earlier to occur of the
Acceptance Time or receipt of the Required Company Stockholder Vote, in order
to accept a Superior Offer and enter into a binding written definitive
acquisition agreement providing for the consummation of a transaction
constituting a Superior Offer (a " _Specified Agreement_ "), if (i) the
Company has complied in all material respects with the requirements of
Section 5.3 and Section 6.1(a) and (ii) prior to such termination (or if
the Specified Agreement is executed on a day that is not a business day, the
preceding business day), the Company pays the Termination Fee due to Parent
under Section 8.3(b);

  



  

(g) by Parent at any time prior to the Acceptance Time or if an Offer
Termination occurs, at any time prior to the Closing, if a breach of any
representation or warranty or failure to perform any covenant or obligation
contained in this Agreement on the part of the Company shall have occurred
that (i) if the Offer Termination shall not have occurred, the condition set
forth in clause "(b)" or "(c)" of Annex I would not be satisfied, (ii) if the
Offer Termination shall have occurred, would cause a failure of the
conditions in Section 7.2(a), (b), (c), (d) or (e) to exist and in the case of
each of the foregoing clauses "(i)" and "(ii)" cannot be cured by the Company
by the End Date, or if capable of being cured, shall not have commenced to
have been cured within fifteen (15) days of the date Parent gives the Company
notice of such breach or failure to perform;  _provided, however,_ that,
Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 8.1(g) if either Parent or Merger Sub is then in material breach of
any representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements hereunder such
that the Company has the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.1(h);

  



  

(h) by the Company at any time prior to the Acceptance Time or if an
Offer Termination occurs, at any time prior to the Closing, if a breach of
any representation or warranty or failure to perform any covenant or
obligation contained in this Agreement on the part of Parent or Merger Sub
shall have occurred that would cause a failure of the conditions in Section
7.3(a), (b) or (c) to exist and cannot be cured by Parent or Merger Sub by
the End Date, or if capable of being cured, shall not have commenced to have
been cured within fifteen (15) days of the date the Company gives Parent
notice of such breach or failure to perform; _provided, however_ , that, the
Company shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 8.1(h) if it is then in material breach of any representations,
warranties, covenants or other agreements hereunder that would result in the
conditions to Closing set forth in Section 7.1 or Section 7.2 not being
satisfied;

(i) by the Company, if the Offer Termination has occurred and (A) the
Marketing Period has ended and the conditions set forth in Sections 7.1 and
7.2 (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by
actions taken at the Closing) have been satisfied, (B) the Company has
irrevocably confirmed by notice to Parent after the end of the Marketing
Period that all conditions set forth in Sections 7.1 and 7.2 have been
satisfied as of the date of such notice (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing) and, if
there any unsatisfied conditions in Section 7.3 (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the
Closing) that it is willing to waive any unsatisfied conditions in Section
7.3 (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by
actions taken at the Closing) and (C) the Merger shall not have been
consummated within three (3) business days after the delivery of such notice;

  



  

(j) by Parent or the Company if for any reason other than the
occurrence of the Offer Termination, the Offer (as it may have been
extended pursuant to Section 1.1(c)) expires as a result of the non-
satisfaction of one or more Offer Conditions, or is terminated or withdrawn
prior to the Acceptance Time, without Merger Sub having accepted for payment
any Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer; _provided, however_ , that a party
shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
8.1(j) if the non-satisfaction of any Offer Condition or the termination or
withdrawal of the Offer is attributable to the failure of such party (or any
affiliate of such party) to perform any covenant or other obligation under
this Agreement.

  



  

8.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement as provided in Section 8.1, written notice thereof shall be given
to the other Party or Parties, specifying the provision hereof pursuant to
which such termination is made, and this Agreement shall be of no further
force or effect and there shall be no liability on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub or the Company or their respective directors, officers and Affiliates
following any such termination; _provided, however,_ that (a) this
Section 8.2, Section 8.3, Section 9 and the expense reimbursement and
indemnification provisions of Section 6.11(b) shall survive the termination
of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect, (b) the
Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement and
shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms; (c) the
Guaranty shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall remain in
full force and effect in accordance with its terms; and (d) subject to the
limitations set forth in Section 8.3, the termination of this Agreement shall
not relieve any Party from any liability for willful and material breach of
this Agreement prior to the date of termination and common law fraud. Nothing
shall limit or prevent any Party from exercising any rights or remedies it
may have under Section 9.5(b) in lieu of terminating this Agreement pursuant
to Section 8.1.

  



  

8.3 Expenses; Termination Fee.

  



  

(a) Except as set forth in this Section 8.3 and the expense

is consummated.

(i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section
8.1(f);

  



  

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section
8.1(d)(i); or

  



  

(iii) (x) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(b) or
Section 8.1(g) (as a result of any willful breach), (y) any Person shall have
publicly disclosed or shall have made known to the Company's Board of
Directors a _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal after the date hereof and prior
to such termination (unless irrevocably, in good faith and, if such
Acquisition Proposal is public, publicly withdrawn prior to such
termination), and (z) within twelve (12) months of such termination the
Company shall have entered into a definitive agreement with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal or consummated an Acquisition Proposal (provided that
for purposes of this clause (z) the references to "20%" in the definition of
"Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be references to "80%");

  



  

then, in any such event under clause "(i)", "(ii)" or "(iii)" of this Section
8.3(b), the Company shall pay to Parent or its designee the applicable
Termination Fee (less, if applicable, the Expense Reimbursement previously
paid to Parent by the Company) by wire transfer of same day funds (x) in the
case of Section 8.3(b)(ii), within two (2) business days after such
termination, (y) prior to (or if the Specified Agreement is executed on a day
that is not a business day, the next business day) such termination if
pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i) or (z) in the case of Section 8.3(b)(iii),
prior to the consummation of the Acquisition Proposal referred to in subclause
(iii)(z) above; it being understood that in no event shall the Company be
required to pay the applicable Termination Fee on more than one occasion. As
used herein, " _Termination Fee_ " shall mean a cash amount equal to
$24,136,000. In the event that Parent or its designee shall receive full
payment pursuant to this Section 8.3(b), the receipt of the applicable
Termination Fee, the Expense Reimbursement and the expenses referred to in
Section 8.3(f) shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and
all losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Merger Sub, any of
their respective Affiliates or any other Person in connection with this
Agreement (and the termination hereof), the transactions contemplated hereby
(and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such

Affiliates or any other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any
claim, action or proceeding against the Company or any of its Affiliates
arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or any matters forming the basis for such termination;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Section 8.3(b) shall limit the
rights of Parent and Merger Sub under Section 9.5(b); _provided, further,
however_ , nothing in this Section 8.3(b) shall relieve the Company of
liability for any willful and material breach of this Agreement.

  



  

(c) If this Agreement is terminated by:

  



  

(i) Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(e) and: (A) at the time of such
termination, each of the Offer Conditions has been satisfied or waived (other

(ii) the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(e) and: (A) at the time of
such termination, each of the Offer Conditions has been satisfied or waived

termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e)) and (B) the Company
shall have given Parent written notice at least five (5) business days prior
to termination stating the Company's intention to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1(e) (and the basis for such termination);

  



  

(iii) the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(i) if the condition set
forth in Section 7.2(f) has been satisfied; or

  



  

(iv) the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(j) if Parent did not, at the
time of the Company's termination, have a right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1(j);

  



  

then Parent shall pay to the Company by wire transfer of same day funds,
within two (2) business days after such termination, a non-refundable
termination fee of $48,273,000 (the " _Parent Termination Fee_ "), it being
understood that in no event shall Parent be required to pay the Parent
Termination Fee on more than one occasion; _provided, that_ in the case of the
termination of this Agreement by the Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(i),
the Parent Termination Fee shall be paid by Parent at or prior to the time of
such termination. In the event that Company shall receive full payment
pursuant to this Section 8.3(c), together with indemnification pursuant to
Section 6.11(b) and reimbursement of any applicable expenses pursuant to
Section 8.3(e), the receipt of the Parent Termination Fee together with such
expenses shall be deemed to be the only monetary damages for any and all
losses or damages suffered or incurred by the Company or any other Person in
connection with this Agreement, the Financing Letters, or the Guaranty (and
the termination hereof), the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (and
the abandonment or termination thereof) or any matter forming the basis for
such termination, and neither the Company nor any other Person shall be
entitled to bring or maintain any claim, action or proceeding against Parent,
Merger Sub or any other Parent Related Party (as defined below) arising out
of or in connection with this Agreement, the Financing Letters, or the
Guaranty, any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (or the
abandonment or termination thereof) or any matters forming the basis for such
termination.

  



  

(d) In the event this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
Section 8.1(g) as a result of a willful material breach by the Company, then
the Company shall reimburse Parent for its actual and reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses in an amount not to exceed $4,505,000 (the " _Expense Reimbursement_
"), by wire transfer of immediately available funds on the second (2nd)
business day following the date of such termination of this Agreement;
_provided_ , that the existence of circumstances which would require the
Termination Fee to become subsequently payable by the Company pursuant to
Section 8.3(b) shall not relieve the Company of its obligations to pay the
Expense Reimbursement pursuant to this Section 8.3(d); and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the payment by the Company of the Expense Reimbursement
pursuant to this Section 8.3(d) shall not relieve the Company of any
subsequent obligation to pay the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.3(b)
except to the extent indicated in Section 8.3(b).

  



  

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, (1) under no circumstances shall the
collective monetary damages payable by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
Affiliates, for breaches under

this Agreement or the Equity Funding Letter exceed $48,273,000 in the
aggregate for all such breaches (and any indemnification pursuant to Section
8.3(f), but excluding any indemnification pursuant to Section 6.11(b)) (the "
_Parent Liability Limitation_ ") and (2) while the Company may pursue
specific performance in accordance with Section 9.5(b), under no circumstances
shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both specific
performance of the type contemplated by Section 9.5(b) and any money
damages. In no event shall the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of their
respective former, current or future officers, directors, partners,
stockholders, optionholders, managers, members or Affiliates (collectively, "
_Company Related Parties_ ") seek or obtain, nor shall they permit any of
their Representatives or any other Person on their behalf to seek or obtain,
nor shall any Person be entitled to seek or obtain, any monetary recovery or
award in excess of the Parent Liability Limitation against Parent, Merger
Sub, the Equity Investor, the Financing Sources or any other Available
Financing sources or any of their respective former, current or future
general or limited partners, stockholders, financing sources, managers,
members, directors, officers or Affiliates (collectively, the " _Parent
Related Parties_ "), and in no event shall the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries be entitled to seek or obtain any monetary damages of any kind in
excess of the Parent Liability Limitation against the Parent Related Parties,
including consequential, special, indirect or punitive damages for, or with
respect to, this Agreement, the Equity Funding Letter or the Guaranty or the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (including, any breach by Equity
Investor, Parent or Merger Sub), the termination of this Agreement, the
failure to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
claims or actions under applicable Legal Requirements arising out of any such
breach, termination or failure.

  



  

(f) The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this
Section 8.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into
this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company or Parent, as the case may be,
fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 8.3, and, in order
to obtain the payment, Parent or the Company, as the case may be, commences a
Legal Proceeding which results in a judgment against the other Party,
with respect to Parent or Merger Sub, or Parties, with respect to the
Company, for the payment set forth in this Section 8.3, such paying Party
shall pay the other Party or Parties, as applicable, its reasonable and
documented costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys'
fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on such amount at
the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal in effect on the date
such payment was required to be made through the date such payment was
actually received. Except as provided in Section 8.3, and subject to Section
9.5(b), as applicable, payment of the fees and expenses described in this
Section 8.3 shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parties in
connection with any termination of this Agreement.

  



  

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no
event shall any Non-Recourse Parent Party (as defined in the Equity
Funding Letter, which excludes, for the avoidance of doubt, Equity Investor,
Parent and Merger Sub) have any liability for monetary damages to the Company
or its Subsidiaries relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, other than Equity Investor's obligations
under the Guaranty and the Equity Funding Letter and other than the
obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to the extent expressly provided herein.
In no event shall the Company seek or obtain, nor shall they permit any of
its Representatives to seek or obtain, nor shall any Person be entitled to
seek or obtain, any monetary recovery or monetary award against any Non-
Recourse Parent Party

SECTION 9. Miscellaneous Provisions

  



  

9.1 Amendment. Prior to the Effective Time this Agreement may be
amended with the approval of the respective Boards of Directors of the
Company and Parent at any time (whether before or after the adoption of this
Agreement by the Company's stockholders); _provided, however_ , that after
any such adoption of this Agreement by the Company's stockholders,
no amendment shall be made which by applicable Legal Requirements requires
further approval of the stockholders of the Company without the further
approval of such stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Section 9.1 and Section 9.5 (and the
related definitions in this Agreement used therein, but only with respect to
their use in such Sections as they relate specifically to the

a manner that is adverse in any material respect to any Financing Source
without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (as defined in
the Debt Commitment Letter) for such Financing Source.

  



  

9.2 Waiver. No failure on the part of any Party to exercise any power,
right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of
any Party in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or
remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege
or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other
power, right, privilege or remedy. No Party shall be deemed to have waived

9.5 Applicable Legal Requirements; Jurisdiction; Specific Performance;
Remedies.

  



  

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance
with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might
otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof.
Subject to Section 9.5(c), in any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement: (i) each of the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally consents
and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Chancery Court of
the State of Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom or, if such
court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the United States District Court
sitting in New Castle County in the State of Delaware, (it being agreed that
the consents to jurisdiction and venue set forth in this Section 9.5(a) shall
not constitute general consents to service of process in the State of Delaware
and shall have no effect for any purpose except as provided in this paragraph
and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than the Parties
hereto); and (ii) each of the Parties irrevocably consents to service of
process by first class certified mail, return receipt requested, postage
prepaid, to the address at which such Party is to receive notice in accordance
with Section 9.8. The Parties hereto agree that a final judgment in any such
action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
applicable Legal Requirements; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in the
foregoing shall restrict any Party's rights to seek any post-judgment relief
regarding, or any appeal from, such final trial court judgment.
Notwithstanding anything else in this Section 9.5 or elsewhere in this
Agreement, the Parties hereto agree that New York State or United States
federal courts sitting in the borough of Manhattan, New York City (and any
New York State or United States Federal court from which appeal therefrom may
validly be taken) shall have exclusive jurisdiction over the Parties and
their Affiliates in and over any such action, arbitration, claim or proceeding
brought against any Financing Sources under the Debt Commitment Letter
(including each Financing Source) or any of their respective affiliates in
connection with this Agreement, any Debt Commitment Letter or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or the failure of the
transactions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter to be consummated, and
nothing in this Section 9.5 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed
to provide otherwise, and each of the Parties hereto agree that it will not,
and it will not permit any of its Affiliates to, bring or support anyone else
in bringing any such action, arbitration, claim or proceeding in any forum
other than New York State or United States federal courts sitting in the
borough of Manhattan, New York City (and any New York State or United
States Federal court from which appeal therefrom may validly be taken).

  



  

(b) The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary
damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in
the event that the Parties hereto do not perform their obligations under the
provisions of this Agreement in accordance with its specified terms or
otherwise breach such provisions. The Parties acknowledge and agree that (a)
the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific
performance, or other equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the courts
described in Section 9.5(a) without proof of damages or

  



    

71 
--- 

 

Table of Contents 
--- 

    



  

otherwise, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled under this Agreement, (b) the provisions set forth in Section 8.3
(i) are not intended to and do not adequately compensate for the harm that
would result from a breach of this Agreement and (ii) shall not be construed
to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any Party's right to specific
enforcement and (b) the right of specific performance is an integral part of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without that right,
neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is explicitly agreed that the Company shall
have the right to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable
remedies in connection with enforcing Parent's obligation to cause the Equity
Financing to be funded to fund the Merger (including to cause Parent to
enforce the obligations of the Equity Investor under the Equity Funding
Letter in order to cause the Equity Financing to be timely completed). Each
of the Parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that
the other Parties hereto have an adequate remedy at law or an award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
equity. The Parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any Party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance
with this Section 9.5(b) shall not be required to provide any bond or other
security in connection with any such order or injunction.

  



  

(c) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT
TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING BETWEEN THE PARTIES HERETO ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY
(INCLUDING ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING, CLAIM OR COUNTERCLAIM INVOLVING DEBT
FINANCING SOURCES UNDER THE DEBT FINANCING LETTER (AND THEIR RESPECTIVE
AFFILIATES)).

  



  

9.6 Assignability. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall be
enforceable by and inure solely to the benefit of, the Parties hereto and
their respective successors and permitted assigns; _provided, however,_ that
neither this Agreement nor any of the rights hereunder may be assigned
without the prior written consent of the other Parties hereto, and any
attempted assignment of this Agreement or any of such rights without such
consent shall be void and of no effect; _provided_ , _further_ ,  _however_ ,
that Parent or Merger Sub may (i) assign this Agreement to any of their
Affiliates (provided that such assignment shall not (A) affect the
obligations of the Equity Investor under the Equity Funding Letter or the
Guaranty or (B) impede or delay the consummation of the Transactions or
otherwise impede the rights of the stockholders of the Company under this
Agreement) and/or (ii) pledge its rights hereunder as security to its
Financing Source or any other Available Financing source; provided that
no such assignment or pledge permitted pursuant to this Section 9.6 shall
relieve Parent of its obligations hereunder.

  



  

9.7 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person (other than the
Parties hereto) any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or
by reason of this Agreement; except for: (i) if the Acceptance Time or
Effective Time occurs (A) the right of the Company's stockholders to receive
the Offer Price or Merger Consideration, as applicable and (B) the right of

9.9 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions of
this Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or

such term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases or to replace
such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable

unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be valid and
enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does not exercise the
power granted to it in the prior sentence, the Parties hereto agree to
replace such invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a valid and
enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term or
provision.
