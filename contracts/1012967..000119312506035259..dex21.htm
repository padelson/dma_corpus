(other than (i) the Shares owned by Parent or any direct or indirect
Subsidiary of Parent and (ii) the Shares owned by any direct or

Share REIT Merger Consideration_ "). At the REIT Merger Effective Time, each
Share that has been converted into the right to receive the Per Share REIT
Merger Consideration shall cease to be outstanding, shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each certificate (a " _Certificate_
") formerly representing any of the Shares (other than Excluded Shares) shall

of Shares represented by such Certificate _multiplied_ _by_ (y) the Per Share
REIT Merger Consideration, without interest.



(b) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share described in
Sections 2.1(a)(i) shall, by virtue of the REIT Merger and without any action

without any action on the part of the Purchaser Parties, the Company, the

the Partnership Merger Effective Time (other than (i) OP Units owned by Parent
or any direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent and (ii) OP Units owned by the
Company or any direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Company (each, an "
_Excluded OP Unit_ " and collectively, the " _Excluded OP Units_ ")) shall be

per OP Unit (the " _Per OP Merger Consideration_ "). At the Partnership Merger
Effective Time, each OP Unit that has been converted into the right to receive

automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and shall thereafter
represent only the right to receive the Per OP Merger Consideration, without
interest.

Partnership and (ii) the limited partner interest in Merger Sub II shall
automatically be converted into the Limited Partner Interest (as defined in
the Operating Partnership Agreement) in the Surviving Partnership and shall
constitute the only outstanding limited partner interest in the Surviving
Partnership.



 

5 Section 2.3 _Exchange of Certificates_.



(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time, Parent
shall (i) select a bank or trust company, satisfactory to the Company in its
reasonable discretion, to act as paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") in the
Mergers and (ii) enter into a paying agent agreement with the Paying Agent,
the terms and conditions of which are satisfactory to the Company in its
reasonable discretion. Promptly after the Partnership Merger Effective Time,
on the Closing Date, Parent shall provide funds to the Paying Agent in amounts
sufficient in the aggregate to provide all funds necessary for the Paying
Agent to make payments of the Per Share REIT Merger Consideration and the Per
OP Merger Consideration pursuant to Sections 2.1(a) and 2.2(a), respectively
(such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").



(b)  _Exchange Procedures_. (i) Promptly after the REIT Merger Effective Time
(and in any event within five Business Days), the Surviving Corporation shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares (other than
holders of Excluded Shares) (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form
specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits
of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 2.3(e)) to the Paying Agent,
and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
(or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 2.3(e)) in
exchange for the Per Share REIT Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section
2.3(e)) to the Paying Agent, together with a duly executed letter of
transmittal and any other documents reasonably required by the Paying Agent,
the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor a cash amount in immediately available funds (after giving effect to
any required tax withholdings as provided in Section 2.3(f)) equal to (x) the
number of Shares represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in
lieu thereof as provided in Section 2.3(e)) multiplied by (y) the Per Share
REIT Merger Consideration, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith
be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon
due surrender of the Certificates. If any Per Share REIT Merger Consideration
is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate is registered, then the Per Share REIT Merger Consideration may
be paid to such a transferee so long as (A) the surrendered Certificate is
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect that transfer and
(B) the Person requesting such payment (1) pays any applicable transfer Taxes
or (2) establishes to the satisfaction of Parent and the Paying Agent that any
such Taxes have already been paid or are not applicable. The payment of the
Per Share REIT Merger Consideration upon surrender of any Certificate shall
be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
that Certificate and the Shares formerly represented by it.



(ii) Promptly after the Partnership Merger Effective Time (and in any event
within five Business Days), the Surviving Partnership shall cause the
Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of OP Units (other than holders
of Excluded OP



 

6 Units) (A) a letter of transmittal pursuant to which such holder of record
shall certify to Parent, the Surviving Partnership and the Paying Agent the
number of OP Units held by such holder and shall be in such form and have such
other provisions as Parent, the Surviving Partnership and the Paying Agent may
reasonably require and (B) instructions for use in effecting the delivery of
such letter of transmittal in order to receive the Per OP Merger
Consideration. Upon delivery to the Paying Agent of such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, and any other documents reasonably requested by
the Paying Agent, Parent or the Surviving Partnership, the holder of OP Units
identified in such letter of transmittal shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor a cash amount in immediately available funds (after giving
effect to any required tax withholdings as provided in Section 2.3(f)) equal
to (x) the number of OP Units certified by such letter of transmittal
multiplied by (y) the Per OP Merger Consideration. No interest will be paid or
accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of such letter of
transmittal. If any Per OP Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the OP Units are registered in the
transfer records of the Operating Partnership, then the Per OP Merger
Consideration may be paid to such a transferee so long as (A) an appropriate
letter of transmittal, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect that transfer, is delivered and (B) the Person requesting such payment
(1) pays any applicable transfer Taxes or (2) establishes to the satisfaction
of Parent and the Paying Agent that any such Taxes have already been paid or
are not applicable. The payment of the Per OP Merger Consideration upon
delivery of an appropriate letter of transmittal shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such OP Units.



(c) _Transfers_. (i) From and after the REIT Merger Effective Time, there
shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of
Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the REIT Merger Effective
Time. If, after the REIT Merger Effective Time, any Certificate is presented
to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for transfer, it
shall be cancelled and exchanged for the cash amount in immediately available
funds to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this Article II.



(ii) From and after the Partnership Merger Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the transfer books of the Operating Partnership of OP Units that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time.
If, after the Partnership Merger Effective Time, any holder of OP Units makes
a request to the Surviving Partnership, Parent or the Paying Agent to transfer
such OP Units, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the cash amount in
immediately available funds to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant
to this Article II.



(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by
the stockholders of the Company and the holders of the OP Units for 180 days
after the REIT Merger Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent. Any holder
of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) or OP Units (other than Excluded OP
Units) who has not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter
look only to Parent for payment of the Per Share REIT Merger Consideration or
the Per OP Merger Consideration, as the case may be (in each case
after giving effect to any required tax withholdings as provided in Section
2.3(f)) upon due surrender of its Certificates (or



 

7 affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) in the case of Shares or a properly
completed letter of transmittal in the case of OP Units, without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, the
Surviving Partnership, Parent, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be
liable to any former holder of Shares or OP Units for any amount properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws.



(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and the posting by such Person of a bond in the form and amount
reasonably required by Parent as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against Parent on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue a check in the amount (after giving
effect to any required tax withholdings) equal to the number of Shares
represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate multiplied by the
Per Share REIT Merger Consideration.



(f) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the
Surviving Partnership and the Paying Agent, shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any holder of Shares, Company Options, Company Awards or OP Units such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "
_Code_ "), or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax law including,
without limitation, any withholding required under Section 1445 of the Code;
_provided_ _that_ , for the avoidance of doubt, no withholding will
be required pursuant to Section 1445 of the Code on payments of the Per Share
REIT Merger Consideration if the common stock of the Company is "regularly
traded" (within the meaning of Temporary Treasury Regulation Section
1.897-9T(d)(1) or (2)) during the calendar quarter ending prior to the
quarter in which the REIT Merger Effective Time occurs. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Surviving
Partnership or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts
(i) shall be remitted by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving
Partnership or the Paying Agent, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental
Entity, and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of Shares or OP Units in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the
Surviving Partnership or the Paying Agent, as the case may be.



(g) _Investment of the Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest the
Exchange Fund as directed by Parent. Any interest and other income resulting
from such investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amount
in excess of the amounts payable under Sections 2.1(a) or 2.2(a) shall be paid
promptly to Parent.



 

8 Section 2.4 _Treatment of Stock and Unit Plans; Employee Stock Purchase Plan_.



(a) _Treatment of Options_. At the REIT Merger Effective Time
each outstanding option to purchase Shares (a " _Company Option_ ") under the
Company Stock Award Plans, whether or not then exercisable or vested, shall be
cancelled and shall entitle the holder thereof to receive an amount in cash
equal to the product of (x) the total number of Shares subject to the Company
Option multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of the Per Share REIT Merger
Consideration over the exercise price per Share under such Company Option,
less applicable Taxes required to be withheld in accordance with Section
2.3(f) with respect to such payment.



(b) _Company Awards_. At the REIT Merger Effective Time, each right of any
kind, contingent or accrued, to acquire or receive Shares or benefits measured
by the value of Shares, and each award of any kind consisting of Shares that
may be held, awarded, outstanding, payable or reserved for issuance under the
Company Stock Award Plans, other than Company Options (the " _Company Awards_
"), whether vested or unvested, shall be cancelled and shall only entitle the
holder thereof to receive an amount in cash equal to (x) the number of Shares
subject to such Company Award immediately prior to the REIT Merger Effective
Time multiplied by (y) the Per Share REIT Merger Consideration (or, if the
Company Award provides for payments to the extent the value of the Shares
exceed a specified reference price, the amount, if any, by which the Per Share
REIT Merger Consideration exceeds such reference price), less applicable Taxes
required to be withheld in accordance with Section 2.3(f) with respect to
such payment.



(c) _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. The Company shall adopt such resolutions
or take such other actions with respect to the Amended and Restated Meristar
Hospitality Corporation Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _Stock Purchase
Plan_ "), as may be required or appropriate to provide that (i) no "Offer
Period" (as defined in the Stock Purchase Plan) shall commence following the
date hereof and (ii) the Stock Purchase Plan (and, subject to subparagraph
(i), any Offer Period thereunder) shall terminate, effective as of the earlier
to occur of the REIT Merger Effective Time or the last day of the "Offer
Period" in effect on the date hereof.



(d) _Corporate Actions_. (i) Beginning on the date hereof, the Company shall
not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, establish any new employee stock
purchase plan or extend the availability of any employee stock purchase plan
to any groups or categories of employees not previously included in any such
plan, or, in either case, implement any decisions to do the same, whether or
not such decisions have been communicated to employees. The Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, take such action as is necessary to end the
then current offering period under all employee stock purchase plans as soon
as practicable after the date of this Agreement and to terminate such plan as
of the REIT Merger Effective Time.



(ii) At or prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time, the Company, the board of
directors of the Company and the compensation committee of the



 

9 board of directors of the Company, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions
and take any actions (including, but not limited to, obtaining consents from
holders of Company Awards and Company Options and waiving the Companys
achievement of any required objectives) which are necessary to effectuate the
provisions of Sections 2.4(a), 2.4(b) and 2.4(c). The Company shall take all
actions necessary to ensure that from and after the REIT Merger Effective
Time, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver
Shares or other capital stock of the Company to any Person pursuant to or in
settlement of Company Options or Company Awards.



Section 2.5 _Termination of DRIP_. Effective as of the date of this
Agreement, the Company has terminated the Companys Dividend Reinvestment
Plan.



Section 2.6 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. Without limiting the
obligations of the Company and the Operating Partnership under Section 5.1,
in the event that the Company or the Operating Partnership changes the number
of Shares or OP Units, respectively, or other securities convertible or
exchangeable into or exercisable for Shares or OP Units, issued and
outstanding prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time or Partnership Merger
Effective Time as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization,
merger, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the
Per Share REIT Merger Consideration (and Per OP Merger Consideration) shall be
equitably adjusted.



Section 2.7 _Tax Characterizations_. (a) Parent and the Company intend that,
for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes, the REIT Merger shall
be treated as a taxable acquisition of the Shares by Parent. However, in the
event that Merger Sub I or Alternative Merger Sub I is the Surviving
Corporation of the REIT Merger, Parent and the Company intend that, (i) for
U.S. federal and applicable state income tax purposes, the REIT Merger shall
be treated as a taxable sale by the Company of all of the Companys assets to
Merger Sub I or Alternative Merger Sub I in exchange for the Per Share REIT
Merger Consideration and the assumption of the Companys liabilities,
followed by a liquidating distribution of such Per Share REIT Merger
Consideration to the holders of Shares pursuant to Section 331 and Section 562
of the Code and (ii) this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of liquidation"
of the Company for U.S. federal income tax purposes.



(b) Parent and the Operating Partnership intend that, for U.S. federal and
applicable state income tax purposes, the Partnership Merger shall be treated
as a taxable purchase of OP Units directly by Merger Sub I or the Surviving
Corporation and that the separate existence of Merger Sub II shall be
disregarded.



Section 2.8 _Other Transactions_. Parent shall have the option, in its sole
discretion and without requiring the further consent of the Company,
the Operating Partnership or the board of directors or stockholders of the
Company or any partners of the Operating Partnership, upon reasonable notice
to the Company, to request that the Company, immediately prior to the Closing,
(a) convert one or more Subsidiaries that are organized as corporations into
limited liability companies and one or more Subsidiaries that are organized as
limited partnerships into limited liability companies, on the basis of



 

10 organizational documents as reasonably requested by Parent, (b) sell all of
the stock, partnership interests or limited liability interests owned,
directly or indirectly, by the Company in one or more Subsidiaries at a price
designated by Parent, and (c) sell any of the assets of the Company or one or
more Subsidiaries at a price designated by Parent;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that (i) the Company shall not be required to take any action in contravention
of any organizational document or other Material Contract relating to any
applicable Subsidiary, (ii) any such actions or transactions shall be
contingent upon the receipt by the Company of a written notice from Parent
confirming that all of the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and 6.2 have
been satisfied or waived and that the Purchaser Parties are prepared to
proceed immediately with the Closing (it being understood that in any event
the transactions described in clauses (a), (b) and (c) will be deemed to have
occurred prior to the Closing), and (iii) such actions (or the inability to
complete such actions) shall not affect or modify in any respect the
obligations of Parent or Merger Sub under this Agreement, including payment of
the Per Share REIT Merger Consideration or the Per OP Merger Consideration.
Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for
all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company in connection with
any actions taken by the Company in accordance with this Section 2.8. The
Purchaser Parties shall, on a joint and several basis, indemnify and hold
harmless the Company and its Representatives for and against any and all
liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards,
judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection with
such actions. Without limiting the foregoing, none of the representations,
warranties or covenants of the Company shall be deemed to apply to, or deemed
breached or violated by, any of the transactions contemplated by this Section
2.8.



Section 2.9 _Alternative Structure of Merger_. While it is currently
contemplated that the REIT Merger shall be effected through the merger of
Merger Sub I with and into the Company, Parent shall have the option, in its
sole discretion and without requiring the further consent of the Company or
the board of directors of the Company or the Companys stockholders but
subject to complying with Section 8.12, upon reasonable notice to the Company,
to cause the REIT Merger to be effected through an alternative transaction
structure pursuant to which the Company would merge with and into a
controlled subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub I (" _Alternative Merger Sub I_
"), such Alternative Merger Sub I being a Delaware limited liability company,
and such Alternative Merger Sub I being the Surviving Corporation (the "
_Alternative Merger_ "), in which case, at the REIT Merger Effective Time, (i)
the effect of the Alternative Merger on the capital stock of the Company shall
be the same as set forth in Section 2.1, except that Section 2.1(c) shall not
apply, (ii) each limited liability company interest of Alternative Merger Sub
I issued and outstanding immediately prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time
shall remain unchanged and shall continue as one validly issued, fully paid
limited liability company interest of the Surviving Corporation, (iii)
Sections 1.4(a) and 1.5(a) shall not apply, and instead the limited liability
company agreement and the certificate of formation of Alternative Merger Sub
I, each as in effect immediately prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time,
shall be the limited liability company agreement and certificate of formation
of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided therein or
by Law, and (iv) the managing member(s) of Alternative Merger Sub



 

11 I immediately prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time shall continue as the
managing member(s) of the Surviving Corporation, and the officers of
Alternative Merger Sub I immediately prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time
shall continue as the officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case
until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified
or until the earlier of their death, resignation or removal. Parent shall make
such election by delivering to the Company a notice electing to effect the
Alternative Merger but not later than three days prior to the mailing of
the Company Proxy Statement. If Parent makes such election, (a) the parties
shall take all actions and make all filings required to consummate the
Alternative Merger, including the filing of a certificate of merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, (b) the second sentence of
Section 1.3 shall not apply, and the REIT Merger shall instead become
effective at the times specified by the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act
and the MGCL (the " _Alternative Merger Effective Time_ ") and (c) all
references in this Agreement to the term (i) "Merger Sub I" shall be deemed to
be references to Alternative Merger Sub I, (ii) "REIT Merger" shall be deemed
to refer to the Alternative Merger, (iii) "REIT Merger Effective Time" shall
be deemed to refer to the Alternative Merger Effective Time and (iv)
"Surviving Corporation" shall be deemed to refer to Alternative Merger Sub I
in its capacity as the surviving entity in the Alternative Merger.



Section 2.10 _Debt Offers_.



(a) The Company and the Operating Partnership shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to commence, on the date 14 days prior to the
estimated date of mailing the Company Proxy Statement or on any other date
designated by Parent on at least five days notice to the Company, offers
to purchase, and related consent solicitations with respect to, all of the
outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Companys 9% Senior Notes due
2008 and the Companys 9 1/8% Senior Notes due 2011 (collectively, the " _Non-
Callable Notes_ ") and, in Parents sole discretion, if the Asset Sale has not
been consummated prior to the commencement of the Debt Offers (as defined
below), the Companys 10.50% Senior Notes due 2009 (other than the Redemption
Notes (as defined in Section 2.11(a)) (together with the Non-Callable Notes,
the " _Notes_ ") on the terms and conditions set forth in Section 2.10(a) of
the Company Disclosure Letter (or as may otherwise be agreed between the
Company and Parent) and such other customary terms and conditions as are
reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company (including the related
consent solicitations, collectively, the " _Debt Offers_ "); provided that (i)
this Agreement shall have not been terminated in accordance with Article VII,
(ii) the Company shall have received from Parent the completed Offer
Documents (as defined below), which shall be in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Company, and (iii) at the time of such commencement, the
Purchaser Parties shall have otherwise performed or complied with all of
their agreements and covenants required by this Agreement to be performed on
or prior to the time that the Debt Offers are to be commenced. The Company and
the Operating Partnership shall waive any of the conditions to the Debt
Offers (other than that the Mergers shall have been consummated and that there
shall be no Order prohibiting consummation of the Debt Offers) as may be
reasonably requested by Parent and shall not, without the written consent of
Parent, waive any condition to the



 

12 Debt Offers or make any changes to the Debt Offers other than as agreed
between Parent and the Company. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding
sentence, neither the Company nor the Operating Partnership need make any
change to the terms and conditions of the Debt Offers requested by Parent that
decreases the price per Note payable in the Debt Offers as set forth in
Section 2.10(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter or imposes conditions to the
Debt Offers in addition to those set forth in Section 2.10(a) of the Company
Disclosure Letter that are materially adverse to the holders of the Notes,
unless such change is approved by the Company in writing.



(b) The Company and the Operating Partnership agree that, immediately
following the consent expiration date, assuming the requisite consents are
received, each of the Company, the Operating Partnership, the co-issuers of
the Notes and their Subsidiaries as is necessary shall execute supplemental
indentures to the indentures governing the Notes, which supplemental
indentures shall implement the amendments set forth in the Offer Documents and
shall become operative concurrently with the Partnership Merger Effective
Time, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including the
conditions to the Debt Offers). Concurrent with the Partnership Merger
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Partnership to accept for
payment and thereafter promptly pay for the Notes that have been properly
tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Debt Offers and in
accordance with the Debt Offers.



(c) Promptly after the date of this Agreement, Parent shall prepare all
necessary and appropriate documentation in connection with the Debt Offers,
including the offers to purchase, related letters of transmittal and other
related documents (collectively, the " _Offer Documents_ "). Parent, the
Company and the Operating Partnership shall, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to, cooperate with each other in the preparation of the Offer
Documents. The Offer Documents (including all amendments or supplements) and
all mailings to the holders of the Notes in connection with the Debt Offers
shall be subject to the prior review of, and comment by, the Company and
Parent and shall be reasonably acceptable to each of them. If at any time
prior to the completion of the Debt Offers any information in the Offer
Documents should be discovered by the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the
one hand, or Parent, on the other, which should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to the Offer Documents, so that the Offer Documents shall not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other party, and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be disseminated by or on behalf of the Company and the
Operating Partnership to the holders of the applicable Notes.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.10, the Company
and the Operating Partnership shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1
under the Exchange Act and any other applicable Law to the extent such laws
are applicable in connection with the Debt Offers. To the extent that the
provisions of any applicable Law conflict with this Section 2.10 the Company
and the Operating Partnership shall comply with the applicable Law and shall
not be deemed to have breached their obligations hereunder by such
compliance.



 

13 (d) In connection with the Debt Offers, Parent may select one or more dealer
managers (of which one such dealer manager shall be the Company Financial
Advisor), information agents, depositaries and other agents to provide
assistance in connection therewith and the Company and the Operating
Partnership shall, and shall cause their Subsidiaries to, enter into
customary agreements (including indemnities) with such parties so selected.
Parent shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of any dealer manager,
information agent, depositary or other agent retained in connection with the
Debt Offers, and Parent further agrees to reimburse the Company and the
Operating Partnership and their Subsidiaries for all of their reasonable out-
of-pocket costs in connection with the Debt Offers promptly following
incurrence and delivery of reasonable documentation of such costs. The
Purchaser Parties shall, on a joint and several basis, indemnify and hold
harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries, their respective officers and
directors for and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims,
costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or
incurred by them in connection with the Debt Offers and the Offer Documents;
_provided_ , _however_ , that none of the Purchaser Parties shall have any
obligation to indemnify and hold harmless any such party or person to the
extent that such liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses,
interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred arises from
disclosure regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries that is determined to
have contained a material misstatement or omission.



Section 2.11 _Redemption and Defeasance_.



(a) (i) The Operating Partnership and MeriStar Hospitality Finance Corp. II
shall redeem $100,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
10.50% Senior Notes due 2009 (collectively, the " _Initial Redemption Notes_
") on March 8, 2006 in accordance with the redemption notice dated February 2,
2006 and the terms of such securities and related indentures and (ii) if the
Asset Sale occurs, promptly following the closing thereof, the Operating
Partnership and MeriStar Hospitality Finance Corp. II shall issue an
irrevocable notice of optional redemption for the remaining 10.50% Senior
Notes due 2009 then outstanding (any of such notes so called for redemption
collectively with the Initial Redemption Notes, the " _Redemption Notes"_ )
in accordance with the terms of such securities and Section 3.7(b) of the

other Person) is or may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (and the response thereto from Parent or its
Representatives), (ii) any communication from any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and the
response thereto from Parent or its Representatives) or (iii) any event,

(a) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall prepare a draft of the Company Proxy Statement. The



 

48 Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on such draft, and once such draft is in a form reasonably acceptable
to each of Parent and the Company, the Company shall file the Company Proxy
Statement with the SEC. Each of the Company and Parent shall furnish all
information concerning itself and its affiliates that is required to
be included in the Company Proxy Statement or that is customarily included in

to any comments on the Company Proxy Statement or requests for additional
information from the SEC as soon as practicable after receipt of any such
comments or requests, and (ii) cause the Company Proxy Statement to be mailed
to the stockholders of the Company as promptly as practicable following the
date of this Agreement. The Company shall promptly (A) notify Parent upon the
receipt of any such comments or requests and (B) provide Parent with copies of
all correspondence between the Company and its Representatives, on the
one hand, and the SEC and its staff, on the other hand. If at any time prior
to the Company Stockholders Meeting, any information relating to the Company,
Parent or any of their respective affiliates, officers or directors, should be
discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to the Company Proxy Statement, so that the Company Proxy
Statement shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other parties, and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be filed with the SEC and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated above, prior to responding to
any comments or requests of the SEC or the filing or mailing of the Company
Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the Company (x)
shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
any drafts of the Company Proxy Statement and related correspondence and
filings and (y) shall include in such drafts, correspondence and filings all
comments reasonably proposed by Parent.



(c) The Company Proxy Statement shall recommend to its stockholders that they
approve the REIT Merger and include the Company Board Recommendation unless
the board of directors of the Company has withdrawn, modified or amended the
Company Board Recommendation in accordance with Section 5.4(d).



Section 5.7 _Company Stockholders Meeting_. The Company shall call and hold
the Company Stockholders Meeting as promptly as practicable following the
date of this Agreement for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Company
Vote. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with
Sections 7.1, 7.2, 7.3 or 7.4, the Company shall hold the Company
Stockholders Meeting regardless of whether the Company has withdrawn, modified
or amended the Company Board



 

49 Recommendation. Subject to Section 5.4(d), the Company shall (a) use its
reasonable best efforts to solicit or cause to be solicited from its
stockholders proxies in favor of approval of the REIT Merger and (b) take all
other action necessary or advisable to secure the Requisite Company Vote.



Section 5.8 _Employees; Benefit Plans_.



(a) For a period of one year following the Closing Date (the " _Continuation
Period_ "), Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide Company
Employees (other than those employees covered by a collective bargaining
agreement) who are employed by the Company or its Subsidiaries as of the
Partnership Merger Effective Time (" _Active Employees_ ") with base salary
and wages, annual bonus opportunity and benefits (other than any equity-based
award program or long-term incentive plan) that are no less favorable in the
aggregate, determined on an individual basis, as those provided under the
Company Benefit Plans in effect at the Partnership Merger Effective Time;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall prevent the amendment or
termination of any specific plan, program or arrangement, require that the
Surviving Corporation provide or permit investment in the securities of Parent
or the Surviving Corporation or interfere with the Surviving Corporations
right or obligation to make such changes as are necessary to comply with
applicable law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein,
nothing herein shall preclude the Surviving Corporation from terminating the
employment of any Active Employee for any reason for which the Company could
have terminated such person prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time.



(b) Parent and its Affiliates shall honor all Company Benefit Plans
(including, without limitation, any severance, change of control and similar
plans and agreements) in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately
prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time, subject to any amendment or
termination thereof that may be permitted by such Company Benefit Plans and
except as provided herein. During the Continuation Period, Parent shall
provide all Active Employees who suffer a qualifying termination of
employment with severance benefits no less favorable than those that would
have been provided to such Active Employees under the Companys severance
policy as in effect immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective
Time, a summary of which has been provided to Parent prior to the date
hereof.



(c) For all purposes under the employee benefit plans of Parent and its
affiliates providing benefits to any Active Employees after the Partnership
Merger Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each Active Employee shall be
credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its affiliates
before the Partnership Merger Effective Time (including predecessor or
acquired entities or any other entities for which the Company and its
affiliates have given credit for prior service), to the same extent as such
Active Employee was entitled, before the Partnership Merger Effective Time, to
credit for such service under any similar or comparable Company Benefit Plans
(except to the extent such credit would result in a duplication of benefits).
In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) each
Active



 

50 Employee immediately shall be eligible to participate, without any waiting
time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan
replaces coverage under a similar or comparable Company Benefit Plan in which
such Active Employee participated immediately before the Partnership Merger
Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "); and (ii) for
purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or
vision benefits to any Active Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing
condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be
waived for such Active Employee and his or her covered dependents, and Parent
shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Active Employee and his or
her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan
ending on the date such Employees participation in the corresponding New
Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such Active Employee and his or her covered dependents for the
applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such
New Plan.



(d) Parent and the Company acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained
herein with respect to employees are included for the sole benefit of Parent
and the Company and shall not create any right (i) in any other Person,
including any employees, former employees, any participant in any Company
Benefit Plans or any beneficiary thereof or (ii) to continued employment with
the Surviving Corporation.



Section 5.9 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.



(a) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause all rights to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation now existing in favor
of any present or former director (or Persons acting in a similar capacity for
non-corporate entities) or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") as provided in the Company Organizational
Documents or in agreements between an Indemnified Party and the Company or one
of its Subsidiaries, in each case, in effect on the date of this Agreement to
survive the Merger and to continue in full force and effect for a period of
not less than six years after the Partnership Merger Effective Time.



(b) After the REIT Merger Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall, jointly and severally, indemnify all Indemnified Parties to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws with respect to all acts and
omissions arising out of or relating to their services as directors or
officers of the Company or its Subsidiaries occurring prior to the REIT
Merger Effective Time. If any Indemnified Party is or becomes involved in any
Legal Action in connection with any matter occurring prior to or at the REIT
Merger Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and
severally, pay promptly after they are incurred such Indemnified Partys
reasonable legal fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with such
Legal Action, subject to Parents or the Surviving Corporations, as
applicable, receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified
Party, if required by applicable Law, to repay such legal fees, costs and
expenses if it is



 

51 ultimately determined under applicable Laws that such Indemnified Party is not
entitled to be indemnified;  _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Parent nor
the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any settlement effected without
the Surviving Companys written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) and shall not be obligated to pay the fees
and expenses of more than one counsel (selected by a plurality of the
applicable Indemnified Parties) for all Indemnified Parties in any
jurisdiction with respect to any single Legal Action except to the
extent that two or more of such Indemnified Parties shall have conflicting
interests in the outcome of such action.



(c) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally, (i)
maintain in effect for at least six years after the REIT Merger
Effective Time, if available, the current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance maintained by the Company (provided that the
Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of at least the same
coverage containing terms and conditions which are not less advantageous) or
(ii) obtain as of the REIT Merger Effective Time "tail" insurance policies
with a claims period of at least six years from the REIT Merger Effective Time
with at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions
which are no less advantageous, in each case, with respect to claims arising
out of or relating to events which occurred before or at the REIT Merger
Effective Time so long as Parent and the Surviving Corporation are not
required to pay an annual premium in excess of 300% of the last annual premium
paid by the Company for such insurance prior to the date of this Agreement
(such 300% amount being the " _Maximum Premium_ "). The Company represents
that such annual premium amount is set forth in Section 5.9(c) of the Company
Disclosure Letter. If the Parent or the Surviving Corporation are unable to
obtain the insurance described in the prior sentence for an amount less
than or equal to the Maximum Premium, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall, jointly and severally, instead obtain as much comparable insurance as
possible for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium.



(d) The covenants contained in this Section 5.9 are intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties
and their respective heirs and legal representatives and shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled,
whether pursuant to law, contract or otherwise.



(e) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors or assigns of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall succeed to the
obligations set forth in this Section 5.9.



Section 5.10 _Best Efforts_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement and in accordance with applicable Laws, each of the
parties to this Agreement shall use its best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, 



 

52 or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to ensure that
the conditions set forth in Article VI are satisfied and to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable.



Section 5.11 _Consents; Filings; Further Action_.



(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in
accordance with applicable Laws, each of the Purchaser Parties, on the
one hand, and the Company and the Operating Partnership, on the other hand,
shall (i) use its best efforts to obtain any consents, approvals or other
authorizations, and make any filings and notifications required in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) thereafter make
any other submissions either required or deemed appropriate by either Parent
or the Company, in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement under (A) the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, (B) the MGCL and
DRULPA, (C) the NYSE rules and regulations and (D) any other applicable Laws.
The Purchaser Parties, on the one hand, and the Company and the Operating
Partnership, on the other hand, shall cooperate and consult with each other
in connection with the making of all such filings and notifications, including
by providing copies of all relevant documents to the non-filing party and its
advisors prior to filing. Neither the Purchaser Parties, on the one hand, nor
the Company and the Operating Partnership, on the other hand, shall file any
such document if the other party has reasonably objected to the filing of such
document. Neither the Purchaser Parties, on the one hand, nor the Company and
the Operating Partnership, on the other hand, shall consent to any voluntary
extension of any statutory deadline or waiting period or to any voluntary
delay of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
at the behest of any Governmental Entity without the consent of the other
party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.



(b) Each of the Purchaser Parties, on the one hand, and the Company and the
Operating Partnership, on the other hand, shall use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any third party consents
(i) necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Transactions, (ii)
disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter or (iii) required to prevent a
Company Material Adverse Effect from occurring prior to the Partnership
Merger Effective Time. In the event that the Company or the Operating
Partnership shall fail to obtain any third party consent described above, the
Company and the Operating Partnership shall use its best efforts, and shall
take such actions as are reasonably requested by Parent, to minimize any
adverse effect upon the Company, the Operating Partnership and the Purchaser
Parties and their respective businesses resulting, or which could reasonably
be expected to result, after the Partnership Merger Effective Time, from the
failure to obtain such consent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, in connection with obtaining any approval or consent from any
Person (other than a Governmental Entity) with respect to any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, (i) without the prior written consent of
Parent which shall not be unreasonably withheld, none of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries shall pay or commit to pay to such Person whose



 

53 approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration, make
any commitment or incur any Liability or other obligation due to such Person
and (ii) none of the Purchaser Parties or their respective affiliates shall be
required to pay or commit to pay to such Person whose approval or consent is
being solicited any cash or other consideration, make any commitment or incur
any Liability or other obligation.



Section 5.12 _Public Announcements_. The Purchaser Parties, on the one hand,
and the Company and the Operating Partnership, on the other hand, shall
consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making
any public statements about this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Neither the Purchaser Parties, on the one
hand, nor the Company and the Operating Partnership, on the other hand, shall
issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
consultation, except to the extent required by applicable Laws or the NYSE
requirements, in which case that party shall use its reasonable commercial
efforts to consult with the other party before issuing any such release or
making any such public statement.



Section 5.13  _Stock Exchange De-listing_. Parent and the Company shall use
their reasonable commercial efforts to cause the Common Stock to be de-listed
from the NYSE and de-registered under the Exchange Act promptly following the
REIT Merger Effective Time.



Section 5.14 _Fees, Expenses and Conveyance Taxes_. Whether or not the
Mergers are consummated, all expenses (including fees and expenses payable to
Representatives and hedging counterparties) incurred by any party to this
Agreement or its Affiliates or on its behalf in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (" _Expenses_
") shall be paid by the party incurring those Expenses, except (a) that
Expenses incurred in connection with the filing, printing and mailing of the
Company Proxy Statement shall be shared equally by Parent and the Company,
(b) that all sales, use, value added, transfer, stamp, registration,
documentary, excise, real property transfer or gains, or similar Taxes
incurred as a result of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement shall
be borne by Parent and (c) as otherwise provided in Section 7.6.



Section 5.15 _Takeover Statutes_. If any takeover statute is or becomes
applicable to this Agreement, the Mergers or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of the Purchaser Parties,
the Company, the Operating Partnership and their respective boards of
directors (or managing members or general partner, as applicable) shall (a)
take all necessary action to ensure that such transactions may be consummated
as promptly as practicable upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement and (b) otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the
effects of such takeover statute.



Section 5.16 _Tax Matters_. During the period from the date of this Agreement
to the Partnership Merger Effective Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall:



(a) continue to operate in such a manner as to permit the Company to continue
to qualify as a REIT;



 

54 (b) prepare and timely file all Tax Returns required to be filed by them on or
before the Closing Date (" _Post-Signing Returns_ ") in a manner consistent
with past practice, except as otherwise required by applicable Laws;



(c) fully and timely pay all Taxes due and payable in respect of such Post-
Signing Returns that are so filed;



(d) properly reserve (and reflect such reserve in their books and records and
financial statements), for all Taxes payable by them for which no Post-Signing
Return is due prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time in a manner
consistent with past practice; and



(e) terminate all Tax sharing agreements to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party such that there are no further Liabilities
thereunder.



Section 5.17 _Financing_.



(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange the Debt Financing
on the terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letter, including
using reasonable best efforts to (i) negotiate definitive agreements with
respect thereto on terms and conditions contained therein and (ii) to satisfy
all conditions applicable to the Purchaser Parties in such definitive
agreements that are within its control. In the event any portion of the Debt
Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the
Commitment Letter, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange to
obtain any such portion from alternative sources on comparable or more
favorable terms to Parent (as determined in the reasonable judgment of
Parent) as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event.
Parent shall give the Company prompt notice of any material breach by any
party of the Commitment Letter or any termination of the Commitment
Letter. Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis
in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing and
shall not permit any material amendment or modification to be made to, or any
waiver of any material provision or remedy under, the Commitment Letter
without first consulting with the Company or, if such amendment would or would
be reasonably expected to materially and adversely affect or delay in any
material respect Parents ability to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, without first obtaining the Companys prior written consent
(not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). For the avoidance of doubt, if
the Debt Financing (or any alternative financing) has not been obtained, the
Purchaser Parties shall continue to be obligated to consummate the Mergers on
the terms contemplated by this Agreement and subject only to the satisfaction
or waiver of the conditions set forth in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 of this
Agreement and to Parents rights under Sections 7.2 and 7.3, regardless of
whether the Purchaser Parties have complied with all of their other
obligations under this Agreement (including their obligations under this
Section 5.17).



 

55 (b) The Company agrees to provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its
and their Representatives to provide, all reasonable cooperation in
connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing as may be reasonably
requested by Parent (provided that such requested cooperation does not
unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries), including (i) participation in meetings, drafting sessions and
due diligence sessions, (ii) furnishing Parent and its financing sources with
financial and other pertinent information regarding the Company and
its Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by Parent, (iii) assisting
Parent and its financing sources in the preparation of (A) an offering
document for any debt raised to complete the Mergers and (B) materials for
rating agency presentations, (iv) reasonably cooperating with the marketing
efforts of Parent and its financing sources for any debt raised by Parent to
complete the Mergers, (v) forming new direct or indirect Subsidiaries, (vi)
providing and executing documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent
and (vii) without limiting the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries
under Sections 2.10 and 2.11, cooperating in connection with the repayment or
defeasance of any Indebtedness of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as
of the Partnership Merger Effective Time, including delivering such payoff,
defeasance or similar notices under any existing mortgage or mezzanine loans
of the Company or any Subsidiary as requested by Parent; provided that none
of the Company or any Subsidiary shall be required to pay any commitment or
other similar fee or incur any other liability in connection with the Debt
Financing or any of the foregoing prior to the Partnership Merger Effective
Time. Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the
Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or the
Subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation. The Purchaser Parties shall,
on a joint and several basis, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives for and against any and all
liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards,
judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection with the
arrangement of the Debt Financing and any information utilized in connection
therewith (other than historical information relating to the Company or the
Subsidiaries). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the condition
set forth in Section 6.2(b) of this Agreement, as it applies to the Companys
obligations under this Section 5.17(b), shall be deemed satisfied unless the
Debt Financing (or any alternative financing) has not been obtained primarily
as a result of the Companys or its Subsidiaries willful and material breach
of its obligations under this Section 5.17(b).



(c) All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding the Company
obtained by Parent or its Representatives pursuant to paragraph (b)
above shall be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement.



Section 5.18 _Resignations_. The Company shall (a) use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain and deliver to Parent at the Closing evidence reasonably
satisfactory to Parent of the resignation effective as of the REIT Merger
Effective Time, of those



 

56 directors of the Company or any Subsidiary designated by Parent to the Company
in writing at least five calendar days prior to the Closing and (b) take the
actions specified in Section 5.18 of the Company Disclosure Letter.

on the part of a party to any extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed by such party. The failure of any
part to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not
constitute a waiver of such rights.

Section 8.13 _Remedies_.



(a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.14 or elsewhere in
this Agreement, any and all remedies expressly conferred upon a party to this
Agreement shall be cumulative with, and not exclusive of, any other remedy
contained in this Agreement, at law or in equity and the exercise by a party
to this Agreement of any one remedy shall not preclude the exercise by it of
any other remedy. Without limiting the right to receive any payment it may be
entitled to receive under Sections 2.8 and 5.17(b), each of the Company and
the Operating Partnership agrees that to the extent it has incurred losses or
damages in connection with this Agreement the maximum aggregate liability of
the Purchaser Parties and Guarantor for such losses or damages shall be

shall the Company or the Operating Partnership seek to recover any money
damages in excess of such amount from the Purchaser Parties or Guarantor or
their respective Representatives and affiliates in connection therewith.



(b) To the extent that the Company or the Operating Partnership, as the
case may be (the " _Recipient_ "), recovers money damages pursuant to this
Section 8.13 and the Guarantee (and subject to the terms of Section 8.13(a)
and the Guarantee) (the " _Damages Amount_ "), such amount shall not
exceed the sum of (A) the maximum amount that can be paid to Recipient
without causing it to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and

income described in Sections 856(c)(2)(A)  (H) and 856(c)(3)(A)  (I) of the
Code (" _Qualifying Income_ "), as determined by independent accountants to
the Recipient, and (B) in the event the Recipient receives an opinion from
outside counsel (a " _Damages Opinion_ ") or a ruling from the IRS (a "
_Damages Ruling_ "), in either case holding that the Recipients receipt of
the Damages Amount would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be
excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3)
of the Code (the " _REIT Requirements_ ") or that the receipt by the Recipient
of the remaining balance of the Damages Amount following the receipt of and
pursuant to such ruling or opinion would not be deemed constructively
received prior thereto, the Damages Amount less the amount payable under
clause (A) above; _provided_ , however, that if the Damages Opinion or the
Damages Ruling is based on the absence of constructive receipt, the amount
that will be paid upon the receipt of the Damages Opinion or the Damages
Ruling will be the maximum amount that can be paid at that time without
causing the Recipient to fail the REIT Requirements, as determined by the
Recipients independent accountants based on the Damages Opinion or the
Damages Ruling, and any remaining amount payable to the Recipient pursuant to
clause (B) shall be paid as soon as it shall be possible to do so without
causing the Recipient to fail the REIT Requirements, as determined by the
Recipients independent



 

71 accountants based on the Damages Opinion or the Damages Ruling. In the event
that the Recipient is not able to receive the full Damages Amount, the
Purchaser Party or the Guarantor (the " _Payor_ ") shall place the unpaid
amount in escrow and shall not release any portion thereof to the Recipient
unless and until the Payor receives either a Damages Opinion or a Damages
Ruling, in which event the Payor shall pay to the Recipient the unpaid Damages
Amount; _provided_ , however, that if the Damages Opinion or the Damages
Ruling is based on the absence of constructive receipt, the amount that will
be paid upon the receipt of the Damages Opinion or the Damages Ruling will be
the maximum amount that can be paid at that time without causing the Recipient
to fail the REIT Requirements, as determined by the Recipients
independent accountants based on the Damages Opinion or the Damages Ruling,
and any remaining amount payable to the Recipient shall be paid as soon as it
shall be possible to do so without causing the Recipient to fail the REIT
Requirements, as determined by the Recipients independent accountants based
on the Damages Opinion or the Damages Ruling. Subject to the terms of Section
8.13(a) and the Guarantee, the Payors obligation to pay any unpaid portion of
the Damages Amount shall terminate seven years from the date of this
Agreement.
