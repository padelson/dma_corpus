or otherwise under Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the
Code. None of the Companies or any of its subsidiaries has any Liability
under any defined benefit pension plan (including any multiemployer plan

association, any multiple employer plan or any multiemployer plan (each as
defined in ERISA). With respect to the Wyoming Refining Company Pension Plan,

addition, no circumstances exist that would result in any Liability to the
Companies or their subsidiaries on account of any Employee Benefit Plan that

required to be contributed to by an ERISA Affiliate of the Companies and
their subsidiaries, other than the Company Severance Plan or for the payments
specified in _Section 6.3_ (and with respect to the payments specified in
_Section 6.3_, the Companies obligations for these payments are solely
pursuant to this Agreement and are not due pursuant to any Employee Benefit
Plan other than the Company Severance Plan).

reasonable costs and expenses of obtaining any consent or approval of a Third
Party or Governmental Authority that is required for Buyer to consummate the
Transactions, and Seller shall pay the reasonable costs and expenses of
obtaining any consent or approval of a Third Party or Governmental Authority
that is required for Seller to consummate the Transactions. The Parties
shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, reasonably cooperate with each
other in connection with the making of all such notices or filings or
obtaining such authorizations, consents and approvals.

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the Parties
will, in no event later than five Business Days following the Execution Date
(such deadline being subject to the Parties reasonable cooperation under
_Section 5.2(a)_) file (or cause its appropriate Affiliates to file) any
notification, report forms and related material that it may be required to
file with the United States Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust
Division of the United States Department of Justice under the HSR Act, and
will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an early termination of
the applicable waiting period thereunder. Each of the Parties will (i) comply
at the earliest practicable date with any request under the HSR Act for
additional information, documents or other materials received by such party
from the United States Federal Trade Commission or the United States
Department of Justice or any other Governmental Authority in respect of such
filings, and (ii) subject to _Section 5.2(d)_, cooperate in a commercially
reasonable manner with the other Parties in connection with any such filing

 



38 _ _ and in connection with resolving any investigation or other inquiry of
any such agency or other Governmental Authority under any Antitrust Laws with
respect to any such filing. To the extent not prohibited by applicable Laws,
each Party shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to furnish to each
other Party all information required for any application or other filing to be
made pursuant to any applicable Laws in connection with the Transactions.
Each Party shall give each other Party reasonable prior notice of any
communication with, and any proposed understanding, undertaking or agreement
with, any Governmental Authority regarding any such filings. None of the
Parties shall independently participate in any meeting, or engage in any
substantive conversation, with any Governmental Authority in respect of any
such filings, investigation or other inquiry without giving the other Party
prior notice of the meeting or conversation and, unless prohibited by such
Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend or participate; _provided,
however_ , that a Party or its legal counsel may respond to any unsolicited
telephone calls from such Governmental Authority without prior notice to, or
participation of, the other Parties but before discussing any substantive
matters, such party or its legal counsel shall seek to add legal counsel for
the other Party to the call or to reschedule the call for a time when all
Parties and/or their counsel may participate. The Parties will consult and
cooperate with one another in connection with any analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or
submitted by or on behalf of any Party in connection with proceedings under
or relating to Antitrust Laws. Buyer shall take the lead in coordinating any
filings and obtaining any necessary approvals under the Antitrust Laws. Buyer
shall pay all filing fees payable in connection with the filings by the
parties required by the HSR Act, and make (or cause its appropriate Affiliates
to make) any further filings pursuant thereto that may be necessary, proper or
advisable in connection therewith. __

 

(c) Subject to _Section 5.2(d)_, each of the Parties shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be
asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the Transactions under
the HSR Act, the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, as amended, the Clayton Act of
1914, as amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any
other United States federal or state Laws that are designed to prohibit,
restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or
restraint of trade (collectively, " _Antitrust Laws_ "). In connection
therewith and subject to _Section 5.2(d)_, if any Proceeding is instituted
(or threatened to be instituted) challenging any of the Transactions as
inconsistent with or violative of any Antitrust Law, each of the Parties shall
(by negotiation, litigation or otherwise) cooperate and use its commercially
reasonable efforts vigorously to contest and resist any such Proceeding,
including any administrative or judicial action, and to have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order
whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that
prohibits, prevents, delays or restricts consummation of the Transactions,
including by vigorously pursuing all available avenues of administrative
and judicial appeal, unless, by mutual agreement, the Parties decide that
litigation is not in their respective best interests. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this _Section
5.2_ shall limit the right of a Party to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 9.1_, so long as such Party has until that time complied in all
material respects with its obligations under this _Section 5.2_. Each of the
Parties shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take such action as
may be required to cause the expiration of the notice periods under the HSR
Act or other Antitrust Laws with respect to the Transactions as promptly as
possible after the execution of this Agreement.

 



39 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of the
Parties or any of their respective Affiliates shall be required, in order to
resolve any objections asserted under Antitrust Laws by any Governmental
Authority with respect to the Transactions to (i) sell, hold, divest,
discontinue or limit, before or after the Closing Date, any assets,
businesses or interests of the Parties or their respective Affiliates, or (ii)
to take any action or agree to any limitation or restriction, that its board
of directors (or equivalent governing body) reasonably determines in good
faith, (A) in the case of Seller, would have a Material Adverse Effect, (B)
would materially reduce the overall benefits expected, as of the Execution
Date, to be realized by Buyer or Seller, as applicable, from
the Transactions, or (C) materially limits a Partys or either of the
Companies freedom of action with respect to the conduct of their respective
businesses, whether before or after the Closing Date.

cost and expense of Buyer; _provided_ , _however_ , Buyer shall not be
permitted to undertake any testing or other invasive sampling of the indoor or

but Buyer and its environmental consultant shall be allowed to conduct Phase I

(c) BUYER SHALL RELEASE, PROTECT, DEFEND, INDEMNIFY AND HOLD THE SELLER
INDEMNIFIED PERSONS HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL LIABILITIES, CLAIMS
OR LOSSES (OTHER THAN ANY LIABILITIES, CLAIMS OR LOSSES RELATING TO THE

THE ASSETS, INCLUDING ANY VIOLATIONS OF LAW RELATING TO THE ASSETS) ARISING
FROM OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY DUE DILIGENCE CONDUCTED PURSUANT TO OR IN
CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT PRIOR TO THE CLOSING, INCLUDING ANY SITE
VISITS; _PROVIDED, HOWEVER_ , THAT SUCH INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS SHALL APPLY TO
THE EXTENT, AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT, THAT ANY SUCH LIABILITIES, CLAIMS OR
LOSSES WERE NOT CAUSED BY OR ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE GROSS

  



43  NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF ANY MEMBER OF THE SELLER INDEMNIFIED
PERSONS. BUYER WILL COMPLY AND WILL CAUSE ITS REPRESENTATIVES TO COMPLY FULLY

Knowledge of Seller, there has been a breach of any of Buyers
representations, warranties or covenants contained herein and Buyer shall give
prompt written notice to Seller if, to the Knowledge of Buyer, there has been
a breach of any of the representations, warranties or covenants of Seller
contained herein. __

__(b) _Occurrence of Event_. Between the Execution Date and the Closing Date,
Buyer and Seller shall give prompt written notice to the other, if to the
Knowledge of such notifying Party, there has occurred any event that may
reasonably be expected to make the satisfaction of any of the conditions in
_Article 7_ impossible or unlikely. __

__(c) _Effect of Disclosure_. If any event or development occurs between the
Execution Date and the Closing Date which constitutes an action that Seller or
any Company is expressly permitted to take, or for which Buyer expressly
consents for Seller or any Company to take, pursuant to  _Section 5.3_ or a
transaction that Seller or any Company is expressly permitted to enter into,
or for which Buyer expressly consents for Seller or any Company to enter into,
pursuant to _Section 5.3_, then Seller or any Company may take such action
or enter into such transaction, as applicable, and Seller shall amend or
supplement the applicable section of the Disclosure Schedule to prevent or
cure any misrepresentation, breach of warranty or breach of covenant which
would occur as of the Closing Date as a result of such permitted action or
transaction absent such amendment or supplement, for all purposes of this
Agreement, including for purposes of determining whether or not the condition
set forth in  _Section 7.1_ have been satisfied and for purposes of the
indemnification and termination rights included in this Agreement. __

 



44 Section 5.6 _Exclusivity_. From and after the Execution Date and
continuing through the Closing Date, Seller shall not (and shall not cause or
permit any Company, or any of Representative of Seller and/or any Company to)
(a) solicit, initiate, encourage, or take any other action designed to
facilitate any proposal or offer from any Person relating to, or (b) engage
in negotiations or otherwise provide any information with respect to, or
cooperate with any Person relating to, in each case, any possible sale or
other disposition (whether by merger, consolidation, stock sale,
reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, Capital Stock
exchange or otherwise) of all or any material portion of the Units, the
Capital Stock of Pipeline Company or the Assets with any other Person
other than Buyer, its Affiliates and its Representatives (each, an "
_Acquisition Proposal_ "). Seller shall (and shall cause each Company and any
Representative of Seller and/or each Company to), immediately cease and
terminate all existing discussions or negotiations with any Person with
respect to any proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to
lead to, an Acquisition Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed
that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 5.6_ by
any Representative or Affiliate of Seller or a Company shall be deemed to be a
breach of this _Section 5.6_ by Seller.

 

Section 5.7 _Hydrocarbon Inventory_.

 

(a) The Parties acknowledge that Buyer caused an Affiliate of Intertek Group,
PLC (" _Intertek_ ") to measure the volumes of (i) Onsite Inventory (as
defined in _Exhibit G-2_ Hydrocarbon Inventory Measurement Procedures)
contained in some, but not all, tanks at the Refinery on May 31, 2016 and (ii)
the WPC Inventory contained in tanks (but not pipelines) on May 31, 2016, and
that in each case those measured volumes are correctly stated in _Exhibit G-1_
May EOM Inventory.

 

(b) The Parties also acknowledge that they have agreed (for purposes of this
_Section 5.7_, _Section 8.1(c)_ and  _Section 8.2(b)_ only) as to (i) the
volumes of Onsite Inventory that were not physically measured on May 31, 2016,
(ii) the volumes of the WPC Inventory that were not physically measured on May
31, 2016, and (iii) the volumes of Offsite Inventory on May 31, 2016 and that
in each case those agreed volumes of unmeasured Onsite Inventory, Offsite
Inventory and WPC Inventory are correctly stated on _Exhibit G-1_.

 

(c) Additionally, the Parties acknowledge that they have agreed (for purposes
of this _Section 5.7_, _Section 8.1(c)_ and  _Section 8.2(b)_ only) that
the total value of the Hydrocarbon Inventory as of May 31, 2016 is correctly
set forth in _Exhibit G-1_ (such value, the " _May EOM Inventory Value_ ").

 

(d) The Parties also acknowledge that they have agreed (for purposes of this
_Section 5.7_, _Section 8.1(c)_ and  _Section 8.2(b)_ only) not to measure
or value Onsite Inventory contained in process units or pipeworks at May 31,
2016 or at the Measurement Dated (as defined below), notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in _Exhibit G-2_ or  _Exhibit G-3_.

(e) Buyer shall have the option, but not the obligation, to have the Onsite
Inventory and the WPC Inventory measured and sampled by a mutually agreeable
independent inspector (the " _Field Inspector_ ") on a date that is the first
or second day preceding the Closing Date (the " _Inventory Measurement Date_
"). Buyer and Seller shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause
Intertek to be the Field Inspector. The Field Inspector shall measure and
sample the Onsite Inventory and WPC Inventory (including tank sludge) as of
the Inventory Measurement Date at the respective locations of the Hydrocarbon
Inventory on the Inventory Measurement Date; _provided, however_ , that
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,

 



45  (i) the volumes of all Onsite Inventory in process units and pipeworks shall
not be measured or valued by the Field Inspector or the Parties, (ii) the
volumes of all Hydrocarbon Inventory in transit, whether inbound or outbound,
by pipeline (including line fill), railcar or truck shall be determined as set
forth on _Exhibit G-2_ and shall not be measured by the Field Inspector or
included in the Field Inspector Report but shall instead be validated by
bills of lading (in the case of railcar or truck loads) or meter tickets for
pipeline batches, and (iii) all crude tank and other volume compositions shall
be determined as set forth on _Exhibit G-2_. With respect to the Onsite
Inventory measured by the Field Inspector, such Onsite Inventory shall be
measured in accordance with the procedures reflected in _Exhibit G-2_

 

(f) Seller shall not take or permit to be taken any actions that would reduce
the level of Hydrocarbon Inventory between the Execution Date and the Closing
Date. Buyer and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Field Inspector to issue a written report (the " _Field Inspector Report_ ")
to Buyer and Seller within five (5) Business Days after the Inventory
Measurement Date setting forth the volumes and quantities of the Onsite
Inventory WPC Inventory as of the Inventory Measurement Date (to the extent
such Hydrocarbon Inventory is measured by the Field Inspector in accordance
with _Exhibit G-2_ ) and such volumes and quantities shall be deemed to be
final and binding on Buyer and Seller (absent manifest error). The fees and
expenses of the Field Inspector shall be borne equally by Seller and Buyer.

 

(g) As promptly as practicable, but in any event no later than 20 days
following receipt of the Field Inspector Report, Seller shall cause to be
prepared and delivered to Buyer a statement (the " _Closing Inventory
Statement_ "), together with (where applicable) supporting calculations and
information, setting forth as of the Measurement Time on the Inventory
Measurement Date: (i) the volumes of the Onsite Inventory and WPC Inventory
as determined consistently with the manner in which Onsite Inventory and WPC
Inventory was determined on May 31, 2016 and reflected in _Exhibit G-1,_ and
otherwise in accordance with this _Section 5.7_ and _Exhibit G-2_ ; (ii) the
volumes of the Offsite Inventory determined as set forth on _Exhibit G-2;_ and
(iii) the value of the Onsite Inventory, the Offsite Inventory and the
WPC Inventory, which value shall be determined in accordance with the
procedures set forth in _Exhibit G-3_ Hydrocarbon Inventory Valuation
Procedures (such value, the " _Closing Inventory Value_ "). The Closing
Inventory Statement shall be in substantially the same format as _Exhibit
G-1_ to the extent practical.

(h) No later than 20 days following its receipt of the Closing Inventory
Statement, Buyer shall give Seller notice of (i) its acceptance of the Closing
Inventory Statement (including the Closing Inventory Value) or (ii) specific
and reasonably detailed objections to the Closing Inventory Value and/or (to
the extent expressly permitted in _Exhibit G-2_ ) the volumes set forth in the
Closing Inventory Statement, and Buyer shall be deemed to have agreed with all
matters set forth in the Closing Inventory Statement that are not so objected
to. If Buyer fails to give such notice before the end of such 20-day period,
the Closing Inventory Statement will be deemed final and binding upon the
Parties. If Buyer gives such notice to Seller of Buyers objection
within such 20-day period, and Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve the
issues in dispute within 10 days after delivery of such notice of objection,
each of Buyers and Sellers positions on the remaining items in dispute with
respect to the computation of the Closing Inventory Value will be submitted
to an independent and qualified party mutually selected by the parties (the "
_Dispute Inspector_ ") such as an accounting firm or independent inspector,
for final resolution. The fees and expenses of the Dispute Inspector shall be
borne equally by Seller and Buyer.

 



46 (i) If the total Closing Inventory Value (as finally determined pursuant to
this  _Section 5 .7_) minus the total May EOM Inventory Value (such
difference, the " _Inventory Balance_ ") is less than zero, then, subject to
_Section 8.1(c)_, Buyer may bring a Claim for Indemnification under 
_Section 8.2(b)_ for the absolute value of the Inventory Balance (an "
_Inventory Claim_ ").

(j) Each Party agrees that it shall not take any actions with respect to the
operations books and records, accounting books and records, policies and
procedures of itself or its Affiliates that would obstruct or prevent the
preparation of an accurate Closing Inventory Statement as provided in this
_Section 5.7_. From the Closing through the final determination of the
Closing Inventory Value in accordance with this _Section 5.7_, Seller and
Buyer shall provide one another with reasonable access at all reasonable
times to the personnel, properties, and books and records of the Companies for
purposes of determining the Closing Inventory Value, including granting their
respective representatives the right to observe the measuring and sampling of
the Onsite Inventory on the Measurement Date.

(k) The provisions of this _Section 5.7_ shall survive the Closing.

 

Section 5.8 _Intercompany Accounts_. At or prior to the Closing, Seller shall
cause to be settled, repaid or cancelled all intercompany accounts that are
unpaid as of the Closing between a Company, on the one hand, and Seller or any
of its Affiliates (other than the Companies), on the other hand.

 

Section 5.9 _Payoff Letters_. Seller shall use its commercially reasonably
efforts to deliver to Buyer, at least three Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, copies of executed payoff letters, in customary form (the "
_Payoff Letters_ "), from the lenders under the Credit Facility and each other
item of Closing Indebtedness that (a) confirm the aggregate outstanding
amount required to be paid to fully satisfy the Credit Facility and such other
Closing Indebtedness as of the anticipated Closing Date (and the daily per
diem accrual of interest thereafter) (the " _Payoff Amount_ "), (b) provide
that upon (i) receipt of the applicable Payoff Amount and (ii) the
consummation of arrangements satisfactory to the issuers thereof, the Credit
Facility and such other Closing Indebtedness shall be terminated except for
indemnification and reimbursement obligations which by their terms expressly
survive the termination of the Credit Facility and such other Closing
Indebtedness and (c) provide that (i) all Indebtedness, Liens and
all guarantees granted in connection with the Credit Facility and such other
Closing Indebtedness shall be, upon the payment of the Payoff Amount at the
Closing, automatically released, terminated and discharged and (ii) the
Companies, Buyer or their designees are authorized from and after the Closing
to file all Uniform Commercial Code termination statements as are necessary to
effectuate, or reflect of public record, the release and discharge of such
Liens. Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall obtain all documents,
terminations and releases (including with respect to outstanding mortgages),
as are reasonably necessary to release such Liens as of the Closing upon
receipt of the applicable Payoff Amount. Seller shall be responsible for all
costs, expenses, fees and other amounts payable in connection with the request
for the Payoff Letters.

 



47 Section 5.10 _Title Policies_. Buyer may procure, at its sole cost and
expense, owners title insurance policies with respect to the Owned Real
Property; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyers ability or inability to obtain
title insurance on such Owned Real Property shall not result in an adjustment
to Purchase Price; _provided_ , _further_ , however, that the foregoing shall
not be deemed to mitigate the representations and warranties set forth in
_Section 4.11_. Seller and its Affiliates shall execute and deliver to the
title insurance company such affidavits, certificates and other documentation
as may be reasonably requested to facilitate the issuance of title insurance
policies for the Owned Real Property; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in
such affidavits, certificates or documentation shall require Seller or its
Affiliates to incur any liabilities or obligations to any Person that are not
otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement or to certify or attest to
facts or circumstances that are not factually true, correct or complete in
any respect. Seller agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to assist
Buyer with any reasonable request in Buyers efforts to obtain such title
policies; _provided_ that Seller shall not be obligated to incur any costs or
expenses in connection with such assistance. It is expressly agreed that
Buyers obtaining such policies is not a condition to Buyers obligation to
close the Transactions.

 

Section 5.11 _Company Monthly Consolidated Financial Statements_. During the
Interim Period, Seller shall deliver to Buyer, as soon as reasonably
practicable, but in no event later than 25 days after the end of each calendar
month, the unaudited consolidated interim balance sheet and statement of
operations, cash flows and statement of changes in members equity of the
Companies as of and for the period for each calendar month then ended (the "
_Company Monthly Financial Statements_ "). The Company Monthly Financial
Statements shall be prepared on a basis consistent with manner in which the
Financial Statements were prepared.

Section 5.12 _Financing Matters_.

 

(a) Each of Buyer and Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary to obtain the Equity Financing in advance of Closing. Upon
request of Seller, Buyer will notify Seller in reasonable detail regarding all
material developments concerning the Equity Financing. Buyer or Parent will
promptly notify Seller if any portion of the Equity Financing becomes
unavailable.

(b) During the Interim Period, Seller shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to, and shall cause the Companies and its and their respective
Representatives to use commercially reasonable efforts to, provide, at Buyers
sole cost and expense, all information as may be reasonably requested by Buyer
in connection with Buyers and Parents efforts to obtain the Equity
Financing provided that (i) none of Seller or any Company shall be required to
pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any Liability in connection
with the Equity Financing, (ii) such provision does not unreasonably
interfere with the ongoing operations of Seller or any Company and their
businesses, (iii) Seller shall not have any Liability for any statements,
materials or information provided by Seller or any Company or their
Representatives to Buyer in connection with obtaining the Equity Financing and
(iv) none of Seller or any Company shall have any Liability for any
statements, materials or information provided by Seller or any Company or
their Representatives to Buyer in connection with obtaining the Equity
Financing. Buyer and Parent shall, promptly upon request by Seller, reimburse
Seller for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred
by Seller or

 



48  the Companies in connection with information provided pursuant to this
_Section 5.12_ (including reasonable legal costs and expenses); and shall
indemnify and hold harmless Seller and each Company and their Representatives
from and against any and all Losses suffered or incurred by such Persons
arising from the information provided by such Persons pursuant to this
_Section 5.12_ in arranging the Equity Financing EVEN IF CAUSED IN WHOLE OR
IN PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT), STRICT
LIABILITY OR LEGAL FAULT OF SUCH INDEMNIFIED PERSON (other than to the extent
such Losses arise from the willful misconduct or gross negligence of
Seller or any Company or any of their Representatives) and any information
utilized in connection therewith.

Section 5.13 _Seller Guarantees_. Attached hereto as Schedule 5.13 is a
schedule prepared by Seller setting forth those Seller Guarantees that relate
to and are supporting the obligations of Refinery Company with respect to
purchases of crude oil that will be delivered in June 2016 or in July 2016
and that are anticipated to be delivered in August 2016 (the " _Active Seller
Guarantees_ "). Seller shall, prior to Closing, secure the release of itself
from, and/or terminate, all of the Seller Guarantees other than the Active
Seller Guarantees. Following the Closing, Seller, Parent and Buyer shall
cooperate and use their commercially reasonable effort to obtain a release of
Seller from the Active Seller Guarantees; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if
after using its commercially reasonable efforts, Seller is unable to secure
such release, Buyer shall, if required by the beneficiary of any Active Seller
Guarantee, provide a replacement or substitute guarantee of Buyer in respect
of such Active Seller Guarantee; _provided_ , _further_ , that in no event
shall Parent be required to provide a replacement or substitute guarantee, or
Parent or Buyer be required to provide a letter of credit, bond,
security deposit or any other form of credit support, in each case, in
consideration for the release of Seller from such Seller Guarantee. If Buyer
assigns a material portion of the Assets outside of the ordinary course of
business, any Units and/or any of the Capital Stock in Pipeline Company prior
to the termination of the Active Seller Guarantees, then such assignee shall
also assume Buyers obligations pursuant to this _Section 5.13_ and _Section
8.3(e)_.

 

ARTICLE 6

POST-CLOSING COVENANTS

The Parties agree as follows with respect to the period following Closing.

 

Section 6.1 _General_. In case at any time after Closing any further action is
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, each of
the Parties will take such further action (including the execution and
delivery of such further instruments and documents) as any other Party
reasonably may request, all at the sole cost and expense of the requesting
Party (unless the request is made pursuant _Section 6.4_ or the requesting
Party is entitled to indemnification therefor under _Article 8_ ).

 

Section 6.2 _Litigation Support_. In the event and for so long as any Party
actively is contesting or defending against any Proceeding (a " _Litigating
Party_ ") (other than any Proceeding initiated (directly or indirectly) by one
or more other Parties against such Litigating Party) in connection with the
Transactions, the other Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to provide such information to such Litigating Party and its counsel, as such
Litigating Party determines is reasonably necessary in connection with the
relevant defense or contest, all at the sole cost and expense of the
Litigating Party (unless the Litigating Party is entitled to indemnification
therefor under _Article 8_ ).

 



49 Section 6.3 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Schedule 6.3(a) sets forth (i) the name and title of certain Employees
employed as of the Execution Date (the " _Specified Employees_ "), (ii) the
Employee Obligations that would arise in connection with the termination of
each such Specified Employee and (iii) Buyers anticipated categorization of
such Specified Employee as a Continued Employee, a Transitional Employee or a
Non-Continued Employee. Each Employee that is not a Specified Employee shall
be deemed a Continued Employee for the purposes of this _Section 6.3_.
Subject to applicable Law and all agreements and other arrangements with the
Specified Employees, not fewer than five Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, Buyer shall provide Seller with a schedule (the " _Employee Severance
Schedule_ ") of the Specified Employees to whom Buyer or its Affiliate will
provide continuing employment (whether at Buyer, an Affiliate of the Buyer or
the Companies), subject to the employment practices and policies of Buyer and
its Affiliates (the " _Continued Employees_ "), a list of Specified Employees
whom Buyer will provide continuing employment during a six month transitional
period following the Closing (the " _Transitional Employees_ ") and a list of
Specified Employees whom Buyer will not provide continuing employment for the
period after the Closing (the " _Non-Continued Employees_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , in each case the number of employees identified as Transitional
Employees and Non-Continued Employees on the Employee Severance Schedule
shall not materially differ from the number of employees identified as
Transitional Employees and Non-Continued Employees on Schedule 6.3(a). The
employment of the Continued Employees with Buyer, an Affiliate of Buyer or
the Companies (A) shall be effective or shall continue, as applicable, as of
the Closing Date, (B) shall provide for a substantially comparable pay rate as
earned by the Continued Employee immediately prior to the Closing
through December 31, 2016, and (C) shall offer such employee continued
employment in his or her current position or a position with materially
comparable duties (subject to Buyers, its Affiliates, the Companies ability
to terminate any employee at any time and for any reason). In addition,
following the Closing, the Continued Employees will continue to participate in
all Company Benefit Plans on the same basis and the same extent as they
participated prior to the Closing, unless and until Buyer determines to
amend, modify, terminate, substitute or replace such plans, which Buyer may do
in its discretion. Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
assist Buyer with Buyers (or the Companies immediately following Closing)
entry into employment agreements with any Continued Employee.

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, and following the adoption of the amendment
and restatement of the Company Severance Plan (in form and substance
consistent with the terms of this Agreement and acceptable to Buyer) by
Refining Company, Seller and the Companies shall take all action necessary to
transfer the sponsorship of the Company Severance Plan to Refining Company
such that all obligations and payments thereunder will be the responsibility
of and will be paid by the Companies and not by Seller. Prior to the
Closing Date, following the receipt of the Employee Severance Schedule, the
Companies shall terminate the employment of all Non-Continued Employees.
Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all employment
agreements entered into between Seller or a Company, on the one

 



50  hand, and Sellers or a Companys employees, on the other hand, providing
services to the Companies to be terminated and for such employees to execute
and deliver a release that is acceptable to Buyer in its reasonable
discretion in exchange for the payment of the applicable Employee Obligations.
At Closing or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter, the Companies
shall pay to each Non-Continued Employee and each Transitional Employee that
has delivered a release that has become effective and non-revocable ((i) as
provided by the Company Severance Plan (as amended prior to Closing), with
respect to such Employees that do not have an employment agreement or (ii)
that is reasonably acceptable to Buyer, with respect to such Employees that
have an employment agreement) an amount equal to the Employee Obligations for
each such Employee, by check or direct deposit in accordance with customary
payroll pay procedures, which amounts for the Transitional Employees will
take the form a transaction bonus. With respect to any Non-Continued Employee
or Transitional Employee (A) that does not have an employment agreement and
has not delivered the release provided for in the Company Severance Plan (as
amended prior to Closing) or such Transitional Employees transaction bonus
agreement, as applicable, then on December 31, 2016, Buyer shall pay to Seller
an amount equal to the Employee Obligations of such Employee as set forth on
Schedule 6.3(a), and (B) that has an employment agreement and has not
delivered a release reasonably acceptable to Buyer, then Buyer shall pay to
Seller on the earlier of (1) the date of Sellers payment of Employee
Obligations to such Employee, the amount of Employee Obligations actually paid
by Seller to such Employee and (2) December 31, 2016, the amount of the
Employee Obligations for such Employee.

 

(c) To the extent that any Continued Employee becomes eligible to participate
in any Employee Benefit Plans or programs that Buyer or its Affiliates or a
Company maintains or implements after the Closing (each a " _Buyer Benefit
Plan_ "), then for all purposes (including determining eligibility to
participate and vesting under plans), service with a Company shall be treated
as service under such Buyer Benefit Plan in as similar a manner as
practicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, such
service need not be recognized as benefit service (A) under any Buyer Benefit
Plan which is a qualified defined benefit pension plan or (B) to the extent
that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits.

 

(d) From and after the Closing, the Companies will be solely responsible for
all obligations and benefits under the Company Benefit Plans (excluding any
such plan maintained by an ERISA Affiliate that is not one of the Companies or
a subsidiary thereof) and all employment agreements entered into by the
Companies with any Employees of the Companies, and Seller shall have no
liability in connection therewith, except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Buyer shall not be responsible for
any employment agreements entered into between Seller and any Employee, except
with respect to the payments specified in _Section 6.3(b)_. Buyer shall pay
to each Continued Employee whose employment is terminated by Buyer, its
Affiliate or a Company within 12 months of the Closing, a severance benefit
package equivalent to that which would have been provided to such individual
upon termination by Company under the Company Severance Plan, subject to the
terms and eligibility condition of such plan and provided that such Continued
Employee is not entitled to any other severance payment whether pursuant to
an employment agreement or otherwise.

 



51 (e) Buyer acknowledges that, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
Seller will not pay any performance or other bonuses to any Employees for any
portion of the year in which the Closing occurs and that any performance or
other bonuses for the year in which the Closing occurs will be the
responsibility of the Companies (or of the Buyer or its Affiliates), which
bonus amounts, if any, Buyer may determine in its sole discretion, subject to
the terms of any applicable employment agreements, and, for the avoidance of
doubt, such bonuses will not constitute Employee Obligations hereunder.

(f) After the Closing, Buyer shall ensure that neither Company shall, at any
time prior to 90 days after the Closing Date, effectuate a "plant closing" or
"mass layoff" as those terms are defined in the WARN Act. The Company shall
provide to Buyer, on the Closing Date, a list of all employees terminated by a
Company in the 90-day period immediately prior to the Closing Date.

(g) Buyer will cause the Limited Liability Company Agreement and Pipeline
Companys limited liability company agreement to contain indemnification
provisions effective for not fewer than six years after the Closing for the
benefit of any of the Companies members, directors, officers, agents and
employees (" _Covered Persons_ ") which are at least as favorable in all
material respects to the Covered Persons as compared to current provisions
regarding indemnification contained in the Limited Liability Company Agreement
and the limited liability company agreement of Pipeline Company, as the case
may be.

(h) The provisions of this _Section 6.3_ (other than _Section 6.3(g)_) are
for the sole benefit of the Parties and nothing herein, express or implied,
is intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any Person
(including any Employee), other than the Parties and their respective
permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or
remedies under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement. Nothing
contained herein, express or implied: (A) shall be construed to establish,
amend, or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement
(including any Employee Benefit Plan); (B) shall alter or limit Buyers or any
Companys ability to amend, modify or terminate any benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement (including any Employee Benefit Plan); or (C) is
intended to confer upon any current or former employee of any Company any
right to employment or continued employment for any period of time by reason
of this Agreement, or any right to a particular term or condition of
employment.

 

(i) With respect to each Non-Continued Employee and Transitional Employee,
during the 12 month period following the termination of such Non-Continued
Employees and Transitional Employees employment with a Company, Buyer may
not, directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of Seller,
solicit for employment or hire any Non-Continued Employee or
Transitional Employee, except for offers of employment made pursuant to a
general solicitation of employment to the public or the industry.

(j) On the date that is six months following the Closing Date (the "
_Transition Date_ "), Buyer shall deliver to Seller a schedule setting forth
each Transitional Employee and if such Transitional Employee is still employed
by the Companies on the Transition Date or, if such Transitional Employee is
not still employed by the Companies on the Transition Date, the date of
termination of such Transitional Employee.

 



52 Section 6.4 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Tax Returns_. The preparation and filing of all Tax Returns by or on
behalf of the Companies after the Closing shall be governed by the following
provisions:

(i) Buyer shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and timely (with applicable
extensions) file, or caused to be filed, all Tax Returns of the Companies for
all Pre-Closing Tax Periods and Straddle Periods that are filed or required to
be filed after the Closing Date. Any such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a
manner consistent with prior Tax Returns of the Companies except as otherwise
required by Law. Reasonably in advance of filing any such Tax Return, but no
later than 30 days prior to the due date (including extensions thereof) ("
_Due Date_ ") for the filing of any such Tax Returns that constitute Income
Tax Returns, Buyer shall submit, or cause to be submitted, to Seller for
review, comment, and approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed) a draft of such Tax Return. Buyer shall provide
Seller with copies of all backup documentation and work papers supporting the
preparation of such draft Tax Returns as Seller may reasonably request. Seller
shall have 20 days following the date of delivery of the draft Tax Return
to notify Buyer in writing of either (A) any objection to such draft Tax
Return or (B) Sellers approval of the draft Tax Return. If Seller fails to
provide written notice to Buyer within such twenty-day time period, Seller
shall be conclusively treated as having approved of such Tax Return for all
purposes hereunder. In the event Seller timely notifies Buyer of any objection
with respect to a draft Tax Return (" _Objection Notice_ "), Buyer shall
consider in good faith Sellers comments to such draft Tax Return. Buyer and
Seller shall attempt in good faith to resolve all disputed items and amounts.
If Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve any disagreement within 30 days of
Buyers receipt of the Objection Notice, the unresolved disputes shall be
referred to the Accountants for resolution in accordance with _Section
6.4(a)(ii)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that any disputed
items cannot be resolved by the Due Date for filing the applicable Tax
Return, the applicable Tax Return shall be filed by such Due Date reflecting
Buyers position with respect to such disputed items and shall, if necessary,
be amended promptly after resolution of the dispute to reflect such
resolution. Buyer shall deliver to Seller a complete and accurate copy of each
such Tax Return prepared and filed by Buyer pursuant to this _Section
6.4(a)(i)_ within 15 days of filing.

 

(ii) Buyer and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Accounting Firm to resolve all remaining disagreements identified in any
Objection Notice as soon as practicable, but in any event shall direct the
Accounting Firm to render a written determination within 60 days after its
retention. The Accounting Firm shall consider only those items and amounts
(and any substantiating documentation from Buyer and Seller in connection
therewith) that are identified as the items in dispute. In resolving any
disputed item, the Parties will direct the Accounting Firm not to assign a
value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by
either Party or less than

 



53  the smallest value for such item claimed by either Party. The Accounting
Firms determination of the disputed items shall be made based solely on
substantiating documentation submitted by Buyer and Seller ( _i.e._ , not on
independent review), the applicable definitions set forth herein, and an
analysis that is consistent with and in accordance with the methodologies and
principles contemplated herein. The determination of the Accounting Firm
shall be conclusive and binding upon Buyer and Seller, and shall not be
subject to appeal or further review absent manifest error. The Parties shall
promptly comply with all reasonable requests by the Accountant for
information, books, records and similar items. The costs and expenses of the
Accounting Firm shall be borne 50% by Buyer, on the one hand, and 50% by
Seller, on the other hand.

 

(iii) Buyer shall timely pay or cause to be paid to the appropriate Taxing
Authority an amount equal to the total liability for Taxes shown to be due
and payable on any Tax Return to be filed pursuant to _Section 6.4(a)(i)_. In
connection with the filing of any such Tax Return by Buyer, Seller shall pay
to Buyer an amount equal to the portion of the total liability for Taxes
shown to be due and payable on the Tax Return that constitutes Seller Taxes
within seven days after receiving notice from Buyer that payment of such Taxes
has either been made or will be made by Buyer or a Company (but in no event
any sooner than two Business Days prior to the Due Date for such Tax Return,
except as Seller otherwise decides in his sole discretion).

 

(iv) Unless otherwise required by applicable Law, Seller will not file or
cause to be filed any amended Tax Returns for the Companies for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period without the prior written consent of
Buyer, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or
delayed. Unless otherwise required by applicable Law, Buyer will not file
or cause or allow to be filed any amended Tax Returns for the Companies for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period without the prior written
consent of Seller, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed.

 

(v) Seller shall, at the expense of Seller, prepare and file, or cause to be
prepared and filed, all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with
respect to all Transfer Taxes applicable to Seller, subject to reimbursement
by Buyer for Transfer Taxes allocated to Buyer pursuant to _Section 6.4(f)_.

 

(b) _Cooperation_. After the Closing, until expiration of the statutes of
limitation applicable for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods and Straddle Periods,
Seller and Buyer (and Buyer shall cause the Companies and their respective
Affiliates to) reasonably cooperate with each other, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the preparation
and filing of any Tax Returns pursuant to _Section 6.4(a)_ and any Tax
Proceeding. In such regard, each Party shall, and shall use reasonable efforts
to cause its Affiliates to, provide to the other Party such cooperation and
information as any of them may reasonably request in filing any Tax Returns
(including any reporting required pursuant to Section 6043 of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder) or any Tax Proceeding, including
making its employees reasonably available on a mutually convenient basis at
its cost

 



54  to provide explanation of any documents or information so provided. Such
cooperation and information shall include providing copies of all relevant
portions of relevant Tax Returns, together with relevant accompanying
schedules, relevant documents relating to rulings or other determinations by
Taxing Authorities and relevant records concerning the ownership and Tax basis
of property, that such Party may possess.

 

(c) _Confidentiality_. Any information shared in connection with Taxes shall
be kept confidential, except as may otherwise be necessary in connection with
the filing of Tax Returns or Tax Proceedings, or as required by Law.

(d) _Tax Proceedings_. The administration of all Tax Proceedings shall be
governed by the following provisions:

(i) Except as otherwise provided in this  _Section 6.4(d)_, any Tax
Proceeding associated with Seller Taxes shall constitute a Third Party Claim
governed by the procedures set forth in _Section 8.4_. In the event of any
conflict between the provisions of this  _Section 6.4(d)_ and the provisions
of _Section 8.4_, this _Section 6.4(d)_ shall control.

 

(ii) Buyer and the Companies, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand,
shall provide prompt written notice to each other upon becoming aware of any
pending or threatened Tax Proceeding, including copies of all correspondence
with any Taxing Authority with respect thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that
no delay providing such notification shall relieve Seller from any obligation
to indemnify Buyer under _Section 8.2_ unless (and then solely to the extent)
Buyer is materially prejudiced thereby. Such notice shall be in addition to
any notice of a Third Party Claim pursuant to  _Section 8.4(a)_.

(iii) Seller shall keep Buyer reasonably informed of the progress of any Tax
Proceeding under Sellers sole control pursuant to _Section 8.4_.

(iv) Buyer shall have the right, at its own expense, to control and make all
decisions taken in connection with any Tax Proceeding regarding a Straddle
Period; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the results of any such Tax
Proceeding would reasonably be expected to result in any liability under 
_Section 8.2_ for Seller in excess of $25,000, then Buyer shall not settle
any such proceeding without Sellers prior written consent, which consent may
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, and Seller shall, at
its own expense, have a right to participate in the defense and settlement of
any such Tax Proceeding.

(e) _Tax Refunds and Credits_. The amount of any refunds or credits of Taxes
of the Companies for any taxable period ending on or prior to Closing Date and
for the portion of any Straddle Period through the end of the Closing Date
shall be for the account of Seller. The amount of any refunds or credits of
Taxes of the Companies for any taxable period or the portion of any Straddle
Period beginning after the Closing Date shall be for the account of the Buyer.
The amount of any refunds or credits of Taxes of the Companies for
any Straddle

 



55  Period shall be equitably apportioned between Buyer and Seller in accordance
with the principles set forth in the definition of Straddle Period Seller
Taxes. Each Party shall forward, and shall cause its Affiliates to forward,
to the Party entitled to receive a refund or credit of Tax pursuant to this
_Section 6.4(e)_ the amount of such refund or credit within 30 days after
such refund is received or such credit is recognized, in each case net of any
reasonable costs or expenses incurred by such Party or its Affiliates in
procuring such refund. Buyer shall take all necessary actions, or cause the
Companies to take all necessary actions, as commercially reasonable (i)
to obtain any refunds of Taxes of the Companies for the account of Seller
pursuant to this _Section 6.4(e)_, or (ii) to obtain credits or offsets to
Taxes of the Companies attributable to taxable periods ending on or prior to
the Closing Date or the portion of any Straddle Period through the Closing
Date.

(f) _Transfer Taxes_. Buyer and Seller shall each pay 50% of any Transfer
Taxes.

(g) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. All Tax sharing agreements or similar agreements
and all powers of attorney with respect to or involving the Companies (other
than such agreements or powers of attorney between the Companies) shall be
terminated prior to the Closing and, on and after the Closing, no Company
shall be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder.

(h) _Wage Reporting_. The Parties shall use or cause their respective
Affiliates to use the alternate procedure set forth in Revenue Procedure
2004-53 with respect to wage reporting.

(i) _Purchase Price Allocation_. Seller and Buyer shall allocate the Purchase
Price (and any assumed obligations or other items required to be treated as
purchase price for U.S. federal income tax purposes) among the Assets in
accordance with Section 1060 of the Code, the Treasury Regulations thereunder,
and the Allocation Schedule. Buyer and Seller also shall allocate and report
any adjustments to the Purchase Price in accordance with Treasury Regulations
Section 1.1060-1(e), and any allocations made as a result of such adjustments
shall become part of the allocation pursuant to this _Section 6.4(i)_. Buyer
and Seller further acknowledge and agree that they will file all Tax Returns
and related forms (including IRS Form 8594) in accordance with this _Section
6.4(i)_, and will not make any inconsistent statement or take any
inconsistent position on any Tax Return, in any refund claim or during the
course of any Tax Proceeding, except as otherwise required pursuant to a "
_determination_ " within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code. Each
Party will notify the other if it receives notice that the IRS proposes any
allocation that is different from the allocation contemplated in this this
_Section 6.4(i)_; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Parties acknowledge and
agree that (i) Buyers cost for the Assets may differ from the total amount
allocated under this _Section 6.4(i)_ to reflect the inclusion in the total
cost of items (for example, capitalized acquisition costs) not included in
the amount so allocated, (ii) the amount realized by Seller may differ from
the total amount allocated under this _Section 6.4(i)_ to reflect transaction
costs that reduce the amount realized for federal income tax purposes, (iii)
nothing contained herein shall prevent Buyer or Seller from settling any
proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Taxing Authority based upon or
arising out of the Allocation Schedule, and (iv) neither Seller nor any of
their Affiliates nor Buyer or any of its Affiliates will be obligated to
litigate any challenge to such allocation of the Purchase Price by any Taxing
Authority.

 



56 (j) _Allocation Schedule_. Within 60 days after the Closing, Seller shall
deliver to Buyer a schedule allocating the Purchase Price among the Assets in
accordance with _Section 6.4(i)_ (the " _Proposed Allocation Schedule_ ").
Within 20 days after receiving the Proposed Allocation Schedule, Buyer shall
notify Seller in writing if Buyer has any objections to the allocations
proposed in the Proposed Allocation Schedule, and shall specify in reasonable
detail the basis for any such objections. If Buyer does not so notify Seller
of any such objection to the allocations proposed in the Proposed Allocation
Schedule, then the Proposed Allocation Schedule shall thereafter be final and
binding on all Parties. If Buyer timely notifies Seller of objections to any
of the proposed allocations in the Proposed Allocation Schedule, then Buyer
and Seller shall attempt in good faith to resolve all disputed items and
amounts. If Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve any disagreement within
thirty (30) days of Sellers receipt of the notice of objection from Buyer,
the unresolved disputes shall be referred to the Accountants for resolution in
accordance with the principals set forth in _Section 6.4(a)(iii)_. The
Proposed Allocation Schedule, upon becoming final and binding in accordance
with the foregoing (including any revisions thereby made to the Proposed
Allocation Schedule), shall constitute the " _Allocation Schedule_."

 

(k) _Treatment of the Transactio_ n. The Parties acknowledge and agree that
each Company is an entity disregarded as separate from Seller, and
accordingly, the transaction contemplated by this Agreement will constitute a
purchase and sale of the Assets for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Buyer
and Seller further acknowledge and agree that they will file all Tax Returns
in accordance with this _Section 6.4(k)_, and will not make any inconsistent
statement or take any inconsistent position on any Tax Return, in any refund
claim or during the course of any Tax Proceeding, except as otherwise required
pursuant to a " _determination_ " within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of
the Code. Each Party will notify the other if it receives notice that the IRS
proposes a treatment of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement that is
different from the treatment contemplated in this _Section 6.4(k)_
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Parties acknowledge and agree that (i)
nothing contained herein shall prevent Buyer or Seller from settling any
proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Taxing Authority based upon or
arising out of the treatment of the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement, and (ii) neither Seller nor any of their Affiliates nor Buyer or
any of its Affiliates will be obligated to litigate any challenge to the
treatment contemplated in this _Section 6.4(k)_ by any Taxing Authority.

(l) _Treatment of Payments_. Any payments made to any Party pursuant to this
_Section 6.4_ or _Article 8_ shall constitute an adjustment of the Purchase
Price for Tax purposes and shall be treated as such by Buyer and Seller on
their Tax Returns to the extent permitted by Law.

Section 6.5 _Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Prior to Closing, the terms and conditions of this Agreement and any
documentation provided to the Parties in connection herewith shall be treated
as Confidential Information that is subject to the terms and provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement. The Parties agree that the Confidentiality
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect following the Execution
Date;  _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Closing shall occur, then the
Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate as of the Closing and be of no
further force and effect thereafter.

 



57 (b) From and after the Execution Date until the second anniversary of the
Execution Date, each Seller shall maintain in confidence, shall cause its
Affiliates to maintain in confidence and shall cause its and their respective
Representatives to maintain in confidence, any written, oral or other
information relating to the Companies, the Assets or their respective
businesses, except that the requirements of this _Section 6.5(b)_ shall not
apply to the extent that (i) any such information is or becomes generally
available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by Seller or its
Affiliates or any of Sellers or Sellers Affiliates respective
Representatives in violation of this Agreement, (ii) any such information is
requested or required by applicable Law or a Governmental Authority to be
disclosed (including any report, statement, testimony or other submission to
such Governmental Authority), (iii) any such information is requested or
required to be disclosed in connection with any Proceeding or in any
dispute, in each case, with respect to this Agreement (including in response
to any summons, subpoena or other legal process or formal or informal
investigative demand issued to the disclosing Party in the course of any
Proceeding) or (iv) any such information is or has been obtained by Seller or
its Affiliates or Sellers or its Affiliates respective Representatives, in
each case, from and after the Closing on a non-confidential basis and from a
source (other than Seller, the Companies, Buyer or any of their respective
Affiliates or their respective Representatives) that is not known to be bound
by a confidentiality agreement with respect to such information. If Seller or
any of its Affiliates or any of Sellers or Sellers Affiliates respective
Representatives becomes legally compelled by deposition, interrogatory,
request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar
judicial or administrative process to disclose any information described in
this _Section 6.5(b)_, Seller shall, or shall cause its Affiliate or the
applicable Representative to, unless prohibited by Law, provide Buyer with
prompt prior written notice of such requirement (including any
report, statement, testimony or other submission to such Governmental
Authority) and, to the extent reasonably practicable, use commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate with Buyer, at Buyers sole cost and expense,
to obtain a protective order or similar remedy to cause such information not
to be disclosed; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in the event that such
protective order or other similar remedy is not obtained, Seller shall, or
shall cause its Affiliate or the applicable Representative to, furnish only
that portion of such information that has been legally compelled, and shall,
or shall cause its Affiliate or the applicable Representative to, exercise its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain assurance that confidential
treatment will be accorded such disclosed information. Seller shall instruct
its Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives having access to
any information described in this _Section 6.5(b)_ of the obligation
of confidentiality described in this _Section 6.5(b)_ and shall be
responsible for any breach of the terms of this _Section 6.5(b)_ by any of
its Affiliates or its or their respective Representatives. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, without satisfying the other obligations of
this _Section 6.5_, Seller may disclose Confidential Information to the
extent disclosure is requested or required in connection with routine audits
or examinations by, or blanket document requests from, a regulatory or
governmental entity that does not specifically target the Companies.

(c) Without intending in any way to limit the remedies available to Buyer,
Seller hereby acknowledges that the breach, or attempted or threatened breach,
of the provisions of this _Section 6.5_ by it will result in immediate and
irreparable harm to Buyer and that damages at law will not be an adequate
remedy for Buyer, and further acknowledges and agrees that if such Seller
breaches any of the covenants contained in this _Section 6.5_, Buyer may seek
injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to restrain the
breach or the threatened breach of, or otherwise specifically to enforce, any
of such covenants. Such injunctive relief shall be in addition to, and not in
lieu of, any other remedies at law or in equity available to Buyer.

 



58 Section 6.6 _Financial Statement Assistance_. For so long as Buyer or
its Affiliates are required under Regulation S-X of the Securities Act to
separately include the financial statements of any Company in documents filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission by Buyer or its Affiliates
pursuant to the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, Seller shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts (a) to cause Sellers auditors, subject to
Buyers compliance with any reasonable request of Sellers auditors, to
provide, at Buyers sole cost and expense, such assistance as Buyer may
reasonably request in connection with the preparation of the Financial
Statements or to the inclusion or incorporation by reference of Sellers
auditors opinion with respect to the Financial Statements in documents filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission by Buyer or its Affiliates
pursuant to the Securities Act or Exchange Act (including the delivery to
Sellers auditors of customary representation letters of Seller) and, in
connection with any issuance of securities, to deliver customary auditors
consents and "comfort letters" in connection therewith and (b) if requested by
Buyer, to make available to Buyer such additional information with respect to
the financial statements of the Companies in Sellers possession and control
for the periods ending prior to the Closing as reasonably required by Buyer in
order to prepare or, if required, audit financial statements of the
Companies meeting the requirements of Regulation S-X of the Securities Act
from time to time (provided that Buyer shall reimburse Seller for the
reasonable, documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Seller in
connection with such cooperation);  _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller
shall not (i) be required to deliver any representation letter, certificate or
other information with respect to any use of such financial statements by
Buyer or its Affiliates subsequent to the Closing Date or (ii) be responsible
for any misstatement or omission in any of Buyers or its Affiliates
securities filings or in respect of any of Buyers or its Affiliates
financings caused by or resulting from the use by Buyer or its Affiliates of
such financial statements. Buyer will reimburse Seller, within ten Business
Days after demand in writing therefor, for any reasonable costs and expenses
incurred by Seller and its Affiliates in complying with the provisions of
this _Section 6.6_.

Section 6.7 _Retention of Certain Amounts_. Following Closing until the later
of (a) December 31, 2016 and (b) the date that the last Claim for
Indemnification then pending under this Agreement has been (1) paid in full or
(2) fully and finally resolved by agreement of the Parties or by a
final, non-appealable court order, Seller shall maintain, and shall not
distribute to its members, an amount equal to the Holdback Amount, in a
segregated account of Seller with the Deposit Bank that is free and clear of
any Liens; _provided_ ,  _however_ , on or after (i) the later of (A) the
Closing Date and (B) the resolution of any Inventory Claims, Seller may
distribute the amount of the Holdback Amount in excess of $5,000,000 and (ii)
December 31, 2016, if there is no pending Claim for Indemnification as of
such date that asserts an unliquidated amount of damages (provided that Buyer
has used its commercially reasonable efforts to include its reasonable
estimate of liquidated damages with respect to any Claim for
Indemnification), Seller may distribute the Holdback Amount in excess of the
aggregate amount of liquidated damages asserted in any Claim for
Indemnification validly raised by Buyer and pending as of such date.

 



59 Section 6.8 _Release of Certain Amounts_. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, the Parties agree that following the Closing, upon the release
by the Deposit Bank of its Liens in account #4451122737 (the " _Subject Seller
Account_ "), all funds then held in such account shall be promptly but in any
event within one Business Day of such release by the Deposit Bank transferred
to Seller, which payment shall be deemed to be a distribution made by Refining
Company to Seller, effective immediately prior to the Closing Date.

 

Section 6.9 _Company Records_. Within 15 days following the Closing Date,
Seller shall make available to Buyer any of the Company Records that are not
in the possession or control of the Companies on the Closing Date.

Section 8.4 _Matters Involving Third Parties_.

 

(a) If any third party shall notify any Party (the " _Indemnified Party_ ")
with respect to any matter (a " _Third-Party Claim_ ") which may give rise to
a Claim for Indemnification against any other Party (the " _Indemnifying
Party_ ") under this _Article 8_ , then the Indemnified Party shall promptly
notify each Indemnifying Party thereof in writing; _provided, however_ , that
no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in notifying any Indemnifying
Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from any obligation under this
Agreement unless (and then solely to the extent) the Indemnifying Party is
prejudiced thereby.

(b) In the case of a Claim for Indemnification based upon a Third-Party Claim,
the Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days from its receipt of written notice
of such claim to notify the Indemnified Party whether it admits or denies its
liability to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third-Party Claim at
the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party is
authorized, prior to and during such 30-day period, to file any motion, answer
or other pleading, or take such other and further action, that the Indemnified
Party in its reasonable judgment shall deem necessary or appropriate to
protect its interests or those of the Indemnifying Party and that is not
prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party.

 

(c) If the Indemnifying Party admits its liability, it shall have the right
and obligation to diligently defend, at its sole cost and expense, the Third-
Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall have full control of such defense
and Proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof unless (i) the
Indemnifying Party fails to provide reasonable assurance to the
Indemnified Party of its financial capacity to defend such Third-Party Claim,
(ii) the Third-Party Claim relates to a Material Customer or Material
Supplier, (iii) the Third-Party Claim is with respect to a criminal
proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation, or (iv) the
Indemnified Party reasonably believes that the Adverse Consequences relating
to such Third-Party Claim would reasonably be expected to exceed the maximum
amount that such Indemnified Party could then be entitled to recover under
the provisions of this _Article 8_. If the compromise or settlement of any
Third-Party Claim includes the payment of any amount by, the performance of
any obligation by or the limitation of any right or benefit of,
the Indemnified Party or the admission by the Indemnified Party of matters of
fact or law, such settlement or compromise shall not be effective without the
consent of the Indemnified Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnified Party agrees to cooperate in contesting any Third-Party Claim
which the Indemnifying Party elects to contest. The Indemnified Party may
participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement of any Third-Party
Claim fully controlled by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Section
8.4(c)_. An Indemnifying Party shall not, without

 



65  the written consent of the Indemnified Party, (A) settle any Third-Party
Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect thereto which does
not include an unconditional written release of the Indemnified Party from
all liability in respect of such Third-Party Claim or (B) settle any Third-
Party Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect thereto in
any manner that may materially and adversely affect the Indemnified Party
(other than as a result of money damages covered by the indemnity).

(d) If the Indemnifying Party is not entitled to fully control the defense of
a Third-Party Claim pursuant to _Section 8.4(c)_, then the Indemnified Party
shall have the right to defend against the Third-Party Claim at the sole cost
and expense of the Indemnifying Party (to the extent and only to the extent
such costs and expenses are reasonable), with counsel of the Indemnified
Partys choosing, subject to the right of the Indemnifying Party to approve
(such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) such
counsel and costs and expenses. If the Indemnified Party has assumed the
defense against the Third-Party Claim pursuant to this _Section 8.4(d)_, the
Indemnified Party (i) shall send written notice to the Indemnifying Party
of any proposed settlement and (ii) shall not, without the written consent of
the Indemnifying Party, settle any Third-Party Claim or consent to the entry
of any judgment with respect thereto without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed).

(e) If the Indemnifying Party does not admit its liability or admits its
liability but fails to diligently prosecute or settle the Third-Party Claim,
then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend against the Third-
Party Claim at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, with
counsel of the Indemnified Partys choosing, subject to the right of the
Indemnifying Party to admit its liability and assume the defense of the Third-
Party Claim at any time prior to settlement or final determination thereof. If
the Indemnified Party has assumed the defense against the Third Party Claim
pursuant to this _Section 8.4(e)_, the Indemnified Party shall send written
notice to the Indemnifying Party of any proposed settlement and the
Indemnifying Party shall have the option for 10 days following receipt of
such notice to (i) admit in writing its liability for the Third-Party Claim
and consent to such proposed settlement, (ii) admit in writing its liability
for the Third-Party Claim and reject, in its reasonable judgment, the
proposed settlement and take over (and diligently pursue) the defense and/or
settlement of such Third-Party Claim or (iii) deny its liability for the
Third-Party Claim, in which case the Indemnified Party may accept such
proposed settlement and seek all remedies available to such Indemnified Party
against the Indemnifying Party. Any failure by the Indemnifying Party to
respond to such notice shall be deemed to be an election under subsection
(iii) above. 

Section 8.5 _Matters Not Involving Third Party Claims_. Buyer or Seller, may
make a claim for any matter that does not involve a Third-Party Claim in any
amount to which Buyer or Seller may be entitled under this _Article 8_ by
providing a Claim for Indemnification against the other promptly after such
Indemnified Party has notice of any Adverse Consequence which may give rise
to a Claim for Indemnification; _provided, however_ , that no delay on the
part of Buyer or Seller in notifying the other shall relieve the Indemnifying
Party from any obligation hereunder unless the Indemnifying Party
is prejudiced by such delay. The Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days to
object to the Claim for Indemnification by delivery of a written notice of
such objection to the Indemnified Party specifying in reasonable detail the
basis for such

 



66  objection. Failure to timely respond shall constitute a final and binding
acceptance of the Claim for Indemnification by the Indemnifying Party, and the
Claim for Indemnification shall be paid in accordance with _Section 8.6_. If
an objection is timely interposed by the Indemnifying Party, then the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall negotiate in good faith for
a period of 20 Business Days from the date the Indemnified Party receives
such objection prior to commencing any arbitration, formal legal action, suit
or proceeding with respect to such Claim for Indemnification.

 

Section 8.6 _Final Determination of a Claim_. A " _final determination_ " of a
Claim for Indemnification shall be (i) a final judgment of any court
determining the validity of a disputed claim that is non-appealable; (ii) an
award of any arbitrator or arbitration panel determining the validity of such
disputed claim, if there is not pending any motion to set aside such award or
if the time within which to move to set such award aside has elapsed; (iii) a
written termination of the dispute with respect to such claim signed by all of
the parties thereto; (iv) a written acknowledgment of the Indemnifying Party
that it no longer disputes the validity or amount of such claim; (v) the date
on which an Indemnifying Party fails to respond to a Claim for Indemnification
as specified in _Section 8.5_; or (vi) such other evidence of final
determination of a disputed claim as shall be reasonably acceptable to the
Parties.

 

Section 8.7 _Determination of Adverse Consequences_. All indemnification
payments under this _Article 8_ shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party net
of any insurance proceeds actually recovered by the Indemnified Party (net of
reasonable out of pocket third party expenses incurred in obtaining such
indemnification payments and premium adjustment attributable thereto). For
the purposes of determining whether a breach or inaccuracy occurred and
calculating any Adverse Consequences in connection therewith pursuant to
_Section 8.2(a)_, or _Section 8.3(a)_, the representations and warranties
in this Agreement shall be read without any materiality (including the word
"material"), Material Adverse Effect or similar qualifiers.

 

Section 8.8 _Effect of Investigation_. The representations, warranties and
covenants of the Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnified Partys right to
indemnification with respect thereto, shall not be affected or deemed waived
by reason of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party
(including by any of its Representatives) or by reason of the fact that the
Indemnified Party or any of its Representatives knew or should have known that
any such representation or warranty is, was or might be inaccurate or by
reason of the Indemnified Partys waiver of any condition set forth in 
_Section 7.1_ or _Section 7.2_, as the case may be.

Section 8.9 _Exclusive Remedy_. BUYER AND SELLER ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT,
FROM AND AFTER THE CLOSING, THE FOREGOING INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS IN THIS
_ARTICLE 8_ SHALL BE THE EXCLUSIVE REMEDY OF BUYER AND SELLER WITH RESPECT TO
THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER AND BUYER SET FORTH IN _ARTICLE
3_ AND _ARTICLE 4_ AND THE CERTIFICATES DELIVERED AT CLOSING (OTHER THAN
CLAIMS ARISING FROM FRAUD, CRIMINAL ACTIVITY OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT ON THE PART
OF A PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS). EACH OF BUYER AND SELLER
WAIVES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT NEITHER IT, NOR ANY SUCCESSOR OR ASSIGN, SHALL
HAVE ANY RIGHTS

 



67  (INCLUDING STATUTORY OR COMMON LAW RIGHTS AND CLAIMS ARISING UNDER
ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS INCLUDING CERCLA) AGAINST THE OTHER PARTIES OR THEIR
AFFILIATES WITH RESPECT TO THE TRANSACTIONS OTHER THAN AS IS EXPRESSLY
PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT. NOTHING IN THIS _SECTION 8.9_ SHALL LIMIT ANY
PERSONS RIGHT TO SEEK ANY REMEDY ON ACCOUNT OF ANY PARTYS FRAUDULENT,
CRIMINAL OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT.

 

Section 8.10 _Limitation on Damages_. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY
IN THIS AGREEMENT, IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY PARTY BE LIABLE TO ANY OTHER PARTY
FOR ANY EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, REMOTE, SPECULATIVE, SPECIAL DAMAGES, OR LOSS OF
PROFITS EXCEPT (A) TO THE EXTENT ANY SUCH PARTY SUFFERS SUCH DAMAGES
(INCLUDING COSTS OF DEFENSE AND REASONABLE ATTORNEYS FEES INCURRED IN
CONNECTION WITH DEFENDING OF SUCH DAMAGES) TO A THIRD PARTY OR (B) ARISING
FROM FRAUD, WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OR CRIMINAL ACTIVITY, WHICH DAMAGES (INCLUDING
COSTS OF DEFENSE AND REASONABLE ATTORNEYS FEES INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH

Buyer to close in the instance where, as of the Outside Closing Date, (i) all
of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ (excluding conditions that, by
their terms, cannot be satisfied until the Closing) have been satisfied (or
waived, or deemed to have been waived, by Buyer), (ii) Seller is ready,
willing and able to close, (iii) Buyer has secured the Equity Financing on or
prior to the Outside Closing Date and (iv) Buyer nevertheless elects not to
promptly close, then in either such event, the Parties agree and acknowledge
that Seller would not have any adequate remedy at law and would suffer damages
that are not practicable to ascertain, and Seller shall be entitled to, at its
option, (A) specific performance against either Buyer or Parent, without any
requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such
remedy, or (B) terminate this Agreement and retain the Deposit Amount as
liquidated damages. Seller agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by
Law, Sellers right to either specific performance or the payment of such
Deposit Amount as provided in this _Section 9.2(c)_ shall be the sole and
exclusive remedies of Seller with respect to Buyers failure to close as
contemplated by this _Section 9.2(c)_.

(d) In the event this Agreement is terminated for any reason (other than as
provided in  _Section 9.2(b)_ or _Section 9.2(c)_), then Seller shall be
entitled to retain the Deposit Amount, free and clear of any claims thereon by
Buyer as the sole and exclusive remedy (except as provided in _Section
9.2(a)_) of Seller or any of its respective Affiliates against Buyer or any
of its Affiliates or any of their respective stockholders, partners, members
or Representatives for any and all Adverse Consequences that may be suffered
based upon, resulting from or arising out of the circumstances giving rise to
such termination, and upon payment of the Deposit Amount to Seller in
accordance with this _Section 9.2_, none of the Buyer or any of its
Affiliates or any of their respective stockholders, partners, members or
Representatives shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions except as provided in
_Section 9.2(a)_.

 

(e) Upon termination of this Agreement, Buyer shall destroy or return to
Seller all data, assessments and/or reports, maps and other information
furnished by or on behalf of Seller to Buyer or prepared by or on behalf of
Buyer in connection with its due diligence investigation of the Units and
Assets, in each case, in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement and, if
Buyer elects to destroy any such information, an officer of Buyer shall
