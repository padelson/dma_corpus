its reasonable estimation of the amount of any liability in respect of (a) any
bona fide Relevant Claim or (b) any right to recover any sum from a third
party (other than the underwriter of the WandI Policy) in respect of a matter
which could give rise to a Warranty Claim which the Buyer is pursuing against
that third party in accordance with paragraph 7.1 of Schedule 5 of the Deed of
Warranty, and, subject to paragraphs 2.2 to 2.6 below, require that such
amount is retained in the Retention Account notwithstanding the Release Date,

and the quantum of the Relevant Claim in question and as to whether there is
a reasonable prospect that such liability or Relevant Claim may be
established by judgement in favour of the Buyer in relation to such liability
or Relevant Claim. For the purposes of paragraph 2.3, a reasonable prospect
is one with greater than 50% likelihood of success and, for the avoidance of
doubt, in the case of contingent liabilities, the Queens Counsels decision
on the Retained Amount shall be made on the same basis and on the assumption
that the contingent liability will become an actual liability.

expert in relation to all financial, accounting and actuarial matters provided
always that the Institutional Sellers Representative and the Sellers
Representative and the Buyer shall be entitled to make representations to the
Queens Counsel for the purposes of this paragraph 2.4 including as to the

Claim and dispute in question to the extent available in support of such

determined by the Queens Counsel in his absolute discretion and the Buyer and
the Institutional Sellers Representative and the Sellers Representative
shall observe and perform any directions which the Queens Counsel may give
and shall be bound by any decision which he may make consequent upon any
failure to observe and perform any such directions. Costs shall be borne as
the Queens Counsel directs. 
---|--- 



   2.6 | To the extent that: 
---|--- 



     | 2.6.1 | the Queens Counsel should decide that any part of the
Retained Amount was in excess of a reasonable estimate of the amount of the
liability in respect of such Relevant Claim or that there is no reasonable
prospect of a judgement in favour of the Buyer in relation to such Relevant
Claim; or 
---|---|--- 



     | 2.6.2 | the Buyer and the Institutional Sellers Representative
and the Sellers Representative agree that any part of the Retained Amount was
in excess of a reasonable estimate of the amount of the liability in respect
of such Relevant Claim, 
---|---|--- 

then such amount shall be dealt with in accordance with paragraph 3.1 below.

 



   3. | RELEASES

of the Retention Account (if any) shall be retained in that account until
