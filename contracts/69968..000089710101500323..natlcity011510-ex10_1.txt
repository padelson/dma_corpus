                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER



         AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of April 30, 2001 (the
"Agreement"), between NATIONAL CITY BANCORPORATION, an Iowa corporation (the
"Seller") and MARSHALL & ILSLEY CORPORATION, a Wisconsin corporation (the
"Company").

         WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of the Company and the Seller have
each determined that it is fair to and in the best interests of their respective
shareholders for the Seller to merge with and into the Company (the "Merger")
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein and in accordance
with the Iowa Business Corporation Act (the "IBCA") and the Wisconsin Business
Corporation Law (the "WBCL");

         WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of the Company and the
Seller have each approved the Merger of the Seller with and into the Company,
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, and adopted this
Agreement;

         WHEREAS, subsequent to the Seller's approval of this Agreement and
concurrently with the execution of this Agreement and as a condition and an
inducement to the willingness of the Company to enter into this Agreement, the
Company and each of the Lowell W. Andreas Revocable Trust, as amended and
restated November 3, 1998, the David L. Andreas Revocable Trust, amended on
December 18, 1998, the D.I.A. Revocable Trust, amended and restated on July 15,
1995, the Sandra Ann Andreas McMurtie Trust, amended and restated on September

have entered into an agreement pursuant to which each such shareholder has
agreed to vote its shares of Seller Common Stock in favor of the Merger;

         WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the
Merger shall qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368 of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and this Agreement
shall constitute the plan of reorganization; and

         WHEREAS, for financial accounting purposes it is intended that the
Merger shall be accounted for as a purchase.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the
representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, and subject to the
terms and conditions set forth herein, the parties hereto hereby agree as
follows:

                             ARTICLE I - THE MERGER

         SECTION 1.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the IBCA, the WBCL and the
Plan of Merger attached hereto as Exhibit 1.1, at the Effective Time (as defined
in Section 1.2) Seller shall be merged with and into the Company. As a result of
the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Seller shall cease and the
Company shall continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the
"Surviving Corporation").

         SECTION 1.2 Effective Time. As promptly as practicable after the
satisfaction or, if permissible, waiver of the conditions set forth in Article
VII, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing
articles of merger (the "Articles of Merger") with the Secretary




                                        1
<PAGE>

of State of the State of Iowa (the "Iowa Secretary of State") and the Department
of Financial Institutions of the State of Wisconsin (the "DFI"), in such form as
required by, and executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of, the
IBCA and the WBCL (the date and time of such filing is referred to herein as the
"Effective Time").

         SECTION 1.3 Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of
the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions
of the IBCA and the WBCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject thereto, at the Effective Time, except as otherwise provided herein, all
the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and the
Seller shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and
duties of the Company and the Seller shall become the debts, liabilities and
duties of the Surviving Corporation.

         SECTION 1.4 Articles of Incorporation; By-Laws. At the Effective Time,
the Articles of Incorporation, as amended of the Company (the "Company
Articles") and the By-Laws, as amended, of the Company (the "Company By-Laws"),
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Articles of
Incorporation and the By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation.

         SECTION 1.5 Directors and Officers. At the Effective Time, the
directors of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in
accordance with the Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Surviving
Corporation and to be assigned to the class previously assigned. At the
Effective Time, the officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case
until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed.

         SECTION 1.6 Conversion of Securities; Dissenting Shares. Subject to
Section 1.7(e) regarding fractional shares, at the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without action on the part of the Company, the Seller or the
holder of the following securities:

                  (a) Each share of common stock, par value $1.25 per share, of
         Seller ("Seller Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior
         to the Effective Time (all shares of Seller Common Stock issued and
         outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time being referred to
         herein as the "Shares"), other than Shares held in the treasury of
         Seller or owned by the Company and any Company Subsidiary for its own
         account and other than Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section
         1.6(e)), shall be converted in accordance with Section 1.7, into the
         right to receive shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of
         the Company ("Company Common Stock") having a value of $29.50 (subject
         to adjustment in accordance with Section 1.6(b), below). All such
         shares of Seller Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
         automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
         each certificate previously representing any such shares shall
         thereafter represent the right to receive a certificate representing
         shares of Company Common Stock into which such Seller Common Stock
         shall have been converted. Certificates previously representing shares
         of Seller Common Stock shall be exchanged for certificates representing
         whole shares of Company Common Stock issued in consideration therefor
         upon the surrender of such certificates in accordance with the
         provisions of Section 1.7, without interest. No fractional share of
         Company Common Stock shall be issued, and, in lieu thereof, a cash
         payment shall be made pursuant to Section 1.7.

<PAGE>

                  (b) The number of shares of Company Common Stock that each
         Share shall have the right to receive in accordance with Section 1.6(a)
         above shall equal $29.50 divided by the Average Trading Price of the
         Company Common Stock (rounded to the nearest one hundred thousandth);
         provided, however, that if the number of shares as so calculated (1) is
         greater than 0.65556, such number shall be reduced to 0.65556, or (2)
         is less than 0.53636, such number shall be increased to 0.53636 (the
         exchange rate, as adjusted if applicable, is hereinafter referred to as
         the "Exchange Rate"). The "Average Trading Price" of the Company Common
         Stock shall be the average of the average high and low sale price per
         share of the Company Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the
         "NYSE") as reported in the Midwest Edition of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
         for the twenty (20) trading days ending on and including the third
         trading day preceding the Effective Time. The Company agrees that all
         of its purchases of Company Common Stock shall be in accordance with
         Regulation M under the Exchange Act.

                  (c) Each Share held by the Seller as treasury stock
         immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and
         extinguished without any conversion thereof into Company Common Stock
         or payment therefor.

                  (d) Each Share held by the Company and any Company Subsidiary
         for its own account shall be canceled and extinguished without
         conversion thereof into Company Common Stock or payment therefor.

                  (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
         contrary, Shares which are issued and outstanding immediately prior to
         the Effective Time and which are held by shareholders who have validly
         exercised dissenter's rights available under Sections 490.1301 to
         490.1331 of the IBCA (the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted
         into or be exchangeable for the right to receive Company Common Stock
         in accordance with this Section 1.6, unless and until such holders
         shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or
         lost their rights to appraisal under the IBCA. Dissenting Shares shall
         be treated in accordance with Division XIII of the IBCA, if and to the
         extent applicable. If any such holder shall have failed to perfect or
         shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right to dissent, such
         holder's Shares shall thereupon be converted into and become
         exchangeable only for the right to receive, as of the Effective Time,
         Company Common Stock in accordance with this Section 1.6, without any
         interest thereon. Seller shall give the Company (a) prompt notice of
         each and every notice of a shareholder's intent to demand payment for
         the shareholder's Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and
         any other instruments served pursuant to the IBCA and received by the
         Seller relating to rights to be paid the "fair value" of Dissenting
         Shares, as provided in Sections 490.1301 to 490.1331 of the IBCA and
         (b) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with
         respect to demands for appraisal under the IBCA. Seller shall not,
         except with the prior written consent of the Company, voluntarily make
         any payment with respect to any demands for appraisals of capital stock
         of Seller, offer to settle or settle any demands or approve any
         withdrawal of any such demands.

         SECTION 1.7 Exchange of Certificates.

                  (a) Exchange Agent. As of the Effective Time, the Company
         shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust
         company designated by the Company (the "Exchange Agent"), for the
         benefit of the holders of Shares, for exchange in accordance




                                        3
<PAGE>

         with this Article I, through the Exchange Agent, certificates
         representing the shares of Company Common Stock (such certificates for
         shares of Company Common Stock, together with any dividends or
         distributions with respect thereto are referred to herein as the
         "Exchange Fund") issuable pursuant to Section 1.6 in exchange for
         outstanding Shares.

                  (b) Exchange Procedures. As soon as reasonably practicable
         after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder
         of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to
         the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares (the "Certificates"),
         whose Shares were converted into the right to receive shares of Company
         Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.6, (i) a letter of transmittal
         (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss
         and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
         Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have
         such other provisions as the Company may reasonably specify) and (ii)
         instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
         exchange for certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock.
         Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent
         together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of
         such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a
         certificate representing that number of whole shares of Company Common
         Stock which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the
         Certificate surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this Article I
         (after taking into account all Shares then held by such holder), and
         the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the
         event of a transfer of ownership of Shares which is not registered in
         the transfer records of the Seller, a certificate representing the
         proper number of shares of Company Common Stock may be issued to a
         transferee if the Certificate representing such Shares is presented to
         the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence
         and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock
         transfer taxes have been paid. In the event any Certificate shall have
         been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
         fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
         destroyed and the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as
         the Company may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
         against it or the Exchange Agent with respect to such Certificate, the
         Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
         destroyed Certificate a certificate representing the proper number of
         shares of Company Common Stock. Until surrendered as contemplated by
         this Section 1.7, each Certificate (other than Certificates
         representing Shares owned by the Company or any Company Subsidiary, and
         Certificates representing Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed at any
         time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive
         upon such surrender the certificate representing shares of Company
         Common Stock and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Company
         Common Stock as contemplated by Section 1.7(e).

                  (c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No
         dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective
         Time with respect to Company Common Stock with a record date after the
         Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
         Certificate with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock
         represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares
         shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 1.7(e), until the
         holder of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to
         the effect of applicable laws, following surrender of any such
         Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the certificates
         representing whole shares of Company Common Stock issued in exchange
         therefor, without interest, (i) promptly, the amount of any cash
         payable with respect to a fractional share of Company Common Stock




                                       4
<PAGE>

         to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.7(e) and the
         amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
         Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of
         Company Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the
         amount of dividends or other distributions, with a record date after
         the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date occurring
         after surrender, payable with respect to such whole shares of Company
         Common Stock.

                  (d) No Further Rights in the Shares. All shares of Company
         Common Stock issued upon conversion of the Shares in accordance with
         the terms hereof (including any cash paid pursuant to Section 1.7(e))
         shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights
         pertaining to such Shares.

                  (e) No Fractional Shares. No certificates or scrip
         representing fractional shares of Company Common Stock shall be issued
         upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, and such fractional
         share interest will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any
         rights of a shareholder of the Company. Each holder of a fractional
         share interest shall be paid an amount in cash equal to the product
         obtained by multiplying such fractional share interest to which such
         holder (after taking into account all fractional share interests then
         held by such holder) would otherwise be entitled by the Average Trading
         Price. As soon as reasonably practicable after the determination of the
         amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of fractional share
         interests, the Company shall make available such amounts (without
         interest) to such holders of such fractional share interests.

                  (f) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange
         Fund which remains undistributed to the former shareholders of Seller
         for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the
         Company, upon demand, and any former shareholders of Seller who have
         not theretofore complied with this Article I shall thereafter look only
         to the Company to claim their shares of Company Common Stock, any cash
         in lieu of fractional shares of Company Common Stock and any dividends
         or distributions with respect to Company Common Stock, in each case
         without interest thereon, and subject to Section 1.7(g).

                  (g) No Liability. Neither the Company nor the Seller shall be
         liable to any former holder of Shares for any such Shares (or dividends
         or distributions with respect thereto) or cash or other payment
         delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property,
         escheat or similar laws.

                  (h) Withholding Rights. The Company shall be entitled to
         deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant
         to this Agreement to any former holder of Shares such amounts as the
         Company is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making
         of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or
         foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the
         Company, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
         this Agreement as having been paid to the former holder of the Shares
         in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the
         Company.

         SECTION 1.8 Stock Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of Seller shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Seller Common Stock thereafter on the
records of Seller. From and after the Effective Time, the holders




                                       5
<PAGE>

of certificates evidencing ownership of shares of Seller Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided herein or by
law. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the Exchange
Agent or the Company for any reason shall be converted into shares of Company
Common Stock in accordance with this Article I, subject to applicable law in the
case of Dissenting Shares.

         SECTION 1.9 Adjustments for Dilution and Other Matters. If prior to the
Effective Time, (i) Seller shall declare a stock dividend or distribution upon
or subdivide, split up, reclassify or combine the Seller Common Stock, or
declare a dividend or make a distribution on the Seller Common Stock in any
security convertible into Seller Common Stock, or (ii) the Company shall declare
a stock dividend or distribution upon or subdivide, split up, reclassify or
combine the Company Common Stock or declare a dividend or make a distribution on
the Company Common Stock in any security convertible into Company Common Stock,
appropriate adjustment or adjustments will be made to the Exchange Rate
determined pursuant to Section 1.6(b).

         SECTION 1.10 Company Common Stock. The shares of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
unaffected by the Merger and at the Effective Time, such shares shall remain
issued and outstanding.


              ARTICLE II - REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER

         Except as set forth in the Disclosure Schedule delivered by Seller to
the Company prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "Seller Disclosure
Schedule"), which shall identify exceptions by specific Section references,
Seller hereby represents and warrants to the Company that:

         SECTION 2.1 Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries.

                  (a) Seller is a corporation duly organized, validly existing
         and in good standing under the laws of the State of Iowa, and is a
         registered bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of
         1956, as amended (the "BHCA"). Each subsidiary of Seller ("Seller
         Subsidiary" or, collectively, "Seller Subsidiaries") is a federally
         chartered national bank or a corporation duly organized, validly
         existing and in good standing under the laws of the state of its
         incorporation. Each of Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries has the
         requisite corporate power and authority and is in possession of all
         franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements,
         consents, certificates, approvals and orders ("Seller Approvals")
         necessary to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its
         business as it is now being conducted, including appropriate
         authorizations from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
         System (the "Federal Reserve Board"), the Office of the Comptroller of
         the Currency (the "OCC"), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
         (the "FDIC") and the Iowa Secretary of State, and neither Seller nor
         any Seller Subsidiary has received any notice of proceedings relating
         to the revocation or modification of any Seller Approvals, except in
         each case where the revocations or modifications, the failure to be so
         organized, existing and in good standing or to have such power,
         authority and Seller Approvals would not, individually or in the
         aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in Section
         2.1(d)) on Seller and Seller Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

                  (b) Seller and each Seller Subsidiary is duly qualified or
         licensed as a foreign corporation to do business, and is in good
         standing, in each jurisdiction where the character



                                       6
<PAGE>

         of its properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its
         activities makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for
         such failures to be so duly qualified or licensed and in good standing
         that would not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a
         Material Adverse Effect on Seller or Seller Subsidiaries, taken as a
         whole.

                  (c) A true and complete list of all of the Seller
         Subsidiaries, together with (i) the Seller's percentage ownership of
         each Seller Subsidiary and (ii) laws under which the Seller Subsidiary
         is incorporated is set forth on Annex A. Except as set forth on Annex
         A, Seller and/or one or more of the Seller Subsidiaries owns
         beneficially and of record all of the outstanding shares of capital
         stock of each of the Seller Subsidiaries. Except for the subsidiaries
         set forth on Annex A, Seller does not directly or indirectly own any
         equity or similar interests in, or any interests convertible into or
         exchangeable or exercisable for any equity or similar interest in, any
         corporation, partnership, joint venture or other business association
         or entity other than in the ordinary course of business, and in no
         event in excess of 5% of the outstanding equity securities of such
         entity.

                  (d) As used in this Agreement, the term "Material Adverse
         Effect" means, with respect to the Company or the Seller, as the case
         may be, any effect that (i) is material and adverse to the business,
         assets, liabilities, results of operations or financial condition of
         the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (as defined in Section 3.1(a))
         taken as a whole or the Seller and Seller Subsidiaries taken as a
         whole, respectively, or (ii) materially impairs the ability of the
         Company or Seller to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby;
         provided, however, that Material Adverse Effect shall not be deemed to
         include the impact of (a) compliance with the terms of, or the taking
         of actions contemplated by, this Agreement, (b) changes in laws and
         regulations or interpretations thereof that are generally applicable to
         the banking industry, (c) changes in generally accepted accounting
         principles that are generally applicable to the banking industry, (d)
         reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the transactions
         contemplated hereby, and (e) changes attributable to or resulting from
         changes in general economic conditions affecting banks or their holding
         companies generally, including changes in the prevailing level of
         interest rates; provided, further, however, that none of the following
         shall be deemed (either alone or in combination ) to constitute, and
         none of the following shall be taken into account in determining
         whether there has been or will be, a Material Adverse Effect with
         respect to the Seller: (a) any change in the market price or trading
         volume of the Seller's Common Stock; (b) the payment of any amounts due
         to, or the provision of any other benefits to, any officers or
         employees under employment contracts, non-competition agreements,
         employee benefit plans, severance agreements or other arrangements in
         existence as of the date of this Agreement; (c) the taking of any
         action by the Seller approved or consented to by the Company; or (d)
         any adverse event (including litigation, employee terminations or
         disruption of business relationships) directly caused by this Agreement
         and the transactions contemplated herein. Failure by the Seller to meet
         its revenue or income projections shall not be deemed in and of itself
         to be a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (e) The minute books of the Seller and each of the Seller
         Subsidiaries contain true, complete and accurate records in all
         material respects of all meetings and other corporate actions held or
         taken since January 1, 2001, of their respective shareholders and
         Boards of Directors (including committees of their respective Boards of
         Directors).

         SECTION 2.2 Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws. Seller has
heretofore furnished to the Company a complete and correct copy of the Articles
of Incorporation and the By-Laws, as amended or restated, of Seller ("Seller
Articles" and "Seller By-Laws," respectively") and each Seller Subsidiary. Such
Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws of Seller and each Seller Subsidiary are
in full force and effect. Neither Seller nor any Seller Subsidiary is in
violation in any material respect of any of the provisions of its Articles of
Incorporation or By-Laws.

         SECTION 2.3 Capitalization. The authorized capital stock of Seller
consists of 40,000,000 shares of Seller Common Stock. As of the date of this
Agreement, (i) 8,868,183.857 shares of Seller Common Stock are issued and
outstanding, all of which are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable, and not issued in violation of any preemptive right of any
Seller shareholder and (ii) 394,285 shares of Seller Common Stock are held in
the treasury of Seller. There are no outstanding options, warrants or other
rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments of any character, including
without limitation voting agreements or arrangements, relating to the issued or
unissued capital stock of Seller or any Seller Subsidiary or obligating Seller
or any Seller Subsidiary to issue or sell any shares of capital stock of, or
other equity interests in, Seller or any Seller Subsidiary. All shares of Seller
Common Stock subject to issuance as aforesaid, upon issuance on the terms and
conditions specified in the instruments pursuant to which they are issuable,
shall be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. There
are no obligations, contingent or otherwise, of Seller or any Seller Subsidiary
to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of Seller Common Stock or
the capital stock of any Seller Subsidiary or to provide funds to or make any
investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in any
Seller Subsidiary or any other entity, except for loan commitments and other
funding obligations entered into in the ordinary course of business. Each of the
outstanding shares of capital stock of each Seller Subsidiary are duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, and not in violation
of any preemptive rights of any Seller Subsidiary shareholder, and such shares
owned by Seller or another Seller Subsidiary are owned free and clear of all
security interests, liens, claims, pledges, agreements, limitations of Seller's
voting rights, charges or other encumbrances of any nature whatsoever.

         SECTION 2.4 Authority. Seller has the requisite corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations
hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (other than,
with respect to the Merger, the approval and adoption of this Agreement by
Seller's shareholders in accordance with the IBCA and the Seller Articles and
Seller By-Laws). The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Seller and the
consummation by Seller of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly
and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action, including without
limitation Seller's Board of Directors, and no other corporate proceedings on
the part of Seller are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate
the transactions so contemplated hereby (other than, with respect to the Merger,
the approval and adoption of this Agreement by Seller's shareholders in
accordance with the IBCA and the Seller Articles and Seller By-Laws). The action
of Seller's Board of Directors has been taken in compliance with Article VII(b)
of the Seller Articles. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by,
and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Seller and assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by Company, enforceable against Seller in
accordance with its terms, except as enforcement may be limited by laws
affecting insured depository institutions, general principles of equity whether
applied in a court of law or a court of equity and by bankruptcy, insolvency and
similar laws affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally.

         SECTION 2.5  No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents.

                  (a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Seller do
         not, and the performance of this Agreement and the transactions
         contemplated hereby by Seller shall not, (i) conflict with or violate
         the Seller Articles or Seller By-Laws or the Articles of Incorporation
         or By-Laws of any Seller Subsidiary, (ii) conflict with or violate any
         domestic (federal, state or local) or foreign law, statute, ordinance,
         rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree (collectively, "Laws")
         applicable to Seller or any Seller Subsidiary or by which its or any of
         their respective properties is bound or affected, or (iii) result in
         any breach of or constitute a default (or an event that with notice or
         lapse of time or both would become a default) under, or give to others
         any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of,
         or result in the creation of a lien or encumbrance on any of the
         properties or assets of Seller or any Seller Subsidiary pursuant to,
         any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease,
         license, permit, franchise or other instrument or obligation to which
         Seller or any Seller Subsidiary is a party or by which Seller or any
         Seller Subsidiary or its or any of their respective properties is bound
         or affected, except in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) for any such
         conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences that
         would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
         Effect on Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The
         Board of Directors of Seller has taken all actions necessary including
         approving the transactions contemplated herein to ensure that none of
         (A) the restrictions set forth in Section 490.1110 of the IBCA, and (B)
         the provisions set forth in Article VII of the Seller Articles, do or
         will apply to the transactions contemplated herein.

                  (b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Seller do
         not, and the performance of this Agreement by Seller shall not, require
         any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or
         notification to, any governmental or regulatory authority, domestic or
         foreign, except (i) for applicable requirements, if any, of the
         Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), the
         Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), state
         securities or blue sky laws ("Blue Sky Laws"), the BHCA, the banking
         laws of the United States of America (the "USBL") and the filing and
         recordation of appropriate merger or other documents as required by the
         IBCA and the WBCL and (ii) where the failure to obtain such consents,
         approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or
         notifications, would not prevent or delay consummation of the Merger or
         otherwise prevent Seller from performing its obligations under this
         Agreement, and would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Seller or
         Seller Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

         SECTION 2.6 Compliance; Permits. Neither Seller nor any Seller
Subsidiary is in conflict with, or in default or violation of, (i) any Law

indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other
instrument or obligation to which Seller or any Seller Subsidiary is a party or
by which Seller or any Seller Subsidiary or its or any of their respective
properties is bound or affected, except for any such conflicts, defaults or
violations which would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect on Seller or Seller Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

         SECTION 2.7  Securities and Banking Reports; Financial Statements.

                  (a) Seller and each Seller Subsidiary have filed all forms,
         reports and documents required to be filed with (x) the Securities and
         Exchange Commission (the "SEC") since December 31, 2000, and as of the
         date of this Agreement has delivered to the Company (i) its Annual
         Reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1998, 1999
         and 2000, respectively, (ii) all proxy statements relating to Seller's

         supplements to all such reports and registration statements filed by
         Seller with the SEC since December 31, 1998 (collectively, the "Seller
         SEC Reports") and (y) the OCC, the Federal Reserve Board, and any other
         applicable federal or state securities or banking authorities (all such
         reports and statements are collectively referred to with the Seller SEC
         Reports as the "Seller Reports"). The Seller Reports, including all
         Seller Reports filed after the date of this Agreement, (i) were or will
         be prepared in all material respects in accordance with the
         requirements of applicable Law and (ii) did not at the time they were
         filed, or will not at the time they are filed, contain any untrue
         statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required
         to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
         therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,
         not misleading.

                  (b) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including,
         in each case, any related notes thereto) contained in the Seller SEC
         Reports, including any Seller SEC Reports filed since the date of this
         Agreement and prior to or on the Effective Time, have been prepared in
         accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a
         consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as may be
         indicated in the notes thereto) and each fairly presents the
         consolidated financial position of Seller and Seller Subsidiaries as of
         the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of its
         operations and changes in financial position for the periods indicated,
         except that any unaudited interim financial statements were or are
         subject to normal and recurring year-end adjustments, which were not or
         are not expected to be material in amount.

                  (c) Except (i) for those liabilities that are fully reflected
         or reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of the Seller
         included in the Seller's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December
         31, 2000, (ii) for liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of
         business consistent with past practice since December 31, 2000, and
         (iii) as set forth in Section 2.7 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,
         neither Seller nor any Seller Subsidiary has incurred any liability of
         any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or
         otherwise due or to become due), that, either alone or when combined
         with all other undisclosed liabilities, has had, or would reasonably be
         expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on the Seller and the
         Seller Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

         SECTION 2.8 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except as disclosed
in the Seller SEC Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement or set forth

date of this Agreement, Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries have conducted their
businesses only in the ordinary course and in a manner consistent with past
practice and, since December 31, 2000, there has not been (i) any change in the
financial condition, results of operations or business of Seller and any of the
Seller Subsidiaries having a




                                       10
<PAGE>

Material Adverse Effect on Seller or the Seller Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
(ii) any damage, destruction or loss (whether or not covered by insurance) with
respect to any assets of Seller or any of the Seller Subsidiaries having a
Material Adverse Effect on Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,

by Seller of any material portion of its assets which has a Material Adverse
Effect on Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (v) except for
regular quarterly cash dividends on Seller Common Stock with usual record and

                  (a) Except as set forth in Section 2.9 of the Seller
         Disclosure Schedule, neither the Seller nor any of the Seller
         Subsidiaries is a party to any, and there are no pending or, to the
         Seller's knowledge, threatened, legal, administrative, arbitral or
         other proceedings, claims, actions or governmental or regulatory
         investigations of any nature against the Seller or any of the Seller
         Subsidiaries or challenging the validity or propriety of the
         transactions contemplated by this Agreement as to which there is
         reasonable probability of an adverse determination and which, if
         adversely determined, would, individually or in the aggregate, have a
         Material Adverse Effect on the Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries,
         taken as a whole.

                  (b) There is no injunction, order, judgment, decree or
         regulatory restriction imposed upon the Company, any of the Seller
         Subsidiaries or the assets of the Seller or any of the Seller
         Subsidiaries which has had a Material Adverse Effect on the Seller and
         the Seller Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

         SECTION 2.10  Employee Benefit Plans.

                  (a) Section 2.10(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule lists
         (i) all employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of the
         Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA")),
         and all bonus, stock option, stock purchase, restricted stock,
         incentive, deferred compensation, retiree medical or life insurance,
         supplemental retirement, severance or other benefit plans, programs or
         arrangements, and all material employment, termination, severance or
         other employment contracts or employment agreements, with respect to
         which Seller or any Seller Subsidiary has any obligation (collectively,
         the "Plans"). Seller has furnished or made available to the Company a
         complete and accurate copy of each Plan (or a description of the Plans,
         if the Plans are not in writing) and a complete and accurate copy of
         each material document prepared in connection with each such Plan,


                                       11
<PAGE>

         including, without limitation, and where applicable, a copy of (i) each
         trust or other funding arrangement, (ii) each summary plan description
         and summary of material modifications, (iii) as applicable, the three
         (3) most recently filed IRS Forms 5500 and related schedules, (iv) as
         applicable, the most recently issued IRS determination letter for each
         such Plan and (v) as applicable, the three (3) most recently prepared
         actuarial and financial statements with respect to each such Plan.

                  (b) Absence of Certain Types of Plans. Except as disclosed in
         the Seller Disclosure Schedule, no member of Seller's "controlled
         group," within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(14) of ERISA, maintains
         or contributes to, or within the five years preceding the Effective
         Time has maintained or contributed to, an employee pension benefit plan
         subject to Title IV of ERISA ("Title IV Plan"). No Title IV Plan is a
         "multiemployer pension plan" as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA.
         Except as disclosed in the Seller Disclosure Schedule, none of the
         Plans obligates Seller or any of the Seller Subsidiaries to pay
         material separation, severance, termination or similar-type benefits
         solely as a result of any transaction contemplated by this Agreement or
         as a result of a "change in control," within the meaning of such term
         under Section 280G of the Code. Except as disclosed in the Seller
         Disclosure Schedule, or as required by COBRA, none of the Plans
         provides for or promises retiree medical, disability or life insurance
         benefits to any current or former employee, officer or director of
         Seller or any of the Seller Subsidiaries. Each of the Plans is subject
         only to the laws of the United States or a political subdivision
         thereof.

                  (c) Compliance with Applicable Law. Except as disclosed in the
         Seller Disclosure Schedule, each Plan has been operated in all respects
         in accordance with the requirements of all applicable Law and all
         persons who participate in the operation of such Plans and all Plan
         "fiduciaries" (within the meaning of Section 3(21) of ERISA) have acted
         in accordance with the provisions of all applicable Law, except where
         such violations of applicable Law would not, individually or in the
         aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Seller and the Seller
         Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries have
         performed all obligations required to be performed by any of them
         under, are not in any respect in default under or in violation of, and
         Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries have no knowledge of any default or
         violation by any party to, any Plan, except where such failures,
         defaults or violations would not, individually or in the aggregate,
         have a Material Adverse Effect on Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries,
         taken as a whole. No legal action, suit or claim is pending or, to the
         knowledge of Seller or the Seller Subsidiaries, threatened with respect
         to any Plan (other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course)
         and, except as disclosed in the Seller Disclosure Schedule, to the
         knowledge of Seller or the Seller Subsidiaries, no fact or event exists
         that could reasonably be expected to give rise to any such action, suit
         or claim. Except as disclosed in the Seller Disclosure Schedule,
         neither Seller nor any Seller Subsidiary has incurred any material
         liability under Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code that is
         currently due and that has not been satisfied in full and no condition
         exists that presents a material risk of incurring any such liability.

                  (d) Qualification of Certain Plans. Each Plan that is intended
         to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code or Section 401(k) of
         the Code (including each trust established in connection with such a
         Plan that is intended to be exempt from Federal income taxation under
         Section 501(a) of the Code) has received a favorable determination
         letter from the IRS (as defined herein) that it is so qualified, and,
         except as disclosed in the Seller Disclosure




                                       12
<PAGE>

         Schedule, Seller is not aware of any fact or event that has occurred
         since the date of such determination letter from the IRS to adversely
         affect the qualified status of any such Plan. Except as disclosed on
         the Seller Disclosure Schedule, no trust maintained or contributed by
         the Seller or any of the Seller Subsidiaries is intended to be
         qualified as a voluntary employees' beneficiary association or is
         intended to be exempt from federal income taxation under Section
         501(c)(9) of the Code.

                  (e) Absence of Certain Liabilities and Events. Except for
         matters disclosed in the Seller Disclosure Schedule, there has been no
         prohibited transaction (within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or
         Section 4975 of the Code) with respect to any Plan that is subject to
         ERISA, that would individually or in the aggregate have a Material
         Adverse Effect on the Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries, taken as a
         whole. Neither Seller nor any of the Seller Subsidiaries has incurred
         any liability for any excise tax arising under Section 4972 or 4980B of
         the Code that would individually or in the aggregate have a Material
         Adverse Effect on the Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries, taken as a
         whole, and, to the knowledge of Seller or the Seller Subsidiaries, no
         fact or event exists that could reasonably be expected to give rise to
         any such liability.

                  (f) Plan Contributions. All material contributions, premiums
         or payments required to be made prior to the Effective Time with
         respect to any Plan have been made on or before the Effective Time.

                  (g) Employment Contracts. Except for employment, severance,
         consulting or other similar contracts with any employees, consultants,
         officers or directors of Seller or any of the Seller Subsidiaries
         disclosed in Section 2.10(g) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, neither
         Seller nor any Seller Subsidiary is a party to any such contracts.
         Neither Seller nor any Seller Subsidiary is a party to any collective
         bargaining agreements.

                  (h) Effect of Agreement. Except as disclosed on the Seller
         Disclosure Schedule, the consummation of the transactions contemplated
         by this Agreement will not, either alone or in conjunction with another
         event, entitle any current or former employee of Seller or any Seller
         Subsidiary to severance pay, unemployment compensation or any other
         payment, except as expressly provided herein, or accelerate the time of
         payment or vesting or increase the compensation due any such employee
         or former employee, in each case, except as expressly provided herein.

         SECTION 2.11 Registration Statement; Proxy Statement/Prospectus. The
information supplied by Seller for inclusion in the Registration Statement (as
hereinafter defined) shall not at the time the Registration Statement is
declared effective contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. The information supplied by Seller for inclusion in
the proxy statement/prospectus to be sent to the shareholders of Seller in
connection with the meeting of Seller's shareholders to consider the Merger (the
"Seller Shareholders' Meeting") (such proxy statement/prospectus as amended or
supplemented is referred to herein as the "Proxy Statement/Prospectus") shall
not at the date the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (or any amendment thereof or
supplement thereto) is first mailed to shareholders, at the time of the Seller
Shareholders' Meeting and at the Effective Time, be false or misleading with
respect to any material fact required to be stated herein, or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in the




                                       13
<PAGE>

light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. If at any
time prior to the Effective Time any event relating to Seller or any of its
affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by Seller which should be
set forth in an amendment to the Registration Statement or a supplement to the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus, Seller shall promptly inform the Company. The Proxy
Statement/Prospectus shall comply in all material respects as to form with the
requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller makes no
representation or warranty with respect to any information about, or supplied or
omitted by, the Company which is contained in any of the foregoing documents.

         SECTION 2.12 Title to Property. Seller and each of the Seller
Subsidiaries has good and marketable title to all of their respective properties
and assets, real and personal, free and clear of all mortgage liens, and free
and clear of all other liens, charges and encumbrances except liens for taxes
not yet due and payable, pledges to secure deposits and such minor imperfections
of title, if any, as do not materially detract from the value of or interfere
with the present use of the property affected thereby or which, individually or
in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Seller and the
Seller Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; and all leases pursuant to which Seller
or any of the Seller Subsidiaries lease from others material amounts of real or
personal property are in good standing, valid and effective in accordance with
their respective terms, and there is not, under any of such leases, any existing
material default or event of default by Seller or any Seller Subsidiary (or
event which with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a material
default by Seller or any Seller Subsidiary and in respect of which the Seller or
such Seller Subsidiary has not taken adequate steps to prevent such a default
from occurring) except where the lack of good standing, validity or
effectiveness or default, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a
Material Adverse Effect on Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
Substantially all of Seller's and each of the Seller's Subsidiaries' buildings
and equipment in regular use have been reasonably maintained and are in good and
serviceable condition, reasonable wear and tear excepted.

         SECTION 2.13 Environmental Matters. Except as set forth in Section 2.13
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, Seller represents and warrants that to the
Seller's knowledge: (i) each of the Seller, the Seller's Subsidiaries,
properties owned or operated by the Seller or the Seller's Subsidiaries, and the
Participation Facilities (each as hereinafter defined) are and have been in
compliance with all applicable federal, state and local laws including common
law, rules, guidance, regulations and ordinances and with all applicable
decrees, orders, judgments, and contractual obligations relating to the
environment, health, safety, natural resources, wildlife or "Hazardous
Materials" which are hereinafter defined as chemicals, pollutants, contaminants,
wastes, toxic substances, compounds, products, solid, liquid, gas, petroleum or
other regulated substances or materials which are hazardous, toxic or otherwise
harmful to health, safety, natural resources, or the environment ("Environmental
Laws"), except for violations which, either individually or in the aggregate,
would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Seller or Seller's Subsidiaries;
(ii) during and prior to the period of (a) the Seller's or any of the Seller's
Subsidiaries' ownership or operation of any of their respective current
properties, or (b) the Seller's or any of the Seller's Subsidiaries'
participation in the management of any Participation Facility, Hazardous
Materials have not been generated, treated, stored, transported, released or
disposed of in, on, under, above, from or affecting any such property, except
where such release, generation, treatment, storage, transportation, or disposal
would not have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on the Seller or Seller's Subsidiaries; (iii) there is no asbestos or any
material amount of ureaformaldehyde materials in or on any property owned or
operated by Seller or Seller's Subsidiaries or any Participation Facility and no
electrical transformers or capacitors, other than



                                       14
<PAGE>

those owned by public utility companies, on any such properties contain any
PCB's; (iv) there are no underground or aboveground storage tanks and there have
never been any underground or aboveground storage tanks located on, in or under
any properties currently or formerly owned or operated by the Seller or any of
Seller's Subsidiaries or any Participation Facility; (v) neither Seller nor
Seller's Subsidiaries have received any notice from any governmental agency or
third party notifying the Seller or Seller's Subsidiaries of any Environmental
Claim; (vi) and there are no circumstances with respect to any properties
currently owned or operated by the Seller or any of Seller's Subsidiaries or any
Participation Facility that could reasonably be anticipated (a) to form the
basis for an Environmental Claim against Seller or Seller's Subsidiaries or any
properties currently or formerly owned or operated by the Seller or any of
Seller's Subsidiaries or any Participation Facility or (b) to cause any
properties currently owned or operated by the Seller or any of Seller's
Subsidiaries or any Participation Facility to be subject to any restrictions on
ownership, occupancy, use or transferability under any applicable Environmental
Law or require notification to or consent of any Governmental Authority or third
party pursuant to any Environmental Law.

         The following definitions apply for purposes of this Section 2.13: (a)
"Participation Facility" means any facility in which the Seller or any of the
Seller's Subsidiaries participates in the management and, where required by the
context, said term means the owner or operator of such property; (b)
"Environmental Claims" shall mean any and all administrative, regulatory,
judicial or private actions, suits, demands, demand letters, notices, claims,
liens, notices of non-compliance or violation, investigations, allegations,
injunctions or proceedings relating in any way to (i) any Environmental Law;
(ii) any Hazardous Material including without limitation any abatements,
removal, remedial, corrective or other response action in connection with any
Hazardous Material, Environmental Law or order of a Governmental Authority or

aggregate would have a Material Adverse Effect on Seller or Seller's
Subsidiaries; (c) "Governmental Authority" shall mean any applicable federal,
state, regional, county or local person or body having governmental authority.

         SECTION 2.14 Absence of Agreements. Neither Seller nor any Seller
Subsidiary is a party to any agreement or memorandum of understanding with, or a
party to any commitment letter or similar undertaking to, or is subject to any
order or directive by, or is a recipient of any extraordinary supervisory letter
which restricts materially the conduct of its business (including any contract
containing covenants which limit the ability of Seller or of any Seller
Subsidiary to compete in any line of business or with any person or which
involve any restriction of the geographical area in which, or method by which,
Seller or any Seller Subsidiary may carry on its business (other than as may be
required by Law or applicable regulatory authorities)), or in any manner relates
to its capital adequacy, its credit policies or its management, except as
disclosed in the Seller Disclosure Schedule, nor has Seller been advised that
any federal, state, or governmental agency is contemplating issuing or
requesting (or is considering the appropriateness of issuing or requesting) any
such order, decree, agreement, memorandum of understanding, extraordinary
supervisory letter, commitment letter or similar submission, except as disclosed
by Seller in Section 2.14 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule.

         SECTION 2.15 Taxes. Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries have timely
filed all material Tax Returns (as defined below) required to be filed by them,
and Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries have timely paid and discharged all
material Taxes (as defined below) due in connection with or with respect to the
filing of such Tax Returns, except such as are being contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings and with respect to which Seller is maintaining reserves
adequate for their



                                       15
<PAGE>

payment. To the knowledge of Seller, the liability for Taxes set forth on each
such Tax Return adequately reflects the Taxes required to be reflected on such
Tax Return. For purposes of this Agreement, "Tax" or "Taxes" shall mean taxes,
charges, fees, levies, and other governmental assessments and impositions of any
kind, payable to any federal, state, local or foreign governmental entity or
taxing authority or agency, including, without limitation, (i) income,

or other instrument or understanding which is not terminable by Seller or the
Seller Subsidiary without additional payment or penalty within 60 days and
obligates Seller or any Seller Subsidiary for payments or other consideration
with a value in excess of $100,000 (except for agreements or documents whereby

         SECTION 3.1 Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries.

                  (a) The Company is a company duly organized, validly existing
         and in active status under the laws of the State of Wisconsin and a
         registered bank holding company under the BHCA. Each subsidiary of the
         Company (a "Company Subsidiary" or, collectively, "Company
         Subsidiaries") is a bank, a corporation, a limited liability company,
         or another form of business entity duly organized, validly existing and
         in good standing under the laws of the state of its organization or the
         United States of America. Each of the Company and the Company
         Subsidiaries have the requisite power and authority and are in
         possession of all franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses,
         permits, easements, consents, certificates, approvals and orders
         ("Company Approvals") necessary to own, lease and operate their
         respective properties and to carry on their respective business as now
         being conducted, including appropriate authorizations from the Federal
         Reserve Board, the FDIC, the DFI or the OCC and neither Company nor any
         Company Subsidiary has received any notice of



                                       17
<PAGE>

         proceedings relating to the revocation or modification of any Company
         Approvals, except in each case where the revocations or modifications,
         the failure to be so organized, existing and in good standing or to
         have such power, authority, Company Approvals would not, individually
         or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company and
         the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

                  (b) The Company and each Company Subsidiary is duly qualified
         or licensed as a foreign business entity to do business, and is in good
         standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties
         owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its activities makes
         such qualification or licensing necessary, except for such failures to
         be so duly qualified or licensed and in good standing that would not,
         either individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect
         on the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

                  (c) A true and complete list of all of the Company
         Subsidiaries as of February 28, 2001 is set forth in Exhibit 21 to the
         Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
         2000 ("Exhibit 21") previously delivered to Seller. The Company and/or
         one or more of the Company Subsidiaries owns beneficially and of record
         substantially all of the outstanding shares of capital stock or other
         equity interest of each of the Company Subsidiaries which is a
         "significant subsidiary" under Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act.
         Except for the Company Subsidiaries, set forth on said Exhibit 21, the
         Company did not as of February 28, 2001 directly or indirectly own any

         exchangeable or exercisable for any equity or similar interest in, any
         corporation, partnership, joint venture or other business, other than
         in the ordinary course of business, which would be required to be
         disclosed on Exhibit 21.

         SECTION 3.2 Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws. The Company has
previously furnished to Seller a complete and correct copy of the Company
Articles and the Company By-laws. The Company Articles and Company By-laws are
in full force and effect. The Company is not in violation of any of the
provisions of the Company Articles or the Company By-laws. No Company Subsidiary
is in violation of any of the provisions of its Articles of Incorporation or
By-laws or other organizational documents which violation would have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

         under Section 501(a) of the Code) has received a favorable
         determination letter from the IRS (as defined herein) that it is so
         qualified, and the Company is not aware of any fact or event that has
         occurred since the date of such determination letter from the IRS to
         adversely affect the qualified status of any Company Plan or the exempt
         status of any such trust. No trust maintained or contributed to by the
         Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is intended to be qualified
         as a voluntary employees' beneficiary association or is intended to be
         exempt from federal income taxation under Section 501(c)(9) of the
         Code.

                  (c) Absence of Certain Liabilities and Events. There have been
         no prohibited transactions (within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA
         or Section 4975 of the Code) with respect to any Company Plan. The
         Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries has not incurred any
         liability for any excise tax arising under Section 4972 or 4980B of the
         Code and, to the knowledge of Company or the Company Subsidiaries, no
         fact or event exists that could give rise to any such liability.

         made on or before their due dates.

         SECTION 3.11 Registration Statement; Proxy Statement/Prospectus. The
information supplied by the Company for inclusion in the registration statement
of the Company (the "Registration Statement") pursuant to which the shares of
Company Common Stock to be issued in the Merger will be registered with the SEC
shall not, at the time the Registration Statement (including any amendments or
supplements thereto) is declared effective by the SEC, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The information
supplied by the Company for inclusion in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall
not, at the date the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (or any amendment thereof or
supplement thereto) is first mailed to shareholders, at the time of the Seller's
Shareholders' Meeting and at the Effective Time, be false or misleading with
respect to any material fact required to be stated therein, or omit to state any
material fact necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. If at any time
prior to the Effective Time any event relating to the Company or any of its
affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by the Company which
should be set forth in an amendment to the Registration Statement or a
supplement to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the Company will promptly inform
the Seller. The Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall
comply in all material respects as to form with the requirements of the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company makes no representation or warranty
with respect to any information about, or supplied or omitted by, Seller which
is contained in any of the foregoing documents.

         SECTION 3.12 Title to Property. The Company and each of the Company
Subsidiaries has good and marketable title to all of their respective properties
and assets, real and personal, free and clear of all mortgage liens, and free
and clear of all other liens, charges and encumbrances except liens for taxes
not yet due and payable, pledges to secure deposits and such minor imperfections
of title, if any, as do not materially detract from the value of or interfere
with the present use of the property affected thereby or which, individually or
in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; and all leases pursuant to which the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries lease from others material amounts of
real or personal property are in good standing, valid and effective in
accordance with their respective terms, and there is not, under any of such
leases, any existing material default or event of default (or event which with
notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a material default and in
respect of which the Company or such subsidiary has not taken adequate steps to
prevent such a default from occurring). Substantially all of the Company's and
each of the Company Subsidiaries' buildings and equipment in regular use have
been reasonably maintained and are in good and serviceable condition, reasonable
wear and tear excepted.

         SECTION 3.13 Environmental Matters. There is not pending and, to the
Company's knowledge, there is not threatened, any litigation, action, or other
proceeding related to a violation or alleged violation of any Environmental Laws

Company Subsidiaries is a party to any agreement or memorandum of understanding
with, or a party to any commitment letter or similar undertaking to, or is
subject to any order or directive by, or is a recipient of any extraordinary
supervisory letter which restricts materially the conduct of its business
(including any contract containing covenants which limit the ability of the
Company or Company Subsidiary to compete in any line of business or with any
person or which involve any restriction of the geographical area in which, or
method by which, the Company or any Company Subsidiary may carry on its business
(other than as may be required by Law or applicable regulatory authorities)), in
any manner relates to its capital adequacy, its credit policies, or its
management, except for those the existence of which has been disclosed to Seller
prior to the date of this Agreement, nor has the Company been advised that any
federal, state, or governmental agency is contemplating issuing or requesting

entity or taxing authority or agency, domestic or foreign, including, without
limitation, consolidated, combined and unitary tax returns. For the purposes of
this Section 3.15, references to the Company Subsidiaries include former
subsidiaries of the Company for the periods during which any such subsidiaries
were owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company. Except as otherwise
disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule, to the knowledge of the Company,
neither the IRS nor any other governmental entity or taxing authority or agency
is now asserting, either through audits, administrative proceedings or court
proceedings, any deficiency or claim for additional Taxes. Except as otherwise

respect to, or any extension of a period for the assessment of, any Tax. Except
as otherwise disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule, and except for

disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither Company nor any of the
Company Subsidiaries has received a ruling or entered into an agreement with the
IRS or any other taxing authority that would have a Material Adverse Effect on
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after the Effective
Time. Except as otherwise disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule, no tax
indemnities have




                                       24

been given by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries to third parties in
connection with the sale of Company Common Stock or assets that remain in effect

knowledge, any of its affiliates has through the date of this Agreement taken or
agreed to take any action that would prevent the Merger from qualifying as a
reorganization under Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code.

         SECTION 3.18 Material Adverse Effect. Since December 31, 2000 there has
been no Material Adverse Effect on the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,

Agreement until the Effective Time, Seller shall not do, or permit any Seller
Subsidiary to do, without the prior written consent of the Company, any of the
following:

                  (a) (i) except as required by applicable law or to maintain
         qualification pursuant to the Code, adopt, amend, renew or terminate
         any Plan or any agreement, arrangement, plan or policy between the
         Seller or any Subsidiary of the Seller and one or more of its current
         or former directors, officers or employees ("Employee Changes"), except
         that Employee Changes for employees who are not directors or officers
         subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act may be made in the ordinary
         course of business consistent with past practice or (ii) except for
         normal increases in the ordinary course of business consistent with
         past practice or, except as required by applicable law, increase in any
         manner the base salary, bonus incentive compensation or fringe benefits
         of any director, officer or employee or pay any benefit not required by

         without limitation, the granting of stock options, stock appreciation
         rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units or performance units
         or shares);

                  (b) (i) except as provided below declare or pay any dividend
         on, or make any other distribution in respect of, its outstanding
         shares of capital stock, except for (A) regular quarterly cash
         dividends on Seller Common Stock with usual record and payment dates
         for such dividends with each such dividend at a rate per share of
         Seller Common Stock not in excess of $0.14 per share and (B) dividends
         by a Seller Subsidiary to Seller;

                           (ii) declare or pay any dividends or make any
                  distributions in any amount on Seller Common Stock in or with
                  respect to the quarter in which the Effective Time shall occur
                  and in which the shareholders of Seller Common Stock are
                  entitled to receive dividends on the shares of Company Common
                  Stock into which the shares of Seller Common Stock have been
                  converted; provided that, it is the intent of this clause (ii)
                  to provide that the holders of Seller Common Stock will
                  receive either the payment of cash dividends on their shares
                  of Seller Common Stock or the payment of cash dividends as the
                  holders of shares of Company Common Stock received in exchange
                  for the shares of Seller Common Stock pursuant to this
                  Agreement for the calendar quarter during which the Effective
                  Time shall occur, but will not receive and will not become
                  entitled to receive for the same calendar quarter both the
                  payment of a cash dividend as shareholders of Seller Common
                  Stock and the payment of a cash dividend as the holders of
                  shares of Company Common Stock received in exchange for the
                  shares of Seller Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement; and
                  if Seller does not declare and pay cash dividends in a
                  particular calendar quarter because of Seller's reasonable
                  expectation that the Effective Time was to have occurred in
                  such calendar quarter wherein the holders of Seller Common
                  Stock would have become entitled to receive cash dividends for
                  such calendar quarter on the shares of Company Common Stock to
                  have been exchanged for the shares of Seller Common Stock
                  pursuant to this Agreement, and the Effective Time does not in
                  fact occur in such calendar quarter, then, as a result
                  thereof, Seller shall be entitled to declare and pay a cash
                  dividend (within the limitations of this clause (ii)) on such
                  shares of Seller Common Stock for such calendar quarter by the
                  declaration and payment of such cash dividends as soon as
                  reasonably practicable after the end of such calendar quarter;

         Seller Subsidiary: any proposal made by a third party to acquire,
         directly or indirectly, including pursuant to a tender offer, exchange
         offer, merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization,
         liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction, for consideration
         consisting of cash and/or securities, more than 50% of the combined
         voting power of the shares of Seller Common Stock then outstanding or
         all or substantially all of the assets of Seller, and otherwise on
         terms which the Board of Directors of Seller determines in its good
         faith judgment (based on the opinion of a financial advisor of
         nationally recognized reputation) to be more favorable to its
         shareholders than the Merger and for which financing, to the extent
         required, is then committed or which if not committed is, in the good
         faith judgment of its Board of Directors, reasonably capable of being
         obtained by such third party.

         SECTION 4.5  Update Disclosure; Breaches.

                  (a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the
         Effective Time, Seller shall update the Seller Disclosure Statement on
         a regular basis by written notice to the Company to reflect any matters
         which have occurred from and after the date of this Agreement which, if
         existing on the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be
         described therein; provided that (i) to the extent that any information
         that would be required to be included in an update under this Section
         4.5(a) would have in the past been contained in internal reports
         prepared by Seller or any Seller Subsidiary in the ordinary course,
         such update may occur by delivery of such internal reports prepared in
         accordance with past practice, with appropriate steps taken by Seller
         to identify relevant information contained therein, and (ii) to the
         extent that updating required under this Section is unduly burdensome
         to Seller, Seller and the Company will use their reasonable efforts to
         develop alternate updating procedures using, wherever possible,
         existing reporting systems.

                  (b) Seller shall, in the event it becomes aware of the
         impending or threatened occurrence of any event or condition which
         would cause or constitute a material breach (or would have caused or
         constituted a material breach had such event occurred or been known
         prior to the date of this Agreement) of any of its representations or
         agreements contained or referred to herein, give prompt written notice
         thereof to the Company and use its reasonable efforts to prevent or
         promptly remedy the same.

         SECTION 4.6 Affiliates; Tax Treatment. Within thirty (30) days after
the date of this Agreement (a) Seller shall deliver to the Company a letter
identifying all persons who are then "affiliates" of Seller, including, without
limitation, all directors and executive officers of Seller, for purposes of Rule
145 promulgated under the Securities Act (each a "Seller Affiliate") and (b)
Seller shall advise the persons identified in such letter of the resale
restrictions imposed by applicable


                                       29

securities laws. Seller shall use its reasonable efforts to obtain from each
person identified in such letter a written agreement, substantially in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit 4.6. Seller shall use its reasonable efforts to
obtain from any person who becomes an affiliate of Seller after Seller's
delivery of the letter referred to above, on or prior to the Effective Time, a
written agreement, substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit 4.6 as
soon as practicable after such person attains such status. Seller will use its
reasonable efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a reorganization under
Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code.

         SECTION 4.7 Delivery of Shareholder List. Seller shall arrange to have
its transfer agent deliver to the Company or its designee, from time to time

may reasonably request.

         SECTION 4.8 Loan and Investment Policies. To the extent permitted by
applicable law or regulations, Seller agrees to give the Company prior notice of
any material change in its loan and investment policies and procedures designed

regarding its loan and investment activity prior to the Effective Time. The
Seller and the Company agree to use their reasonable efforts to develop a plan
for such communications.

         SECTION 4.9 Access and Information. Seller will give the Company and
its representatives, employees, counsel and accountants reasonable access to the

to Seller that is reasonably requested by the Company for purpose of permitting
the Company, among other things, to: (a) verify the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of Seller contained in this Agreement, (b)
confirm compliance by Seller with the terms of this Agreement, and (c) prepare
for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement. The
parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any investigation by the Company
pursuant to this Section 4.9 shall not unreasonably interfere with the business
and operations of Seller. The Company shall not, without the consent of Seller
contact any customers or key employees of Seller. If the Merger contemplated
hereby is not consummated, the Company shall maintain in confidentiality all
non-public and all proprietary information acquired by the Company from the
Seller in connection with its due diligence review.

         SECTION 4.10 Confidentiality Letter. Seller agrees that the
Confidentiality Letter entered into between the Company and the Seller on July
15, 1999 shall remain in full force and effect and binding upon the Seller and
shall survive termination of this Agreement.

         taken as a whole.

         SECTION 5.2 Negative Covenants. Except as set forth in Section 5.2 of

this Agreement, or (iii) consummate the transactions contemplated hereby; or (c)

         steps taken by the Company to identify relevant information contained
         therein, and (ii) to the extent that updating required under this

                                       31
<PAGE>

         reasonable efforts to develop alternate updating procedures using,

                  (b) The Company shall, in the event it becomes aware of the
         impending or threatened occurrence of any event or condition which
         would cause or constitute a material breach (or would have caused or

         agreements contained or referred to herein, give prompt written notice

at any time prior to such time as the shareholders of Seller shall have adopted
and approved this Agreement and the Merger in accordance with the IBCA,
withdraw, modify or change any such recommendation to the extent Board of
Directors of Seller determines in good faith, after consultation with and based
upon the advice of independent legal counsel, that the failure to so withdraw,
modify or change its recommendation would cause the Board of Directors of Seller
to breach its fiduciary duties to Seller's shareholders under applicable Law.

         SECTION 6.2 Meeting of Seller's Shareholders. Seller shall promptly
after the date of this Agreement take all action necessary in accordance with
the IBCA and the Seller Articles and the

reasonable efforts to solicit from shareholders of Seller proxies in favor of
the Merger and shall take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the
vote or consent of shareholders required by the IBCA to approve the Merger,
unless the Board of Directors of Seller shall have determined in good faith
based on advice of counsel that such actions would violate its fiduciary duty to
Seller's Shareholders under applicable Law.

         SECTION 6.3 Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings. Seller and the

state banking laws and (C) any other applicable Law; provided that, the Company
and Seller shall cooperate with each other in connection with the making of all
such filings, including providing copies of all such documents to the non-filing
party and its advisors prior to filing and, if requested, to accept all
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested in connection therewith.
Seller and the Company shall furnish all information required for any
application or other filing to be made pursuant to the rules and regulations of
any applicable Law (including all information required to be included in the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Registration Statement) in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In case at any time after the
Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement, the proper officers and directors of each party to
this Agreement shall use all reasonable efforts to take all such necessary
action.

         SECTION 6.4 Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance.

         indemnification agreements of Seller or the Seller Subsidiaries or
         otherwise in effect as of the date of this Agreement with respect to
         matters occurring prior to the Effective Time. Section 6.4 of the
         Seller Disclosure Schedule contains a complete list of all

         of this Agreement. Seller agrees not to amend or enter into new
         arrangements or agreements from and after the date hereof.

                  (b) From and after the Effective Time, the Company agrees to
         maintain an insurance policy for directors' and officers' liabilities
         for all present and former directors and officers of Seller covered by
         Seller's current insurance policies on the date of this Agreement for a
         period of six years from and after the Effective Time with terms
         (including coverage

         limits) not less advantageous as currently in effect on the date of
         this Agreement with respect to acts, omissions and other matters
         occurring prior to the Effective Time.

                  (c) The provisions of this Section 6.4 are intended to be for
         the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each person who is now, or
         has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement or who becomes
         prior to the Effective Time, an officer or director of Seller or any
         Seller Subsidiary (the "Indemnified Parties") and his or her heirs and
         representatives against the Company and its successor and assigns.

         SECTION 6.5 Notification of Certain Matters. Seller shall give prompt
notice to the Company, and the Company shall give prompt notice to Seller, of
(i) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event the occurrence, or
non-occurrence, of which would be likely to cause any representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate and (ii) any failure of
Seller or the Company, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
hereunder; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
Section 6.5 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder
to the party receiving such notice.

reasonably likely to disrupt its existing customer relationships or practices or
procedures.

         SECTION 6.8  Expenses.

Merger. The respective obligations of each party to effect the Merger shall be
subject to the satisfaction at or prior to the Effective Time of the following
conditions:

                  (a) Effectiveness of the Registration Statement. The

                  (d) No Order. No federal or state governmental or regulatory

         competent jurisdiction, shall have enacted, issued, promulgated,
         enforced or entered any statute, rule, regulation, executive order,
         decree, injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or
         permanent) which is in effect restricting, preventing or prohibiting
         consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

                  (e) NYSE Listing. The shares of Company Common Stock to be
         issued at the Effective Time shall have been authorized for listing on
         the NYSE subject to official notice of issuance.

         SECTION 7.2 Additional Conditions to Obligations of the Company. The
obligations of the Company to effect the Merger are also subject to the
following conditions:

                  (a) Representations and Warranties. Each of the
         representations and warranties of Seller contained in this Agreement,
         without giving effect to any update to the Seller Disclosure Schedule
         or notice to the Company under Section 4.5 or 6.5, shall be true and
         correct in all respects as of the date of this Agreement and (except to
         the extent such representations and warranties speak as of an earlier
         date) as of the Effective Time as though made on and as of the
         Effective Time; provided, however, that for purposes of determining the
         satisfaction of the condition contained in this clause, no effect shall
         be given to any exception in such representations and warranties
         relating to materiality or a Material Adverse Effect, and provided,
         further, however, that, for purposes of this clause, such
         representations and warranties shall be deemed to be true and correct
         in all material respects unless the failure or failures of such
         representations and warranties to be so true and correct,



                                       35
<PAGE>

         individually or in the aggregate, represent a Material Adverse Effect
         on the Seller. Company shall have received a certificate signed on
         behalf of the Seller by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief
         Financial Officer of the Seller to the foregoing effect.

                  (b) Agreements and Covenants. The Seller shall have performed
         or complied in all material respects with all agreements and covenants
         required by this Agreement to be performed or complied with by it on or
         prior to the Effective Time.

                  (c) Consents Obtained. All Seller Approvals and all filings
         required to be made by Seller for the authorization, execution and
         delivery of this Agreement and the consummation by it of the
         transactions contemplated hereby shall have been obtained and made by
         Seller, except when the failure to obtain any Seller Approvals required
         to be obtained or filings required to be made would not have a Material
         Adverse Effect on the Seller and Seller Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

                  (d) No Challenge. There shall not be pending any action,
         proceeding or investigation before any court or administrative agency
         or by a government agency or any other person (i) challenging or
         seeking material damages in connection with, the Merger or the
         conversion of Seller Common Stock into Company Common Stock pursuant to
         the Merger or (ii) seeking to restrain, prohibit or limit the exercise
         of full rights of ownership or operation by the Company or the Company
         Subsidiaries of all or any portion of the business or assets of Seller,
         which in either case is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
         Effect on either Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
         or the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

                  (e) Tax Opinion. An opinion of Godfrey & Kahn, S.C.,
         independent counsel to the Company, dated as of the Effective Time,
         substantially to the effect that on the basis of facts, representations
         and assumptions set forth in such opinion which are consistent with the
         state of facts existing at the Effective Time, the Merger will be
         treated for federal income tax purposes as a reorganization within the
         meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and accordingly that no gain or
         loss will be recognized by Seller as a result of the Merger. In
         rendering such opinion, Godfrey & Kahn may require and rely upon
         representations and covenants contained in certificates of officers of
         the Company, the Seller and others.

         Maslon Edelman Borman & Brand, LLP or other independent counsel for
         Seller reasonably satisfactory to the Company, an opinion dated the
         Effective Time, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
         Company, covering the matters set forth in Annex C hereto, which
         opinion shall be based on such assumptions and containing such
         qualifications and limitations as are appropriate and reasonably
         satisfactory to the Company.

                  (i) Burdensome Condition. There shall not be any action taken,
         or any statute, rule, regulation or order enacted, entered, enforced or
         deemed applicable to the Merger, by any federal or state governmental
         entity which, in connection with the grant of any regulatory approval,
         imposes any condition or restriction upon the Company or Seller or
         their respective subsidiaries (or the Surviving Corporation or its
         subsidiaries after the Effective Time), requiring the disposition of
         more than 10% of Seller's deposits and/or loans (as of March 31, 2001)
         or would otherwise reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
         Effect on either Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries taken as a whole or
         the Company and the Company Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

                  (j) No Material Adverse Changes. Since the date of the
         Agreement, there has not been any change in the financial condition,
         results of operations or business of the Seller and the Seller
         Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, that either individually or in the
         aggregate would have a Material Adverse Effect on the Seller and the
         Seller Subsidiaries taken as a whole. The Company shall have received a
         certificate of the President and the Chief Financial Officer of the
         Company to that effect.

                  (k) Seller Expenses. Seller shall have delivered to the
         Company evidence in form reasonably satisfactory to the Company that
         all out-of-pocket expenses (including, without limitation, all fees and
         expenses of counsel, accountants, investment bankers, experts and
         consultants to the Seller and its affiliates) incurred by the Seller or
         on its behalf in connection with or related to the authorization,
         preparation and execution of this Agreement, the Registration Statement
         and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and all SEC and other regulatory
         filings, the solicitation of shareholder approvals and all other
         matters related to the closing of the transactions contemplated hereby
         are not in excess of $5,000,000.00.

                  (l) Seller shall own 100% of the outstanding capital stock of
         each Seller Subsidiary.

         SECTION 7.3 Additional Conditions to Obligations of Seller. The
obligation of Seller to effect the Merger is also subject to the following
conditions:

                  (a) Representations and Warranties. Each of the
         representations and warranties of the Company contained in this
         Agreement, without giving effect to any notice to Seller under Section
         5.4 or 6.5, shall be true and correct in all respects as of the date of
         this Agreement and (except to the extent such representations and
         warranties speak as of an earlier date) as of the Effective Time, as
         though made on and as of the Effective Time; provided, however, that
         for purposes of determining the satisfaction of the condition contained
         in this clause, no effect shall be given to any exception in such
         representations and warranties relating to materiality or a Material
         Adverse Effect, and provided, further, however, that, for purposes of
         this clause, such representations and warranties shall be deemed to be
         true and correct in all material respects unless the failure or
         failures of such representations and warranties to be so true and
         correct, individually or in the aggregate, represent a Material Adverse
         Effect on the Company. The Seller shall have received a certificate
         signed on behalf of the Company by the Chief Executive Officer and the
         Chief Financial Officer of the Company to the foregoing effect.



                                       37
<PAGE>

                  (b) Agreements and Covenants. The Company shall have performed
         or complied in all material respects with all agreements and covenants
         required by this Agreement to be performed or complied with by it on or
         prior to the Effective Time.

                  (c) Consents Obtained. All material consents, waivers,
         approvals, authorizations or orders required to be obtained, and all
         filings required to be made by the Company for the authorization,
         execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation by it of
         the transactions contemplated hereby shall have been obtained and made
         by the Company, except where the failure to obtain any consents,
         waivers, approvals, authorizations or orders required to be obtained or
         any filings required to be made would not have a Material Adverse
         Effect on the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

                  (d) Tax Opinion. The Seller shall have received an opinion of
         Maslon Edelman Borman & Brand, LLP, in form and substance reasonably
         satisfactory to the Seller, dated as of the Effective Time,
         substantially to the effect that on the basis of facts, representations
         and assumptions set forth in such opinion which are consistent with the
         state of facts existing at the Effective Time, the Merger will be
         treated as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
         Code, and that, accordingly, for federal income tax purposes:

                           (i) No gain or loss will be recognized by the Seller
                  as a result of the Merger;

                           (ii) No gain or loss will be recognized by the
                  shareholders of the Seller who exchange their Seller Common
                  Stock for Company Common Stock pursuant to the Merger (except
                  with respect to cash received in lieu of a fractional share
                  interest in Company Common Stock); and

                           (iii) The aggregate tax basis of the Company Common
                  Stock received by shareholders who exchange their Seller
                  Common Stock for Company Common Stock pursuant to the Merger
                  will be the same as the aggregate tax basis of the Seller
                  Common Stock surrendered in exchange therefor (reduced by any
                  amount allocable to a fractional share interest for which cash
                  is received).

In rendering such opinion, the Seller's Counsel may require and rely upon
representations and covenants contained in certificates of officers of Company,
the Seller and others.

                  (e) Opinion of Counsel. Seller shall have received from
         Godfrey & Kahn, S.C., or other independent counsel for the Company
         reasonably satisfactory to Seller, opinions dated the Effective Time,
         in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Seller, covering the
         matters set forth in Annex D hereto, which opinion shall be based on
         such assumptions and contain such qualifications and limitations as are
         appropriate and reasonably satisfactory to Seller.

                  (f) No Material Adverse Changes. Since the date of the
         Agreement, there has not been any change in the financial condition,
         results of operations or business of the Company and the Company
         Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, that either individually or in the
         aggregate would have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company and the
         Company Subsidiaries taken as a whole. The Seller shall have received a
         certificate of the President and the Chief Financial Officer of the
         Company to that effect.

                ARTICLE VIII - TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

         SECTION 8.1  Termination.

                  (a) This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
         Effective Time, whether before or after approval of the matters
         presented in connection with the Merger by the shareholders of Seller:

                           (i) by mutual consent of the Company and Seller by a
                  vote of majority of the members of the entire Board of
                  Directors of both the Company and Seller;

                           (ii) by Seller or the Company (A) if there has been a
                  breach in any material respect (except that where any
                  statement in a representation or warranty expressly includes a
                  standard of materiality, such statement shall have been
                  breached in any respect) of any representation, warranty,
                  covenant or agreement on the part of Seller, on the one hand,
                  or the Company, on the other hand, respectively, set forth in
                  this Agreement, or (B) if any representation or warranty of
                  Seller, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand,
                  respectively, shall be discovered to have become untrue in any
                  material respect (except that where any statement in a
                  representation or warranty expressly includes a standard of
                  materiality, such statement shall have become untrue in any
                  respect), in either case which breach or other condition has
                  not been cured within 30 business days following receipt by
                  the nonterminating party of notice of such breach or other
                  condition, or which breach by its nature, cannot be cured
                  prior to Closing; provided, however, neither party shall have
                  the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
                  8.1(a)(ii) unless the breach of any representation or warranty
                  (but not breaches of covenants or agreements), together with
                  all other such breaches, would entitle the party receiving
                  such representation or warranty not to consummate the
                  transactions contemplated hereby under Section 7.2(a) (in the
                  case of a breach of a representation or warranty by the
                  Seller) or Section 7.3(a) (in the case of a breach of
                  representation or warranty by the Company); provided, further,
                  this Agreement may not be terminated pursuant to this clause
                  (ii) by the breaching party or party making any representation
                  or warranty which shall have become untrue in any material
                  respect;

                           (iii) by either the Company or Seller if any
                  permanent injunction preventing the consummation of the Merger
                  shall have become final and nonappealable;

                           (iv) by either the Company or Seller if the Merger
                  shall not have been consummated by December 31, 2001, for a
                  reason other than the failure of the party seeking termination
                  to comply with its obligations under this Agreement;

                           (v) by either the Company or Seller if the Federal
                  Reserve Board has denied approval of the Merger, and neither
                  the Company nor Seller has, within 30 days after the entry of
                  such order denying approval, filed a petition seeking review
                  of such order as provided by applicable law;

                           (vi) by either the Company or the Seller, if at the
                  Seller Shareholders' Meeting, this Agreement and the
                  transactions contemplated hereby shall fail to receive the
                  requisite vote for approval and adoption by the Seller's
                  Shareholders;



                                       39
<PAGE>

                           (vii) by the Company, if there shall exist a proposal
                  for a Superior Competing Transaction with respect to the
                  Seller and the Board of Directors of the Seller have withdrawn
                  or modified in a manner adverse to the Company its approval
                  and recommendation of this Agreement or its approval of the
                  Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby or if the
                  Board of Directors of the Seller shall have approved or
                  recommended such Superior Competing Transaction; or

                           (viii) by the Company if any person or persons
                  holding in the aggregate 10% or more of the outstanding Seller
                  Common Stock deliver a notice or notices of intent to demand
                  payment in accordance with Section 490.1321 of the IBCA.

         SECTION 8.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become
void and all rights and obligations of any party hereto shall cease except: (i)
as set forth in Section 9.1 of this Agreement and (ii) nothing herein shall
relieve any party from liability for any willful breach of this Agreement or
shall restrict either party's rights in the case thereof.

         SECTION 8.3 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties
hereto by action taken by or on behalf of their respective Boards of Directors
at any time prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that, after approval
of the Merger by the shareholders of Seller, no amendment may made which would
reduce the amount or change the type of consideration into which each Share
shall be converted pursuant to this Agreement upon consummation of the Merger.
This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by
the parties hereto.

         SECTION 8.4 Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party
hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
other acts of the other party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound
thereby, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance
with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a
waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent other failure.


                         ARTICLE IX - GENERAL PROVISIONS

         SECTION 9.1 Non-Survival of Representations, Warranties and Agreements.

or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original

that transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

connection with this Agreement, this Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Wisconsin, regardless of
the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of choice of
law or conflicts of law.

         SECTION 9.10 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

         SECTION 9.11 Time is of the Essence. Time is of the essence of this
Agreement.

         SECTION 9.12 Specific Performance. The parties hereto acknowledge that
