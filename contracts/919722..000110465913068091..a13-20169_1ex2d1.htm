WHEREAS, it is proposed that Acquisition Sub shall commence a tender offer
(the " **Offer** ") to acquire all of the outstanding shares (the " **Company
Shares** ") of Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the "
**Company Common Stock** "), at a price of $8.50 per Company Share, net to the
holder thereof, subject to reduction for any applicable withholding taxes
payable in respect thereof, in cash (such amount, or any higher amount per
Company Share that may be paid pursuant to the Offer, being hereinafter
referred to as the " **Offer Price** "), all upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein;

 



 

WHEREAS, it is also proposed that, as soon as practicable following the
consummation of the Offer, Acquisition Sub will merge with and into the
Company (the " **Merger** ") in accordance with the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware (the " **DGCL** ") and each Company Share that is not
tendered and accepted pursuant to the Offer (other than Cancelled Company
Shares and Dissenting Company Shares) will thereupon be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Offer
Price, and the Company will survive the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Parent, all upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein;

 



 

WHEREAS, the parties intend for the Merger to be effected under Section 251(h)
of the DGCL pursuant to the terms of this Agreement;

 



 

WHEREAS, the Company Board has (i) determined that it is in the best interests
of the Company and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into
this Agreement, (ii) approved the execution and delivery by the Company of
this Agreement, the performance by the Company of its covenants and agreements
contained herein and the consummation of the Offer and the Merger upon the
terms and subject to the conditions contained herein and (iii) resolved to
recommend that the holders of Company Shares accept the Offer, tender their
Company Shares to Acquisition Sub pursuant to the Offer and, if required by
the applicable provisions of Delaware Law, adopt this Agreement;

 



 

WHEREAS, the board of directors of each of Parent and Acquisition Sub have (i)
declared it advisable to enter into this Agreement, and (ii) approved the
execution and delivery by Parent and Acquisition Sub, respectively, of this
Agreement, the performance by Parent and Acquisition Sub, respectively, of
their respective covenants and agreements contained herein and the
consummation of the Offer and the Merger upon the terms and subject to the
conditions contained herein; and

      
 

 



 

WHEREAS, Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby to prescribe certain
conditions with respect to the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the

to the Company to keep such information confidential, _provided_ that such
confidentiality provisions are no less restrictive in the aggregate to such
counter-party(ies) (and any of its (their) representatives named therein), and

Offer is first commenced (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under
the Exchange Act). In the event that the Offer is extended pursuant to and in
accordance with this Agreement, then the Offer shall expire on the date and at
the time to which the Offer has been so extended.

its staff or NASDAQ, in any such case which is applicable to the Offer;

 



 

(B) in the event that any of the conditions to the Offer set forth on _Annex

permitted hereunder) as of any then scheduled expiration of the Offer,
Acquisition Sub shall extend the Offer for successive extension periods of ten
(10) Business Days each (or any longer period as may be approved in advance by

the Offer; and

 



 

(C) in the event that all of the conditions to the Offer set forth on _Annex
A_ have been satisfied or waived (if permitted hereunder), except that the
Minimum Condition has not been satisfied, as of any then scheduled expiration
of the Offer, Acquisition Sub shall extend the Offer for an extension period
of ten (10) Business Days (or any longer period as may be approved in advance
by the Company), it being understood and agreed that Acquisition Sub shall not
be required to extend the Offer pursuant to this clause (C) on more than two
(2) occasions, but may, in its sole discretion, elect to do so;

 



 

 _provided, however_ , that the foregoing clauses (A), (B) or (C) of this

restrict in any manner the right of the parties to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to the terms of _Article IX_.

 



 

(iii) Neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub shall extend the Offer in any manner
other than pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of _Section
2.1(d)(ii)_ without the prior written consent of the Company.

 



 

(iv) Neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub shall terminate or withdraw the Offer
prior to the then scheduled expiration of the Offer unless this Agreement is
validly terminated in accordance with _Article IX_, in which case
Acquisition Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Acquisition Sub to) irrevocably
and unconditionally terminate the Offer promptly (but in no event more than
one (1) Business Day) after such termination of this Agreement.

 



 

(e) _Payment for Company Shares_. On the terms and subject to conditions set
forth in this Agreement and the Offer, Acquisition Sub shall (and Parent shall
cause Acquisition Sub to) accept for payment, and pay for, all Company Shares
that are validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer promptly
(within the meaning of Section 14e-1(c) promulgated under the Exchange Act)
after the expiration of the Offer (as it may be extended in accordance with
_Section 2.1(d)(ii)_). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Acquisition Sub on a timely
basis the funds necessary to pay for any Company Shares that Acquisition Sub
becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer; _provided, however,
_that without the prior written consent of the Company, Acquisition Sub shall
not accept for payment or pay for any Company Shares if, as a result,
Acquisition Sub would acquire less than the number of Company Shares necessary
to satisfy the Minimum Condition. The Offer Price payable in respect of each
Company Share validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall
be paid net to the holder thereof in cash, subject to reduction for any
applicable withholding taxes payable in respect thereof.

 



       
 

 



 

(f) _Subsequent Offering Period_. Subject to the last sentence of this
_Section2.1(f)_ , Acquisition Sub may (but shall not be required to), and the

Parent shall cause Acquisition Sub to) accept for payment, and pay for, all
Company Shares that are validly tendered during the "subsequent offering
period" promptly (within the meaning of Section 14e-1(c) promulgated under the
Exchange Act) after any such Company Shares are validly tendered during the
"subsequent offering period." Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Acquisition Sub on
a timely basis the funds necessary to pay for any Company Shares that
Acquisition Sub becomes obligated to purchase during such "subsequent offering
period." The Offer Price payable in respect of each Company Share that is

the holder thereof in cash, subject to reduction for any applicable
withholding taxes payable in respect thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, Acquisition Sub shall not (and Parent

 **2.3** ** **_Company Board of Directors and Committees; Section 14(f) of
Exchange Act_.

 



 

(a) _Composition of Company Board and Board Committees_. Effective upon the
initial acceptance for payment by Acquisition Sub of Company Shares pursuant
to the Offer (the " **Acceptance Time** ," the use of which term herein shall
not, unless the context otherwise requires, depend upon whether Parent shall
exercise its rights under this _Section 2.3(a)_) and from time to time
thereafter (as long as Parent and its Affiliates beneficially own a majority
of the outstanding Company Shares), Parent shall be entitled to designate up
to such number of directors on the Company Board equal to the product (rounded
up to the next whole number) obtained by multiplying (x) the number of
directors on the Company Board (giving effect to any increase in the number of
directors pursuant to this _Section 2.3_) and (y) a fraction, the numerator
of which is the number of Company Shares beneficially owned by Parent and
Acquisition Sub (giving effect to the Company Shares accepted for payment
pursuant to the Offer), and the denominator of which is the total number of
then outstanding Company Shares. Following a request by Parent, the Company
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Laws and the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Company, take all action necessary to cause
the individuals so designated by Parent to be elected or appointed to the
Company Board, including (at the election of Parent) either by increasing the
size of the Company Board or by seeking and accepting or otherwise securing
the resignations of such number of then incumbent directors as is

 



      
 

 



 

necessary to enable the individuals so designated by Parent to be elected or
appointed to the Company Board. From time to time after the Acceptance Time
(as long as Parent and its Affiliates beneficially own a majority of the
outstanding Company Shares), at the request of Parent, the Company shall, to
the extent permitted by applicable Laws and the certificate of incorporation
and bylaws of the Company, take all action necessary to cause the individuals
so designated by Parent to constitute substantially the same percentage
(rounding up where appropriate) as is on the Company Board on (i) each
committee of the Company Board, (ii) each board of directors (or equivalent
governance body) of each Subsidiary of the Company and (iii) each committee of
each such board of directors (or equivalent governance body) of each
Subsidiary of the Company, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by all
applicable Laws. Notwithstanding the foregoing, from the Acceptance Time until
the Effective Time, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the Company Board to always have at least two (2) directors who are directors
on the date hereof, who are not employed by the Company and who are not
Affiliates or employees of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, and who are
independent directors for purposes of the continued listing requirements of
NASDAQ (the " **Continuing Directors** "); _provided_ that, if the number of
Continuing Directors shall be reduced below two (2) for any reason whatsoever,
the remaining Continuing Director shall be entitled to designate any other
Person(s) who shall not be an Affiliate or employee of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries to fill such vacancies and such Person(s) shall be deemed to be a
Continuing Director(s) for purposes of this Agreement; _provided further_ ,
that the remaining Continuing Director shall fill such vacancies as soon as
practicable, but in any event within ten (10) Business Days, and further
_provided_ that if no such Continuing Director is appointed in such time
period, Parent shall designate such Continuing Director; _provided further_ ,
that if no Continuing Director then remains, the other directors shall
designate two (2) Persons who shall not be Affiliates, consultants,
representatives or employees of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to fill such
vacancies and such Persons shall be deemed to be Continuing Directors for
purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act_. The Companys obligation to appoint
Parents designees to the Company Board shall be subject to Section 14(f) of
the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder and the Companys
receipt of sufficient information from Parent to enable the Company to include
in the Schedule 14D-9 the information required by Section 14(f) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder in respect of Parents
designees to the Company Board. The Company shall take all action required
pursuant to this _Section 2.3_ and Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to
fulfill its obligations under this _Section 2.3_, and shall include in the
Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to the Company and its directors
and officers, as well as Parents designees to the Company Board, as is
required under such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its
obligations under this _Section 2.3_. Parent shall provide to the Company in
writing, and be solely responsible for, any information with respect to itself
and its designees to the Company Board required by such Section 14(f) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder.

 



 

(c) _Required Approvals of Continuing Directors_. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, following the election or appointment of
Parents designees to the Company Board pursuant to _Section 2.3(a)_ and
until the Effective Time, the approval of a majority of the Continuing
Directors shall be required to authorize (and such authorization shall
constitute the authorization of the Company Board and no other action on the
part of the

 



      
 

 



 

Company, including any action by any other director of the Company, shall be
required to authorize) (i) any amendment or termination of this Agreement on
behalf of the Company, (ii) any amendment of this Agreement requiring action
by the Company Board, (iii) any extension of time for performance of any
obligation or action hereunder by Parent or Acquisition Sub, (iv) any
exercise, enforcement or waiver of compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein for the benefit of the Company, (v) any amendment
of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company that would
adversely affect the Company Stockholders, and (vi) any other action
(including any determination, approval or authorization) to be taken or not to
be taken on behalf of the Company under or in connection with this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided however,_ that following
the Acceptance Time, Parent may cause its designees elected or appointed
pursuant to _Section 2.3(a)_ to withdraw or modify any Company Board
Recommendation Change that may have been made prior to such time without the
approval of the majority of the Continuing Directors. The Continuing Directors
shall have the authority to retain counsel (which may include current counsel
to the Company) at the expense of the Company for the purpose of fulfilling
their obligations hereunder, and shall have the authority, after the
Acceptance Time, to institute any action on behalf of the Company to enforce
the performance of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

properly and validly perfected their statutory rights of appraisal in respect
of such Company Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL
(collectively, " **Dissenting Company Shares** ") shall not be converted into,
or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 3.7(a)_. Such Company Stockholders shall be entitled to receive
payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Company Shares in accordance
with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, except that all Dissenting
Company Shares held by Company Stockholders who shall have failed to perfect

receive the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, upon surrender of
the certificate or certificates that formerly evidenced such Company Shares in
the manner provided in _Section 3.8_.

Delaware Law in respect of Dissenting Company Shares. The Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment
with respect to any demands for appraisal, or settle or offer to settle any
such demands for payment, in respect of Dissenting Company Shares.

 



 

(d) _Company Options_. Parent shall not assume any Company Options in
connection with the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, except as otherwise agreed to by Parent and a holder of a Company
Option, the Company shall take such action as may be necessary so that
immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, (i) the vesting of each Company
Option that remains outstanding as of immediately prior to the Acceptance Time
shall be accelerated in full, (ii) each Company Option that remains
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Acceptance Time shall be cancelled
and terminated as of the Acceptance Time, and (iii) each holder of each such
Company Option shall be paid by the Company promptly after the Acceptance
Time, subject to _Section 3.8(e)_, an amount in cash (without interest), if
any, equal to the product obtained by _multiplying_ (x) the aggregate number
of Company Shares that were issuable upon exercise of such Company Option
immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, _by_ (y) the Offer Price, _less_ the
per share exercise price of such Company Option (the " **Option
Consideration** ") (it being understood and agreed that such exercise price
shall not actually be paid to the Company by the holder of a Company Option).
The Company shall take all actions necessary to effect the transactions
contemplated by this _Section 3.7(d)_ under all Company Option agreements and
any other plan or arrangement of the Company, including delivering all
required notices and making any determinations and/or resolutions of the
Company Board or a committee thereof. Within three (3) Business Days after the
Closing, Parent shall pay by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
the Surviving Corporation, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
pay to each of the holders of Company Options, the applicable Option
Consideration (less any applicable withholding taxes payable in respect
thereof) as promptly as practicable (and in no event later than the next
regular payroll date) thereafter.

 



 

(e) _Company ESPP_.

 



 

(i) Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary
to cause the rights of participants in the Company ESPP with respect to any
offering period then underway to be determined by treating the last Business
Day prior to, or if more administratively advisable, the last payroll date of
the Company immediately prior to, the Acceptance Time, as the last day of such
offering period and by making such other pro-rata adjustments as may be
necessary to reflect the shortened and final offering period but otherwise
treating such shortened and final offering period as a fully effective and
completed offering period for all purposes under the Company ESPP.

 



       
 

 



 

(ii) The Company shall take all actions necessary so that the Company ESPP
shall terminate immediately prior to and effective as of the Acceptance Time.
All amounts withheld by the Company on behalf of the participants in the
Company ESPP that have not been used to purchase Company Common Stock prior to
the Effective Time will be returned to the participants without interest
pursuant to the terms of the Company ESPP.

 



 

(iii) The Company agrees to take any and all actions necessary to approve and
effectuate the foregoing provisions of this _Section 3.7(e)_ including making
any determinations and/or resolutions of the Company Board or a committee
thereof.

 

 ** **

 

 **3.8** ** **_Exchange of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Payment Agent_. Prior to the Acceptance Time, Parent shall select a bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the payment
agent for the Merger (the " **Payment Agent** ").

 



 

(b) _Exchange Fund_. At the Closing, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be
deposited) with the Payment Agent, for payment to the holders of Company
Shares pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_, an amount of cash
equal to the aggregate consideration to which holders of Company Common Stock
become entitled under this _Article III_. Until disbursed in accordance with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such funds shall be invested by
the Payment Agent, as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, in
obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or obligations of
an agency of the United States of America which are backed by the full faith
and credit of the United States of America (such cash amount being referred to
herein as the " **Exchange Fund** "). Any interest and other income resulting
from such investments shall be paid to Parent. To the extent that there are
any losses with respect to any investments of the Exchange Fund, or the
Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the
Payment Agent to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by this _Article
III_, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly
replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the
Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Payment
Agent to make such payments contemplated by this _Article III_.

 



 

(c) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder
of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of (i) a certificate
or certificates (the " **Certificates** ") which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding Company Shares and (ii) uncertificated
Company Shares (the " **Uncertificated Shares** "), in each case, whose shares
were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 3.7_ (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Payment
Agent), and/or (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates and Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of this
_Article III_. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Payment
Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates
shall be entitled to receive in exchange

 



      
 

 



 

therefor an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x)
the aggregate number of Company Shares represented by such Certificate that
were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 3.7_, by (y) the Merger Consideration (less any applicable
withholding taxes payable in respect thereof), and the Certificates so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Upon receipt of an "agents message"
by the Payment Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the
Payment Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of
Uncertificated Shares, the holders of such Uncertificated Shares shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of Company Shares
represented by such holders transferred Uncertificated Shares that were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 3.7_, by (y) the Merger Consideration (less any applicable
withholding taxes payable in respect thereof), and the transferred
Uncertificated Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. The Payment
Agent shall accept such Certificates and transferred Uncertificated Shares
upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Payment Agent
may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal
exchange practices. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of
holders of the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares on the Merger
Consideration payable upon the surrender of such Certificates and
Uncertificated Shares pursuant to this _Section 3.8_. Until so surrendered,
outstanding Certificates and Uncertificated Shares shall be deemed, from and
after the Effective Time, to evidence only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest thereon, payable in respect thereof pursuant
to the provisions of this _Article III_.

 



 

(d) _Transfers of Ownership_. In the event that a transfer of ownership of
Company Shares is not registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the
Company, or if the Merger Consideration is to be paid in a name other than
that in which the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares surrendered in
exchange therefor are registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the
Company, the Merger Consideration may be paid to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the Certificate or Uncertificated Share so surrendered is
registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company only if such
Certificate or Uncertificated Shares is properly endorsed and otherwise in
proper form for surrender and transfer and the Person requesting such payment
has paid to Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) any transfer taxes
required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person
other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares,
or established to the satisfaction of Parent (or any agent designated by
Parent) that such transfer taxes have been paid or are otherwise not payable.

 



 

(e) _Required Withholding_. Each of the Payment Agent, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any cash
amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of
Company Shares and Company Options such amounts as are required to be deducted
or withheld therefrom under applicable Tax Laws. To the extent that such
amounts are so deducted, withheld and remitted to the applicable Governmental
Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement
as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have
been paid.

 



 

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
other party

 



      
 

 



 

hereto shall be liable to a holder of Company Shares for any amount properly
paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law.

 



 

(g) _Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares on the date that is six (6) months after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of Company
Shares that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger who
have not theretofore surrendered their Certificates or Uncertificated Shares
representing such Company Shares for exchange pursuant to the provisions of
this _Section 3.8_ shall thereafter look for payment of the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of the Company Shares represented by such
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares solely to Parent, as general creditors
thereof, for any claim to the applicable Merger Consideration to which such
holders may be entitled pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_.

 

 ** **

 

 **3.9** ** **_No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. From and
after the Effective Time, all Company Shares shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically be cancelled, retired and cease to exist, and each
holder of a Certificate or Uncertificated Shares theretofore representing any
Company Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the Merger Consideration payable therefor upon the surrender
thereof in accordance with the provisions of _Section 3.8_. The Merger
Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this _Article III_ shall
be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such shares of the Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time,
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the
Surviving Corporation of Company Shares that were issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than transfers to reflect, in
accordance with customary settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated
Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall
be canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article III_.

 

 ** **

 

 **3.10** ** **_Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that
any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, in the form and
substance satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation, and the posting by such
holders of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms as may be required
by Parent as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Merger Consideration payable in respect
thereof pursuant to _Section 3.7_.

 



 

 **3.11** ** **_Necessary Further Actions_. At and after the Effective Time,
the officers and directors of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be
authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company
and Acquisition Sub, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and
to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company and Acquisition Sub,
any other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or
otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest
in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or to be
acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with,
the Merger.

 **ARTICLE IV**

 

 **REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY**

 



 

Except (i) as disclosed in the letter delivered by the Company to Parent on
the date of this Agreement (the " **Company Disclosure Letter** "), or (ii) as
disclosed in any Company SEC Reports filed with or furnished to the SEC by the
Company between January 1, 2013 and the date hereof (other than in any "risk
factor" disclosure or any other forward looking statements set forth therein
and _provided_ that nothing in such Company SEC Reports shall be deemed to
modify or qualify the representations and warranties set forth in _Section
4.2_ and _Section 4.6_) and in each of (i) and (ii) only to the extent the
relevance of such disclosure to the applicable representation or warranty is
reasonably apparent on its face, the Company hereby represents and warrants to
Parent and Acquisition Sub as follows:

 



 

 **4.1** ** **_Organization; Good Standing_.

 



 

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under Delaware Law, and has the requisite corporate power and
authority to conduct its business as it is presently being conducted and to
own, lease or operate its properties and assets, except where the failure to
be so organized or in good standing, or have such power or authority, would
not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.
The Company is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or
properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification (to the
extent the "good standing" concept is applicable in the case of any
jurisdiction outside the United States), except where the failure to be so
qualified or in good standing would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company is in compliance
with the provisions of its certificate of incorporation and bylaws in all
material respects. The Company has set forth in _Section 4.1(a)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter a true and complete list of each jurisdiction in
which it is qualified to do business.

 



 

(b) The Company has made available to Parent prior to the date of this
Agreement true and complete copies of (i) the Companys certificate of
incorporation and bylaws, each as amended through the date hereof and (ii) the
minutes of all meetings from January 1, 2012 to the date of this Agreement of
the Companys stockholders, the Company Board and each standing committee of
the Company Board, except, in case of clause (ii), for any portions of such
minutes relating to the consideration of any Acquisition Proposal or
Acquisition Transaction, or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

 **4.2** ** **_Corporate Power; Enforceability_. The Company has all
requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement,
to perform its covenants and obligations hereunder and, only in the case of
the consummation of the Merger, subject to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder
Approval, to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution
and delivery by the Company of this Agreement, the performance by the Company
of its covenants and obligations hereunder and the consummation by the Company
of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of the Company, and no additional
corporate proceedings or actions on the part of the Company are necessary to
authorize the execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement, the
performance by the Company of its covenants and obligations hereunder or the

 



      
 

 



 

consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, other than and only in
the case of the consummation of the Merger, obtaining the Requisite
Stockholder Approval. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by
Parent and Acquisition Sub, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation
of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms,
except that such enforceability (a) may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws affecting or
relating to creditors rights generally, and (b) is subject to general
principles of equity (the " **Enforceability Limitations** ").

 

 ** **

 

 **4.3** ** **_Requisite Stockholder Approval_. The affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding Company Shares (the " **Requisite
Stockholder Approval** "), is the only vote of the holders of any class or
series of Company Capital Stock that, absent Section 251(h) of the DGCL, would
have been necessary under applicable Law and the Companys certificate of
incorporation and bylaws to adopt, approve or authorize this Agreement and
consummate the Merger and other transactions contemplated hereby in their
capacity as stockholders of the Company.

 



 

 **4.4** ** **_Non-Contravention_. The execution and delivery by the Company
of this Agreement, the performance by the Company of its covenants and
obligations hereunder and the consummation by the Company of the Merger and
other transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not, with or without
giving notice, the passage of time or both, constitute or result in (a) breach
or violation of, a conflict with, or a default under any provision of the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or comparable governing
instruments of its Subsidiaries, (b) assuming the Consents referred to in
_Section 4.5_ are obtained or made and, only in the case of the consummation
of the Merger, subject to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval,
violate or conflict with any Law or Order applicable to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or by which any of their respective properties or assets are
bound or affected, or (c) a breach or violation of, a termination (or right of
termination) or a default under, the acceleration, or creation or cancellation
of any obligations or the creation of any Lien (other than Permitted Liens)
upon any of the properties or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
pursuant to any Material Contract, except in the case of each of clauses (b)
and (c) above, for such violations, conflicts, defaults, terminations,
accelerations or Liens which would not prevent or materially delay the
performance by the Company of, or materially impair the ability of the Company
to perform, its covenants and obligations hereunder.

 



 

 **4.5** ** **_Required Governmental Approvals_. No consent, approval,
registration, declaration, Order or authorization of, filing or registration
with, or notification to (any of the foregoing being referred to herein as a "
**Consent** "), any Governmental Authority is required on the part of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the execution and
delivery by the Company of this Agreement, the performance by the Company of
its covenants and obligations hereunder and the consummation by the Company of
the Merger and other transactions contemplated hereby, except (a) the filing
and recordation of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware and such filings with any other Governmental Authorities
to satisfy the applicable Laws of states and foreign jurisdictions in which
the Company and its Subsidiaries are qualified to do business, (b) such
filings and approvals as may be required by any federal or state securities
Laws, including compliance with any applicable requirements of the Exchange
Act, (c) Consents required under, and compliance

 



      
 

 



 

with any other applicable requirements of the HSR Act, (d) the post-closing
notification requirements under the Foreign Exchange and Trade Law of Japan (
_gaikoku kawase boeki ho_ ), and (e) such other Consents, the failure of which
to obtain would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect or the occurrence of a substantively equivalent condition with
respect to the Surviving Corporation.

each case that obligates the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue,
deliver or sell or cause to be issued, delivered or sold any shares of capital
stock, partnership interests or similar ownership interests of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, or any securities or obligations convertible or
exchangeable into or exercisable for, or giving any Person a right to

interest of any class of any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(d) There are no outstanding contractual commitments of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries which obligate the Company or its Subsidiaries to make any
investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in any
other Person.

 



 

(e) With respect to the Company Options issued pursuant to the Company Stock
Plan, (i) each grant of an option was duly authorized no later than the date
on which the grant of such option was by its terms to be effective on the date
the option was granted (the " **Grant Date** ") by all necessary corporate

(a) _Section 4.7(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a true,
complete and accurate list of the name, jurisdiction of organization,

under the laws of the jurisdiction of its respective organization (to the
extent the "good standing" concept is applicable in the case of any

Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Companys Subsidiaries has the requisite
corporate power and authority to carry on its respective business as it is
presently being conducted and to own, lease or operate its respective
properties and assets. Each of the Companys Subsidiaries is duly qualified to
do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character
of its properties owned or leased or the nature of its activities make such
qualification necessary (to the extent the "good standing" concept is
applicable in the case of any jurisdiction outside the United States), except
where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
Companys Subsidiaries are in compliance with the provisions of their
respective certificates of incorporation, bylaws or other applicable
constituent documents in all material respects.

 



 

(b) All of the outstanding capital stock of, or other security, equity or
voting interest in, each Subsidiary of the Company (i) is duly authorized,
validly issued and fully paid and nonassessable and (ii) is owned, directly or
indirectly, by the Company, free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted
Liens) and free of any other restriction (including any restriction on the

business as of the Effective Time in substantially the same manner such
business is conducted on the date hereof.

 



 

(c) There are no outstanding (i) securities of any Subsidiary of the Company
convertible into or exchangeable for shares of capital stock of, or other
equity or voting interest in, any Subsidiary of the Company, (ii) options,
warrants or other rights to acquire from any Subsidiary of the Company, or
that obligates any Subsidiary of the Company to issue, sell or transfer any
capital stock of, partnership or similar ownership interests or any other
equity or voting interest in, or any securities convertible into or
exchangeable for shares of capital stock of, or other equity or voting
interest in, any Subsidiary of the Company, (iii) obligations of any
Subsidiary of the Company to grant, extend or enter into any subscription,
warrant, right, convertible or exchangeable security or other similar Contract
relating to any capital stock of, or other equity or voting interest
(including any voting debt) in, any Subsidiary of the Company (the items in
clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), together with the capital stock of the
Subsidiaries of the Company, being referred to collectively as " **Subsidiary
Securities** "), or (iv) other obligations by any Subsidiary of the Company to
make any payments based on the price or value of any shares of any Subsidiary
of the Company. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to
any Contract that obligates the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any outstanding Subsidiary Securities.

documents, together with all exhibits and schedules thereto, the " **Company
SEC Reports** "). As of its filing date (or, if amended or superseded by a
filing prior to the date of this Agreement, on the date of such amended or
superseded filing), (i) each Company SEC Report complied as to form in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act or
the Exchange Act, as the case may be, each as in effect on the date such
Company SEC Report was filed, and (ii) each Company SEC Report did not, and
any Company SEC Reports filed with the SEC subsequent to the date of this
Agreement will not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, _provided_ that no representation or warranty is made in this
_Section 4.8(a)_ with respect to any Company SEC Reports filed in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which are covered solely
in _Section 4.28_. None of the Companys Subsidiaries is required to file any

to an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) furnish to any Person (other than Parent,
Acquisition Sub or any designees of Parent or Acquisition Sub) any non-public
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or afford to
any Person (other than Parent, Acquisition Sub or any designees of Parent or
Acquisition Sub) access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or
other non-public information, or to any personnel, of the Company or any of

or similar document, or any Contract or commitment contemplating or otherwise

(other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement). The Company agrees that
it shall, as soon as practicable following the date hereof but in any event
within two (2) Business Days, request of each Person that has heretofore
executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of a
transaction with the Company to return all confidential information furnished
prior to the execution of this Agreement to or for

 



      
 

 



 

the benefit of such Person by or on behalf of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or Representatives.

 



 

(c) As promptly as practicable, and in any event within forty-eight (48)
hours, following receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for
nonpublic information or inquiry which the Company reasonably believes would
lead to an Acquisition Proposal or for a waiver or release under any
standstill or similar agreement, the Company shall provide Parent with oral
and written notice of (i) the material terms and conditions of such
Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, (ii) the identity of the Person or
group (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) making such
Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry and (iii) a copy of all written
proposals provided by such Person or group in connection with such Acquisition
Proposal, request or inquiry. The Company shall provide Parent as promptly as
practicable, and in any event within forty eight (48) hours, oral and written
notice setting forth all information as is reasonably necessary to keep Parent
informed in all material respects, on a current basis, of the status and
details (including any material change, whether written or oral, to the terms
and conditions) of any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry,
including by providing a copy of all written proposals relating to any
Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry. The Company shall provide Parent

request clarifications from, participate in discussions or negotiations with
or furnish information to, any Person or group (as defined under Section 13(d)
of the Exchange Act) that makes an unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal if (A) such action is taken subject to an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement, and (B) the Company Board reasonably determines in good faith by
majority vote, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure
to take such actions would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company may not provide any information to, request clarifications from or
participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person or group (as
defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) making an Acquisition
Proposal under this _Section 6.2(d)_ until two (2) Business Days after the
Company has first notified Parent of such Acquisition Proposal as required by
_Section 6.2(c)(i)_, _provided_ that the foregoing obligation to provide such
notice shall only apply to the first Acquisition Proposal made by such Person
or group, but not to any subsequent Acquisition Proposal by such Person or
group. The Company shall, concurrently with providing any non-public
information of the Company to any person who has made an Acquisition Proposal,
provide such information to Parent (including by posting such information to
an electronic data room) to the extent such information has not previously
been provided to Parent.

 



 

(e) Without limiting the foregoing, the Company agrees that any violation of
the restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.2_ by any director, officer,
financial advisor or outside counsel of the Company (other than any such
Person who is an Affiliate or employee of Parent), whether or not such Person
is purporting to act on behalf of the Company or its Affiliates, shall
constitute a breach by the Company of this _Section 6.2_. Subject to _Section
6.1(b)(xv), t_he Company shall enforce, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, the provisions of

 



      
 

 



 

any standstill, confidentiality or similar agreement entered into by it or any
of its Subsidiaries or their respective Affiliates or Representatives,
including, without limitation, where necessary, obtaining injunctions to
prevent breaches of such agreements and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions thereon in any court having jurisdiction.

Contracts to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party in
connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions

by this Agreement. In addition to the foregoing, neither Parent or Acquisition
Sub, on the one hand, nor the Company, on the other hand, shall take any
action, or fail to take any action, that is intended to, or has (or would
reasonably be expected to have) the effect of, preventing, impairing, delaying
or otherwise adversely affecting the consummation of the Offer or the Merger

Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company shall
not be required prior to the Effective Time to pay any consent or other

under any Antitrust Laws, including using reasonable best efforts to take all
such action as reasonably may be necessary to resolve such objections, if any,
as the FTC, the DOJ, or any other Person may assert under any applicable
Antitrust Laws with respect to the Offer and/or the Merger. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing contained in this
Agreement shall be deemed to require Parent or any Subsidiary or Affiliate
thereof to agree to (i) any divestiture, by itself or any of its Affiliates,

respect to which any such filings have been made, then such party shall use
its reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be made, as soon as
reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other party, an
appropriate response in compliance with such request. In connection with and
without limiting the foregoing, to the extent reasonably practicable and
unless prohibited by applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental
Authority, and except with respect to "4(c) documents" as that term is used in
the rules and regulations of the HSR Act, the parties hereto agree to (i) give
each other reasonable advance notice of all meetings with any Governmental
Authority relating to the Offer or the Merger, (ii) give each other an
opportunity to participate in each of such meetings, (iii) keep the other
party reasonably apprised with respect to any oral communications with any
Governmental Authority regarding the Offer or the Merger, (iv) cooperate in
the filing of any analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments,
opinions or other written communications explaining or defending the Offer and
the Merger, articulating any regulatory or competitive argument and/or
responding to requests or objections made by any Governmental Authority, (v)
provide each other with a reasonable advance opportunity to review and comment
upon, and consider in good faith the views of the other with respect to, all
written communications (including any analyses, presentations, memoranda,
briefs, arguments and opinions) with a Governmental Authority regarding the
Offer and the Merger, (vi) provide each other (or counsel of each party, as
appropriate) with copies of all written communications to or from any
Governmental Authority relating to the Offer or the Merger, and (vii)
cooperate and provide each other with a reasonable opportunity to participate
in, and consider in good faith the views of the other with respect to, all
material deliberations with respect to all efforts to satisfy the conditions
set forth in clauses (A) and (C)(1) of _Annex A_ and _Section 8.1(c)_. Any
such disclosures, rights to participate or provisions of information by one
party to the other may be made on a counsel-

 



      
 

 



 

only basis to the extent required under applicable Law or as appropriate to
protect confidential business information.

 



 

(c) Each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company shall cooperate with one
another in good faith to (i) promptly determine whether any filings not
contemplated by _Section 7.2(a)_ are required to be or should be made, and
whether any other consents, approvals, permits or authorizations not
contemplated by _Section 7.2(a)_ are required to be or should be obtained,
from any Governmental Authority under any other applicable Law in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) promptly make any filings,
furnish information required in connection therewith and seek to obtain timely
any such consents, permits, authorizations, approvals or waivers that the
parties determine are required to be or should be made or obtained in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

 **7.3 **_Proxy Statement_.

 



 

(a) If the Company Stockholders are required under the DGCL to adopt this
Agreement in order to consummate the Merger, as soon as practicable following
the Acceptance Time, the Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall jointly
prepare, and the Company shall file with the SEC, the Proxy Statement for use
in connection with the solicitation of proxies from the Company Stockholders
for use at the Company Stockholder Meeting. The Company, Parent and
Acquisition Sub, as the case may be, shall furnish all information concerning
the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Acquisition Sub (and their
respective Affiliates, if applicable), on the other hand, as the other may
reasonably request in connection with the preparation and filing with the SEC
of the Proxy Statement. Subject to applicable Law, the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be disseminated to the
Company Stockholders as promptly as practicable following the filing thereof
with the SEC and confirmation from the SEC that it will not comment on, or
that it has no additional comments on, the Proxy Statement. Each of the
Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall promptly correct any information
provided by it or any of its respective directors, officers, employees,
Affiliates, agents or other representatives for use in the Proxy Statement if
and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading
in any material respect. The Company shall take all steps necessary to cause
the Proxy Statement, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to the Company Stockholders, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable Laws. The Company shall provide Parent, Acquisition Sub
and their counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy
Statement prior to the filing thereof with the SEC, and the Company shall give
reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by Parent,
Acquisition Sub and their counsel (it being understood that Parent,
Acquisition Sub and their counsel shall provide any comments thereon as soon
as reasonably practicable). The Company shall provide in writing to Parent,
Acquisition Sub and their counsel any comments or other communications,
whether written or oral, the Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC
or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement promptly after such receipt,
and the Company shall provide Parent, Acquisition Sub and their counsel a
reasonable opportunity to participate in the formulation of any response to
any such comments of the SEC or its staff (including a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on any such response, to which the Company shall give
reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by Parent,
Acquisition Sub and their counsel).

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to _Article IX_,
subject to the terms of _Section 7.5(b)_, the Company shall include the
portion of the Company Board Recommendation relating to the Merger and the
adoption of this Agreement in the Proxy Statement.

 



 

 **7.4 **_Company Stockholder Meeting; Short-Form Merger_.

 



 

(a) If the Company Stockholders are required under the DGCL to adopt this
Agreement in order to consummate the Merger, the Company shall establish a
record date for, call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the
Company Stockholders (the " **Company Stockholder Meeting** ") as promptly as
practicable following the date hereof for the purpose of voting upon the
adoption of this Agreement in accordance with the DGCL.

 



 

(b) Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub shall vote all Company Shares acquired
in the Offer (or otherwise beneficially owned by it or any of its respective
Subsidiaries as of the applicable record date) in favor of the adoption of
this Agreement in accordance with the DGCL at the Company Stockholder Meeting
or otherwise. Parent shall vote all of the shares of capital stock of
Acquisition Sub beneficially owned by it, or sign a written consent in lieu of
a meeting of the stockholders of Acquisition Sub, in favor of the adoption of
this Agreement in accordance with the DGCL.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, in
the event that the Merger can be effected pursuant to Section 251(h) of the
DGCL, then following the consummation of the Offer, each of Parent,
Acquisition Sub and the Company shall take all necessary and appropriate
actions to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable after
the Acceptance Time, without a meeting of the stockholders of the Company, in
accordance with Section 251(h) of the DGCL and upon the terms and subject to
the conditions of this Agreement. In furtherance, and without limiting the
generality, of the foregoing, neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub shall, or
shall cause or permit any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives
to, take any action that could render Section 251(h) of the DGCL inapplicable
to the Merger.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, in
the event that the Merger cannot be effected pursuant to Section 251(h) of the
DGCL, then if Parent, Acquisition Sub and any other Subsidiary of Parent,
holds in the aggregate at least ninety percent (90%) of the issued and
outstanding Company Shares following the consummation of the Offer, then each
of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company shall take all necessary and
appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as
practicable after the Acceptance Time, without a meeting of the stockholders
of the Company, in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL and upon the terms
and subject to the conditions of this Agreement.

 



 

 **7.5 **_Company Board Recommendation_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms of _Section 7.5(b)_ and _Section 7.5(c)_, the
Company Board shall recommend that the holders of Company Shares accept the
Offer, tender their Company Shares to Acquisition Sub pursuant to the Offer
and, if required by the applicable provisions of Delaware Law, adopt this
Agreement (the " **Company Board Recommendation** ").

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (x) withhold,
withdraw, amend, modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent, or publicly
propose to withhold, withdraw, amend, modify or qualify in a manner adverse to
Parent, the Company Board Recommendation or (y) approve, endorse or recommend
an Acquisition Proposal (each of clauses (x) and (y), a " **Company Board
Recommendation Change** "); _provided, however_ , that a "stop, look and
listen" communication by the Company Board to the Company Stockholders
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, or any substantially similar
communication, shall not be deemed to be a Company Board Recommendation
Change. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, in response to the
receipt of a Superior Proposal or an Intervening Event, the Company Board may
effect a Company Board Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 9.1(e)_ if all of the following conditions in clauses
(i) through (iv) are met:

 



 

(i) A Superior Proposal with respect to the Company has been made and has not
been withdrawn or an Intervening Event has occurred;

 



 

(ii) The Company shall have (A) delivered to Parent written notice (a "
**Change of Recommendation Notice** ") at least four (4) Business Days prior
to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, which notice shall
state expressly (x) that it has received a Superior Proposal, (y) the material
terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal and the identity of the Person
or group (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) making the
Superior Proposal, and (z) that it intends to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 9.1(e)_ or effect a Company Board Recommendation Change
and the manner in which it intends to do so, and (B) provided to Parent a copy
of all written proposals provided by such Person or group in connection with
such Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that delivery of a
Change of Recommendation Notice shall not, by itself, be deemed to be a
Company Board Recommendation Change);

 



 

(iii) The Company Board has concluded in good faith by majority vote, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to effect a Company
Board Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to constitute a
breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; and

 



 

(iv) The Company shall not have breached any of the provisions set forth in
_Section 6.2_ or this _Section 7.5_ in any material respect with respect to
the Superior Proposal or Intervening Event that is the subject matter of such
Company Board Recommendation Change.

 



 

After delivering the Change of Recommendation Notice, the Company shall
provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to make such adjustments to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement (the " **Modified Terms** "), and negotiate
in good faith with respect thereto, as would enable the Company to proceed
without making a Company Board Recommendation Change. In the event Parent
proposes Modified Terms and notwithstanding anything in this _Section _ _7_
_._ _5_ _(_ _b_ _)_ to the contrary, the Company Board may not terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(e)_ or effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change unless and until the Company Board of Directors
concludes in good faith by majority vote, after considering the Modified Terms
and

 



      
 

 



 

consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(e)_ or effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



 

(c) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board from (i) taking
and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying with the provisions of Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act, and (ii) making any disclosure to the
Company Stockholders that the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to make such
disclosure would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of its
fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under applicable Law; _provided_
that, in either such case, any such statement(s) or disclosures made by the
Company Board will be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
including the provisions of _Article IX_.

 



 

 **7.6 **_Public Statements and Disclosure_. None of the Company, on the one
hand, or Parent and Acquisition Sub, on the other hand, shall issue (or shall
cause its Subsidiaries or Representatives to issue) any public release or make
any public announcement concerning this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
except as such release or announcement may be required by applicable Law or
the rules or regulations of NASDAQ or the Tokyo Stock Exchange or Governmental
Authority to which the relevant party is subject or submits, wherever
situated, in which case the party required to make the release or announcement
shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow the other party or parties
hereto reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance
of such issuance (it being understood that the final form and content of any
such release or announcement, as well as the timing of any such release or
announcement, shall be at the final discretion of the disclosing party);
_provided, however_ , that the restrictions set forth in this _Section 7.6_
shall not apply to any release or announcement made or proposed to be made by
the Company pursuant to _Section 7.3_ or following a Company Board
Recommendation Change.

 



 

 **7.7 **_Anti-Takeover Laws_. In the event that any state anti-takeover or
other similar Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and Company Board
shall grant such approval and take such action as necessary so that such
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Law on this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

 **7.8 **_Access_. At all times during the period commencing with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to
occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_ and the
Acceptance Time, the Company shall afford Parent and its financial advisors,
business consultants, legal counsel, accountants and other agents and
representatives reasonable access during normal business hours, upon
reasonable notice, to the properties, books and records and personnel of the
Company; _provided, however_ , that the Company may restrict or otherwise
prohibit access to any documents or information to the extent that (i) any
applicable Law requires the Company to restrict or otherwise prohibit access
to such documents or information, (ii) access to such documents or information
would give rise to a

 



       
 

 



 

material risk of waiving any attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine
or other applicable privilege applicable to such documents or information, or
(iii) access to a Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
a party or otherwise bound would violate or cause a default under, or give a
third party the right terminate or accelerate the rights under, such Contract;
and _provided further_ , that no information or knowledge obtained by Parent
in any investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this
_Section 7.8_ shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty of the Company set forth in this Agreement or otherwise impair the
rights and remedies available to Parent and Acquisition Sub hereunder. In the
event that the Company does not provide access or information in reliance on
the preceding sentence, it shall use its reasonable best efforts to
communicate the applicable information to Parent in a way that would not
violate the applicable Law, Contract or obligation or to waive such a
privilege. Any investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by
this _Section 7.8_ shall be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably
interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries
or create a risk of damage or destruction to any property or assets of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Any access to the properties of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be subject to the Companys
reasonable security measures and insurance requirements and shall not include
the right to perform invasive testing without the Companys prior written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). The terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall
apply to any information obtained by Parent or any of its financial advisors,
business consultants, legal counsel, accountants and other agents and
representatives in connection with any investigation conducted pursuant to the
access contemplated by this _Section 7._ _8_. Nothing in this _Section 7.8_
or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to require the Company, any
of its Subsidiaries or any Representatives of any of the foregoing to prepare
any reports, analyses, appraisals, opinions or other information, _provided_ ,
that the Company shall deliver updates to Parent upon the receipt of any
material results or other information regarding the status of the Phase II
clinical trial for SGI 110 being conducted by or on behalf of the Company or
its Subsidiaries.

 



 

 **7.9 **_Section 16(b) Exemption_. The Company shall take all actions
reasonably necessary to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and any other dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including
"derivative securities" (as defined in Rule 16a-1(c) under the Exchange Act))
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is a director or executive officer of the Company to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



 

 **7.10 **_Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries as of the Acceptance Time
shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
as of the Acceptance Time to) honor and fulfill in all respects the
obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries under (i) the indemnification
agreements between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of their
respective current or former directors and officers and any person who becomes
a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the
Acceptance Time (the " **Indemnified Persons** ") and (ii) indemnification,
expense advancement and exculpation provisions in any certificate of
incorporate or bylaws or comparable organizational document of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries in effect on the date of this Agreement. In addition,

 



      
 

 



 

during the period commencing at the Acceptance Time and ending on the sixth
(6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries as of the Acceptance Time shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries as of the Acceptance Time to) cause
the certificates of incorporation and bylaws (and other similar organizational
documents) of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries as of the
Acceptance Time to contain provisions with respect to indemnification,
exculpation and the advancement of expenses that are no less favorable than
the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions
contained in the certificates of incorporation and bylaws (or other similar
organizational documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date
hereof, and during such six (6) year period, such provisions shall not be
repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner except as required by
applicable Law or as provided below.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the generality of the provisions of _Section 7.10(a)_,
during the period commencing at the Acceptance Time and ending on the sixth
(6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries as of the
Acceptance Time shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries as of the Acceptance Time to) indemnify and hold harmless
each Indemnified Person from and against any costs, fees and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and investigation expenses), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim,
proceeding, investigation or inquiry arises directly or indirectly out of or
pertains directly or indirectly to (i) any action or omission or alleged
action or omission in such Indemnified Persons capacity as a director,
officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or other
Affiliates (regardless of whether such action or omission, or alleged action
or omission, occurred prior to or at the Effective Time), or (ii) any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that if, at
any time prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, any
Indemnified Person delivers to Parent a written notice asserting in good faith
a claim for indemnification under this _Section 7.10(b)_, then the claim
asserted in such notice shall survive the sixth (6th) anniversary of the
Effective Time until such time as such claim is fully and finally resolved. In
addition, during the period commencing at the Acceptance Time and ending on
the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries as
of the Acceptance Time shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries as of the Acceptance Time to) advance, prior to the final
disposition of any claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry for which
indemnification may be sought under this Agreement, promptly following request
by an Indemnified Person therefor, all costs, fees and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and investigation expenses) incurred by such
Indemnified Person in connection with any such claim, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry upon receipt of an undertaking by such Indemnified
Person to repay such advances if it is ultimately decided in a final, non-
appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified
Person is not entitled to indemnification. In the event of any such claim,
proceeding, investigation or inquiry, (i) the Surviving Corporation shall have
the right to control the defense thereof after the Acceptance Time, (ii) each
Indemnified Person shall be entitled to retain his or her own counsel, whether
or not the Surviving Corporation shall elect to control the defense of any
such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, (iii) the Surviving
Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of any counsel retained
by an Indemnified Person, promptly after statements

 



      
 

 



 

therefor are received, whether or not the Surviving Corporation shall elect to
control the defense of any such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry,
and (iv) no Indemnified Person shall be liable for any settlement effected
without his or her prior express written consent. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth in this _Section 7.10(b)_ or elsewhere in this
Agreement, neither the Surviving Corporation nor any of its Affiliates
(including Parent) shall settle or otherwise compromise or consent to the
entry of any judgment or otherwise seek termination with respect to any claim,
proceeding, investigation or inquiry for which indemnification may be sought
by an Indemnified Person under this Agreement unless such settlement,
compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional release of all
Indemnified Persons from all liability arising out of such claim, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry.

 



 

(c) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth
(6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain in effect directors
and officers liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time, covering each person covered by the Companys
currently in force directors and officers liability insurance (" **Current
Company D andO Insurance**"), on terms with respect to the coverage and amounts
that are no less favorable than those of the Current Company DandO Insurance;
_provided, however_ , that in satisfying its obligations under this _Section
7.10(c)_, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay
annual premiums in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the amount paid
by the Company for coverage during its current coverage period (such three
hundred percent (300%) amount, the " **Maximum Annual Premium** ") (which
premiums the Company represents and warrants to be as set forth in _Section
7.10(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter); _provided_ that, if the annual
premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium. Prior
to the Effective Time, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, the Company may purchase a six (6) year "tail" prepaid policy
on the Current Company DandO Insurance. In the event that the Company elects to
purchase such a "tail" policy prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to)
maintain such "tail" policy in full force and effect and continue to honor
their respective obligations thereunder, in lieu of all other obligations of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation under the first sentence of this _Section
7.10(c)_ for so long as such "tail" policy shall be maintained in full force
and effect.

 



 

(d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of
the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set forth in this
_Section 7.10_.

 



 

(e) Except as required by applicable Law, the obligations set forth in this
_Section 7.10_ shall not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in any
manner that adversely affects any Indemnified Person (or any other person who
is a beneficiary under the Current Company DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy
referred to in _Section 7.10(c)_) without the

 



      
 

 



 

prior written consent of such affected Indemnified Person or other person who
is a beneficiary under the Current Company DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy
referred to in _Section 7.10(c)_. Each of the Indemnified Persons or other
persons who are beneficiaries under the Current Company DandO Insurance or the
"tail" policy referred to in _Section 7.10(c)_ (and, if and to the extent
applicable, their heirs and representatives) are intended to be third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 7.10_, with full rights of enforcement as if a
party thereto. The rights of the Indemnified Persons (and other persons who
are beneficiaries under the Current Company DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy
referred to in _Section 7.10(c)_ (and, if and to the extent applicable, their
heirs and representatives)) under this _Section 7.10_ shall be in addition
to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that such persons may have
under the certificates of incorporation, bylaws or other equivalent
organizational documents, any and all indemnification agreements of or entered
into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or applicable Law (whether at
law or in equity).

 



 

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this _Section 7.10_ is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

 



 

 **7.11 **_Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change of control" (or similar phrase)
within the meaning of the Employee Plans, as applicable, will occur as of the
Acceptance Time, as applicable.

 



 

(b) For a period of one (1) year following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) either
(i) provide to each Continuing Employee, compensation and benefits (other than
equity and equity-based benefits and benefits provided under individual
employment agreements) that are, taken as a whole, substantially comparable in
the aggregate to the compensation and benefits (other than equity and equity-
based benefits and benefits provided under individual employment agreements)
in effect for such Continuing Employee on the date of this Agreement or (ii)
provide compensation and benefits (other than equity or equity-based benefits
and benefits provided under individual employment agreements) to each
Continuing Employee that, taken as a whole, are no less favorable in the
aggregate than the compensation, benefits and severance payments (other than
equity based benefits and individual employment agreements) provided to
similarly situated employees of Parent (" **Parent Plans** "). In each case,
base salary or regular wages as of the Acceptance Time shall not be decreased
for a period of one (1) year for any Continuing Employee who continues to be
employed by the Surviving Corporation or an Affiliate during that period.

 



 

(c) To the extent that an Employee Plan or any other employee benefit plan or
other compensation or severance arrangement of the Surviving Corporation or
any of its Subsidiaries (together, the " **Company Plans** ") or Parent Plan
is made available to any Continuing Employee on or following the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and

 



      
 

 



 

Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) cause to be granted to such
Continuing Employee credit for all service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time solely for purposes of eligibility to
participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits where length of service is
relevant for purposes of vacation accrual and severance pay entitlement but
excluding for the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of any equity or equity-
based awards or incentives granted after the Effective Time; _provided,
however_ , that such service need not be credited to the extent that it would
result in duplication of coverage or benefits. In addition, and without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall (or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to) use its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure
that: (i) each Continuing Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all employee benefit plans
sponsored by the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (other than the
Company Plans) (such plans, collectively, the " **New Plans** ") to the extent
coverage under any such New Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Company
Plan in which such Continuing Employee participates immediately before the
Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the " **Old Plans** "); and (ii) for
purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision
and/or disability benefits to any Continuing Employee, all waiting periods,
pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements and
actively-at-work or similar requirements of such New Plan to be waived for
such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, any eligible
expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents during any unfinished portion of the plan year of the Old Plan
ending on the date such employees participation in the corresponding New Plan
begins to be given full credit under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying
all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable
to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for the
applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such
New Plan, and (iii) the accounts of such Continuing Employees under any New
Plan which is a flexible spending plan are credited with any unused balance in
the account of such Continuing Employee under the applicable Company Plan. Any
vacation or paid time off accrued but unused by a Continuing Employee as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be credited to such Continuing
Employee following the Effective Time, and shall not be subject to accrual
limits or other forfeiture and shall not limit future accruals.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no
provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) guarantee employment for
any period of time for, or preclude the ability of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation to terminate, any Continuing Employee for any reason, or (ii)
require Parent or the Surviving Corporation to continue any Company Plan or
prevent the amendment, modification or termination thereof after the Effective
Time. The provisions of this _Section 7.11_ are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and no Continuing Employee (including any
beneficiary or dependent thereof) shall be regarded for any purpose as a
third-party beneficiary of this Agreement, and no provision of this _Section

become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or of any failure of the
Company to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this
Agreement, in any such case if and only to the extent that such untruth or
inaccuracy, or such failure, would reasonably be expected to cause any of the
conditions to the obligations of Parent and Acquisition Sub to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby set forth in paragraphs (C)(2) and (C)(3) of
_Annex A_ to fail to be satisfied at the then scheduled expiration of the
Offer; _provided, however_ , that no such notification shall affect or be

Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the

has become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or of any failure of
Parent or Acquisition Sub to comply with or satisfy in any material respect
any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
under this Agreement, in any such case if and only to the extent that such
untruth or inaccuracy, or such failure, would reasonably be expected to
prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of Parent and
Acquisition Sub to consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger) or the ability of Parent
and Acquisition Sub to fully perform their respective covenants and
obligations under this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that no such
notification shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty of Parent or Acquisition Sub set forth in this Agreement or the
conditions to the obligations of the Company to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the remedies available to the parties
hereunder; and _provided further_ , that the terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any information provided to the
Company pursuant to this _Section 7.13(b)_.

 



 

 **7.14 **_Certain Litigation_. The Company shall promptly advise Parent of
any litigation commenced after the date hereof against the Company or any of
its directors (in their capacity as such) by any Company Stockholders (on
their own behalf or on behalf of the Company) relating to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby, and shall keep Parent reasonably
informed regarding any such litigation. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to consult with the Company regarding the defense or settlement of
any such stockholder litigation and shall consider Parents views with respect
to such stockholder litigation.

 



      
 

 



 

 **7.15 **_Treatment of Company Warrants_. The Company shall, in accordance
with the terms of the Company Warrants, deliver notices to the holders of the

Sub and the Company shall permit such holders to, and Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such holders to, participate in the
Offer through the conditional exercise of such Company Warrants and tender of
the underlying Company Shares received upon such exercise into the Offer. If,
after the Acceptance Time, any Company Warrants (or portion thereof) remain
unexercised and outstanding, the Company and the Acquisition Sub shall take
any other actions required by the terms of the Company Warrants.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VIII

include, to the extent proven, the benefit of the bargain lost by a partys
stockholders (taking into consideration relevant matters, including other
combination opportunities and the time value of money), which shall be deemed
in such event to be damages of such party) resulting from any willful or
intentional breach of this Agreement that occurs prior to such termination, in
which case the aggrieved party shall be entitled to all remedies available at
law or in equity. In addition to the foregoing, no termination of this
Agreement shall affect the obligations of the parties hereto set forth in the
Confidentiality Agreement, all of which obligations shall survive termination
of this Agreement in accordance with their terms.

 



 

 **9.4 **_Fees and Expenses_.

 



 

(a) _General_. Except as set forth in this _Section 9.4_, all fees and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions

by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts

writing by Parent, within two (2) Business Days after demand by Parent, in the
event that: (A) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant
to _Section 9.1(b)_ ( _provided_ , that (x) the condition to the Offer set
forth in clause (A) of _Annex A_ is satisfied at the time of such termination
pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)_, (y) the condition to the Offer set forth in
clause (C)(1) of _Annex A_ is satisfied at the time of such termination
pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)_, except where the failure to meet such condition
arises out of or results from a Legal Proceeding brought by or on behalf of
the Person who has made the Competing Acquisition Transaction referred to in
clause (B) below and (z) the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 9.1(b)_ is then available to Parent); and (B) following the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to such termination of this
Agreement, a Competing Acquisition Transaction shall have been publicly
announced or shall have become publicly disclosed and, in either case, shall
not have been withdrawn or otherwise abandoned; and (C) within twelve (12)
months following such termination of this Agreement, the Company enters into a
definitive agreement with any third party that effectuates a Competing
Acquisition Transaction or a Competing Acquisition Transaction is consummated.
For purposes of the foregoing, a " **Competing Acquisition Transaction** "
shall have the same meaning as an "Acquisition Transaction" except that all
references therein to (i) "more than twenty percent (20%)" shall be deemed to
be references to "more than forty percent (40%)" and (ii) "more than eighty
percent (80%)" shall be deemed to be references to "more than sixty percent
(60%)."

 



 

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to

termination.

Parent.

that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on
more than one (1) occasion, whether or not the Termination Fee may be payable
under more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at different
times and the occurrence of different events.

 



 

(d) _Consequence of Non-Payment_. The Company acknowledges that the agreements
contained in _Section 9.4(b)_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent
would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to
promptly pay the amount due pursuant to _Section 9.4(b)_, and, in order to
obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment
against the Company for the fee set forth in _Section 9.4(b)_ or any portion
of such fee, the Company shall pay to Parent its costs and expenses (including
attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest at a
rate per annum equal to the prime lending rate prevailing during the period as
published in The Wall Street Journal. Payment of the fees described in

breach of this Agreement.

provisions of this Agreement, this Agreement may be amended by the parties
hereto at any time prior to the Effective Time by execution of an instrument
in writing signed on behalf of each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the
Company; _provided, however_ , that in the event that this Agreement has been
adopted by the Company Stockholders in accordance with Delaware Law, no
amendment shall be made to this Agreement that requires the approval of such
Company Stockholders under Delaware Law or the rules of NASDAQ, without such
approval.

 



 

 **9.6 **_Extension; Waiver_. At any time and from time to time prior to the
Effective Time, any party or parties hereto may, to the extent legally allowed
and except as otherwise set forth herein, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party or
parties hereto, as applicable, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties made to such party or parties hereto contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance
with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party or
parties hereto contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party or
parties hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party or parties,
as applicable. Any delay in exercising any right under this Agreement shall
not constitute a waiver of such right. The conditions to each of the parties
obligations to consummate the Merger are for the sole benefit of such party
and may be waived by such party in whole or in part to the extent permitted by
applicable Law.

or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to negotiate in good faith in an effort to replace such void or
unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable
provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business
and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

other remedy.

of any breach or threatened breach by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent
and/or Acquisition Sub, on the other hand, of any of their respective
covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement, the Company, on the one

threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and
obligations of the other under this Agreement. The Company, on the one hand,
and Parent and Acquisition Sub, on the other hand hereby agree not to raise
any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific
performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this
Agreement by such party (or parties), and to specifically enforce the terms
and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches
of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of such party
(or parties) under this Agreement.

Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought, tried and
determined only in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, only if

have jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal or other state court
within the State of Delaware); (e) waives any objection that it may now or
hereafter have to the venue of any such action or proceeding in any such court

COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)

ACQUISITION SUB OR THE COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE
AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

or otherwise preventing the consummation of the Offer, the acquisition of
Company Shares by Parent or Acquisition Sub, or the Merger in the United
States , or (ii) issued or granted any Order that is in effect as of
immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer and has the effect of making

(2) (i) the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
_Sections 4.6(a)_ through _(c)_ (regarding capitalization and equity awards
of the Company) of the Agreement shall not be true and correct in all material

Agreement as though made at and as of such time (except to the extent
expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case, at and as of such earlier
date), except where the failure to be so true and correct would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect;

 



 

(3) the Company shall have failed to perform in all material respects any
obligations, agreements or covenants to be performed, or complied with, by it
under the Agreement at or prior to the expiration of the Offer;

to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any
such right and, each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be
asserted at any time and from time to time.
