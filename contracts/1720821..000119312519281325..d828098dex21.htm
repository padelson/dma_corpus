the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective
Time, by virtue of the First Merger and without any further action on the part
of Parent, First Merger Sub, the Company, the Company Stockholders or
the holders of any of the securities of Parent, the following shall occur:

(a) Each share of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares) issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled and
automatically deemed for all purposes to represent the right to receive a
portion of the Total Consideration, with each Company Stockholder
being entitled to receive its Pro Rata Share of: (i) the Closing Cash Payment
Amount; (ii) the Closing Number of Securities; (iii) and any amount payable to
the Company Stockholders pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.11_,  _Section_ __ _

surrender of stock certificates representing all of such Company
Stockholders Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") and delivery of
the other documents required pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.9_. As of the
Effective Time, each Company Stockholder shall cease to have any other rights
in and to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Entity, and
each Certificate relating to the ownership of shares of Company Common Stock
(other than Excluded Shares) shall thereafter represent only the right to
receive the applicable portion of the Total Consideration.

(b) No fraction of a share of Parent Class A Stock will be issued by virtue
of the First Merger, and each Company Stockholder who would otherwise be
entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Class A Stock (after aggregating
all fractional shares of Parent Class A Stock that otherwise would be
received by such Company Stockholder) shall receive from Parent, in lieu of
such fractional share: (i) one share of Parent Class A Stock if the aggregate
amount of fractional shares of Parent Class A Stock such Company Stockholder
would otherwise be entitled to is equal to or exceeds 0.50; or (ii) no shares
of Parent Class A Stock if the aggregate amount of fractional shares of Parent
Class A Stock such Company Stockholder would otherwise be entitled to is less

(c) Each issued and outstanding share of common stock of First Merger Sub
shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation, which shall constitute the only outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective
Time, all certificates representing the common stock of First Merger Sub shall
be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock
of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance
with the immediately preceding sentence.

(d) Each share of Company Common Stock held in the Companys treasury or
owned by Parent, First Merger Sub, Second Merger Sub or the Company

be cancelled and no consideration shall be paid or payable with respect
thereto.

Stockholders are entitled to receive as a result of the First Merger and as

stock dividend or distribution (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Parent Class A Stock), extraordinary cash
dividend, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination,

Stockholder or the holders of any shares of capital stock of Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or Second Merger Sub: (a) each share of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Second Effective Time shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist without
any conversion thereof or payment therefor; and (b) the membership interest
of Second Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Second Effective
Time shall be converted into and become the membership interest of the
Surviving Entity, which shall constitute one hundred percent (100%) of the
outstanding equity of the Surviving Entity. From and after the Second
Effective Time, the membership interests of the Second Merger Sub shall be
deemed for all purposes to represent the number of membership interests into
which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding
sentence.

 

Section 2.9 _Surrender of Company Certificates and Disbursement of Closing
Consideration_.

 

(a) Subject to this _Section_ __ _ 2.9_, at the Effective Time, Parent shall
deliver, or cause to be delivered to each Company Stockholder such Company
Stockholders Pro Rata Share of: (i) the Closing Cash Payment Amount _minus_
the Adjustment Escrow Amount; and (ii) the Closing Number of Securities
(collectively, the " _Closing Consideration_ ").

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a commercial bank
or trust company (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging
Certificates for each Company Stockholders portion of the Closing
Consideration.

 

(c) At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent the
aggregate amount of the cash portion of the Closing Consideration and make
available the aggregate amount of the equity portion of the Closing
Consideration. Such cash and equity deposited with the Exchange Agent shall be
referred to in this Agreement as the " _Exchange Fund_ ". At the Effective
Time, Parent shall deliver irrevocable instructions to the Exchange Agent to
deliver the Closing Consideration out of the Exchange Fund in the manner it is
contemplated to be issued or paid pursuant to this _Article II_.

 

(d) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within five Business
Days thereafter), the Exchange Agent shall mail to each Company Stockholder
(other than holders of Excluded Shares): (i) a letter of transmittal in
customary form specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of
the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as
provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.9(g)_) to the Exchange Agent, such letter of
transmittal to be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and
the Stockholder Representative may reasonably agree; and (ii) instructions
for surrendering the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the
Certificates as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.9(g)_) to the Exchange Agent
(the " _Surrender Documentation_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Exchange Agent shall not be required to deliver the Surrender Documentation to
any Company Stockholder that has delivered its Surrender Documentation with
respect to such Company

 



9

    

 Stockholders Certificates to the Exchange Agent at least two Business Days
prior to the Closing Date. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of
loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.9(g)_) to
the Exchange Agent in accordance with the terms of the Surrender
Documentation, the Exchange Agent will deliver to the holder of such
Certificate in exchange therefor such holders portion of the Closing
Consideration in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.9(a)_ hereof, with: (A) any
cash portion of the Closing Consideration being delivered via wire transfer of
immediately available funds in accordance with instructions provided by such
Company Stockholder in the letter of transmittal; and (B) the equity portion
of the Closing Consideration being delivered via book-entry issuance, in each
case, less any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section_ __ _
2.12_; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the holder of such Certificate
delivers to the Exchange Agent the Surrender Documentation with respect to
such Company Stockholders Certificates at least two Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, the Exchange Agent shall deliver to the holder of such
Certificate in exchange therefor such holders portion of the Closing
Consideration covered by such Surrender Documentation in accordance with
clauses (A) and (B) of this sentence on the Closing Date or as promptly as
practicable thereafter. The Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. Until so surrendered, each Certificate shall represent after the
Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive the applicable
portion of the Total Consideration attributable to such Certificate. No
interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender
of the Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of
Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, the applicable portion of the Total Consideration to be delivered
upon due surrender of the Certificate may be issued to such transferee if the
Certificate formerly representing such shares of Company Common Stock is
presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock
transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

(e) From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation,
the Surviving Entity, Parent or the Exchange Agent for transfer, it shall be
cancelled and deemed exchanged for (without interest and after giving effect
to any required Tax withholdings as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 2.12_) the
portion of the Total Consideration represented by such Certificate.

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any
investments of the Exchange Fund) that remains unclaimed by the Company
Stockholders for 180 days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the
Surviving Entity. Any Company Stockholder who has not theretofore complied
with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Entity for
payment of their respective portion of the Total Consideration (after giving
effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.12_)
upon due surrender of its Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the
Certificates as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.9(g)_), without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation,
the Surviving Entity, Parent, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be
liable to any former Company Stockholder for any amount properly delivered to
a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Legal Requirements.

 



10

    

(g) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed: (i) upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed; and (ii) if
required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount
and upon such terms as may be required by Parent as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it, the Surviving Corporation or the Surviving
Entity with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue the
portion of the Total Consideration attributable to such Certificate (after
giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section_ __ _
2.12_).

 

Section 2.10 _Adjustment Escrow Deposit_. At the Closing, Parent shall deposit
with the Escrow Agent an amount equal to $12,500,000 (the " _Adjustment
Escrow Amount_ ") into a designated non-interest bearing account the ("
_Adjustment Escrow Account_ "), by wire transfer of immediately
available funds in U.S. dollars. Pursuant to an escrow agreement to be
entered into on the Closing Date by and among Parent, the Stockholder
Representative and the Escrow Agent in substantially the form attached hereto
as _Exhibit G_ (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "), Parent and the Stockholder
Representative will appoint the Escrow Agent to hold the Adjustment Escrow
Amount until the final determination of the Final Merger Consideration and
disburse the Adjustment Escrow Amount as provided herein and in the Escrow
Agreement.

Section 2.11 _Closing Calculations; Adjustment_.

 

(a) No later than three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall deliver to Parent a statement (the " _Estimated Adjustment Statement_
") setting forth the Companys good faith estimate of: (i) the Closing Working
Capital (such estimate, the " _Estimated Closing Working Capital_ "); (ii) the
Closing Rollover Indebtedness Amount (the " _Estimated Rollover Indebtedness
Amount_ "); (iii) the Company Transaction Costs Adjustment Amount (the "
_Estimated Company Transaction Costs Adjustment Amount_ "); (iv) the Company
Cash (the " _Estimated Company Cash_ "); and (v) the Tax
Overpayment/Underpayment Amount (the " _Estimated Tax Overpayment/Underpayment
Amount_ "), together with instructions that list the applicable bank accounts
designated to facilitate payment by Parent of the amounts included in the
Estimated Company Transaction Costs Adjustment Amount and all relevant
supporting documentation used by Company in calculating such amounts.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company will consider in good faith
Parents comments to the Estimated Adjustment Statement, and if any
adjustments are made to the Estimated Adjustment Statement prior to the
Closing, such adjusted Estimated Adjustment Statement shall thereafter become
the Estimated Adjustment Statement for all purposes of this Agreement;
_provided_ , for the avoidance of doubt, that, following the Companys
consideration in good faith of Parents comments to the Estimated Adjustment
Statement, the Company may determine, in its sole and absolute discretion,
not to make any adjustments to the Estimated Adjustment Statement, in which
case the Estimated Adjustment Statement shall be the Estimated Adjustment
Statement delivered by the Company to Parent. The Estimated Adjustment
Statement and the determinations contained therein shall be prepared in
accordance with the applicable definitions contained in this Agreement.

 

(b) Within 90 days after the Closing Date, Parent will prepare, or cause to be
prepared, and deliver to the Stockholder Representative an unaudited
statement (the " _Adjustment Statement_ "), which shall set forth Parents
good faith calculation of each of the Closing Working Capital, the Company
Transaction Costs Adjustment Amount, Company Cash, the Tax

 



11

    

 Overpayment/Underpayment Amount and the Closing Rollover Indebtedness
Amount. To the extent any amounts in the calculation of the foregoing are not
U.S. dollars, such amounts shall be converted to U.S. dollars using the
average exchange rate to U.S. dollars for the Closing Date as reported by
Bloomberg L.P. Solely for illustrative purposes, an example of the calculation
of Closing Working Capital, as if the Closing Date were June 30, 2019, is
attached as _Schedule B_ hereto using the applicable provisions of this
Agreement and based upon the balance sheet of the Company as of such date.

 

(c) Upon receipt from Parent, the Stockholder Representative shall have 60
days to review the Adjustment Statement (the " _Adjustment Review Period_ ").
At the request of the Stockholder Representative, Parent shall: (i) reasonably
cooperate and assist, and shall cause its Subsidiaries, including the
Surviving Entity, and each of their respective Representatives to reasonably
cooperate and assist, the Stockholder Representative and its Representatives
in the review of the Adjustment Statement (including by requesting their
respective accountants to deliver to the Stockholder Representative and its
Representatives copies of their work papers relating to the Surviving Entity);
and (ii) provide the Stockholder Representative and its Representatives with
any information reasonably requested by the Stockholder Representative that
is necessary for their review of the Adjustment Statement. If the Stockholder
Representative disagrees with Parents computation of the Closing Working
Capital, the Company Transaction Costs Adjustment Amount, Company Cash, the
Tax Overpayment/Underpayment Amount or the Closing Rollover Indebtedness
Amount (each as set forth in the Adjustment Statement), the Stockholder
Representative shall, on or prior to the last day of the Adjustment Review
Period, deliver a written notice to Parent (the " _Adjustment Notice of
Objection_ ") that sets forth the Stockholder Representatives objections to
Parents calculation of the Closing Working Capital, the Company Transaction
Costs Adjustment Amount, Company Cash, the Tax Overpayment/Underpayment
Amount and the Closing Rollover Indebtedness Amount, as applicable. Any
Adjustment Notice of Objection shall specify those items or amounts with which
the Stockholder Representative disagrees and shall set forth the Stockholder
Representatives calculation of the Closing Working Capital, the Company
Transaction Costs Adjustment Amount, Company Cash, the Tax
Overpayment/Underpayment Amount or the Closing Rollover Indebtedness Amount,
as applicable, based on such objections (it being understood that the
Stockholder Representative shall be deemed to have accepted Parents
calculation of any amounts set forth on the Adjustment Statement to which the
Stockholder Representative does not object in the Adjustment Notice of
Objection).

(d) If the Stockholder Representative does not deliver an Adjustment Notice
of Objection to Parent with respect to an item contained in the Adjustment
Statement within the Adjustment Review Period, the Stockholder Representative
shall be deemed to have accepted Parents calculation of the underlying item
of the Closing Working Capital, the Company Transaction Costs Adjustment
Amount, Company Cash, the Tax Overpayment/Underpayment Amount and the Closing
Rollover Indebtedness Amount, as applicable, and such calculation shall be
final, conclusive and binding on the Parties. If the Stockholder
Representative delivers an Adjustment Notice of Objection to Parent within the
Adjustment Review Period, Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall,
during the 30 days following such delivery or any mutually agreed extension
thereof, use their good faith efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items
and amounts in order to determine the amount of the disputed Closing Working
Capital, the Company Transaction Costs Adjustment Amount, Company Cash, the
Tax Overpayment/Underpayment

 



12

    

 Amount or the Closing Rollover Indebtedness Amount, as applicable. If, at
the end of such period or any mutually agreed extension thereof, Parent and
the Stockholder Representative are unable to resolve their disagreements,
they shall jointly retain and refer their disagreements to a nationally
recognized independent accounting firm mutually acceptable to Parent and the
Stockholder Representative (such firm or individual, the " _Independent
Expert_ "). The Parties shall instruct the Independent Expert promptly to
review this _Section_ __ _ 2.11_, as well as the Adjustment Statement,
Adjustment Notice of Objection and any other materials reasonably requested
by the Independent Expert, and to determine, solely with respect to the
disputed items and amounts so submitted, whether and to what extent, if any,
the Closing Working Capital, the Company Transaction Costs Adjustment
Amount, Company Cash, the Tax Overpayment/Underpayment Amount or the Closing
Rollover Indebtedness Amount, as applicable, set forth in the Adjustment
Statement requires adjustment pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. The
Independent Expert shall base its determination solely on written submissions
by Parent and the Stockholder Representative and not on an independent review.
Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall make available to the
Independent Expert all relevant books and records and other items reasonably
requested by the Independent Expert. As promptly as practicable, but in no
event later than 45 days after its retention, the Independent Expert shall
deliver to Parent and the Stockholder Representative a report that sets forth
its resolution of the disputed items and amounts and its calculation of the
Closing Working Capital, the Company Transaction Costs Adjustment Amount,
Company Cash, the Tax Overpayment/Underpayment Amount or the Closing Rollover
Indebtedness Amount, as applicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Independent Expert may not assign a value to any item greater than the
greatest value for such item claimed by Parent, on one hand, and the
Stockholder Representative, on the other hand, nor less than the smallest
value for such item claimed by Parent, on one hand, and the Stockholder
Representative, on the other hand. The decision of the Independent Expert
shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties. The costs and expenses
of the Independent Expert shall be allocated between Stockholder
Representative, on the one hand, and the Stockholder Representative, on the
other hand, based upon the percentage that the portion of the aggregate
contested amount not awarded to each Party bears to the aggregate amount
actually contested by such Party, as determined by the Independent Expert.

 

(e) For purposes of this Agreement, "Final Closing Working Capital", "Final
Company Transaction Costs Adjustment Amount", "Final Company Cash", "Final
Tax Overpayment/Underpayment Amount" and "Final Rollover Indebtedness Amount"
mean the amount of such items: (i) as shown in the Adjustment Statement
delivered by Parent to the Stockholder Representative pursuant to _Section
2.11(b)_ if no Adjustment Notice of Objection with respect thereto is timely
delivered by the Stockholder Representative to Parent pursuant to _Section
2.11(d)_; or (ii) if an Adjustment Notice of Objection is so delivered: (A)
as agreed by Parent and the Stockholder Representative pursuant to _Section
2.11(d)_; or (B) in the absence of such agreement, as determined in the
Independent Experts report delivered pursuant to _Section 2.11(d)_.

(f) Within five Business Days after the Final Merger Consideration has been
finally determined pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.11_ (the date of such
determination, the " _Final Adjustment Settlement Date_ "):

 



13

    

(i) if the Final Merger Consideration is less than the Estimated Merger
Consideration: (A) Parent shall be entitled to receive a payment in cash out
of the Adjustment Escrow Account in an amount equal to the lesser of: (1) such
difference; and (2) the total amount of the Adjustment Escrow Funds; and (B)
subject to _Section_ __ _ 7.22(c)_, each Company Stockholder shall be
entitled to receive its Pro Rata Share of the balance of any remaining
Adjustment Escrow Funds after the payment to Parent pursuant to clause (A);
and in no event shall any Company Stockholder have any liability under this
_Section_ __ _ 2.11_ in excess of such Company Stockholders Pro Rata Share
of the Adjustment Escrow Funds; and

 

(ii) if the Final Merger Consideration is equal to or greater than the
Estimated Merger Consideration: (A) subject to _Section_ __ _ 7.22(c)_, each
Company Stockholder shall be entitled receive its Pro Rata Share of the
Adjustment Escrow Funds; and (B) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Entity to, pay to each Company Stockholder an amount equal to such Company
Stockholders Pro Rata Share of the amount of such difference.

 

(g) Any payment required to be made: (i) from the Adjustment Escrow Account to
Parent pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 2.11_ shall be made by wire transfer
of immediately available funds in U.S. dollars to the account of Parent or the
Surviving Entity designated in writing by Parent at least one Business Day
prior to such transfer; and (ii) from the Adjustment Escrow Account or by
Parent or the Surviving Entity on behalf of Parent, in each case, pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 2.11_ shall be made by wire transfer of immediately
available funds in U.S. dollars to the account(s) designated in writing by
the Stockholder Representative at least one Business Day prior to such
transfer.

 

(h) Any payments made pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.11_ shall be treated
as an adjustment to the Total Consideration by the Parties for Tax purposes,
unless otherwise required by Tax law.

Section 2.12 _Withholding Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, Parent, First Merger Sub, Second Merger Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Entity, the Exchange Agent and their
Affiliates shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement, any amount required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under
Applicable Legal Requirements; _provided_ , that if Parent, First Merger Sub,
Second Merger Sub, any of their respective Affiliates, or any party acting on
their behalf determines that any payment to the Company Stockholders hereunder
is subject to deduction and/or withholding, then Parent shall provide notice
to the Stockholder Representative as soon as reasonably practicable after
such determination. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over
to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. Any amounts so
withheld shall be timely remitted to the applicable Governmental Entity.

 

Section 2.13 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time
after the Effective Time or the Second Effective Time, any further action is
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest
the Surviving Corporation following the First Merger and the Surviving Entity
following the Second Merger with full right, title and possession to all
assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company,
First Merger Sub

 



14

    

 and Second Merger Sub, the officers and directors or members, as applicable,
(or their designees) of the Company, First Merger Sub and Second Merger Sub
are fully authorized in the name of their respective corporations or
otherwise to take, and will take, all such lawful and necessary action, so
long as such action is not inconsistent with this Agreement.

 

Section 2.14 _Stockholder Representative Expenses_. At least three Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, the Stockholder Representative may provide to
Parent a written estimate of the aggregate amount of the fees and expenses
incurred, or that the Stockholder Representative reasonably believes in good
faith will in the future be incurred, by the Stockholder Representative on
behalf of the Company Stockholders in connection with the preparation,
negotiation and execution of this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise in its capacity as
the Stockholder Representative (such fees and expenses, the " _Stockholder
Representative Expenses_ "). On the Closing Date, Parent shall pay to the
Stockholder Representative or to such other Persons (and in such amounts) as
may be designated by the Stockholder Representative, by wire transfer to an
account or accounts designated by the Stockholder Representative in writing at
least three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, immediately available
funds in the amount of such Stockholder Representative Expenses and such
amount shall be included as a Company Transaction Cost in the Company
Transaction Costs Adjustment Amount.

 

Section 2.15 _Tax Treatment of the Mergers_. For U.S. federal income tax
purposes (and for purposes of any applicable state or local Tax that follows
the U.S. federal income tax treatment), the Parties will prepare and file all
Tax Returns consistent with the treatment of the Mergers, taken together, as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code (or

of any third party under, or give to others any rights of consent,

creation of a Lien (other than any Permitted Lien) on any of the properties or

Section 5.7 _Parent SEC Reports and Financial Statements_.

 

(a) Parent has filed all forms, reports, schedules, statements and other
documents, including any exhibits thereto, required to be filed or furnished
by Parent with the SEC under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act since
Parents incorporation to the date of this Agreement, together with any

filed prior to the date of this Agreement, the " _Parent SEC Reports_ "), and
will have filed all such forms, reports, schedules, statements and other
documents required to be filed subsequent to the date of this Agreement
through the Closing Date (the " _Additional Parent SEC Reports_ "). All
Parent SEC Reports, Additional Parent SEC Reports, any correspondence from or
to the SEC or Nasdaq (other than such correspondence in connection with the

U.S.C. § 1350 (Section 906) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect to any of
the foregoing (collectively, the " _Certifications_ ") are available on the

full without redaction. Parent has heretofore furnished to the Company true
and correct copies of all amendments and modifications that have not been
filed by Parent with the SEC to all agreements, documents and other
instruments that previously had been filed by Parent with the SEC and are
currently in effect. The Parent SEC Reports were, and the Additional Parent
SEC Reports will be, prepared in accordance with the requirements of the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may
be, and the rules and regulations thereunder. The Parent SEC Reports did not,
and the Additional Parent SEC Reports will not, at the time they were or are
filed, as the case may be, with the SEC contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances 

 



42

    

 under which they were made, not misleading. The Certifications are each true
and correct. Parent maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by
Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Each director and
executive officer of Parent has filed with the SEC on a timely basis all
statements required with respect to Parent by Section 16(a) of the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. As used in this _Section_ __ _
5.7_, the term "file" shall be broadly construed to include any manner in
which a document or information is furnished, supplied or otherwise made
available to the SEC or Nasdaq.

(b) The financial statements and notes contained or incorporated by reference
in the Parent SEC Reports fairly present, and the financial statements and
notes to be contained in or to be incorporated by reference in the Additional
Parent SEC Reports will fairly present, the financial condition and the
results of operations, changes in stockholders equity and cash flows of
Parent as at the respective dates of, and for the periods referred to, in such
financial statements, all in accordance with: (i) GAAP; and (ii) Regulation
S-X or Regulation S-K, as applicable, subject, in the case of interim
financial statements, to normal recurring year-end adjustments (the effect of
which will not, individually or in the aggregate, be material) and the
omission of notes to the extent permitted by Regulation S-X or Regulation
S-K, as applicable. Parent has no off-balance sheet arrangements that are not
disclosed in the Parent SEC Reports. No financial statements other than those
of Parent are required by GAAP to be included in the consolidated financial
statements of Parent.

Section 5.8  _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Except as set forth in
Parent SEC Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement, and except as
contemplated by this Agreement, since December 31, 2017, there has not been:
(a) any Parent Material Adverse Effect; (b) any declaration, setting aside or
payment of any dividend on, or other distribution in respect of, any of
Parents capital stock, or any purchase, redemption or other acquisition by
Parent of any of Parents capital stock or any other securities of Parent or
any options, warrants, calls or rights to acquire any such shares or other
securities; (c) any split, combination or reclassification of any of Parents
capital stock; (d) any material change by Parent in its accounting methods,
principles or practices, except as required by concurrent changes in GAAP (or

in the auditors of Parent; (f) any issuance of capital stock of Parent; (g)
any revaluation by Parent of any of its assets, including, without limitation,
any sale of assets of Parent other than in the ordinary course of business; or

would be prohibited by _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ if such action were taken on or
after the date hereof without the consent of the Stockholder Representative.

 

Section 5.9 _Litigation_. There are no Legal Proceedings pending or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, threatened in writing against or otherwise relating to
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, before any Governmental Entity: (a)
challenging or seeking to enjoining, alter or materially delay the
Transactions; or (b) that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to be material to Parent.

none of Parent, First Merger Sub or Second Merger Sub has conducted any
business activities other than activities: (a) in connection with its
organization; or (b) directed toward the accomplishment of a
business combination. Except as set forth in the Parent Organizational
Documents, there is no Contract or Order binding upon Parent, First Merger Sub
or Second Merger Sub or to which any of them is a

 



43

    

 party which has or could reasonably be expected to have the effect of
prohibiting or materially impairing any business practice of it, any
acquisition of property by it or the conduct of business by it as currently
conducted or as currently contemplated to be conducted (including, in each
case, following the Closing).

 

Section 5.11 _Parent Material Contracts_. _Schedule_ __ _ 5.11_ of the Parent
Disclosure Letter sets forth a true, correct and complete list of each
"material contract" (as such term is defined in Regulation S-K of the SEC) to
which Parent, First Merger Sub or Second Merger Sub is party (the " _Parent
Material Contracts_ "), other than any such Parent Material Contract that is
listed as an exhibit to Parents annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2018. 

Section 5.12 _Parent Listing_. The issued and outstanding Parent Units are
registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and are listed for
trading on the Nasdaq Capital Markets (" _Nasdaq_ ") under the symbol "
_GRSHU_ ". The issued and outstanding shares of Parent Class A Stock are
registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and are listed for
trading on Nasdaq under the symbol " _GRSH_ ". The issued and outstanding
Parent Warrants are registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act
and are listed for trading on Nasdaq under the symbol " _GRSHW_ ". Parent is
a member in good standing with Nasdaq. There is no action or proceeding
pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened in writing against Parent
by Nasdaq or the SEC with respect to any intention by such entity to
deregister the Parent Units, the shares of Parent Class A Stock or Parent
Warrants or terminate the listing of Parent on Nasdaq. None of Parent or any
of its Affiliates has taken any action in an attempt to terminate the
registration of the Parent Units, the Parent Class A Stock or Parent Warrants
under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 5.13 _PIPE Investment Amount_. _Exhibit H_ sets forth true, accurate
and complete copies of each of the subscription agreements (the "
_Subscription Agreements_ ") entered into by Parent with the applicable
investors named therein (collectively, the " _PIPE Investors_ "), pursuant to
which the PIPE Investors have committed to provide equity financing to Parent
in the aggregate amount of $220,000,000 (the " _PIPE Investment Amount_ ").
The PIPE Investment Amount, together with the amount in the Trust Account at
the Closing, are in the aggregate sufficient to enable Parent to: (a) pay all
cash amounts required to be paid by Parent or its Subsidiaries under or in
connection with this Agreement; and (b) pay any and all fees and expenses of
or payable by Parent with respect to the Transactions. To Parents Knowledge
with respect to each PIPE Investor, the Subscription Agreements are in full
force and effect and have not been withdrawn or terminated, or otherwise
amended or modified, in any respect, and no withdrawal,
termination, amendment or modification is contemplated by Parent. Each
Subscription Agreement is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and,
to Parents Knowledge, each PIPE Investor. The Subscription Agreements provide
that the Stockholder Representative is a third-party beneficiary thereof and
is entitled to enforce such agreements. There are no other agreements, side
letters, or arrangements between Parent and any PIPE Investor relating to
any Subscription Agreement, that could affect the obligation of the PIPE
Investors to contribute to Parent the applicable portion of the PIPE
Investment Amount set forth in the Subscription Agreements, and, as of the
date hereof, Parent does not know of any facts or circumstances that may
reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions set forth in any
Subscription Agreement not being satisfied, or the PIPE Investment Amount not
being available to Parent, on the Closing Date. No event has occurred that,
with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or
breach on the part of Parent under any material term or condition of any
Subscription Agreement and, as of the date 

 



44

    

 hereof, Parent has no reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy in
all material respects on a timely basis any term or condition of closing to be
satisfied by it contained in any Subscription Agreement. The Subscription
Agreements contain all of the conditions precedent (other than the conditions
contained in the other Transaction Agreements) to the obligations of the PIPE
Investors to contribute to Parent the applicable portion of the PIPE
Investment Amount set forth in the Subscription Agreements on the terms
therein.

Section 5.14  _Trust Account_.

(a) As of October 31, 2019, Parent had $408,585,719.03 in a trust account (the
" _Trust Account_ "), maintained and invested pursuant to that certain
Investment Management Trust Agreement (the " _Trust Agreement_ ") effective as
of September 6, 2018, by and between Parent and Continental Stock Transfer and
Trust Company, a New York corporation (" _Continental_ ") for the benefit of
its public stockholders, with such funds invested in United States Government
securities or money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7
promulgated under the Investment Company Act. Other than pursuant to the Trust
Agreement and the Subscription Agreements, the obligations of Parent under
this Agreement are not subject to any conditions regarding Parents, its
Affiliates, or any other Persons ability to obtain financing for the
consummation of the Transactions.

 

(b) The Trust Agreement has not been amended or modified and, to the Knowledge
of Parent with respect to Continental, is valid and in full force and effect
and is enforceable in accordance with its terms, except insofar as
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors rights
generally or by principles governing the availability of equitable remedies.
Parent has complied in all material respects with the terms of the Trust
Agreement and is not in breach thereof or default thereunder and there does
not exist under the Trust Agreement any event which, with the giving of
notice or the lapse of time, would constitute such a breach or default by
Parent or, to the Knowledge of Parent, the Trustee. There are no separate
Contracts, side letters or other understandings (whether written or
unwritten, express or implied): (i) between Parent and Continental that would
cause the description of the Trust Agreement in the Parent SEC Reports to be
inaccurate in any material respect; or (ii) to the Knowledge of Parent, that
would entitle any Person (other than stockholders of Parent holding Parent
Class A Stock sold in Parents initial public offering who shall have elected
to redeem their shares of Parent Class A Stock pursuant to Parents Charter
Documents) to any portion of the proceeds in the Trust Account. Prior to the
Closing, none of the funds held in the Trust Account may be released except:
(A) to pay income and franchise taxes from any interest income earned in the
Trust Account; and (B) to redeem Parent Class A Stock in accordance with the
provisions of Parents Charter Documents. There are no Legal Proceedings
pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened in writing with respect to
the Trust Account.

Section 5.15 _Taxes_.

 

(a) All material Tax Returns required to be filed by Parent have been filed
and all such Tax Returns are true, correct and complete in all material
respects.

(b) Parent has paid all material amounts of its Taxes which are due and
payable.

 



45

    

(c) Parent has complied in all material respects with all Applicable
Legal Requirements relating to withholding and remittance of all material
amounts of Taxes and all material amounts of Taxes required by Applicable
Legal Requirements to be withheld by Parent have been withheld and paid over
to the appropriate Governmental Entity.

(d) No deficiency for any material amount of Taxes has been asserted or
assessed by any Governmental Entity in writing against Parent (nor to the
Knowledge of Parent is there any), which deficiency has not been paid or
resolved. No material audit or other proceeding by any Governmental Entity is
currently pending or threatened in writing against Parent with respect to any
Taxes due from Parent.

(e) There are no Tax indemnification agreements or Tax sharing agreements
under which Parent could be liable after the Closing Date for the Tax
liability of any Person other than Parent, First Merger Sub or Second Merger
Sub, except for customary agreements or arrangements with customers, vendors,
lessors, lenders and the like or other agreements, in each case, that do not
relate primarily to Taxes.

(f) Parent has not consented to extend the time in which any material Tax may
be assessed or collected by any Governmental Entity (other than pursuant to
extensions of time to file Tax Returns obtained in the ordinary course of
business), which extension is still in effect.

(g) Parent will not be required to include any material item of income in, or
exclude any material item or deduction from, taxable income for any taxable
period beginning after the Closing Date or, in the case of any taxable period
beginning on or before and ending after the Closing Date, the portion of such
period beginning after the Closing Date, as a result of: (i) an installment
sale or open transaction disposition that occurred on or prior to the Closing
Date; (ii) any change in method of accounting on or prior to the Closing Date,
including by reason of the application of Section 481 of the Code (or any
analogous provision of state, local or foreign Tax law); or (iii) any closing
agreement pursuant to Section 7121 of the Code or any similar provision of
state, local or foreign Tax law.

 

(h) There are no liens for material amounts of Taxes (other than Permitted
Liens) upon any of Parents assets.

 

Section 5.16 _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by Parent for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement will, at the date mailed to stockholders of Parent or at the time of
the Special Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent
makes no representation, warranty or covenant with respect to: (a) statements
made or incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Proxy Statement; or (b) any projections or
forecasts included in the Proxy Statement.

 



46

    

Section 5.17 _Employees; Benefit Plans_. Other than any former officers or as
described in the Parent SEC Reports, Parent has never had any employees. Other
than reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
Parents officers and directors in connection with activities on Parents
behalf in an aggregate amount not in excess of the amount of cash held by
Parent outside of the Trust Account, Parent has no unsatisfied material
liability with respect to any employee. Parent does not currently maintain or
have any direct liability under any benefit plan, and neither the execution
and delivery of this Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements nor the
consummation of the Transactions will: (a) result in any payment (including
severance, unemployment compensation, golden parachute, bonus or otherwise)
becoming due to any director, officer or employee of Parent; or (b) result in
the acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such benefits.

Section 5.18 _Board Approval; Stockholder Vote_. The board of directors of
Parent and First Merger Sub (including any required committee or subgroup of
the board of directors of Parent or First Merger Sub, as applicable) and the
sole member of Second Merger Sub have, as of the date of this Agreement,
unanimously: (a) approved and declared the advisability of this Agreement,
the other Transaction Agreements and the consummation of the Transactions; and
(b) determined that the consummation of the Transactions is in the best
interest of, as applicable, the stockholders of Parent or First Merger Sub
(as applicable) and the sole member of Second Merger Sub. Other than the
approval of the Parent Stockholder Matters, no other corporate proceedings on
the part of Parent are necessary to approve the consummation of the
Transactions.

Section 5.19 _Title to Assets_. Subject to the restrictions on use of the
Trust Account set forth in the Trust Agreement, Parent owns good and
marketable title to, or holds a valid leasehold interest in, or a valid
license to use, all of the assets used by Parent in the operation of its
business and which are material to Parent, free and clear of any Liens (other
than Permitted Liens).

Section 5.20 _Affiliate Transactions_. Except as described in the Parent SEC
Reports, no Contract between Parent, on the one hand, and any of the present
or former directors, officers, employees, stockholders or warrant holders or
Affiliates of Parent (or an immediate family member of any of the foregoing),
on the other hand, will continue in effect following the Closing, other than
any such Contract that is not material to Parent.

 

Section 5.21 _Brokers_. Other than fees or commissions for which Parent will
be solely responsible, none of Parent, First Merger Sub, Second Merger Sub,
nor any of their respective Affiliates, including Sponsor, has any liability
or obligation to pay, or is entitled to receive, any fees or commissions to
any broker, finder or agent with respect to the Transactions.

Section 5.22 _Disclaimer of Other Warranties_. PARENT, FIRST MERGER SUB AND
SECOND MERGER SUB HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN
_ARTICLE IV_ , NONE OF THE COMPANY, ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES OR ANY OF THEIR
RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES OR REPRESENTATIVES HAS MADE, IS MAKING, OR SHALL BE

consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the Parent
Stockholder Matters shall be the only matters (other than procedural matters)
which Parent shall propose to be acted on by the Parents stockholders at the
Special Meeting. The Proxy Statement will comply as to form and substance
with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder. Parent shall file the definitive Proxy Statement with
the SEC and cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to its stockholders of
record, as of the record date to be established by the board of directors of

Statement or such other document and will provide the Company with a
reasonable opportunity to comment on such drafts and shall consider such
comments in good faith. Parent shall not file any such documents with the SEC

(E) the issuance of any stop order by the SEC; (F) any request by the SEC for
amendment of the Proxy Statement; (G) any comments from the SEC relating to

practicable; _provided_ , that prior to responding to any requests or comments
from the SEC, Parent will make available to the Company drafts of any such
response and provide the Company with a reasonable opportunity to comment
on such drafts.

(iii) If, at any time prior to the Special Meeting, there shall be discovered
any information that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the

directors or employees that should be set forth in an amendment or a
supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, then Company shall promptly inform
Parent of such information, event or circumstance.

(iv) Parent shall make all necessary filings with respect to the Transactions
under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and applicable "blue sky" laws,

Subsidiaries, in each case, reasonably requested by Parent for inclusion in
the Proxy Statement. The Company shall cause the officers and employees of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries to be reasonably available to Parent and

" _Special Meeting_ "), for the purpose of obtaining the approval of the
Parent Stockholder Matters, which meeting shall be held not more than 45 days
after the date on which Parent mails the Proxy Statement to its stockholders.
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the approval of the
Parent Stockholder Matters at the Special Meeting, including by soliciting
proxies as promptly as practicable in accordance with Applicable Legal
Requirements for the purpose of seeking the approval of the Parent Stockholder
Matters. Subject to the proviso in the following sentence, Parent shall

 withdraw, withhold, qualify or modify, or publicly propose to change,
withdraw, withhold, qualify or modify, the Parent Recommendation (a " _Change
in Recommendation_ ");  _provided_ , that the board of directors may make a
Change in Recommendation if it determines in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, that a failure to make a Change in
Recommendation would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach by the
board of directors of its fiduciary obligations to Parents stockholders under
Applicable Legal Requirements. Parent agrees that its obligation to establish
a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Special
Meeting for the purpose of seeking approval of the Parent Stockholder Matters
shall not be affected by any Change in Recommendation, and Parent agrees to
establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold
the Special Meeting and submit for the approval of its stockholders the
matters contemplated by the Proxy Statement as contemplated by this _Section_
__ _ 7.1(b)_, regardless of whether or not there shall have occurred any

in this Agreement, Parent shall be entitled to postpone or adjourn the Special
Meeting: (i) to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement
that the board of directors of Parent has determined in good faith is
required by Applicable Legal Requirements is disclosed to Parents
stockholders and for such supplement or amendment to be promptly disseminated
to Parents stockholders prior to the Special Meeting; (ii) if, as of the
time for which the Special Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in
the Proxy Statement), there are insufficient shares of Parent Class A Stock
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary
to conduct the business to be conducted at the Special Meeting; or (iii) in
order to solicit additional proxies from stockholders for purposes of
obtaining approval of the Parent Stockholder Matters;  _provided_ , that in
the event of a postponement or adjournment pursuant to clauses (i) or (ii)
above, the Special Meeting shall be reconvened as promptly as practicable
following such time as the matters described in such clauses have
been resolved.

(c) Company Stockholder Approval. The Company shall solicit the Company
Stockholder Approval via the Stockholder Consent and Joinder. In connection
therewith, as promptly as practicable, the board of directors of the Company
shall set a record date for determining the stockholders required to execute
such Stockholder Consent and Joinder. The Company shall, through its board of
directors, recommend to its stockholders that they provide the Company
Stockholder Approval and execute the Stockholder Consent and Joinder. The
Company will provide Parent with a copy of the executed Stockholder Consent
and Joinder.

of this Agreement, Parent and the Company shall (a) each prepare and file the
notification required of it under the HSR Act within 10 Business Days after

of all substantive oral communications) between each of them, any of their
Affiliates and their respective agents, representatives and advisors, on the
one hand, and any Governmental Entity, on the other hand, with respect to

covered by a directors and officers liability insurance policy of one or
more Group Companies on terms with respect to coverage, deductibles and
amounts no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date of
this Agreement for the six-year period following the Closing. Parent shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Entity to, maintain the DandO Tail in full force
and effect for its full term and cause all obligations thereunder to be
honored by the Group Companies, as applicable, and no other party shall have
any further obligation to purchase or pay for such insurance pursuant to
this  _Section_ __ _ 7.13(b)_.

(c) The rights of each DandO Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in
addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such person may have
under the Charter Documents of any Group Company, any other indemnification
arrangement, any Legal Requirement or otherwise. The obligations of Parent and
the Group Companies under this _Section_ __ _ 7.13_ shall not be terminated
or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any DandO Indemnified Party
without the consent of such DandO Indemnified Party. The provisions of this 
_Section_ __ _ 7.13_ shall survive the Closing and expressly are intended to
benefit, and are enforceable by, each of the DandO Indemnified Parties, each of
whom is an intended third-party beneficiary of this _Section_ __ _ 7.13_.

(d) If Parent or, after the Closing, any Group Company, or any of their
respective successors or assigns: (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity of such
consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or such
Group Company, as applicable, assume the obligations set forth in this 
_Section_ __ _ 7.13_.

Section 7.14 _280G Approval_. To the extent that any
"disqualified individual" (within the meaning of Section 280G(c) of the Code
and the regulations thereunder) has the right to receive any payments or
benefits that could be deemed to constitute "parachute payments" (within the
meaning of Section 280G(b)(2)(A) of the Code and the regulations thereunder),
then, the Company will: (a) no later than six days prior to the Closing Date,
solicit and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from each such
"disqualified individual" a waiver of such disqualified individuals rights
to some or all of such payments or benefits (the " _Waived 280G Benefits_ ")
so that any remaining payments and/or benefits shall not be deemed to be
"excess parachute payments" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code
and the regulations thereunder); and (b) no later than three days prior to the
Closing Date, with respect to each individual who agrees to the waiver
described in clause (a), submit to a vote of holders of the equity interests
of the Company entitled to vote on such matters, in the manner required under
Section 280G(b)(5) of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder,
along with adequate disclosure intended to satisfy such requirements
(including QandA 7 of Section 1.280G-1 of such regulations), the right of any
such "disqualified

 



63

    

 individual" to receive the Waived 280G Benefits. Prior to, and in no event
later than four days prior to soliciting such waivers and approval, the
Company shall provide drafts of such waivers and approval materials to Parent
for its reasonable review and comment, and the Company shall consider in good
faith any changes reasonably requested by Parent. No later than seven days
prior to soliciting the waivers, the Company shall provide Parent with the
calculations and related documentation to determine whether and to what extent
the vote described in this _Section_ __ _ 7.12_ is necessary in order to
avoid the imposition of Taxes under Section 4999 of the Code. Prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent evidence that a vote of the
stockholders of the Company was solicited in accordance with the foregoing and
whether the requisite number of votes of the stockholders of the Company was
obtained with respect to the Waived 280G Benefits or that the vote did not
pass and the Waived 280G Benefits will not be paid or retained.

 

Section 7.15 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) Parent will pay to the Company Stockholders (by wire transfer of
immediately available funds) any Transaction Tax Benefit, or any portion
thereof, within five (5) Business Days of filing the U.S. federal income Tax
Return for the applicable year, to the extent that any such Transaction Tax
Benefit, or any portion thereof, is realized by Parent, any Group
Company (after the Closing) or their respective Affiliates in any taxable
year ending on or prior to December 31, 2022. For this purpose, a "
_Transaction Tax Benefit_ " is, without duplication, (i) any refund actually
received (or applied as a credit) with respect to Taxes of any Group Company
for a Pre-Closing Tax Period attributable to a Transaction Tax Deduction and
any interest received thereon net of any Taxes with respect thereto and (ii)
any reduction in the liability for Taxes of Parent or any Group Company or any
of their respective Affiliates with respect to any taxable period (or portion
thereof) beginning after the Closing Date resulting from (A) the carryforward
of a net operating loss generated in the Pre-Closing Tax Period to the extent
attributable to the Transaction Tax Deductions and (B) any Transaction Tax
Deductions deductible in a taxable period beginning after the Closing Date by
reason of the vesting of any Restricted Stock Units issued, or other amounts
payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.24_ (" _Post-Closing TTDs_ ") (in each
case determined on a "with" and "without" basis), in each case which
Transaction Tax Benefit was not taken into account in the calculation of the
Tax Overpayment/Underpayment Amount. For purposes of clause (ii) of the
immediately preceding sentence, Parent, the Group Companies or any of their
respective Affiliates will be deemed to realize a Transaction Tax Benefit as a
result of a reduction in Tax liabilities in a taxable period (or portion
thereof) beginning after the Closing Date to the extent that (i) the
aggregate actual Tax liabilities of Parent, the Group Companies or any of
their respective Affiliates taking the net operating losses generated in a
Pre-Closing Tax Period and Post-Closing TTDs into account exceed (ii) the
aggregate hypothetical Tax liabilities of Parent, the Group Companies or their
respective Affiliates without taking such net operating losses and Post-
Closing TTDs into account. In connection with the foregoing, Parent agrees to
cause the Group Companies, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing
Date, to apply for a refund of estimated Tax paid (including pursuant to IRS
Form 4466 and any comparable or similar non-U.S. Return or Tax form), if
applicable, and to utilize any net operating losses from the Pre-Closing Tax
Period.

 



64

    

(b) All Tax Returns with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period that affect the
amount of any Transaction Tax Benefit shall be prepared in accordance with the
past practices of the applicable Group Company (unless otherwise required by
Legal Requirement) and shall be provided to the Stockholder Representative at
least thirty (30) days prior to filing for review and approval by the
Stockholder Representative (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed);  _provided_ that the Stockholder Representatives
review and approval rights shall be limited to any items that impact the
amount of any Transaction Tax Benefit. If Parent and the Stockholder
Representative have not agreed to the content of any such Tax Return prior to
the due date (taking into account extensions) for such Tax Return, Parent
shall be permitted to file such Tax Return without the Stockholder
Representatives consent; _provided_ that if the Independent
Expert determines that such Tax Return should have reflected a greater number
of Transaction Tax Benefits, Parents obligation to make payments to the
Company Stockholders pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.15(a)_ of this Agreement
shall be determined based on the amount of Transaction Tax Benefits that the
Independent Expert determines should have been reflected on such Tax Return.
Parent and the Company Stockholders agree that for purposes of such Tax
Returns, all Transaction Tax Deductions will be allocable to the Pre-Closing
Tax Period (or, in the case of any Post-Closing TTDs, to the first taxable
period in which such Post-Closing TTDs are deductible under applicable Law) to
the extent provided in _Section_ __ _ 7.15(c)_. With respect to each Tax
Return for a Post-Closing Tax Period, Parent agrees to provide, upon request
by the Stockholder Representative, a written calculation, along with
reasonable supporting detail, of the determination of the Transaction Tax
Benefit with respect to such Tax Return. Any dispute regarding the calculation
of the Transaction Tax Benefit shall be referred to an Independent Expert
(which may be the same or different from the Independent Expert chosen for
purposes of resolving any dispute under _Section_ __ _ 2.11_) for final
resolution.

 

(c) The Parties agree that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement or otherwise: (i) except as provided in clause (ii) of this
_Section_ __ _ 7.15(c)_, any Taxes for a Straddle Period with respect to the
Group Companies shall be apportioned between the Pre-Closing Tax Period
and the Post-Closing Tax Period based on the actual operations of such
entity, as the case may be, by a closing of the books of such entity, as if
the Closing Date were the end of a Tax year (and, for such purpose, the Tax
period of any partnership or pass-through entity, or any controlled foreign
corporation within the meaning of Section 957(a) of the Code, in which a Group
Company holds a beneficial interest shall be deemed to terminate as of the
Closing Date), and each such portion of such period shall be deemed to be a
taxable period (whether or not it is in fact a taxable period); (ii) in the
case of any Taxes imposed on a periodic basis ( _e.g_., any real property,
personal property or similar ad valorem Taxes) that are payable for a
Straddle Period, the portion of such Tax which relates to the Pre-Closing Tax
Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable
period  _multiplied_ by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
days in the taxable period ending on (and including) the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire taxable period; (iii)
any Transaction Tax Deductions (other than Post-Closing TTDs) shall be
treated as deductible in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date to the
maximum extent permitted by Tax law based on a "more likely than not" or
higher level of comfort, and it shall be assumed that neither Parent nor any
of its Affiliates (including after the Closing the Group Companies) shall have
applied the so called "next day rule" under Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) to such deductions; (iv) any Post-Closing TTDs shall be
treated as deductible in the first taxable period in which such Post-Closing
TTDs are permitted to be deducted by Tax law based on a "more likely than
not" or higher level of comfort, (v) the election under Revenue Procedure
2011-29, 2011-18 I.R.B. to apply the 70% safe harbor to any "success based
fee" as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.263(a)-5(f) incurred in
connection with the Transactions shall be made for U.S. federal income tax
purposes 

 



65

    

 (and, as applicable, for state and local income Tax purposes); and (vi)
other than as provided in clauses (iii), (iv) and (v) of this _Section_ __ _
7.15(c)_, any gain, income, deduction or loss from transactions outside the
ordinary course of business occurring on the Closing Date but after the
Closing shall be treated as occurring after the Closing Date.

 

(d) Parent agrees that it shall not make (or cause any of its Affiliates to
make) any election under Section 338 or 336(e) of the Code, or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign Tax law, with respect to the
Transactions.

(e) Parent covenants that it will file a consolidated U.S. federal income Tax
Return with the applicable Group Companies for the period starting on the day
following the Closing Date and, for U.S. federal income Tax purposes, and the
applicable Group Companies will become members of the affiliated group of
corporations of which Parent is the common parent or of which Parent is a
member on the day following the Closing Date.

 

(f) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration, excise,
recording, registration value added and other such similar Taxes and fees
(including any penalties and interest) that become payable in connection with
or by reason of the execution of this Agreement and the Transactions shall be
borne and paid by the Parent. Parent shall timely file any Tax Return or
other document with respect to such Taxes or fees (and the Stockholder
Representative and Parent shall reasonably cooperate with respect thereto as
necessary).

 

(g) On the Closing Date, the Company shall provide Parent with a certificate
on behalf of the Company, prepared in a manner consistent and in accordance
with the requirements of Treasury Regulation Sections 1.897-2(g), (h) and
1.1445-2(c)(3), certifying that no interest in the Company is, or has been
during the relevant period specified in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code,
a "U.S. real property interest" within the meaning of Section 897(c) of the
Code, and a form of notice to the Internal Revenue Service prepared in
accordance with the provisions of Treasury Regulations Section 1.897-2(h)(2);
_provided_ , that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Parents sole
remedy in the event the Company fails to deliver such certificate shall be to
make a proper withholding of Tax to the extent required by applicable Tax law.

 

(h) Each Company Stockholder shall be entitled to its Pro Rata Share of any
payments made pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 7.15(a)_, and all such payments
shall be treated as an adjustment to the Total Consideration by the Parties
for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by Tax law.

 

Section 7.16 _Seller Retained Claims_.

 

(a) Each of the Parties acknowledges that the Company and/or one or more of
the Company Subsidiaries has made the Seller Retained Claims.

(b) Parent agrees that all monetary damages that are hereafter recovered by
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in connection with the Seller
Retained Claims shall be for the sole benefit of the Company Stockholders.
Accordingly, Parent hereby agrees that, notwithstanding any other provision
contained herein: (i) prior to the Closing, the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries shall have the right to settle the Seller Retained Claims on
terms it deems acceptable, subject to Parents prior approval (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned 

 



66

    

 or delayed); and (ii) following the Closing the Stockholder Representative
shall be entitled to control the Seller Retained Claims (including any
litigation relating thereto or settlement thereof) on terms it deems
acceptable in its sole discretion and to direct counsel in connection
therewith. In the event that any amounts are received by the Surviving Entity
or one or more of the Company Subsidiaries in respect of the Seller Retained
Claims following the Closing Date (with the exception of amounts received
pursuant to representation and warranty insurance policies), Parent shall
cause such amounts (net of any Taxes with respect thereto which, in the case
of income Taxes, to the extent includable in the Taxable income of the
Surviving Entity or any of the Company Subsidiaries, shall be calculated based
on an assumed cash Tax rate of 24%) to be paid to the Stockholder
Representative for further payment to the Company Stockholders (whether by
directing the payor of any such amounts to pay such amounts directly to the
Stockholder Representative or by promptly paying over to the Stockholder
Representative any such amounts received by Parent or any of its Affiliates
(including the Surviving Entity or any of the Company Subsidiaries), or
otherwise).

(c) From and after the Closing, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Entity and the Company Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate with the
Stockholder Representative in the resolution and/or settlement of the Seller
Retained Claims (including with respect to any litigation in relation
thereto) and shall not settle, compromise or discharge any such claim (or
permit the Surviving Entity or the Company Subsidiaries to take any such
action) that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
Company Stockholders rights under this _Section_ __ _ 7.16_. Parent shall
afford to the Stockholder Representative and its counsel and other
representatives reasonable access to all of their respective properties,
books, contracts, and records, and appropriate officers and employees of the
Surviving Entity and the Company Subsidiaries, necessary or useful for the
pursuit and/or settlement of the Seller Retained Claims. Upon reasonable
request by the Stockholder Representative in writing, the Surviving Entity
shall: (i) on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, successors and assigns,
execute a customary general release with the applicable parties to the Seller
Retained Claims, their Affiliates, successors and assigns, as applicable, in
respect of such claims; and (ii) agree to the release of all or a portion of
the Indemnity Escrowed Funds (including executing any written instructions to
the escrow agent in connection with such release). Parent further agrees that
it will not agree to release (including executing any written instructions to
the escrow agent in connection with such release) the Indemnity Escrowed Funds
other than: (A) at the written direction of the Stockholder Representative or
(B) pursuant to a final order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction.

(d) Any payments made pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.16_ shall be treated
by all parties hereto as adjustments to the Final Merger Consideration for Tax
purposes, except as otherwise required by Tax law.

 

(e) All out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by the Stockholder
Representative or by Parent, the Surviving Entity or any Company Subsidiary at
the request of the Stockholder Representative in connection with or related to
the Seller Retained Claims (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt any
amount paid prior to the Closing Date or accrued as a current liability as of
the Closing Date and are reflected in the Final Closing Working Capital
Adjustment Amount) shall be paid or reimbursed to the Surviving Entity (as the
case may be) by the Stockholder Representative promptly upon receipt of the
applicable invoice related to such fees, expenses or costs.

 



67

    

Section 7.17 _Subscription Agreements_.

 

(a) Parent shall not permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or
any waiver of any provision or remedy under, or any replacements of, the
Subscription Agreements in a manner materially adverse to the Company or the
Company Stockholders. Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done,
all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by the Subscription Agreements on the terms and conditions
described therein, including maintaining in effect the Subscription Agreements
and using its commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) satisfy in all material
respects on a timely basis all conditions and covenants applicable to Parent
in the Subscription Agreements and otherwise comply with its obligations
thereunder; (ii) in the event that all conditions in the Subscription
Agreements (other than conditions that Parent or any of its Affiliates control
the satisfaction of and other than those conditions that by their nature are
to be satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied, consummate transactions
contemplated by the Subscription Agreements at or prior to Closing; and (iii)
enforce its rights under the Subscription Agreements in the event that all
conditions in the Subscription Agreements (other than conditions that Parent
or any of its Affiliates control the satisfaction of and other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) have been
satisfied, to cause the applicable PIPE Investors to contribute to Parent
the applicable portion of the PIPE Investment Amount set forth in the
Subscription Agreements at or prior to the Closing. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Parent shall give the Company or the Stockholder
Representative, prompt (and, in any event within three Business Days) written
notice: (A) of any amendment to any Subscription Agreement (together with a
copy of such amendment); (B) of any breach or default (or any event or
circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could give
rise to any breach or default) by any party to any Subscription Agreement
known to Parent; (C) of the receipt of any written notice or other written
communication from any party to any Subscription Agreement with respect to
any actual, potential or claimed expiration, lapse, withdrawal, breach,
default, termination or repudiation by any party to any Subscription Agreement
or any provisions of any Subscription Agreement; and (D) if Parent does not
expect to receive all or any portion of the PIPE Investment Amount on the
terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Subscription
Agreements. The Subscription Agreements contain all of the conditions
precedent to the obligations of the PIPE Investors to contribute to Parent
the applicable portion of the PIPE Investment Amount set forth in the
Subscription Agreements on the terms therein.

 

(b) Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the PIPE
Investors to contribute the PIPE Investment Amount at or prior to the Closing
if all conditions set forth in the applicable Subscription Agreement have been
satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing and other than conditions that Parent or any of
its Affiliates control the satisfaction of). Parent shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions required to
obtain the PIPE Investment Amount contemplated by the Subscription
Agreements, including enforcing the rights of Parent under the Subscription
Agreements.

Section 7.18  _Section_ __ _ 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall take all reasonable steps as may be required or permitted to
cause any acquisition or disposition of the Parent Class A Stock that occurs
or is deemed to occur by reason of or pursuant to the Transactions by each
individual who is or will be subject to the reporting requirements of Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to Parent to be exempt under
Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, including by taking steps in
accordance with the No-Action Letter, dated January 12, 1999, issued by the
SEC regarding such matters.

 



68

    

Section 7.19 _Board of Directors_. The Parties shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to ensure that the persons listed on _Schedule_ __ _ 7.19_
of the Company Disclosure Letter and the other persons identified by the
applicable Party (as if the Investor Rights Agreement were in effect)
following the date hereof are elected and appointed as directors of Parent
effective immediately after the Closing; _provided_ , that any such persons
not listed on _Schedule_ __ _ 7.19_ of the Company Disclosure Letter shall
be identified as promptly as practicable following the date hereof (but in no
event later than the date on which the Proxy Statement is filed with the SEC).

 

Section 7.20 _Deleveraging Amount_.

 

(a) Simultaneously with the Closing, the Company shall obtain the Existing
Term Loan Upsizing Amendment and apply the Existing Term Loan Upsizing to the
repayment of Indebtedness under the Existing Second Lien Credit Agreement.

(b) Simultaneously with the Closing: (i) Parent shall pay or cause to be paid
to the Surviving Entity the Deleveraging Amount; and (ii) immediately
thereafter, Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to pay to lenders under
the Existing Second Lien Credit Agreement an aggregate amount equal to the
Deleveraging Amount.

Section 7.21 _ITAR and NISPOM Notifications_. Prior to and after the Closing
Date Parent and the Company shall furnish each other such information and
assistance as is required for: (a) the Company to file its notice with the
State Department, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, under Section
122.4(a)(2) of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (" _ITAR_ ", and
such notice, an " _ITAR Notice_ ") within five (5) Business Days after the
Closing Date; and (b) the Company to submit a notice of changed conditions to
the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (" _DCSA_ ") under Section
1-302(g) of the NISPOM (a " _NISPOM Notice_ "). The Company shall submit an
ITAR Notice with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to the Stockholder Representative, to the
State Department, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, within five days
after the Closing Date. The Company shall submit a NISPOM Notice with respect
to the transactions contemplated hereby to DCSA on or before the Closing Date.

 

Section 7.22 _PAE-ISR Joint Venture_.

 

(a) Each of the Parties acknowledges that the Company has decided to sell all
or substantially all of the business of, or otherwise discontinue the
business conducted by, its majority-owned joint venture PAE ISR LLC (" _ISR_
"). Accordingly, notwithstanding any other provision contained herein, prior
to the Closing Date, unless otherwise agreed by Parent in writing, the
Company shall either (i) sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of the business
of ISR (through a sale of equity, assets or otherwise), and/or (ii) terminate
operations of ISR effective prior to the Closing in order to effect an
orderly liquidation of the assets of ISR. For a period of 90 days after the
Closing Date (the " _Post-Closing ISR Disposition Period_ "), the Stockholder
Representative shall have the right (at the sole cost and expense of
the Stockholder Representative) to control the

 



69

    

 sale or other disposition of any assets remaining after such sale or the
termination of operation of ISR (the " _Post-Closing ISR Disposition_ "). If,
prior to the Closing Date, the Company and/or the Stockholder Representative
determine that the Post-Closing ISR Disposition will be necessary, the Company
shall deliver to Parent, no later than three Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, a good faith and appropriately detailed description of (A) any
outstanding assets of ISR that are required to be disposed of during the Post-
Closing ISR Disposition Period and (B) the proposal to dispose of such
outstanding assets during the Post-Closing ISR Disposition Period (the "
_Post-Closing ISR Disposition Plan_ "). In the event that such assets have not
been sold or otherwise transferred on or prior to the expiration of the Post-
Closing ISR Disposition Period, the Surviving Entity shall have no further
obligation to the Stockholder Representative or the Company Stockholders with
respect thereto and may sell or otherwise dispose of such remaining assets in
its sole discretion. During the Post-Closing ISR Disposition Period, the
Surviving Entity shall reasonably cooperate with the Stockholder
Representative to sell any such assets and shall pay the proceeds of such sale
(net of (i) any Taxes with respect thereto (which, in the case of income
Taxes, shall be calculated based on an assumed cash Tax rate of 24% on the
aggregate amount of gain (and net of loss) recognized as a result of sale of
ISR assets during the ISR Disposition Period) or other out of pocket expenses
of the Surviving Entity or ISR payable in connection with such sale or (ii)
any other liabilities of ISR (other than any intercompany payables or other
amounts owed to the Company or its Subsidiaries), except to the extent any
such Taxes, expenses or other liabilities are accrued on the Closing Balance
Sheet) to the Stockholder Representative for further payment to the Company
Stockholders. To the extent that any liability of ISR has not been satisfied
on or prior to the Closing Date (other than any intercompany payables or other
amounts owed to the Company or its Subsidiaries), a current liability shall
be accrued on the Adjustment Statement in the calculation of Closing Working
Capital whether or not required in accordance with GAAP and the Surviving
Entity shall cause ISR to satisfy such liability or obligation up to the
amount accrued thereon.

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, to the extent the sale of the ISR business is
sold in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.22(a)(i)_ in a transaction
structured as a sale of the equity interests of ISR, unless otherwise agreed
by Parent in writing, the Company shall:

 

(i) Use commercially reasonable efforts to cause ISR to file at the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office a written request for abandonment or withdrawal
of the trademark application for "PAE ISR" (U.S. Serial No. 88,232,125) filed
on December 17, 2018;

 

(ii) provide to Parent: (A) copies of such filings set forth above in 
_Section_ __ _ 7.22(b)(i)_; and (B) proof that such filings had been received
by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or other applicable Governmental
Entity; and

 

(iii) cause PAE Applied Technologies LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
(" _PAE AT_ "), to formally notify ISR (by way of written notice pursuant to
Section 14.5 of the Third Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company
Operating Agreement, dated February 9, 2017, by and among PAE AT, ISR and the
other parties thereto (the " _ISR Operating Agreement_ ")) of ISRs
obligation to promptly cease using "PAE" in the conduct of ISRs business.

 



70

    

(c) To the extent that any liability or obligation of ISR has not
been included as a current liability in the Final Closing Working Capital
Adjustment Amount or otherwise fully satisfied or otherwise provided for on or
prior to the Closing Date, whether such liability or obligation is known as of
the Closing Date or arises thereafter, the Company Stockholders, severally
and not jointly, shall, for a period of 12 months following the Closing Date
(the " _ISR Indemnification Period_ "), assume and remain solely liable for,
and neither Parent, the Surviving Entity nor any of the Company Subsidiaries
shall have any liability related to, any and all Losses (the " _ISR Losses_ ")
up to an aggregate maximum amount of $10,000,000 (the " _ISR Indemnity Cap_ ")
to the extent related to, arising from or attributable to the business of ISR
or the operation thereof conducted prior to the Closing Date or the Post-
Closing ISR Disposition. In such event and during the ISR Indemnification
Period, the Company Stockholders, severally and not jointly, shall indemnify,
reimburse, compensate and hold harmless Parent, the Surviving Entity and/or
the Company Subsidiaries, as applicable, from and against all ISR Losses up to
the ISR Indemnity Cap;  _provided_ , that Parent, the Surviving Entity and
the Company Subsidiaries shall be entitled to indemnification under this
_Section_ __ _ 7.22(c)_ solely: (i) with respect to any claim made under
this  _Section_ __ _ 7.22(c)_ that is finally and fully resolved prior to
the Final Adjustment Settlement Date, from the Adjustment Escrow Funds (to be
paid in accordance with the Escrow Agreement on the same date any amounts are
paid from the Adjustment Escrow Funds under _Section 2.11(f)_) to the extent
funds are available therefor after paying any amount to be paid to Parent in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.11(f)(i)(A)_; or (ii)(A) to the extent any
claim under this _Section_ __ _ 7.22(c)_ is not finally and fully resolved
prior to, or is first made on or after, the Final Adjustment Settlement Date;
or (B) with respect to any claim made under this  _Section_ __ _ 7.22(c)_
that is finally and fully resolved prior to the Final Adjustment Settlement
Date, to the extent the amount that remains payable in respect of such claim
exceeds the remaining Adjustment Escrow Funds (after taking into account any
Adjustment Escrow Funds payable to Buyer under _Section_ __ _ 2.11(f)_ and
clause (i) of this proviso), then in each case under this clause (ii), from
proceeds actually received by the Company Stockholders from the sale or other
disposition of Parent Class A Stock received hereunder, promptly following the
receipt of such proceeds from such sale or other disposition. For the
avoidance of doubt: (1) in the event that Parent, the Surviving Entity or any
Company Subsidiary makes a claim for indemnification pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 7.22(c)_ during the ISR Indemnification Period, such claim
shall be preserved until its full and final resolution and Parent, the
Surviving Entity or such Company Subsidiary, as applicable, shall remain
entitled to recover any related ISR Losses hereunder (subject to the ISR
Indemnity Cap) notwithstanding the expiration of the ISR Indemnification
Period; and (2) in no event shall any Adjustment Escrow Funds be payable in
respect of any claim under this _Section_ __ _ 7.22(c)_ that is not finally

_GENERAL PROVISIONS _

Section 11.1 _Stockholder Representative_.

 

(a) The Stockholder Representative shall act as the representative of the
Company Stockholders in respect of all matters arising under this Agreement
or the Transaction Agreements, and shall be authorized to act, or refrain from
acting, with respect to any actions to be taken by or on behalf of any Company
Stockholder or the Stockholder Representative, including to enforce any
rights granted to any Company Stockholder hereunder, in each case as the

 



78

    

 Stockholder Representative believes is necessary or appropriate under this
Agreement and the Transaction Agreements, for and on behalf of the Company
Stockholders. The Company Stockholders shall be bound by all such actions
taken by the Stockholder Representative and no Company Stockholder shall be
permitted to take any such actions. The Stockholder Representative is serving
as the Stockholder Representative solely for purposes of administrative
convenience, and is not personally liable (except in its capacity as a Company
Stockholder hereunder) for any of the obligations of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of Company Stockholders hereunder, and Parent (on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates) agrees that it will not look to the
Stockholder Representative or the underlying assets of the Stockholder
Representative for the satisfaction of any obligations of the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries or any of the Company Stockholders. The Stockholder
Representative shall not be liable for any error of judgment, or any action
taken, suffered or omitted to be taken, in connection with the performance by
the Stockholder Representative of the Stockholder Representatives duties or
the exercise by the Stockholder Representative of the Stockholder
Representatives rights and remedies under this Agreement or any Transaction
Agreement, except in the case of its bad faith or willful misconduct. No bond
shall be required of the Stockholder Representative. The Stockholder
Representative may consult with legal counsel, independent public accountants
and other experts selected by it and shall not be liable for any action taken
or omitted to be taken in good faith by it in accordance with the advice of
such counsel, accountants or experts. The Stockholder Representative shall not
have any duty to ascertain or to inquire as to the performance or observance
of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement or any
Transaction Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Stockholder Representative shall have the full power and authority to
interpret all the terms and provisions of this Agreement and the Transaction
Agreements, and to consent to any amendment hereof or thereof on behalf of all
Company Stockholders and their respective successors. Parent shall be entitled
to rely on all statements, representations, decisions of, and actions taken
or omitted to be taken by, the Stockholder Representative relating to this
Agreement or any Transaction Agreement.

(b) The Company Stockholders will indemnify and hold harmless the Stockholder
Representative from and against any and all Losses arising out of or in
connection with the Stockholder Representatives execution and performance of
this Agreement and the Transaction Agreement, in each case as such Loss is
suffered or incurred; _provided_ , that in the event that any such Loss is
finally adjudicated to have been directly caused by the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the Stockholder Representative, the Stockholder
Representative will reimburse the Company Stockholders the amount of such
indemnified Loss to the extent attributable to such gross negligence or
willful misconduct. The Stockholder Representative shall be entitled
to reimbursement by the Company Stockholders from funds paid to it under
_Section_ __ _ 2.14_, released from the Adjustment Escrow Account for the
benefit of the Company Stockholders and/or otherwise received by it in its
capacity as the Stockholder Representative pursuant to or in connection with
this Agreement (including for the benefit of the Company Stockholders), for
all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances (including fees and
disbursements of its counsel, experts and other agents and consultants)
incurred by the Stockholder Representative in such capacity. In the event that
the Stockholder Representative determines, in its sole and absolute
discretion, that the funds paid to the Stockholder Representative pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.14_ or otherwise exceed the Stockholder Representative
Expenses, the Stockholder Representative shall pay such excess amount to the
Company Stockholders (pro rata in accordance with the number of shares of
Company Common Stock held by each of them immediately prior to the Effective
Time)

 



79

    

 as an addition to the Final Merger Consideration; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement, in no event shall such excess amount become payable to Parent or
the Surviving Entity. In no event will the Stockholder Representative be
required to advance its own funds on behalf of the Company Stockholders or
otherwise. The Company Stockholders acknowledge and agree that the foregoing
indemnities will survive the resignation or removal of the Stockholder
Representative or the termination of this Agreement.

 

(c) The Stockholder Representative may resign at any time by giving 30 days
notice to Parent and the Company Stockholders; _provided_ , _however_ , in
the event of the resignation or removal of the Stockholder Representative, a
new Stockholder Representative (who shall be reasonably acceptable to Parent)
shall be appointed by the vote or written consent of the Company Stockholders
who held of a majority of the Company Common Stock of the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

subsidiaries of such entity. Reference to the subsidiaries of an entity shall
be deemed to include all direct and indirect subsidiaries of such entity. The
word "or" shall be disjunctive but not exclusive. When calculating the period
of time before which, within which or following which any act is to be
done or step taken pursuant to this Agreement, the date that is the reference
date in calculating such period shall be excluded and if the last day of such
period is a non-Business Day, the period in question shall end on the next
succeeding Business Day. References to a particular statute or regulation
including all rules and regulations thereunder and any predecessor or
successor statute, rule, or regulation, in each case as amended or otherwise

Section 11.4 _Counterparts; Electronic Delivery_. This Agreement, the
Transaction Agreements and each other document executed in connection with
the Transactions, and the consummation thereof, may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same document and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties, it being understood that
all Parties need not sign the same counterpart. Delivery by electronic
transmission to counsel for the other Parties of a counterpart executed by a
Party shall be deemed to meet the requirements of the previous sentence.

Section 11.5 _Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement,
the other Transaction Agreements and any other documents and instruments and
agreements among the Parties as contemplated by or referred to herein,
including the Exhibits and Schedules hereto: (a) constitute the entire
agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof; and (b) other
than the rights, at and after the Effective Time, of Persons pursuant to the
provisions of _Section_ __ _ 7.13_ and _Section_ __ _ 11.15_ (which will be
for the benefit of the Persons set forth therein), are not intended to confer
upon any other Person other than the Parties any rights or remedies.

Section 11.6 _Severability_. In the event that any term, provision, covenant
or restriction of this Agreement, or the application thereof, is held to be
illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or future Legal
Requirement: (a) such provision will be fully severable; (b) this Agreement
will be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provision had never comprised a part hereof; (c) the remaining provisions of
this Agreement will remain in full force and effect and will not be affected
by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or by its severance
herefrom; and (d) in lieu of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision,
there will be added automatically as a part of this Agreement a legal, valid
and enforceable provision as similar in terms of such illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provision as may be possible.

Section 11.7  _Other Remedies; Specific Performance_. Except as otherwise
provided herein, prior to the Closing, any and all remedies herein expressly
conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any
other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such Party, and the
exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any
other remedy. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that each Party shall be entitled to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court of the United States
or any state having jurisdiction and immediate injunctive relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of
money damages as a remedy and without bond or other security being required,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law
or in equity. Each of the Parties hereby acknowledges and agrees that it may
be difficult to prove damages with reasonable certainty, that it may be
difficult to procure suitable substitute performance, and that injunctive
relief and/or specific performance will not cause an undue hardship to the
Parties. Each of the Parties hereby further acknowledges that the existence of
any other remedy contemplated by this Agreement does not diminish the
availability of specific performance of the obligations hereunder or any other
injunctive relief. Each Party hereby further agrees that in the event of any
action by any other party for specific performance or injunctive relief, it
will not assert that a remedy at law or other remedy would be adequate or that
specific performance or injunctive relief in respect of such breach or
violation should not be available on the grounds that money damages are
adequate or any other grounds. Parent acknowledges and agrees that the
Stockholder Representative shall be entitled to bring an action for specific
enforcement to cause Parent to seek to enforce the provisions of the
Subscription Agreements to the fullest extent permissible pursuant to such
Subscription Agreements as if it were a party thereto.

 



83

    

Section 11.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and the consummation the
Transactions, and any action, suit, dispute, controversy or claim arising out
of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, or the validity,
interpretation, breach or termination of this Agreement and the consummation
of the Transactions, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the internal law of the State of Delaware regardless of the law that might
otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law thereof.

 

Section 11.9 _Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 

(a) Except as provided in _Sections 2.11(d)_ and _7.15_ , each of the Parties
irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts of
the State of Delaware or the federal courts located in the State of Delaware
in connection with any matter based upon or arising out of this Agreement, the
other Transaction Agreements and the consummation of the Transactions, agrees
that process may be served upon them in any manner authorized by the laws of
the State of Delaware for such Person and waives and covenants not to assert
or plead any objection which they might otherwise have to such manner of
service of process. Each Party and any Person asserting rights as a third-
party beneficiary may do so only if he, she or it hereby waives, and shall not
assert as a defense in any legal dispute, that: (i) such Person is not
personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named courts for any
reason; (ii) such Legal Proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable
in such court; (iii) such Persons property is exempt or immune from
execution; (iv) such Legal Proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum; or
(v) the venue of such Legal Proceeding is improper. Each Party and any Person
asserting rights as a third-party beneficiary hereby agrees not to commence
or prosecute any such action, claim, cause of action or suit other than before
one of the above-named courts, nor to make any motion or take any other
action seeking or intending to cause the transfer or removal of any such
action, claim, cause of action or suit to any court other than one of the
above-named courts, whether on the grounds of inconvenient forum or
otherwise. Each Party hereby consents to service of process in any such
proceeding in any manner permitted by Delaware law, and further consents to
service of process by nationally recognized overnight courier service
guaranteeing overnight delivery, or by registered or certified mail, return
receipt requested, at its address specified pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 11.2_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing in this  _Section_ __ _ 11.9_, any Party may
commence any action, claim, cause of action or suit in a court other than the
above-named courts solely for the purpose of enforcing an order or
judgment issued by one of the above-named courts.

(b) TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW WHICH CANNOT BE WAIVED,
EACH OF THE PARTIES AND ANY PERSON ASSERTING RIGHTS AS A THIRD-PARTY
BENEFICIARY MAY DO SO ONLY IF HE, SHE OR IT IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY ON ANY CLAIMS OR COUNTERCLAIMS ASSERTED IN
ANY LEGAL DISPUTE RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, EACH OTHER TRANSACTION
AGREEMENTS AND THE CONSUMMATION OF THE TRANSACTIONS, AND FOR ANY COUNTERCLAIM
RELATING THERETO, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING. IF
THE SUBJECT MATTER OF ANY SUCH LEGAL DISPUTE IS ONE IN WHICH THE WAIVER OF
JURY TRIAL IS PROHIBITED, NO PARTY NOR ANY PERSON ASSERTING RIGHTS AS A THIRD-
PARTY BENEFICIARY SHALL ASSERT IN SUCH LEGAL DISPUTE A NONCOMPULSORY
COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER
TRANSACTION AGREEMENTS AND

 



84

    

 THE CONSUMMATION OF THE TRANSACTIONS. FURTHERMORE, NO PARTY NOR ANY PERSON
ASSERTING RIGHTS AS A THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY SHALL SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE ANY
SUCH LEGAL DISPUTE WITH A SEPARATE ACTION OR OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDING IN WHICH
A JURY TRIAL CANNOT BE WAIVED.

Section 11.10  _Rules of Construction_. Each of the Parties agrees that it
has been represented by independent counsel of its choice during the
negotiation and execution of this Agreement and each Party hereto and its
counsel cooperated in the drafting and preparation of this Agreement and the
documents referred to herein and, therefore, waive the application of any law,
regulation, holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an
agreement or other document will be construed against the Party drafting such
agreement or document.

Section 11.11 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, whether or not the Transactions are consummated, each Party will
pay its own costs and expenses incurred in anticipation of, relating to and in
connection with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the
Transaction Agreements and the consummation of the Transactions.

Section 11.12 _Assignment_. No Party may assign, directly or indirectly,
including by operation of law, either this Agreement or any of its rights,
interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval of the
other Parties. Subject to the first sentence of this  _Section_ __ _ 11.12_,
this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the
Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

 

Section 11.13 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the Parties at any
time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
Parties.

Section 11.14 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing, Parent
(on behalf of itself, First Merger Sub and Second Merger Sub), on the one
hand, and the Stockholder Representative (on behalf of itself, the Company and
the Company Stockholders) may, to the extent not prohibited by Applicable
Legal Requirements: (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other Party; (b) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties made to the other Party contained herein or
in any document delivered pursuant hereto; and (c) waive compliance with any
of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such Party contained
herein. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver
shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf
of such Party. Delay in exercising any right under this Agreement shall not
constitute a waiver of such right. In the event any provision of any of the
other Transaction Agreement in any way conflicts with the provisions of this
Agreement (except where a provision therein expressly provides that it is
intended to take precedence over this Agreement), this Agreement shall
control.

 

Section 11.15 _No Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed or
implied in this Agreement, this Agreement may only be enforced against, and
any Legal Proceeding for breach of this Agreement may only be made against,
the entities that are expressly identified herein as Parties to this
Agreement, and no Related Party of a Party shall have any liability for any
liabilities or obligations of the Parties for any Legal Proceeding (whether in
tort, contract or otherwise) for breach of this Agreement or in respect of any
oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith. No
Party shall have any right of recovery in respect hereof

 



85

    

 against any Related Party of a Party and no personal liability shall attach
to any Related Party of a Party through such Party, whether by or through
attempted piercing of the corporate veil, by the enforcement of any judgment,
fine or penalty or by virtue of any Legal Requirement or otherwise. The
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 11.15_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and enforceable by the Related Parties of the Parties and each such
Person shall be a third-party beneficiary of this _Section_ __ _ 11.15_. This
_Section_ __ _ 11.15_ shall be binding on all successors and assigns
of Parties.

Section 11.16 _Legal Representation_. Parent hereby agrees on behalf of its
directors, members, partners, officers, employees and Affiliates (including
after the Closing, the Company), and each of their respective successors and
assigns (all such parties, the " _Waiving Parties_ "), that Latham and Watkins
LLP (or any successor) may represent the Company Stockholders or any of their
respective directors, members, partners, officers, employees or Affiliates
(other than the Company) (collectively, the " _Platinum Group_ "), in each
case, in connection with any Legal Proceeding or obligation arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, any Transaction Agreement or the Transactions,
notwithstanding its representation (or any continued representation) of the
Group Companies or other Waiving Parties, and each of Parent and the Company
on behalf of itself and the Waiving Parties hereby consents thereto and
irrevocably waives (and will not assert) any conflict of interest, breach of
duty or any other objection arising therefrom or relating thereto. Parent and
the Company acknowledge that the foregoing provision applies whether or not
Latham and Watkins LLP provides legal services to any Group Companies after the
Closing Date. Each of Parent and the Company, for itself and the Waiving
Parties, hereby further irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that all
communications, written or oral, between any Group Company or any member of
the Platinum Group and its counsel, including Latham and Watkins LLP, made
in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and
performance under, or any dispute or Legal Proceeding arising out of or
relating to, this Agreement, any Transaction Agreements or the Transactions,
or any matter relating to any of the foregoing, are privileged communications
that do not pass to the Company notwithstanding the Mergers, and instead
survive, remain with and are controlled by the Platinum Group (the "
_Privileged Communications_ "), without any waiver thereof. Parent and the
Company, together with any of their respective Affiliates, Subsidiaries,
successors or assigns, agree that no Person may use or rely on any of the
Privileged Communications, whether located in the records or email server of
the Company or otherwise (including in the knowledge or the officers and
employees of the Company), in any Legal Proceeding against or involving any of
the Parties after the Closing, and Parent and the Company agree not to assert
that any privilege has been waived as to the Privileged Communications,
whether located in the records or email server of the Company or otherwise
(including in the knowledge of the officers and employees of the Company).

 

Section 11.17 _Disclosure Letters and Exhibits_. The Company Disclosure Letter
and Parent Disclosure Letter shall each be arranged in separate parts
corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections and subsections in this
Agreement, and the information disclosed in any numbered or lettered part
shall be deemed to relate to and to qualify only the particular provision set
forth in the corresponding numbered or lettered Section or subsection of this
Agreement, except to the extent that: (a) such information is cross-referenced
in another part of the Company Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter,
as applicable; or (b) it is reasonably apparent on the face of the disclosure
(without any independent knowledge on the part of the reader regarding the
matter disclosed) that such information qualifies another provision in this
Agreement. The specification of any dollar amount in the representations and
warranties contained in this

 



86

    

 Agreement or the inclusion of any specific item in the Company Disclosure
Letter and Parent Disclosure Letter is not intended to imply that such amounts
(or higher or lower amounts) are or are not material, and no Party shall use
the fact of the setting of such amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any
such item in the Company Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter in any
dispute or controversy between the Parties as to whether any obligation,
item, or matter not described herein or included in Company Disclosure Letter
or the Parent Disclosure Letter is or is not material for purposes of this
Agreement. The inclusion of any item in the Company Disclosure Letter or
Parent Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed to constitute an acknowledgment
by the Company or Parent, as applicable, that the matter is required to be
disclosed by the terms of this Agreement, nor shall such disclosure be deemed
(a) an admission of any breach or violation of any Contract or Legal
Requirement, (b) an admission of any liability or obligation to any third
party, or (c) to establish a standard of materiality. The disclosure of any
items or information that is not required by this Agreement to be so included
is solely for informational purposes and the convenience of Parent, First
Merger Sub and Second Merger Sub or the Company, as applicable. In addition,
under no circumstances shall the disclosure of any matter in this Company
Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter, where a representation or
warranty of the Company or Parent, as applicable, is limited or qualified by
the materiality of the matters to which the representation or warranty
is given or by Material Adverse Effect, imply that any other undisclosed
matter having a greater value or other significance is material or would have
a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor Parent shall be prejudiced
in any manner whatsoever, and no presumptions shall be created, by virtue of
the disclosure of any matter in the Company Disclosure Letter or Parent
Disclosure Letter, as applicable, which otherwise is not required to be
disclosed by this Agreement.
