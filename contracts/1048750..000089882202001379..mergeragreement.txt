Exchange Agent to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any holders of FBR
Asset Shares, FBR Group Class A Common Shares or FBR Group Class B Common Shares

       (h)    WITHHOLDING RIGHTS. The Exchange Agent or the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the FBR Asset Merger
Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to Section 1.8(e) of this Agreement to
any holder of FBR Asset Shares such amounts as the Exchange Agent or Newco is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under
the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent or the Surviving Corporation,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of FBR Asset Shares in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent or the Surviving
Corporation.

Time, each option granted by FBR Asset to purchase FBR Asset Shares ("FBR Asset
Stock Option") which is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior thereto
shall cease to represent a right to acquire FBR Asset Shares and shall be
converted automatically into an option to purchase Newco Class A Common Shares
in an amount and at an exercise price determined as provided below (and shall
otherwise remain subject to the terms of the FBR Asset stock option plan
pursuant to which such option has been issued and the agreement evidencing such
grant thereunder):

                (i)   The number of Newco Class A Common Shares to be subject to
       the new option shall be equal to the product of the number of FBR Asset
       Shares subject to the original option and 3.65; provided, however, that
       any fractional Newco Class A Common Shares resulting from such
       multiplication shall be rounded to the nearest whole share; and

                (ii)  The exercise price per Newco Class A Common Share under
       the new option shall be equal to the exercise price per FBR Asset Share
       under the original option divided by 3.65; provided, however, that such
       exercise price shall be rounded down to the nearest whole cent.

The adjustment provided herein with respect to any options which are "incentive
stock options" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code) shall be and is intended
to be effected in a manner which is consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code.

       (b) At the Effective Time, each option granted by FBR Group to purchase
FBR Group Class A Common Shares ("FBR Group Stock Option") which is outstanding
and unexercised immediately prior thereto shall cease to represent a right to
acquire FBR Group Class A Common Shares and shall be converted automatically
into an option to purchase a number of Newco Class A Common Shares equal to the
number of FBR Group Class A Common Shares subject to such option immediately
prior to the Effective Time at an exercise price per Newco Class A Common Share
equal to the exercise price per FBR Group Class A Common Share in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time (and shall otherwise be subject to the
terms of the FBR Group stock option plan pursuant to which such option has been
issued and the agreement evidencing such grant thereunder). The adjustment
provided herein with respect to any FBR Group Stock Options which are "incentive
stock options" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code) shall be and is intended
to be effected in a manner which is consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code.

Material Adverse Effect. The term "FBR Asset Material Adverse Effect" means any

expected to be materially adverse to (i) the business, results of operations or

under the Exchange Act with respect to a Competing Transaction or (ii) making
any disclosure to the FBR Asset Shareholders, if, in the good faith judgment of
the FBR Asset Board or the FBR Asset Special Committee, after receiving advice
of outside legal counsel, failure to disclose would be reasonably likely to
constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to FBR Asset or the FBR Asset
Shareholders under applicable law (including a duty of candor) or otherwise be a
violation of any applicable law.

       (b)   Except as set forth in this Section 4.3(b), neither the FBR Asset
Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify its recommendation
that the FBR Asset Shareholders approve this Agreement, or (ii) approve or
recommend, or authorize or cause FBR Asset to enter into any agreement or
letter of intent with respect to, any Competing Transaction (other than a
confidentiality agreement on the terms described in Section 4.3(a)).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the FBR Asset Special Meeting (as
defined in Section 4.7(d) of this Agreement), after consultation with the FBR
Asset Special Committee's outside legal counsel and independent financial
advisor, the FBR Asset Special Committee may withdraw or modify its
recommendation that the FBR Asset Shareholders approve this Agreement in
connection with FBR Asset's receipt of a Superior Proposal, and the FBR Asset
Board may withdraw or modify its recommendation that the FBR Asset
Shareholders approve this Agreement, and may authorize and cause FBR Asset to
enter into an agreement with respect to, or approve or recommend, a Superior
Proposal; provided, however, that FBR Asset shall, prior to or concurrently with
the execution of any such agreement, terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 6.1(c) and pay, or cause to be paid, to FBR Group the amounts required
by Section 6.3(a).

       (c)   FBR Group shall not (whether directly or indirectly through
advisors, agents or other intermediaries), and shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause its officers, directors, employees, affiliates,
agents and representatives not to encourage, solicit, participate in or initiate
discussions or negotiations with, or provide any information or offer access to
the properties, books or records of FBR Group, to, any Person or group (other
than FBR Asset or any designees of FBR Asset) concerning any Competing
Transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, FBR Group may furnish information
and access, in each case only in response to an unsolicited written proposal
that constitutes, or that the FBR Group Board or FBR Group Special Committee,
after consultation with its financial advisors, determines is reasonably likely
to lead to, a Superior Proposal (provided that FBR Group shall first enter into
a confidentiality agreement with such third party on terms no less favorable to
FBR Group than the terms of the confidentiality agreement between FBR Asset and
FBR Group) and may thereafter participate in discussions and negotiate with
the Person or group making such proposal. FBR Group shall provide a copy of such
written proposal (which shall identify the party making such proposal) and any
amendments thereto to FBR Asset within one business day after receipt thereof
and, thereafter, shall keep FBR Asset promptly advised of material developments
with respect thereto; provided, however, that, nothing contained in this
Section 4.3(c) shall prevent FBR Group, the FBR Group Board or the FBR Group
Special Committee from (i) taking, and disclosing to the FBR Group Shareholders,
a position complying with Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the
Exchange Act with respect to a Competing Transaction or (ii) making any
disclosure to the FBR Group Shareholders, if, in the good faith judgment of the
FBR Group Board or the FBR Group Special Committee, after receiving advice of
outside legal counsel, failure to disclose would be reasonably likely to
constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to FBR Group or the FBR Group
Shareholders under applicable law (including a duty of candor) or otherwise be a
violation of any applicable law.

       (d)   Except as set forth in this Section 4.3(d), neither the FBR Group
Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify its recommendation
that the FBR Group Shareholders approve this Agreement or (ii) approve or
recommend, or authorize or cause FBR Group to enter into any agreement or
letter of intent with respect to, any Competing Transaction (other than a
confidentiality agreement on the terms described in Section 4.3(c)).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the FBR Group Special Meeting (as
defined in Section 4.7(d) of this Agreement), after consultation with the FBR
Group Special Committee's outside legal counsel and independent financial
advisor, the FBR Group Special Committee may withdraw or modify its
recommendation that the FBR Group Shareholders approve this Agreement, and the
FBR Group Board may withdraw or modify its recommendation that the FBR Group
Shareholders approve this Agreement in connection with FBR Group's receipt of a
Superior Proposal, and may authorize and cause FBR Group to enter into an
agreement with
                                       30

respect to, or approve or recommend, a Superior Proposal; provided, however,
that FBR Group shall, prior to or concurrently with the earliest of (x) the
withdrawal or modification of the FBR Group Board's recommendation that the FBR
Group Shareholders approve this Agreement and (y) the execution of any such
agreement, terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.1(e) and pay, or cause
to be paid, to FBR Asset the amounts required by Section 6.3(b).

       (e)   For purposes of this Agreement:

           (i) "Competing Transaction" shall mean any of the following with
respect to FBR Asset or FBR Group, as applicable, or any material subsidiary
thereof (other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including
all schedules and exhibits attached hereto or referred to herein)):  any tender
offer or exchange offer for, or any other proposal for the acquisition of a
substantial equity interest in, or of a substantial portion of the assets of,
or any merger, consolidation or other business combination or similar
transaction with, FBR Asset or FBR Group, as applicable or any of its material
subsidiaries.

           (ii)  "Superior Proposal" shall mean any bona fide proposal relating
to a Competing Transaction which is on terms which the FBR Asset Board or FBR
Asset Special Committee or the FBR Group Board or FBR Group Special Committee,
as applicable, determines in its good faith judgment, after consulting with an
independent financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, and taking
into account, among other things, all legal, financial, regulatory and other
aspects of the proposal and the party making the proposal, (i) to be more
favorable to the FBR Asset Shareholders or the FBR Group Shareholders, as
applicable, than the Mergers and (ii) is reasonably capable of being
consummated.

      Section 4.4  ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS; REASONABLE EFFORTS. (a) Subject to the
terms and conditions herein provided, each of the parties hereto agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and
to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) contesting any legal
proceeding challenging the Mergers and (ii) the execution of any additional
instruments, including the Articles of Merger, necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each party hereto agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Effective Time to occur as soon as practicable after the shareholder
votes with respect to the Mergers. In case at any time after the Effective Time
any further action is necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the
proper officers and directors of each party hereto shall take all such necessary
action. FBR Group, Newco and FBR Asset each will use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain consents, approvals or waivers of all third parties and
Regulatory Entities necessary, proper or advisable for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided that, subject to Section
4.4 of the FBR Group Disclosure Schedule, nothing contained herein shall require
FBR Group or Newco to agree to hold separate or to divest or dispose of any of
its or FBR Asset's businesses, properties or assets or cease engaging in any
business or otherwise take any action which, individually or in the aggregate,
could reasonably be expected to impair the ability of

                                        31
<page>

Newco in any material respect to own and operate the respective assets and
businesses of its subsidiaries, FBR Group and FBR Asset, after giving effect to
the Mergers.

       (b)  The parties hereto agree that they will consult with each other with
respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations
of all Regulatory Entities and other third parties necessary or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party will
keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

       (c)  Subject to applicable laws governing the exchange of information,
each of FBR Group and FBR Asset will, upon request, furnish the other party with
all information concerning itself, its subsidiaries, directors, officers and
shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable
in connection with any filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of
such other party or any of its subsidiaries to any third party or Regulatory
Entity.

       (d) FBR Group and FBR Asset shall promptly advise each other upon

with each other and give each other reasonable advance notice before issuing any
press release or otherwise making any public statements with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Mergers. Each party hereto shall
incorporate in the press release or other public statement such information as
shall reasonably be requested to be included therein by the other party hereto.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party hereto may, without the prior
consent of the other party, issue any press release or make any public
announcement that may be required by law or the rules or requirements of any
Regulatory Entity, if it has used its commercially reasonable efforts to consult
with the other party but has been unable to do so in a timely manner. The
parties agree that the initial press release to be issued with respect to the
Mergers shall be in the form heretofore agreed to by the parties.

      Section 4.6  INDEMNIFICATION; DIRECTORS' AND OFFICERS' INSURANCE. (a) From
and after the Effective Time, Newco shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
the officers, directors and employees of FBR Asset and FBR Group (the
"Indemnified Parties") against all losses, expenses, claims, damages or
liabilities (i) arising out of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or arising as a result thereof or (ii) otherwise arising prior to the Effective
Time, in each case to the fullest extent permitted or required under (A)
applicable law, (B)any indemnification agreements between FBR Asset or FBR Group
and any such person and (C) FBR Asset's or FBR Group's Articles of Incorporation
and Bylaws as in effect as of the date hereof. Newco agrees to maintain in
effect for not less than six years after the Closing Date coverage no less
favorable than the current policies of directors' and officers' liability
insurance maintained by FBR Asset and FBR Group with respect to matters
occurring prior to the Closing Date; provided that Newco shall not be required
to pay aggregate annual premiums for insurance under this Section 4.6 in excess
of 300% of the aggregate annual premium paid by FBR Asset or FBR Group, as
applicable, as of the date of this Agreement for such purpose, but in such case
shall purchase such coverage as Newco may reasonably obtain for such amount.

consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or
(ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case the successors and assigns of such entity
shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 4.6, which obligations
are expressly intended to be for the irrevocable benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each director and officer covered hereby.

      Section 4.7  PREPARATION OF THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT AND THE PROXY

issuable in the Mergers, a portion of which Registration Statement shall also
serve as the joint proxy statement with respect to the meetings of the
shareholders of FBR Group and of FBR Asset in connection with the Mergers
(the "Proxy Statement/Prospectus"). The parties will cause the Form S-4 and the
Proxy Statement/ Prospectus to comply as to form in all material respects with
the applicable provisions of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder. Newco shall use commercially reasonable
efforts, and FBR Group and FBR Asset will cooperate with Newco, to have the Form

time of mailing thereof and at the time of the respective meetings of
shareholders of FBR Group and FBR Asset, and the Form S-4 and each amendment or
supplement thereto, at the time it is filed or becomes effective, will not
include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each of
FBR Group and FBR Asset agrees that the written information provided by it

or supplement thereto, at the time of mailing thereof and at the time of the
respective meetings of shareholders of FBR Group and FBR Asset, or, in the case
of the Form S-4 or any amendments or supplements thereto, at the time it is
filed or becomes effective, will not include an untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. Newco will advise FBR Group and FBR Asset promptly
after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the Form S-4 has become
effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any
stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the Newco Class A Common
Shares and Newco Class B Common Shares issuable in connection with the Mergers
for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for
additional information.

      (b)  FBR Asset covenants that the Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall include
the recommendation of the FBR Asset Board and of the FBR Asset Special Committee
that the FBR Asset Shareholders approve the FBR Asset Merger, this Agreement and
the other transactions contemplated hereby; provided, that such recommendations
may be excluded or may be withdrawn, modified or amended if FBR Asset shall
approve or recommend a Superior

withdrawn, modified or amended if FBR Group shall approve or recommend a
Superior Proposal or enter into an agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal
in accordance with Section 4.3.

Special Meeting"  and the "FBR Group  Special  Meeting") as promptly as
practicable  to consider and vote upon or  otherwise to obtain the consent of
its  shareholders, as required,  to the transactions  contemplated hereby.
Subject to Sections 4.3 and 4.7(b) and (c),  the FBR Asset Board and the FBR
Group Board shall each take all lawful action to solicit such consent,

respect to the timing of such meetings and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to hold such meetings on the same day.

Agreement is terminated according to its terms, FBR Group shall cast or cause to
be cast all votes  attributable  to the FBR Asset  Shares owned of record by FBR
Group  or  any  of its  subsidiaries,  at  any  annual  or  special  meeting  of

or in connection  with any written  consent or other vote of shareholders of FBR
Asset,  (i) in favor of adoption of this Agreement and approval of the FBR Asset
Merger  and the  other  transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement  and (ii)

FBR Asset may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in Sections 5.1
through 5.3 to be satisfied if such failure was caused by such party's
failure to use its commercially reasonable efforts to consummate the Mergers
and the transactions contemplated hereby, as required by and subject to
Section 4.4.

Section 6.3  TERMINATION FEE.

       (a)  Prior to or concurrently with the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 6.1(c), or within 3 days after any termination pursuant
to Section 6.1(d), FBR Asset shall promptly pay FBR Group an amount equal to
the sum of (i) Fourteen Million Two Hundred Thousand dollars ($14,200,000)
and (ii) FBR Group's actual expenses related to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (provided, however, that the maximum amount
that FBR Asset shall be required to pay FBR Group pursuant to this clause
(ii) shall be Two Million Five Hundred Thousand dollars ($2,500,000)
regardless of the actual amount of FBR Group's actual expenses related to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby) (such sum, the "FBR
Asset Termination Fee"); provided, however, if this Agreement is terminated
in accordance with the provisions of this first sentence of Section 6.3(a)
within thirty (30) days of

                                       40

<PAGE>



the date hereof,  the FBR Asset  Termination  Fee will be deemed to include
only the amount set forth in Section 6.3(a)(i).  If this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to (x) Section 6.1(b)(iii) and prior to the FBR Asset Special Meeting a
proposal for a Competing  Transaction  with respect to FBR Asset shall have been
made  public,  or  (y)  pursuant  to  Section  6.1(h)  due  to  the  failure  or
incapability  of a condition set forth in Section  5.2(b) to be  satisfied,  and
within one year of such  termination  FBR Asset  enters into an  agreement  with
respect to a Competing Transaction,  FBR Asset shall pay FBR Group the FBR Asset
Termination  Fee prior to  entering  into any  agreement  with  respect  to such
Competing Transaction.

       (b)  Prior to or concurrently with the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 6.1(e) or within 3 days after any termination pursuant to
Section 6.1(f), FBR Group shall promptly pay FBR Asset an amount equal to the
sum of (i) Eight Million Eight Hundred Thousand dollars ($8,800,000) and (ii)
FBR Asset's actual expenses related to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (provided, however, that the maximum amount that FBR
Group shall be required to pay FBR Asset pursuant to this clause (ii) shall
be Two Million Five Hundred Thousand dollars ($2,500,000) regardless of the
actual amount of FBR Asset's actual expenses related to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby) (such sum, the "FBR Group Termination
Fee"); provided, however, if this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
the provisions of this first sentence of Section 6.3(b) within thirty (30)
days of the date hereof, the FBR Group Termination Fee will be deemed to
include only the amount set forth in Section 6.3(b)(i); provided, further,
however, that the FBR Group Termination Fee shall not exceed the sum of (A)
the maximum amount that can be paid to FBR Asset without causing it to fail
to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined
as if the payment of such amount did not constitute income described in
Sections 856(c)(2)(A)-(H) and 856(c)(3)(A)-(I) of the Code ("Qualifying
Income"), as determined by FBR Asset's independent accountants, and (B) in
the event FBR Asset receives an opinion from outside counsel (a "Termination
Fee Tax Opinion") or a ruling from the IRS (a "Termination Fee Ruling"), in
either case holding that FBR Asset's receipt of the FBR Group Termination Fee
would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross
income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (the
"REIT Requirements") or that the receipt by FBR Asset of the remaining
balance of the FBR Group Termination Fee following the receipt of and
pursuant to such ruling or opinion would not be deemed constructively
received prior thereto, the FBR Group Termination Fee less the amount payable
under clause (A) above; provided, however, that, if the Termination Fee Tax
Opinion or the Termination Fee Ruling is based on the absence of constructive
receipt, the amount that will be paid upon the receipt of the Termination Fee
Tax Opinion or the Termination Fee Ruling will be the maximum amount that can
be paid at that time without causing FBR Asset to fail the REIT Requirements,
as determined by FBR Asset's independent accountants based on the Termination
Fee Tax Opinion or Termination Fee Ruling, and any remaining amount payable
to FBR Asset pursuant to clause (B) shall be paid as soon as it shall be
possible to do so without causing FBR Asset to fail the REIT Requirements, as
determined by FBR Asset's independent accountants based on the Termination
Fee Tax Opinion or Termination Fee Ruling.  FBR Group's obligation to pay any
unpaid portion of the FBR Group Termination Fee shall terminate five years
from the date of this Agreement.  In the event that FBR Asset is not able to
receive the full FBR Group Termination Fee, FBR Group shall place the unpaid
amount in escrow and shall not release any portion thereof to FBR Asset
unless and until FBR Asset receives either a Termination Fee Tax Opinion or a
Termination Fee Ruling, in which event FBR Group shall pay to FBR Asset the
unpaid FBR Group Termination Fee;

                                       41

<PAGE>


provided,  however,  that,  if  the  Termination  Fee  Tax  Opinion  or the
Termination  Fee Ruling is based on the  absence of  constructive  receipt,  the
amount that will be paid upon the receipt of the  Termination Fee Tax Opinion or
the  Termination  Fee Ruling will be the maximum amount that can be paid at that
time without causing FBR Asset to fail the REIT  Requirements,  as determined by
FBR Asset's independent  accountants based on the Termination Fee Tax Opinion or
Termination Fee Ruling,  and any remaining  amount payable to FBR Asset shall be
paid as soon as it shall be possible to do so without  causing FBR Asset to fail
the REIT  Requirements,  as  determined by FBR Asset's  independent  accountants
based on the Termination  Fee Tax Opinion or Termination Fee Ruling.  Subject to
the satisfaction of the conditions in the immediately preceding sentence,  there
is no limitation on the number of distributions that can be made from the escrow
prior to the fifth anniversary of the date of this Agreement.  Such escrow shall
terminate  on the  fifth  anniversary  of the  date of this  Agreement,  and any
remaining balance in such escrow shall be returned to Oaktree. If this Agreement
is  terminated  pursuant  to (x) Section  6.1(b)(iv)  and prior to the FBR Group
Special Meeting a proposal for a Competing Transaction with respect to FBR Group
shall  have been made  public,  or (y)  pursuant  to  Section  6.1(g) due to the
failure  or  incapability  of a  condition  set  forth in  Section  5.3(b) to be
satisfied,  and within one year of such  termination  FBR Group  enters  into an
agreement with respect to a Competing Transaction, FBR Group shall pay FBR Asset
the FBR Group  Termination Fee prior to entering into any agreement with respect
to  such  Competing  Transaction  (subject  to the  limitations  set out in this
paragraph).

       (c)  Except as set forth in this Section 6.3(c), all fees and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such fees and expenses, whether
or not the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated; provided, however, that FBR Asset and FBR Group shall share
equally (i) the filing fee of FBR Asset's pre-merger notification report
under the HSR Act, if any, and (ii) all fees and expenses, other than
accountants' and attorneys' fees, incurred with respect to the printing,
filing and mailing (as applicable) of the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement,
including any related preliminary materials and any amendments or supplements
thereto. All fees and expenses payable pursuant to this Section 6.3(c) shall
be paid by wire transfer of same-day funds.

      Section 6.4  AMENDMENT.  This Agreement may be amended by action taken
by the FBR Asset Special Committee, FBR Group and Newco at any time before or
after approval of the Mergers by the FBR Asset Shareholders and the FBR Group
Shareholders, but, after any such approval, no amendment shall be made which
requires the approval of such shareholders under applicable law without such
approval.  This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of the parties hereto.

      Section 6.5  EXTENSION; WAIVER.  At any time prior to the Effective
Time, each party hereto may (i) extend the time for the performance of any of
the obligations or other acts of the other parties, (ii) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other parties
contained herein or in any document, certificate or writing delivered
pursuant hereto, or (iii) waive compliance by the other parties with any of
the agreements or conditions contained herein.  Any agreement on the part of
any party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party and
expressly referring

                                       42

hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.
