and, as soon as practicable on or after the Closing Date, shall make any and
all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL. The Merger shall
become effective at such time  as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed

and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

 


 

 

Section 1.5 _Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws_.

 


 

 

(a) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Company
shall be  amended and restated in its entirety to be identical to the
certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to
the date hereof, except that (i) the name of the corporation shall be the name
of the Company and (ii)  Article X of the Company Charter shall be included
in the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub, and, as so amended, shall
be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended in accordance with its terms  and as provided by
applicable Law.

 

 

2  

(b) At the Effective Time, and without any further action on the part of the
Company  and Merger Sub, the bylaws of the Company shall be amended and
restated in their entirety to be identical to the bylaws of Merger Sub as in
effect immediately prior to the date hereof, except that (i) the name of the
corporation shall be the name  of the Company and (ii) the provisions related
to indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses shall be identical
to those set forth in the Company Bylaws as of the date of this Agreement,
and, as so amended, shall be the bylaws of  the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended in accordance with their terms, the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and as provided by applicable Law.

 


 

 

Section 1.6 _Directors_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to
the  Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until

ARTICLE II 
  EFFECT ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS

 


 

 

Section 2.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of  the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent,
Merger Sub or the holders of any shares of capital stock of the Company,
Parent or Merger Sub:

 


 

 

(a) Each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company
(such  shares, collectively, the " _Shares_ ") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) Shares to be canceled
in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and (ii) any Dissenting Shares) shall
thereupon be converted  automatically into and shall thereafter represent the
right to receive $37.00 in cash (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As of the
Effective Time, all Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to  exist, and shall thereafter
only represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be paid in
accordance with Section 2.3, without interest.

 


 

 

(b) Each Share held in the treasury of the Company or owned, directly or
indirectly,  by Parent, Merger Sub or any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

 


 

 

(c) Each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Merger Sub
issued and  outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable
share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation.

 


 

 

(d) If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and
the  Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of
the Company, or securities convertible into or exchangeable into or
exercisable for shares of such capital stock, shall occur as a result of any
reclassification,  recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock
split) or subdivision or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or
any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such
period, merger or other similar  transaction, the Merger Consideration shall
be equitably adjusted, without duplication, to provide the same aggregate
Merger Consideration payable in respect of all the Shares contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such change. Nothing in this  Section 2.1(d) shall be
construed as permitting the Company to take any action that is otherwise
prohibited by this Agreement.

 

 

3  

Section 2.2 _Treatment of Company Options and Other Equity-Based Awards_.

 


 

 

(a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each option (each, a " _Company
Stock  Option_ ") to purchase Shares granted under any stock option, stock
purchase or equity compensation plan, arrangement or agreement of the Company,
including the Company's 2014 Stock Incentive Plan (the " _Company Equity
Plans_ "), whether  vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be canceled and, in exchange therefor, the
Surviving Corporation shall pay to each former holder thereof following the
Effective Time an amount in cash (without  interest) equal to the product of
(i) the excess of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share
under such Company Stock Option and (ii) the number of Shares subject to such
Company Stock Option, rounded to the nearest cent; _provided_ ,  that if the
exercise price per Share of any such Company Stock Option is equal to or
greater than the Merger Consideration, such Company Stock Option shall be
canceled without any cash payment being made in respect thereof.

 


 

 

(b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each then-outstanding time-
based  restricted stock unit (each, a " _Company RSU_ ") granted under any
Company Equity Plan, whether or not vested, shall be canceled and, in exchange
therefor, the Surviving Corporation shall pay to each former holder thereof
following the  Effective Time an amount in cash (without interest) equal to
the product of (i) the Merger Consideration and (ii) the number of Shares
subject to such Company RSU, rounded to the nearest cent.

 


 

 

(c) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each then-outstanding
performance  restricted stock unit (each, a " _Company PRSU_ ") granted under
any Company Equity Plan, whether or not vested, shall be canceled and, in
exchange therefor, the Surviving Corporation shall pay to each former holder
thereof following the  Effective Time an amount in cash (without interest)
equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration and (ii) the number of
Shares subject to such Company PRSU, assuming achievement of the applicable
performance goals under such Company PRSU  at the target level of attainment.

 


 

 

(d) The Surviving Corporation shall pay the holders of Company Stock Options,
Company  RSUs and Company PRSUs the cash payments described in this Section
2.2 through the Surviving Corporation's payroll system promptly after the
Effective Time, but in any event not later than the first regular payroll
cycle following the Effective  Time.

 


 

 

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take any actions which
are  necessary to effectuate the provisions of Section 2.2(a), Section
2.2(b), Section 2.2(c), Section 2.2(d) and Section 2.2(e), it being understood
and agreed that from and after the Effective Time, no holder of any Company
Stock Option, Company RSU  or Company PRSU (collectively, the " _Company
Stock Awards_ ") shall have any right with respect to any Company Stock Award
other than to receive the payments provided for in this Section 2.2, if any.

 

 

4  

(f) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company
shall  take all actions reasonably necessary to terminate the Company's
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _Company ESPP_ ") as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time. No offering period is open under the Company ESPP as of
the date of this  Agreement and, from and after the date of this Agreement,
the Company shall not permit any new offering period to commence under the
Company ESPP.

 


 

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, as of the
Effective  Time, the RSUs (as defined in the Company Disclosure Letter)
described in Item 1 of Section 5.1(b)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter
will be treated in accordance with the terms set forth in Item 1 of Section
5.1(b)(ii) of the Company  Disclosure Letter.

 


 

 

(h) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall adopt such resolutions as
may be  reasonably required to effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.2.

 


 

 

Section 2.3 _Payment_.

 


 

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an agreement (in a
form  reasonably acceptable to the Company) with a paying agent selected by
Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for
the payment and delivery of the Merger Consideration to stockholders of the
Company as provided  in this Article II. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Paying Agent cash in an
amount sufficient to make all payments pursuant to this Article II (such cash
being hereinafter referred to as the  " _Payment Fund_ "). The Payment Fund
shall not be used for any purpose other than to fund payments due pursuant to
this Article II, except as provided in this Agreement. The Surviving
Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses,  including those of the
Paying Agent, incurred by it in connection with the exchange of Shares for the
Merger Consideration and other amounts contemplated by this Article II.

 


 

 

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time and in any event not later than the
second  Business Day following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of an
outstanding certificate or outstanding certificates (" _Certificates_ ") that
immediately prior to the  Effective Time represented outstanding Shares that
were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration with respect
thereto pursuant to Section 2.1(a), (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be  effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates held by such Person shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of such Certificates in exchange  for the Merger
Consideration payable with respect thereto pursuant to Section 2.1(a). Upon
surrender of a Certificate to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the 
instructions thereto, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly
represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be  canceled. Promptly after the Effective Time and in any event
not later than the second Business Day following the Effective Time, the
Paying Agent shall issue and deliver to each holder of uncertificated Shares
represented by book entry (" _Book-Entry   Shares_ ") a check or wire
transfer for the amount of cash that such holder is entitled to receive
pursuant to Section 2.1(a) in respect of such Book-Entry Shares, without such
holder being required to deliver a Certificate or an executed  letter of
transmittal, "agent's message" or other documents to the Paying Agent, and
such Book-Entry Shares shall then be canceled. No interest will be paid or
accrued for the benefit of holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the
Merger  Consideration payable in respect of Certificates of Book-Entry
Shares.

 

 

5  

(c) If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other
than the  Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry
Share is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that (i) such
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in
proper form for transfer or such  Book-Entry Share shall be properly
transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any
transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of  the
Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered or shall have established to the
satisfaction of Parent that such Tax either has been paid or is not
applicable.

 


 

 

(d) Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.3, each Certificate
or  Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of Shares theretofore represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares, as applicable,  pursuant to Section 2.1(a), without any interest
thereon.

 


 

 

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall cooperate to
establish  procedures with the Paying Agent and the Depository Trust Company
(" _DTC_ ") to ensure that (i) if the Closing occurs at or prior to 11:30 a.m.
(Eastern time) on the Closing Date, the Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or
its nominees on the  Closing Date an amount in cash in immediately available
funds equal to the number of Shares held of record by DTC or such nominee
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Merger Consideration
(such amount, the " _DTC Payment_ "),   and (ii) if the Closing occurs after
11:30 a.m. (Eastern time) on the Closing Date, the Paying Agent will transmit
to DTC or its nominee on the first Business Day after the Closing Date an
amount in cash in immediately available funds equal to  the DTC Payment.

 


 

 

(f) All cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares  in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed
to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares
formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. At the
Effective Time, the stock  transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and  after the Effective Time,
the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares that evidenced ownership of
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have
any rights with respect to such Shares other than the right to  receive the
applicable Merger Consideration, subject to applicable Law in the case of
Dissenting Shares. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for transfer or transfer is
sought  for Book-Entry Shares, such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall
be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II, subject to
applicable Law in the case of Dissenting Shares.

 

 

6  

(g) The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Payment Fund as
directed by  Parent; _provided_ , that any investment of such cash shall in
all events be in short-term obligations of the United States of America with
maturities of no more than 30 days or guaranteed by the United States of
America and backed by the  full faith and credit of the United States of
America or in commercial paper obligations rated A‑1 or P‑1 or better by
Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporation,
respectively. If for any reason (including investment  losses) the cash in
the Payment Fund is insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment
obligations to be made in cash by the Paying Agent hereunder (but subject to
Section 2.4), Parent shall promptly deposit cash into the Payment Fund in an 
amount that is equal to the deficiency in the amount of cash required to fully
satisfy such cash payment obligations. Any interest and other income resulting
from such investments shall be payable to Guarantor, Parent or the Surviving 
Corporation, as directed by Parent.

 


 

 

(h) At any time following the date that is the first anniversary of the
Effective  Time, the Parent shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to
deliver to it or Guarantor or the Surviving Corporation any funds (including
any interest received with respect thereto) that have been made available to
the Paying Agent and that  have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look to
Parent and the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat
or other similar laws) only as general  creditors thereof with respect to the
Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificate or Book-
Entry Shares.

 


 

 

(i) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
holder's  compliance with the replacement requirements established by the
Paying Agent, including, if necessary or otherwise requested by Parent, the
making by such Person of an indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it or the Surviving  Corporation with respect to such Certificate,
the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to
this Agreement.

 


 

 

Section 2.4 _Withholding Rights_. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation  and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent is required to  deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "
_Code_ "), or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. Any such
withholding required with respect to any  payment that is treated as
compensation to the Company employees and service providers (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, the compensatory payments described in Section 2.2(e))
shall be done in accordance with the payroll practices of the  Company. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate
taxing authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction  and withholding was made.

 

 

7  

Section 2.5 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to  the contrary, Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that are held by any holder who is entitled to demand and
properly demands appraisal of such Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL
(" _Dissenting Shares_ ")   shall not be converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration, unless and until such holder shall have failed to
perfect, or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost, such holder's right to
appraisal under the DGCL. Dissenting Shares  shall be treated in accordance
with Section 262 of the DGCL. If any such holder fails to perfect or withdraws
or loses any such right to appraisal, each such Share of such holder shall
thereupon be converted into and become exchangeable only for  the right to
receive, as of the later of the Effective Time and the time that such right to
appraisal has been irrevocably lost, withdrawn or expired, the Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section 2.1(a) (less any payments made by
the  Surviving Corporation with respect to such Shares before entry of
judgment in accordance with Section 262(h) of the DGCL). The Company shall
serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal of any Shares, and  Parent shall have the right to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall
not, without the prior consent of Parent, make or offer to make any payment
with respect to, compromise or settle or offer to  compromise or settle, or
otherwise negotiate any such demands.

 


 

 

ARTICLE III

Except (a) as disclosed or reflected in the Company SEC Documents (but
excluding any risk factor disclosures contained under the heading "Risk
Factors" or any disclosure of  risks included in any "forward-looking
statements" disclaimer that are predictive or forward-looking in nature, in
each case, other than any specific factual information contained therein);

requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and operate
its properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted and (iii)
is duly qualified or licensed  to do business and is in good standing (with
respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept) in each jurisdiction in
which the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its
properties makes such qualification or  licensing necessary, except, with
respect to clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such failures to have such power
and authority or to be so qualified or licensed or in good standing as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be  expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Material Adverse
Effect_ " means any event, change, condition, state of facts, circumstance,
occurrence or effect that, individually or in the aggregate (x) has or  would
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business,
financial condition, assets, liabilities or results of operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than any such event,
change, condition,  state of facts, circumstance, occurrence or effect to the
extent arising out of or resulting from (1) changes in general economic,

the United States or any country in  which the Company or its Subsidiaries
operate, (2) changes or developments in any of the industries in which the
Company or its Subsidiaries operate, (3) changes in any applicable Laws or
other legal regulatory conditions (or the official  interpretation thereof),
or changes in accounting regulations or principles, (4) any change in the
price or trading volume of the Company's stock, in and of itself ( _provided_
, that the facts or occurrences giving rise to or contributing to  any such
change that are not otherwise excluded from the definition of "Material
Adverse Effect" may be taken into account in determining whether there has
been a Material Adverse Effect), (5) any failure by the Company to meet any
published  analyst estimates or expectations of the Company's revenue,
earnings or other financial performance or results of operations for any
period, in and of itself, or any failure by the Company to meet its internal
or published projections, budgets,  plans or forecasts of its revenues,
earnings or other financial performance or results of operations, in and of
itself ( _provided_ , that the facts or occurrences giving rise to or
contributing to any such failure that are not otherwise  excluded from the
definition of "Material Adverse Effect" may be taken into account in
determining whether there has been a Material Adverse Effect), (6) acts of
God, natural disasters, weather conditions or national or international
political or  social conditions, including the engagement in, or escalation,
outbreak or worsening of, hostilities in or by any country or the occurrence
of any act of war or any similar act of terrorism, (7) the announcement or
pendency of this Agreement and  the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the initiation of litigation by any stockholder of the Company
against the Company Board alleging that the Company Board breached its
fiduciary duties in connection with the approval of this  Agreement, and
including any termination of, reduction in, or other negative impact on
relationships, contractual or otherwise, with any customers, suppliers,
distributors, partners or employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries due to

or any action taken by a business competitor due in whole or in part to the
announcement of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, (8)

Agreement), including any action taken by any party in order to obtain
approvals under the HSR Act or any other applicable Antitrust Law, or (9) any
actions taken (or omitted to be taken) at the  written request or with the
written consent, of Parent; _provided_ , that any event, change, condition,
state of facts, circumstance, occurrence or effect otherwise excluded by any
of the foregoing clauses (1), (2), (3) or (6) shall be taken  into account in
determining the occurrence of a Material Adverse Effect to the extent
disproportionately impacting the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, relative to other Persons operating in the industries in which the
Company and  its Subsidiaries operate; or (y) would prevent, materially
impair, or materially delay the performance by the Company of, or has or would
have a material adverse effect on the ability of the Company to perform, its
obligations under this  Agreement.

audit committee of the Company Board (i) any  significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over
financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any
material respect the Company's ability to record, process, summarize  and
report financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that

Subsidiaries  are, and have been since January 1, 2017, in compliance with
all Laws applicable to them or by which any of their respective properties are

operate their properties and to carry on their businesses as now conducted,
except for any Permits the absence of which would not, individually or  in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. All
Permits are in full force and effect and to the knowledge of the Company, no
suspension or cancellation of any such Permit is threatened, except where the
failure to  be in full force and effect or such suspension or cancellation

Material Adverse Effect:

Section 4.1 _Organization, Standing and Power; Ownership and Operations of
Merger Sub_.

 


 

 

(a) Each of Guarantor, Parent and Merger Sub (i) is a corporation duly
organized,  validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of Delaware

organized under the laws of France (solely in the case of  Guarantor), (ii)
has all requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties
and to carry on its business as now being conducted and (iii) is duly
qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction  in which the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing
or operation of its properties makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, except, with respect to clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such
failures to have such power and authority or  to be so qualified or licensed
or in good standing as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Parent Material Adverse Effect_ " means any  event, change,
occurrence, circumstance or effect that would prevent, materially delay or
materially impede the performance by Guarantor, Parent or Merger Sub of its
obligations under this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger or any of

or obligations other than as contemplated herein. The authorized capital stock
of Merger Sub consists of  100 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per
share, all of which are validly issued and outstanding. All of the issued and

subsidiary of Guarantor.

the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by the Boards
of Directors of Parent and Merger Sub, and no other corporate proceedings on
the part of Parent, Merger Sub or  Guarantor are necessary to approve this
Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, subject in
the case of the consummation of the Merger, to the filing of the Certificate
of Merger with the Delaware Secretary of State as  required by the DGCL. The
board of directors of Guarantor has approved the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement in accordance with applicable Law. This Agreement has been duly

due authorization, execution and delivery by the Company, constitutes a valid
and binding obligation of Parent, Merger Sub and Guarantor, enforceable
against each of them in accordance with its terms (except to the extent that 
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
moratorium, reorganization or similar Laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors' rights generally or by general principles of equity and to the
extent Guarantor is party hereto  for the limited purposes set forth herein).
No vote or consent of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of
Parent or Guarantor is necessary to approve this Agreement or the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated hereby. The  vote or consent of Parent as
the sole stockholder of Merger Sub (which shall have occurred within one

hereby.

applicable to Parent, Merger Sub or Guarantor or by which any of their
respective properties are bound or (iii) result in any breach or violation of,
or constitute a default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or
both would  become a default), or result in the loss of a benefit under, or
give rise to any right of termination, cancellation, amendment or acceleration
of, any Contract to which Parent, Merger Sub or Guarantor is a party or by
which Parent, Merger Sub or  Guarantor or any of their respective properties
are bound, except, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such

this  Agreement, Guarantor hereby guarantees the due, punctual and complete
performance and payment in full of all obligations of Parent and Merger Sub
under, or in respect of, this Agreement (including payment of the Parent
Termination Fee), if, as and  when due and payable or required to be
performed pursuant to any provisions of this Agreement, subject to the terms
and conditions hereof (collectively, the " _Guaranteed Obligations_ "). The
obligations of Guarantor hereunder shall not be  subject to any reduction,
limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, including any claim of
waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall not be subject
to any defense or setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination,  in each
case, by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the

or its Subsidiaries' operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the
Effective Time, each of the Company and Guarantor shall exercise, consistent
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,  complete control and
supervision over its and its Subsidiaries' respective operations.

 


 

 

Section 5.4 _Acquisition Proposals_.

 


 

 

(a) The Company agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, and
that it  shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their
respective officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives,
including any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by or acting
on the behalf of the Company or any of  its Subsidiaries acting in their
capacity as such (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") not to (i) initiate,
solicit or knowingly encourage or facilitate any inquiries, proposals,
expressions of interest, offers or requests for information or  data with
respect to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, the making or
completion of, an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage or participate in any
negotiations or discussions (other than to state that they are not permitted
to have  discussions or to seek clarification regarding the terms of an
Acquisition Proposal) concerning, or provide or cause to be provided any non-
public information or data relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
in connection with, an  Acquisition Proposal, (iii) enter into any Contract
relating to an Acquisition Proposal or (iv) resolve or agree to do any of the
foregoing; _provided_ , _however_ , it is understood and agreed that any
determination or action by the  Company Board or the Company expressly
permitted under Section 5.4(b) or (c) or Section 7.1(c)(ii) shall not be
deemed to be a breach of this Section 5.4(a). The Company agrees that it will
immediately (A) cease and cause to be terminated any  existing activities,
discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal, (B) terminate access by any other Person and its
Representatives to any physical or electronic data room or other  access to
data or information by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case,
relating to or in connection with, any Acquisition Proposal or any transaction
of the type described in the definition of Acquisition Proposal, (C) request
the  prompt return or destruction of all non-public information provided to
any other Person or its Representatives in the 12 months immediately preceding
the date of this Agreement in connection with any inquiry, expression of
interest, proposal, offer  or request for information that would reasonably
be expected to result in an Acquisition Proposal and (D) enforce, and not
waive or modify, the provisions of any confidentiality or non-disclosure
agreement entered into with respect to any  Acquisition Proposal or any
potential transaction of the type described in the definition of Acquisition
Proposal (except for any standstill provision in such confidentiality or non-
disclosure agreement). It is agreed that any breach of this  Section 5.4 by
any Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall constitute
a breach of this Section 5.4 by the Company.

 

 

35  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.4(a), at any time
prior to  obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company may, if it
receives an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal after the date
hereof that has not been withdrawn and did not result from a material breach
of this Section 5.4 and  the Company Board determines in good faith following
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor (x) that
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead
to a Superior Proposal and (y) that the  failure to furnish information to
the Person making such Acquisition Proposal and participate in discussions and
negotiations with such Person and its Representatives regarding such
Acquisition Proposal would reasonably be expected to be  inconsistent with
the Company Board's exercise of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (i)
furnish information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the
Person making such Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_ that prior to 
furnishing such information the Company and such Person enter into a
confidentiality agreement on terms substantially similar to those contained in
the Confidentiality Agreement (except for such changes specifically necessary
in order for the  Company to be able to comply with its obligations under
this Agreement and it being understood that the Company may enter into a
confidentiality agreement without a standstill provision; _provided_ that if
the Company enters into a  confidentiality agreement without a standstill or
waives an existing standstill the Company Board will waive the standstill
provisions in the Confidentiality Agreement) (an " _Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement_ ")) and (ii) participate in  discussions or negotiations with such
Person and its Representatives regarding such Acquisition Proposal; _provided_
, _however_ , that the Company shall (x) promptly (and in any event within 24
hours) provide or make available to Parent  any non-public information or
data provided to or made available to the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal or its Representatives that was not previously provided or made
available to Parent and (y) give Parent written notice of any such 
determination made pursuant to this Section 5.4(b) prior to furnishing any
such information or engaging in such discussions or negotiations.

 

 

36  

(c) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or
modify, or  publicly propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to
Parent or Merger Sub the Company Recommendation, (ii) fail to include the
Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (iii) take any action to exempt
any Person (other than Parent  and its Affiliates) from the provisions of
Section 203 of the DGCL or any other Takeover Law, (iv) fail to publicly
reaffirm the Company Recommendation within five Business Days after Parent so
requests in writing in response to an Acquisition  Proposal, (v) fail to
recommend, in a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9,
against any Acquisition Proposal subject to Regulation 14D under the Exchange
Act within ten Business Days after the commencement of such Acquisition 
Proposal or any material amendment of such Acquisition Proposal, (vi) approve
or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition
Proposal (any of such actions in clauses (i) through (vi), an " _Adverse
Recommendation Change_ ")  or (vii) allow the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to execute or enter into any Contract (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement to the extent expressly permitted by Section 5.4(b))
with any other Person relating to any Acquisition  Proposal. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Section 5.4(c), if, prior to obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval and following compliance with Section 5.4(d), (A)
in response to an Intervening Event, the Company Board determines  in good
faith, after consultation with outside counsel and financial advisor that the
failure to do so would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the
Company Board's exercise of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the
Company Board  or any committee thereof may effect an Adverse Recommendation
Change (under clause (i) or (ii) of the definition thereof) and/or (B) the
Company receives an unsolicited written bona fide Acquisition Proposal that
has not been withdrawn and did not  result from a material breach of Section
5.4 and the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation with its
outside counsel and financial advisor that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal and that the failure to  take such action
would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the exercise of the
Company Board's fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then (x) the Company
Board may make an Adverse Recommendation Change and (y) the Company, upon 
receiving authorization from the Company Board, may enter into a definitive
acquisition agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal if, with respect
to this clause (y), the Company concurrently terminates this Agreement in
accordance with  Section 7.1(c)(ii).

 


 

 

(d) 
 

 


 

 

(i) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company
Board shall  not be entitled to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change or
terminate or authorize the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
Section 7.1(c)(ii) unless prior thereto:

 


 

 

(A) the Company notifies Parent in writing at least five Business Days before
taking  that action of its intention to do so, and specifies the reasons
therefor in reasonable detail, including, if applicable, the terms of the
Superior Proposal and provides with respect to such Superior Proposal the most
recent documents and materials  of the type described in the second sentence
of Section 5.4(e) (a " _Superior Proposal Notice_ ");

 

 

37  


 

 

(B) to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, the Company has negotiated, and
has  caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent and
its Representatives during such five-Business Day period, to enable Parent to
effect revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement that would, if
a Superior Proposal  has been made, cause such Superior Proposal to no longer
constitute a Superior Proposal or, in connection with any other Adverse
Recommendation Change, it would cause the Company Board to no longer believe
that the failure to make an Adverse  Recommendation Change would reasonably
be expected to be inconsistent with the exercise of its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; and

 


 

 

(C) if Parent makes a proposal by no later than 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on
the fifth  Business Day of such five-Business Day period to adjust the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, the Company Board after taking into
consideration the adjusted terms and conditions of this Agreement, as proposed
by Parent, continues to determine  in good faith (after consultation with
outside counsel and its financial advisor) that such Superior Proposal
continues to be a Superior Proposal, if applicable, and that the failure to
make an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this  Agreement in
accordance with Section 7.1(c)(ii), as applicable, would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with the exercise of its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law.

 


 

 

(ii) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any (A) revisions to the
financial  terms or any other material terms of a Superior Proposal or (B)
revisions to the financial terms or any other material terms to an Acquisition
Proposal that the Company Board had determined no longer constitutes a
Superior Proposal, shall  constitute a new Acquisition Proposal and shall in
each case require the Company to deliver to Parent a new Superior Proposal
Notice and a new three Business Day period shall commence thereafter.

 


 

 

(e) The Company promptly (and in any event within 24 hours of receipt) shall
advise  Parent of the receipt of (i) any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any
request for information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries, other
than requests for information not reasonably expected to be related to an
Acquisition Proposal, and (iii) any  inquiry, request for discussion or
negotiation or expression of interest, proposal or offer regarding or that
otherwise would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal,
including in each case the identity of the Person making any  such
Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, expression of interest, proposal, offer or
request and the material terms and conditions of any such Acquisition
Proposal, inquiry, expression of interest, proposal, offer or request, copies
of any material  documentation and a written summary of any oral inquiry,
expression of interest, proposal, offer or request. The Company shall keep
Parent reasonably informed in writing on a reasonably current basis of any
material changes to, the terms of any  such Acquisition Proposal (including
providing Parent a notification in writing within 24 hours following any
determination by the Company Board pursuant to this Section 5.4 or any
material change to the terms of any such Acquisition Proposal) and  any
material discussions and negotiations concerning the material terms and
conditions thereof and provide to Parent as soon as practicable (and in any
event within 24 hours after receipt thereof) of any written indication of
interest (or amendment  thereto) or any written material received in
connection therewith (or amendment thereto) including copies of any proposed
definitive acquisition agreement concerning such Acquisition Proposal
(including any drafts thereof) and drafts of any other  material
documentation.

 

 

38  

(f) Nothing set forth in this Section 5.4 shall prevent the Company or the
Company Board  from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e‑2(a), Rule 14d‑9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to
stockholders in connection with the making  or amendment of a tender offer or
exchange offer) or from (ii) making any "stop, look and listen" communication
to the Company's stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the
Exchange Act limited to the information specified in such  rule; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any Adverse Recommendation Change may be made only in
accordance with Section 5.4(c).

 


 

 

(g) As used in this Agreement:

 


 

 

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal, expression of
interest  or offer from any Person or group of Persons other than Parent or
one of its Subsidiaries that relates to or would reasonably be expected to
lead to (A) a merger, reorganization, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination,  recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint venture, sale
of equity interests or assets, tender offer, exchange offer or other
transaction or any combination of any of the foregoing (including any single-
or multi-step transaction) involving  the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
and 20% or more of the net revenues, net income or assets of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (for the 12-month period ending on the last
day of the Company's most recently completed fiscal  quarter) or (B) the
acquisition (or, in the case of equity securities, issuance) in any manner,
directly or indirectly (including the acquisition of beneficial ownership), of
20% or more of the equity securities or consolidated total assets of the 
Company, in each case other than the Merger.

 


 

 

(ii) " _Intervening Event_ " means any material development or material change
in  circumstances (other than in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or
Superior Proposal) that occurs or arises after the date of this Agreement that
was not known and not reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board as of the
date of this  Agreement.

 


 

 

(iii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide written unsolicited
Acquisition  Proposal (A) on terms that the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel and
financial advisors, to be more favorable from a financial point of view to the
holders of Shares than the Merger,  taking into account all the terms and
conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, and this Agreement (including any
changes to this Agreement proposed by Parent) and (B) that the Company Board
believes is reasonably capable of being completed, in the  case of each of
clause (A) and (B), taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and
other aspects of such Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that for purposes of
the definition of "Superior Proposal," the references to "20%" in the 
definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "50%."

 


 

 

Section 5.5 _Preparation of Proxy Statement; Stockholders ' Meeting_.

 


 

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the  Company shall, with the assistance of Parent, prepare the
Proxy Statement and file the Proxy Statement with the SEC; _provided_ that the
preliminary Proxy Statement will be filed with the SEC within twenty Business
Days following the date of  this Agreement. Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company shall cooperate with each other in the preparation of the Proxy
Statement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Parent
and Merger Sub will furnish to the Company the  information relating to it
required by the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder to be set forth in the Proxy Statement. The Company shall cause the
Proxy Statement to comply as to form in all material respects with the 
applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules of the SEC and the
NYSE. The Company will not file the preliminary or definitive Proxy Statement
or any supplement or amendment thereto (or any disclosure relating to the
foregoing) with  the SEC or otherwise disseminate any of the foregoing
without providing Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity in advance
to review and comment thereon, which comments shall be considered and
discussed with Parent and its counsel by the  Company and its counsel in good
faith; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall have no obligation to
include any such comments to the extent that the Company determines in good
faith, in consultation with its counsel, that  including such comments would
result in the Proxy Statement containing an untrue statement of a material
fact or omitting to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the 
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Company shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to resolve all SEC comments with respect
to the Proxy Statement as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof. Each
of Parent,  Merger Sub and the Company agrees to correct any information
provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement that shall have become false or
misleading. The Company shall as soon as reasonably practicable notify Parent
and Merger Sub of the receipt  of any comments from the SEC with respect to
the Proxy Statement and any request by the SEC for any amendment to the Proxy
Statement or for additional information. To the extent not prohibited under
applicable Law, the Company shall provide Parent  with copies of all material
correspondence between the Company or any of its Representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to such filings, requests
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. To the extent  not
prohibited under applicable Law, no response to staff comments on the Proxy
Statement or requests for information shall be made by the Company without
providing Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity in advance to review
and comment  thereon, which comments shall be considered and discussed with
Parent and its counsel by the Company and its counsel in good faith.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Company shall
not be required to provide to Parent  or Merger Sub with copies of such SEC
comments and requests for information or the opportunity to comment pursuant
to this Section 5.5(a) in the event that the Company Board has made an Adverse
Recommendation Change.

 

 

39  

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable (and, unless otherwise agreed by
Parent and  the Company in writing, in any event promptly following the
clearance of the Proxy Statement by the SEC), the Company, acting through the
Company Board, shall (i) take all action necessary to duly call, give notice
of, convene and hold a meeting of  its stockholders for the purpose of
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval (the " _Company Stockholders
Meeting_ ") and (ii) except to the extent that the Company Board shall have
effected an Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with  Section 5.4(c),
include in the Proxy Statement the recommendation of the Company Board that
the stockholders of the Company vote in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall be permitted to 
adjourn or postpone convening the Company Stockholders Meeting (but not beyond
the third Business Day prior to the Termination Date) (A) if as of the time
for which the Company Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set
forth in the Proxy  Statement), there are insufficient Shares represented
(either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the
business of the Company Stockholder Meeting or to the extent that at such time
the Company has not received proxies  sufficient to allow the receipt of the
Company Stockholder Approval at the Company Stockholder Meeting (such
postponement or adjournment to be for no more than five Business Days and
shall be no later than the date three Business Days prior to the  Termination
Date), (B) to allow time for the filing and dissemination of any supplemental
or amended disclosure document that in the good faith judgment of the Company
Board or any committee thereof (after consultation with its legal counsel)
is  required to be filed and disseminated under applicable Law (in each case,
such postponement or adjournment to be for no more than a reasonable amount of
time taking into account the requirements under applicable Law) or (C) if the
Company is  required to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting
by applicable Law (in each case, such postponement or adjournment to be for no
more than a reasonable amount of time taking into account the requirements
under applicable Law).

 

 

40  

(c) Without the prior written consent of Parent (which shall not be
unreasonably  withheld, conditioned, or delayed), the adoption of this
Agreement shall be the only matter (other than matters of procedure required
by applicable Law to be voted on by the Company's stockholders and a "Say-on-
Golden-Parachute" vote) that the  Company shall propose to be acted on by the
stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholders Meeting.

 


 

 

(d) Once the Company has established a record date for the Company
Stockholders Meeting,  the Company shall not change such record date or
establish a different record date for the Company Stockholders Meeting without
the prior written consent of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed), unless (i)  required to do so by the DGCL or the
Company's organizational documents, (ii) the Company reasonably determines it
is necessary or advisable to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval or (iii)
it is required in connection with any adjournment or  postponement of the
Company Stockholder Meeting permitted under Section 5.5(b) (it being
understood that in the case of each of (i), (ii) and (iii), the Company shall
consult with and consider in good faith the views of Parent in connection
with  changing or establishing a new record date and the setting such new
record date). If the record date for the Company Stockholders Meeting is
changed, the Company shall, as to that record date, comply with each of its
obligations under  this Section 5.5.

 


 

 

(e) In connection with the Company Stockholder Meeting, the Company shall
use  commercially reasonable efforts to (A) subject to the right to make an
Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with Section 5.4, solicit proxies
in favor of the adoption of this Agreement in accordance with applicable Law
and use commercially  reasonable efforts to obtain the Company Stockholder
Approval and (B) otherwise comply with all legal requirements applicable to
such meeting. The Company shall reasonably cooperate with and keep Parent
informed on a reasonably current basis  regarding its solicitation efforts
and voting results following the dissemination of the definitive Proxy
Statement.

 


 

 

(f) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, unless this Agreement
has been  terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company shall
establish a record date for, call, give notice of, convene and hold the
Company Stockholder Meeting and submit the Merger and the adoption of this
Agreement for the approval of its  stockholders at the Company Stockholder
Meeting whether or not an Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred or
an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced or otherwise made
known to the Company, the Company Board or the  Company's Representatives or
its stockholders.

 

 

41  

Section 5.6 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 


 

 

(a) From the date hereof to the Effective Time or the earlier termination of
this  Agreement, upon reasonable prior written notice, the Company shall, and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its Subsidiaries, officers,
directors, employees and representative to, afford to Parent reasonable access
during normal business  hours, consistent with applicable Law, to its
officers, employees, properties, offices, other facilities and books and
records, and shall furnish Parent with all Contracts, financial, operating and
other data and information as Parent shall  reasonably request (it being
agreed, however, that the foregoing shall not permit Parent or its officers,
employees or representatives to conduct any invasive environmental testing or
sampling, including but not limited to facility surface and  subsurface soils
and water, air or building materials without the prior written consent of the
Company, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such investigation or
consultation  shall be conducted in such a manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or otherwise result in any significant interference with the
discharge by the employees of the Company or its  Subsidiaries of their
normal duties. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure would (i) breach any Contract with any third party,  (ii)
constitute a waiver of or jeopardize the attorney-client or other privilege
held by the Company or (iii) otherwise violate any applicable Law (it being
agreed that the Company shall (x) give notice to Parent of the fact that it is
withholding  such information pursuant to clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) above
and (y) reasonably cooperate with Parent to cause such information to be
provided in a manner that would not reasonably be expected to waive or
jeopardize such privilege, violate such  applicable Law or breach such
Contract).

 


 

 

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub will hold and treat and will cause its
Representatives  to hold and treat in confidence all documents and
information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries furnished to Parent or
Merger Sub in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
in accordance with the Confidentiality  Agreement, dated October 25, 2019,
between Guarantor and the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which
Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance
with its terms but shall terminate at the Effective  Time.

 

 

42  

Section 5.7 _Further Action; Efforts_.

 


 

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of  the parties shall and shall cause each of their respective
Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates to use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, and to reasonably assist and  cooperate with the other party in doing,
all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law to consummate
and make effective, as promptly as reasonably practicable, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) taking  all actions necessary
to cause the conditions to Closing required to be satisfied by such party set
forth in Article VI to be satisfied, (ii) preparing and filing any
applications, notices, registrations and requests as may be required or
advisable  to be filed with or submitted to any Governmental Entity in order
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) obtaining
all necessary or advisable actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and
approvals from Governmental  Entities or other Persons necessary in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the making of all necessary or advisable registrations and
filings (including filings with Governmental Entities, if any)  and the
taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary or advisable to obtain an
approval or waiver from, or to avoid an Action by, any Governmental Entity or
other Persons necessary in connection with the consummation of the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement, (iv) subject to Section 5.7(c),
defending any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, against such party challenging this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement, including
seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court
or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed, and (v) executing and
delivering any additional instruments necessary or  advisable to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to fully carry out the
purposes of this Agreement, other than in the case of each of clauses (i)
through (v), with respect to registrations, filings, approvals, consents, 
authorizations or orders, lawsuits or other legal proceedings, from or by any
Governmental Entity or the expiration of any waiting periods, in each case
relating to Antitrust Laws, which are the subject of Section 5.7(b) and
Section 5.7(c) and not  this Section 5.7(a).

 

 

43  

(b) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of  the parties agrees to make any filings required to be made pursuant
to the HSR Act and any other applicable Antitrust Laws with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as reasonably
practicable (and in any event, with  respect to any filings to be made
pursuant to the HSR Act, within 10 Business Days following the date of this
Agreement) and to supply as promptly as reasonably practicable to the
appropriate Governmental Entities any additional information and  documentary
material that may be requested by such Governmental Entities pursuant to any
Antitrust Laws. The parties shall request early termination of the applicable
HSR Act waiting period and use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the 
termination of such waiting period as promptly as reasonably practicable (and
in any event by the Termination Date). The parties shall use their reasonable
best efforts to ensure that all such antitrust filings to be made shall be
made in  substantial compliance with the requirements of the applicable
Antitrust Laws. In furtherance, and without limiting the generality, of the
foregoing, the parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to (i)
cooperate with and assist each other  in good faith to (A) provide or cause
to be provided as promptly as reasonably practicable to the other party all
necessary information and assistance as any Governmental Entity may from time
to time require of such party in connection with  obtaining the relevant
waivers, permits, consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications, orders
or expiration of waiting periods (collectively, " _Consents_ ") in relation to
such filings or in connection with any other review or  investigation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by a Governmental Entity pursuant
to any Antitrust Laws and (B) provide or cause to be provided as promptly as
reasonably practicable all assistance and cooperation to allow the other 
party to prepare and submit any such filings or submissions required to be
submitted under any Antitrust Laws, including providing to the other party any
information that the other party may from time to time reasonably require for
the purpose of  any filing with, notification to, application with, or
request for further information made by, any Governmental Entity in respect of
any such filing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
Parent shall direct and control all  aspects of the strategy and process
relating to obtaining Consents under Antitrust Laws; _provided_ , _however_ ,

its own choosing.

sentence, the parties shall cooperate with respect to reasonable
accommodations that may be requested or appropriate to obtain such consents.
The parties  acknowledge and agree that the obligation to agree to obtain the
Consents or otherwise consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement "as promptly as reasonably practicable" shall not preclude or

beneficiary of this Agreement, and nothing herein shall be (i) construed as an
amendment to any Company Plan or any  other employee benefit plan for any
purpose, (ii) give any employee or former employee or any other individual
associated therewith or any employee benefit plan or trustee thereof or any
other third person any right to enforce the provisions of  this Section 5.8
or (iii) obligate Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Affiliates to retain the employment of any particular employee.

 

 

47

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any employee may have under
any  agreement or Company Plan, from the Effective Time through the sixth
anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless each present (as of
the Effective Time)  and former officer or director of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), against any and all claims,
losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees,
costs and expenses, including  attorneys' fees and disbursements, incurred in
connection with any Action, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Indemnified
Party is or was an officer, director, fiduciary or  agent of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective Time (including in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions and actions contemplated
hereby), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective 
Time, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law and the Company
Charter and Company Bylaws as at the date hereof. In the event of any such
Action, (i) each Indemnified Party shall be entitled to advancement of
expenses incurred in the  defense of any Action from Parent or the Surviving
Corporation to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law and the
Company Charter and Company Bylaws; _provided_ , that any Person to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking,  if and only to the extent
required by the DGCL or the Company Charter or Company Bylaws, to repay such
advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to
indemnification and (ii) the Surviving Corporation shall not settle, 
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any proceeding or
threatened action, suit, proceeding, investigation or claim (and in which
indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder), unless
such settlement,  compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of
such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such action, suit,
proceeding, investigation or claim (including because the Surviving
Corporation reimbursed all monetary damages  to the Indemnified Party) or
such Indemnified Party otherwise consents (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned).

 


 

 

(b) Except as may be required by applicable Law, Parent and the Company agree
that all  rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts
or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to
advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any
Indemnified Party as provided in the  certificate of incorporation or bylaws
(or comparable organizational documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries
or in any indemnification agreement between such Indemnified Party and the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is consistent  with the form of
indemnification agreement included in the Company SEC Documents shall survive
the Merger and continue in full force and effect, and shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect any 
right thereunder of any such Indemnified Party for a period of six years after
the Effective Time.

 


 

 

(c) At the Company's option, the Company may purchase, prior to the Effective
Time, a  six-year prepaid "tail policy" on terms and conditions (in both
amount and scope) providing substantially equivalent benefits as the current
policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance maintained by  the Company and its Subsidiaries with
respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time, covering without
limitation the transactions contemplated hereby for a cost not to exceed 300%
the amount the Company paid in its last full fiscal  year prior to the date
of this Agreement. If such tail prepaid policy has been obtained by the
Company prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall cause such policy to be
maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and cause all 
obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation for a cost
not to exceed 300% of the amount of that the Company paid in its last full
fiscal year prior to the date of this Agreement. Unless prior to the Effective
Time the Company  shall have purchased such "tail policy", for a period of
six years from the Effective Time, Parent shall either cause to be maintained
in effect the current policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance
and fiduciary liability insurance  maintained by the Company and its
Subsidiaries or cause to be provided substitute policies or purchase or cause
the Surviving Corporation to purchase, a "tail policy," in either case of at
least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and  conditions that are
not less advantageous in the aggregate than such policy with respect to
matters arising on or before the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that
(x) in the case of an insurance policy, the Surviving Corporation  shall not
be required to pay with respect to such insurance policies in respect of any
one policy year annual premiums in excess of 300% of the last annual premium
paid by the Company prior to the date hereof and (y) in the case of a "tail
policy,"  the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay more than
300% of such last annual premium, and in either case, the Surviving
Corporation shall purchase the maximum amount of coverage that can be obtained
for 300% of such last annual  premium.

 

 

49  

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Action (whether
arising  before, at or after the Effective Time) is instituted against any
Indemnified Party on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
the provisions of this Section 5.12 shall continue in effect until the final
disposition of such Action.

 


 

 

(e) The indemnification provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of
any other  rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant
to Law, Contract or otherwise. The provisions of this Section 5.12 shall
survive the consummation of the Merger and, notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement that may  be to the contrary, expressly are
intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified
Parties and their respective heirs and legal representatives.

 


 

 

(f) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or Parent or any of their
respective  successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a
majority of its properties and  assets to any Person, then, and in each such
case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, shall succeed to the
obligations set forth in this Section 5.12.

 


 

 

Section 5.13 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take  such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable hereto or
otherwise requested by a party to cause dispositions of Company equity
securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by each  individual who is a director or
officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b‑3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

 

 

50  

Section 5.14 _Public Announcements_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the
one  hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall consult with each other
before issuing, and give each other a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to
this Agreement, the Merger  and the other transactions contemplated hereby
and shall not issue any such press release or make any public announcement
without the prior consent of the other party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, except as may be required by  applicable Law, court
process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national
securities exchange or national securities quotation system, in which case the
party required to make the release or announcement shall consult with  the
other party about, and allow the other party reasonable time to comment on,
such release or announcement in advance of such issuance, and the party
required to make the release or announcement will consider such comments in
good faith. Parent  and the Company agree that the press release announcing
the execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be a joint release of
Parent and the Company.

necessary  to cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their
respective obligations under this Agreement.

opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any Action
commenced or threatened against the Company and/or its directors, officers,
employees or Representatives relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including  (a) any stockholder derivative Action, (b) any Action
under Section 220 of the DGCL or (c) with respect to disclosures made by the
Company in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
_provided_ , that (i) the Company  shall have the right to control any such
Action in which the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or any member of
the Company Board is named as a party or that is brought by any of the
Company's stockholders, and (ii) Parent shall reasonably  cooperate with the
Company in connection with such defense or settlement. Neither Parent nor the
Company shall discuss with the opposing party any settlement or compromise, or
offer or agree to any settlement or compromise, of any such Action  without
consent of the other party hereto, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. Without Parent's prior written consent, the
Company shall not (x) waive any provision of the Company's organizational
documents  providing for the state courts of the State of Delaware as the
exclusive forum for any litigation by stockholders or (y) consent to the
selection of an alternative forum other than the state courts of the State of
Delaware for any such litigation  by stockholders.

 


 

 

Section 5.17 _Company Indebtedness_. Prior to the Closing, if so requested
by  Parent, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to either (a)
obtain and deliver to Parent customary payoff letters for any funded third-
party Indebtedness of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries identified by
Parent in form and substance  reasonably satisfactory to Parent evidencing
full repayment and satisfaction of all such Indebtedness, together with any
customary collateral releases, collateral access agreement terminations,
mortgage releases, Intellectual Property releases,  physical collateral
deliveries and other related termination and/or release items in connection
therewith or (b) reasonably cooperate with Parent to request waivers from the
lenders under any third-party Indebtedness of the Company or any of its 
Subsidiaries identified by Parent, to allow such Indebtedness to remain
outstanding following the Effective Time. " _Indebtedness_ " of any Person at
any date means, without duplication, all obligations (whether or not due and
payable as of  such date) of such Person to pay principal, interest,
premiums, penalties, fees, guarantees, reimbursements, damages, "make-whole"
amounts, costs of unwinding, breakage fees, pre-payment fees or penalties, and

each of their respective former, current and future directors, officers,

this Agreement by the Company. Upon payment of such Termination Fee when due
and payable under this  Agreement, no Company Released Party shall have any
further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except for any pre-
termination Willful Breach of this Agreement by  the Company and that the
obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement and the provisions described

then, in any such case, Parent shall pay the Company an amount equal to
$75,000,000 (the " _Parent Termination Fee_ "). Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, in the  event that the Parent Termination Fee
becomes payable, then payment to the Company of the Parent Termination Fee
shall be the Company's sole and exclusive remedy as liquidated damages for any
and all losses or damages of any nature against Parent,  any of the Parent's
Affiliates (including the Guarantor) and each of their respective former,
current and future directors, officers, employees, agents, general and limited
partners, managers, members, stockholders, Affiliates, Representatives and 
assignees and each former, current or future director, officer, employee,
agent, general or limited partner, manager, member, stockholder, Affiliate,
Representative or assignee of any of the foregoing (collectively, the "
_Parent Released Parties_ ")   in respect of this Agreement, any agreement
executed in connection herewith, and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, including for any loss or damages suffered as a result of the
termination of this Agreement, the failure of the Merger  to be consummated
or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder (whether intentionally,
unintentionally, or otherwise) or otherwise; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
foregoing shall not impair the rights of the Company, if any, (x) to  obtain
injunctive relief and/or specific performance pursuant to Section 8.10 prior

termination Willful Breach of this Agreement by Parent. Upon payment of such
Parent  Termination Fee when due and payable under this Agreement, no Parent
Released Party shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except for any  pre-termination Willful Breach of this Agreement
by Parent and that the obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement and the
provisions described in Section 7.2 shall survive.

 

 

57  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement:

 


 

 

(i) the parties agree that in no event shall the Company or Parent be required
to pay  the Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as the case may
be, on more than one occasion;

 


 

 

(ii) payment of the Termination Fee, if applicable, shall be made by wire
transfer of  same day funds to the account or accounts designated by Parent
(i) on the date of the consummation of any transaction contemplated by an
Acquisition Proposal in the case of a Termination Fee payable pursuant to
Section 7.3(b)(i), (ii) prior to or  concurrently with the termination by the
Company in the case of a Termination Fee payable pursuant to Section

following the termination in accordance with Section 7.3(c).

 


 

 

(e) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained
in this  Section 7.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and (ii) without these agreements, the parties would not enter
into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company or Parent, as the case may
be, fails to timely pay  any amount due pursuant to this Section 7.3, and, in
order to obtain such payment, either Parent or the Company, as the case may
be, commences a suit that results in a judgment against the other party for
the payment of any amount set forth in this  Section 7.3, such paying party
shall pay the other party its reasonable costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit,
together with interest on the amounts due pursuant to this Section 7.3 from 
the date such payment was required to be made until the date of payment at the
annual rate of five percent (5%) plus the prime rate as published by Citibank
N.A. on the date such payment was required to be made through the date such
payment was  actually received, or such lesser rate as is the maximum
permitted by applicable Law.

 


 

 

Section 7.4 _Amendment or Supplement_. This Agreement may be amended, modified
or  supplemented by the parties by action taken or authorized by their
respective Boards of Directors at any time prior to the Effective Time,
whether before or after the Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained;
_provided_ , _however_ ,  that after the Company Stockholder Approval has
been obtained, no amendment may be made that pursuant to applicable Law
requires further approval or adoption by the stockholders of the Company
without such further approval or adoption. This  Agreement may not be
amended, modified or supplemented in any manner, whether by course of conduct
or otherwise, except by an instrument in writing specifically designated as an
amendment hereto, signed on behalf of each of the parties in interest  at the
time of the amendment.

 


 

 

Section 7.5 _Extension of Time; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective
Time,  the parties may, by action taken or authorized by their respective
Boards of Directors, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) extend the
time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of the other party,
(b) waive any  inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the
other parties set forth in this Agreement or any document delivered pursuant
hereto or (c) subject to applicable Law, waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions of the other  parties contained herein; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that after the Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained, no
waiver may be made that pursuant to applicable Law requires further approval
or adoption by the stockholders of the  Company without such further approval
or adoption. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in a written instrument executed and delivered by a
duly authorized officer on behalf of such party. No  failure or delay of any
party in exercising any right or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power,
or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such right or 
power, or any course of conduct, preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right or power.
