an Option Holder Agreement to the Shareholders\' Representative, such Option
Holder shall only be entitled to receive from the Company or the Surviving
Entity, as the case may be, (i) a payment equal to the Option Consideration
Amount only in respect of those Eligible Options not subject to an IRR Hurdle

(other than the Purchaser and Merger Sub) shall thereafter cease to have any
rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock, except the right
to receive, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this

of a certificate or certificates representing such shares of Company Common
Stock (if any such certificates had been issued by the Company with respect
to such shares of Company Common Stock). At the Effective Time, each share of
Company Common Stock held in the Company\'s treasury at the Effective
Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part
of the holder thereof, cease to be outstanding and shall be cancelled
and retired without payment of any Merger Consideration or any
other consideration therefor.

Option Reserve Amount) on and after the Effective Time (including Merger
Consideration, if any, determined to be paid after the Effective Time

and Section 2.13 hereof; and (ii) enter into a written agreement with the
Exchange Agent in form reasonably satisfactory to the Company and
Shareholders\' Representative (the " _Exchange Agent Agreement_ ") for
such purposes.

 

(b) Payment of Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, Purchaser
and/or the Merger Sub shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit
of the holders of Company Common Stock, the Merger Consideration (less
the Aggregate Option Reserve Amount) for (i) exchange in accordance
with this Section 2.08 and (ii) payment to the Paying Agent in
accordance with Section 2.13 (all of such Merger Consideration, together with
and any dividends or distributions with respect to the Stock
Consideration as provided in Section 2.08(d) and 2.09), being
hereinafter collectively referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

 

(c) Notice; Exchange for Merger Consideration. At the time of the
mailing of the Proxy Materials (or promptly thereafter), the Company shall
mail to each holder of record of Company Common Stock whose Company Common
Stock will be converted into the right to receive Merger
Consideration pursuant hereto: (i) a letter (in such form and having such
provisions as are customary for letters of this nature) specifying that
delivery of the Company Common Stock Certificates shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Company Common Stock shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Company Common Stock Certificates to the Exchange Agent, together with
a Transmittal Letter; and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of
such Company Common Stock Certificates and execution by the holder of Company
Common Stock of a joinder page to the Seller Contribution and Indemnity
Agreement in exchange for the payment of Merger Consideration pursuant to the
terms hereof. The Company shall send such materials to the Shareholders in a
manner such that the Shareholders will receive such materials prior to
the Shareholders\' Meeting. Upon surrender of a Company Common
Stock Certificate to the Exchange Agent pursuant to instructions received
by a holder of Company Common Stock together with (a) the Transmittal Letter
and joinder page to the Seller Contribution and Indemnity Agreement, duly
executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and (b)
for each AI Shareholder, a written notification from an officer of Purchaser
evidencing that such shareholder is an AI Shareholder, the Exchange Agent
shall promptly arrange to deliver (x) to each such holder of Company Common
Stock the Merger Consideration calculated pursuant to Section 2.05(a), 
_less_ (I) the amount of any withholding that is required by applicable Tax
Law and (II) the amount of Cash Consideration and Stock Consideration
required to be withheld pursuant to Section 2.13 hereof and (y) to the Paying
Agent such portion of the Stock Consideration and Cash Consideration of such
holder of Company Common Stock as is required pursuant to Section 2.13
hereof; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no payment or distribution shall be
made to any AI Shareholder until and unless, except if the requirement is
waived by the Surviving Entity, such AI Shareholder has executed and
delivered to the Purchaser or the Company a Joinder Signature Page.
Stock Consideration shall be paid in the form of legended certificates
of whole shares of Purchaser Common Stock. Cash Consideration shall be paid
by check or wire transfer. Any Company

 
   

 Common Stock surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be
paid or will accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any of the Company
Common Stock. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock
that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, exchange and
payment may be made with respect to such Company Common Stock to such a
transferee if the Company Common Stock Certificate representing such shares
of Company Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by
all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer. Purchaser
or the Merger Sub shall pay all applicable transfer and stamp Taxes
with respect to the issuance of Purchaser Company Stock. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.08(c), each Company Common
Stock Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time
for all purposes, to represent only the right to receive upon surrender
the Merger Consideration with respect to the shares formerly
represented thereby pursuant to the terms hereof. From and after the
Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(d) Dividends and Distributions on Purchaser Common Stock. No dividends
or other distributions with respect to Purchaser Common Stock with a record
date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any Company
Common Stock with respect to shares of Purchaser Common Stock represented
thereby, and no cash which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
the provisions of this _Article II_ shall be paid to any such holder, and all
such dividends, other distributions and cash shall be paid by Purchaser to
the Exchange Agent and shall be included in the Exchange Fund, in each case
to be disposed of pursuant hereto upon the surrender of such Company Common
Stock Certificate in accordance with this Article II. Subject to the effect
of applicable escheat or similar Laws, following surrender of any such
Company Common Stock Certificate, there shall be delivered to such holder,
without interest, (i) a certificate representing whole shares of
Purchaser Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, and
(ii) at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Purchaser Common Stock
and the amount of cash which such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_. Notwithstanding
any provision of this Section 2.08(d), no additional amount of
Merger Consideration shall be payable, and no other adjustment to the
Merger Consideration shall be made in respect of the Purchaser Stock Split.

 

(e) Timing and Effect of Exchange of Merger Consideration. All shares
of Purchaser Common Stock delivered to the Exchange Agent in accordance with
the terms of this _Article II_ and any cash paid pursuant to this Article II
shall be deemed to have been issued and paid at the Effective Time in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common
Stock, subject, however, to the Surviving Entity\'s obligation to pay
any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior
to the Effective Time which may have been declared or made by the Company on
such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the
Agreement, which remain unpaid at the Effective Time.

 

(f) Fractional Shares of Purchaser Common Stock. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, no certificates or scrip
representing fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock shall be issued in
the Merger upon the surrender for exchange of Company Common Stock, no
dividend or distribution of Purchaser shall relate to such fractional share
interests, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to any rights of a shareholder of Purchaser. In lieu of
the issuance of such fractional shares, the Exchange Agent shall round the
number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock to be issued and delivered
pursuant hereto to the nearest whole number and Purchaser shall make
available to the Exchange Agent any additional number of whole shares
of Purchaser Common Stock as may be necessary for the Exchange Agent to pay
all Stock Consideration.

 

(g) Return of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any interest and other income received by the
Exchange Agent in respect of all such funds) that remains unclaimed by the
holders of Company Common Stock six months after the Effective Time shall
be delivered to the Purchaser. Any holders of Company Common Stock who have
not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to
the Purchaser as general creditors for payment of any Merger Consideration,
without any interest thereon, that may be payable in respect of the Company
Common Stock held by such holder as determined pursuant to this Agreement;
_provided_ , that whenever 

 
   

 the Purchaser pays or distributes the Merger Consideration to any holder of
Common Stock, including to any holder of Dissenting Shares who subsequently
withdraws its claim for appraisal pursuant to Section 2.10, it will pay and
distribute the Merger Consideration to such holder, and if the Seller
Contribution and Indemnity Agreement is still in effect, to the Paying Agent,
in the same amounts, terms and conditions as provided in Section 2.08(c)
for payments and distributions by the Exchange Agent.

 

(h) Delivery of Abandoned Property. None of Purchaser, the Merger Sub,
the Company, the Surviving Entity, the Exchange Agent or any other Person
shall be liable to any former holder of Company Common Stock or any Option
Holder for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

 

(i) Lost Certificates. In the event any Company Common
Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Company
Common Stock Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and, if required
by the Surviving Entity, the posting by such Person of a bond in
such reasonable amount as the Surviving Entity may direct as
indemnity against any claim which may be made against it with respect to
such Company Common Stock Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue,
in each case, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Common
Stock Certificate, the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof
pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(j) Fees of Exchange Agent. Subject to clause (ii) of the definition of
Expenses, in addition to the other deposits to be made by Purchaser in
the Exchange Fund, Purchaser shall separately pay (a) all of the fees
and expenses of the Exchange Agent, and (b) all of the fees and
expenses related to the preparation, handling and mailing of 1099 Tax forms
with respect to payments from the Exchange Fund.

 

(k) Taxes. In the event that any amounts are withheld for the payment
of Taxes as permitted by this Agreement from any payments from the Exchange
Fund to a holder of Company Common Stock or an Option Holder in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made, such withheld amounts shall be
held in trust and paid in a timely manner to the applicable Governmental
Authorities on account of such Tax liabilities and treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company Common
Stock or Option Holder in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

 

2.09 _Adjustment of Stock Consideration_. If, between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, the number or class of outstanding shares
of Purchaser Common Stock is changed into a different number of shares or a
different class as a result of a stock split, reverse stock split,
subdivision, reclassification, combination, exchange, recapitalization or
other similar transaction, or a stock dividend or dividend payable in any
other securities shall be declared with a record date within such period, or
any similar event has occurred, then the Stock Consideration shall be
adjusted accordingly to provide to the holders of Company Common Stock the
same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that no adjustment shall be made in respect of the
Purchaser Stock Split, as the Stock Consideration has been calculated to take
into effect the occurrence of the Purchaser Stock Split.

 

2.10 _Dissenting Shares_. (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, each outstanding share of Company Common Stock the
holder of which (x) has not voted in favor of or consented to the Merger, (y)
has perfected such holder\'s right to an appraisal of such holder\'s
shares in accordance with the applicable provisions of the MBCA and (z)
has not effectively withdrawn or lost such right to appraisal (a "
_Dissenting Share_ "), shall not be converted into or represent a right to
receive the Merger Consideration, the holder thereof shall be entitled only
to such rights as are granted by the applicable provisions of the MBCA, and,
subject to the rights of the Surviving Entity set forth herein and the
MBCA, the Surviving Entity shall promptly pay the amount, if any, to
which such holders are entitled to pursuant to applicable provisions of
the MBCA; _provided_ , _however_ , that any Dissenting Share held by a
person at the Effective Time who shall, after the Effective Time, withdraw
the demand for appraisal or lose the right of appraisal, in either case
pursuant to the MBCA, shall be deemed to be converted into, as of the
Effective Time, the right to receive an amount of cash for each Dissenting
Share equal to the Merger Consideration Price Per Share pursuant to the terms
and conditions of this _Article II_.

 
   

(b) The Company shall give Purchaser and the Merger Sub (x) prompt notice
of any written demands for appraisal, withdrawals of demands for appraisal
and any other instruments served pursuant to the applicable provisions of the
MBCA relating to the appraisal process received by the Company and (y)
from and after the Effective Time, the opportunity to direct
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under
the MBCA. Except with the prior written consent of Purchaser, the Company
will not voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisal and will not settle or offer to settle any such demands.

 

2.11 _Subsequent Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Entity shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of
sale, assignments, assurances and any other actions or things are necessary,
desirable or proper to vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in
the Surviving Entity its rights, title or interest in, to or under any of the
rights, properties or assets of the Constituent Entities as a result of, or
in connection with, the Merger, the officers and directors of the Surviving
Entity shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on
behalf of the Constituent Entities, all such deeds, bills of sale,
assignments and assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of
the Constituent Entities or otherwise, all such other actions and things
as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and

in good standing in each jurisdiction where the nature of its business
or the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets and properties renders
such qualification, license or good standing necessary, except where such

reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The jurisdictions
where the Company and each Company Subsidiary is so qualified or licensed to
do business as a foreign corporation are set forth on _Schedule 3.01 of the

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other covenant herein contained,
in connection with the receipt of any necessary approvals under any Antitrust

TAX MATTERS

 (a) Return Filings. (i) Purchaser shall prepare and timely file or
cause to be timely filed all Returns required to be filed by or with
respect to the Company for (x) taxable years or periods ending on or prior
to the Closing Date, the due date for filing of which (taking into
account extensions) is after the Closing Date, and (y) taxable years or
periods including, but ending after, the Closing Date (any such period, a "
_Straddle Period_ "), and shall remit any Taxes due in respect of such
Returns.

 

(ii) Purchaser shall provide the Shareholders\' Representative with a copy
of any Return for a taxable period that precedes the Closing Date, or
includes the Closing Date and also includes Taxes for which the
Signing Shareholders may be liable at least twenty (20) days prior to the
due date for filing the Return (including extensions). The Shareholders\'
Representative shall have the right to object to such Return within ten (10)
days of receipt of such Return only on the grounds that such Return is
inconsistent with applicable Law or shifts Taxes from the post-acquisition to
the pre-acquisition period. If the Shareholders\' Representative objects to a
Return, the Shareholders\' Representative and Purchaser agree to use
their best efforts to resolve the dispute. Any dispute not resolved
within twenty (20) days after an objection shall be submitted to
the Independent Accountant. The Independent Accountant\'s review shall be
limited to the disputed item and shall be concluded within ten (10) days.
Each party shall bear fifty percent (50%) of the cost of such Independent
Accountant, except that the Shareholders\' Representative shall bear the full
cost if there are no material adjustments to such Return or Purchaser shall
bear the full cost if there are material adjustments to such Return.

 

(b) Certain Straddle Period Determinations. In the case of any Straddle
Period (i) real, personal and intangible property Taxes (" _Property Taxes_
") for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be equal to the amount of such
Property Taxes for such entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the number of days during the Straddle Period that
are in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which is the number
of days in the Straddle Period; and (ii) all other Taxes for the Pre-Closing
Tax Period shall be determined based on actual closing of the books as if
such taxable period ended as of the close of business on the Closing Date
and, in the case of any Taxes attributable to the ownership of any equity
interest in any partnership or other "flow through" entity, based on an
actual closing of the books as if the taxable period of such partnership
or other "flow through" entity ended as of the close of business on the
Closing Date.

 

(c) Tax Certificates. At or prior to the Closing, (i) the
Company shall deliver to Purchaser at the Closing, and shall timely provide
to the Internal Revenue Service, a Notice of Non U.S. Real Property Holding
Corporation Status which meets the requirements of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.897-2(h) and is sufficient to exempt the transactions contemplated
hereby from withholding pursuant to the provisions of the Foreign Investment
in Real Property Tax Act; and (ii) the Company, and the Signing Shareholders,
if applicable, shall deliver to Purchaser or the Exchange Agent such other
clearance certificate(s) or similar document(s) which may be required by any
Tax Authority to relieve Purchaser, the Company or the Surviving Entity of
(a) any obligation to withhold Taxes in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b) any liability for
Taxes (determined without regard to provisions

 
   

 of this Agreement assigning responsibility therefor) for which relief is
available by reason of the filing of an appropriate certificate or other
document.

 

(d) Transfer Taxes. The Signing Shareholders, on the one hand
(which obligation may be paid on their behalf by the
Shareholders\' Representative), and Purchaser, on the other, shall each pay
one-half of all transfer, documentary, registration and similar Taxes not
based on net income together with any related fees, penalties, interest
and additions to such Taxes (excluding stock transfer taxes which shall
be solely borne solely by Purchaser) (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") for which such
Signing Shareholder is legally the primarily responsible party (including all
applicable real estate transfer or gains Taxes and stock transfer Taxes),
incurred in connection with and as a result of the transfer or conversion of
the shares of Company Common Stock and the Merger. Each Signing Shareholder,
the Shareholders\' Representative and Purchaser shall cooperate in timely
preparing and filing all Returns as may be required to comply with the
provisions of such Tax Laws. Each party shall use its reasonable best efforts
to avail itself of any available exemptions from any Transfer Taxes, and
shall cooperate with the other parties in timely providing any information
and documentation, including resale certificates, that may be necessary to
obtain such exemptions.

 

(e) Tax Elections. After the date this Agreement is signed, neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall make or change any Tax election,
change an annual Tax accounting period, adopt or change any Tax accounting
method, file any amended Return, enter into any closing agreement, settle any
Tax Claim or assessment, surrender any right to claim a refund of Taxes,
consent to any extension or waiver of the statute of limitations period
applicable to any Tax Claim or assessment, take any other action or omit to
take any action, if any such election, adoption, change, amendment,
agreement, settlement, surrender, consent or other action or omission would
have the effect of increasing the Tax liability or reducing any
net operating loss, net capital loss, investment tax credit, foreign
tax credit, charitable deduction or any other credit or tax attribute of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary which could reduce Taxes (including,
without limitation, deductions and credits related to alternative minimum
Taxes) without the prior written consent of Purchaser, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

(f) No 368(a) Disqualification Events. Neither Purchaser, Merger Sub
nor the Company shall take any action that would prevent the Merger from
qualifying as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code.

10.04 _Notification of Claims_. (a) In the event of the occurrence of

Shareholders and/or the Signing Shareholders, as applicable, and, if prior to
Closing, to the Company (such party or parties hereinafter referred to as the
" _Indemnifying Party_ ") and shall otherwise make available to
the Indemnifying Party all relevant information which is material to
the claim and which is in the possession of the Indemnified Party.
An Indemnified Party\'s failure to give timely notice or to furnish the
Indemnifying Party with any relevant data and documents in connection with
any Third Party Claim (as defined below) shall not constitute a defense (in
part or in whole) to any claim for indemnification by such party, except and
only to the extent that such failure shall result in any prejudice to the
Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties shall have no obligation hereunder to give notice for any claims
relating to any Losses arising from any matter described on any Schedule or
Exhibit to this Agreement.

 

(b) If such event involves the claim of any third party (a " _Third
Party Claim_ "), the Indemnifying Party may elect, at such party\'s sole
expense (without prejudice to the right of the Indemnified Party to
participate at its own expense through counsel of its own choosing), to
assume control of the defense, settlement, adjustment or compromise of any
Third Party Claim, with counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified
Party, if the Indemnifying Party gives written notice of its intention to do
so no later than thirty (30) days following notice thereof by an Indemnified
Party or such shorter time period as required so that the interests of
the Indemnified Party would not be materially prejudiced as a result of
the failure to have received such notice, and the Indemnifying Party
shall be entitled to maintain such control for so long as it actively
and diligently pursues continue such defense, settlement, adjustment
or compromise; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Indemnified Party shall
have reasonably concluded that separate counsel is required because either
(i) a conflict of interest would otherwise exist, (ii) the Third Party Claim
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Indemnified Party or (iii) the Third Party Claim and any claims that may be
related thereto could reasonably be likely to exceed the amount of
indemnification available to the Indemnified Party (either pursuant to the
terms of this _Article X_ or as a result of the Indemnifying Party(ies)
available financial resources), the Indemnified Party shall have the right
to select separate counsel to participate in the defense of such action
on its behalf, at the expense of the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Party and Indemnified Party shall use all reasonable efforts to cooperate in
such defense. If the Indemnifying Party does not so choose to assume control
of the defense, settlement, adjustment or compromise of any such Third Party
Claim for which any Indemnified Party would be entitled to indemnification
hereunder, then the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to elect to join
in the defense, settlement, adjustment or compromise of any such Third
Party Claim, and to employ counsel to assist such Indemnifying Party
in connection with the handling of such claim, at the sole expense of
the Indemnifying Party, and no such claim shall be settled, adjusted
or compromised, or the defense thereof terminated by the Indemnified Party,
without the prior consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless and until the Indemnifying Party
shall have failed, after the lapse of a reasonable period of time, but in no
event more than thirty (30) days after written notice to it of the Third
Party Claim, to join in the defense, settlement, adjustment or compromise of
the same. No Indemnified Party may settle, compromise or

 
   

 consent to the entry of any judgment in any Third Party Claim for which
indemnification may be sought hereunder unless such settlement, compromise or
consent also includes an express, unconditional release of the Indemnifying
Party and their directors, officers, agents, shareholders, consultants,
employees and controlling persons from all liabilities and obligations
arising therefrom. No Indemnifying Party may settle, compromise or consent to
the entry of any judgment in any Third Party Claim for which indemnification
may be sought hereunder without the prior written consent of each
Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed if such settlement, compromise or consent (i) is for money damages
only, (ii) the Indemnifying Party assumes complete financial
responsibility for such settlement, compromise or consent (and demonstrates
to the Indemnified Party that it has available all required
financial resources therefor), (iii) could not otherwise be likely to cause
a Material Adverse Effect on the Indemnified Party and (iv) includes
an express, unconditional release of the Indemnified Party and
their directors, officers, agents, shareholders, consultants, employees

arising therefrom.

Shareholder that is not also a Principal Shareholder under or pursuant to
this Agreement and the Seller Ancillary Agreements. Furthermore, no
indemnification payment in respect of indemnification required to be made to
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties pursuant to Sections 8.02(a) and
10.3(a) shall be required to be made by any Non-AI Shareholder in an
amount that is excess of the portion of such Non-AI\'s Merger Consideration
paid or payable to the Paying Agent pursuant to Section 2.13 hereof.

 

(b) Limitations on Indemnification by Purchaser Indemnified Parties. If
the Closing occurs, no indemnification payment shall be made to the Seller
Indemnified Parties pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii) of Section 10.3(b)
(other than with respect to breaches or inaccuracies of the representations
and warranties set forth in Sections 4.02 or 4.04 of this Agreement)
until the amounts that the Seller Indemnified Parties would otherwise
be entitled to receive as indemnification under this Agreement aggregate at
least the Indemnification Threshold, at which time the Seller Indemnified
Parties shall be indemnified dollar-for-dollar for the full amount of
indemnification hereunder without giving effect to the Indemnification
Threshold; _provided_ , _however_ , that no indemnification payment in
respect of indemnification required to be made pursuant to clause (i) of
Section 10.3(b) (other than with respect to breaches or inaccuracies of the
representations and warranties set forth in Sections 4.02 or 4.04 of this
Agreement) shall be required to be made to the Seller Indemnification Parties
in excess of the Limited General Indemnification Cap.

 
   

(c) Deductions from Indemnification Obligations. For purposes of
determining the extent of and limitations on indemnification under this
_Article X_ , the amount of any Losses that may be subject to
indemnification hereunder will be determined net of (i) the sum of any
amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Party under insurance policies
with respect to such Losses, _provided_ that the amount of Losses shall be
increased by the present value of all future increases in insurance premiums
that are demonstrable as of the time of the Indemnified Party\'s recovery
from the Indemnifying Party and that result directly from the making of such
claim and (ii) except as expressly specified in this Agreement or the Company
Disclosure Schedule, any actual refund of Taxes paid by the Indemnified Party
or any actual reduction in the amount of any Tax liability which
would otherwise be payable by the Indemnified Party, in each such case
for any time period ending on or prior to December 31, 2009.

 

10.06 _Payment of Claims_.

 

(a) Timing of Payment. With regard to any and all claims for
which indemnification is payable hereunder, such indemnification shall
be paid by the Indemnifying Party upon the earliest to occur of (i)
the entry of a judgment against the Indemnified Party and the expiration
of any applicable appeal period, or if earlier, five Business Days prior to
the date that the judgment creditor has the right to execute the judgment,
(ii) the entry of an unappealable judgment or final appellate decision
against the Indemnified Party or (iii) a settlement of the claim. The
earliest to occur of clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) above is referred to herein
as a " _Final Determination_ ". Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the reasonable legal fees and expenses of counsel to the Indemnified
Party shall be reimbursed on a current basis by the Indemnifying Party
if such legal fees and expenses are a liability of the Indemnifying
Party. With regard to other claims for which indemnification is
payable hereunder, such indemnification shall be paid promptly by
the Indemnifying Party upon demand by the Indemnified Party.

 

(b) Election for Source of Payment. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, if the Closing occurs, any indemnification obligations of the
Signing Shareholders under  _Article VIII_ or _X_ of this Agreement payable
to Purchaser, the Company or the Surviving Entity may, at the election
of the Shareholders\' Representative or the Signing Shareholder, as the case
may be, be paid by reconveying to Purchaser an amount of shares of Stock
Consideration delivered to the Signing Shareholders or the Paying Agent as
Merger Consideration up to an amount equal to that portion of such Signing
Shareholders indemnification obligation  _multiplied by_ a fraction (i) the
numerator of which is the Stock Consideration Per Share Value _multiplied by_
the number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock received as Merger
Consideration by such Signing Shareholder (or the Paying Agent on behalf of
such Signing Shareholder) and (ii) the denominator of which is the aggregate
amount of Merger Consideration received by such Signing Shareholder (or
the Paying Agent on behalf of such Signing Shareholder). The parties
agree that the only shares of Purchaser Common Stock that may be
reconveyed to Purchaser in satisfaction of any indemnification
obligations hereunder by a Signing Shareholder are the shares of Purchaser
Common Stock delivered to such Signing Shareholder (or the Paying Agent
on behalf of such Signing Shareholder) as Stock Consideration hereunder and
only with respect to such shares that have not been subsequently transferred
to a third party by such Signing Shareholder (or the Paying Agent on behalf
of such Signing Shareholder). Any shares of Stock Consideration reconveyed to
Purchaser in consideration of indemnification obligations pursuant to this
Section 10.6(b) shall be valued at the Stock Consideration Per Share Value.

 

10.07 _No Circular Recovery_. Each Signing Shareholder hereby agrees
that, after the Closing, such Signing Shareholder will not make any claim for
indemnification against Purchaser, Merger Sub, the Surviving Entity or any
Company Subsidiary by reason of the fact that such Signing Shareholder was a
controlling person, director, officer, employee or representative of the
Company or a Company Subsidiary or was serving as such for another Person at
the request of Purchaser, Merger Sub, the Surviving Entity, the Company or a
Company Subsidiary (whether such claim is for Losses of any kind or otherwise
and whether such claim is pursuant to any statute, Governing Document,
contractual obligation or otherwise) with respect to any claim brought by a
Purchaser Indemnified Party against any Signing Shareholder pursuant to this
_Article X_. With respect to any claim brought by a Purchaser Indemnified
Party against any Signing Shareholder relating to this Agreement or any
Seller Ancillary Agreement, each Signing Shareholder expressly waives any
right of subrogation, contribution, advancement, indemnification or 

 
   

 other claim against Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Entity or any
Company Subsidiary with respect to any amounts owed by such Signing
Shareholder pursuant to this _Article X_.

 

10.08 _Exclusive Remedy_. The parties hereto hereby acknowledge and
agree that the indemnification provisions in _Article VIII_ and _Article X_
shall be the sole and exclusive rights and remedies of the parties with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including,
without limitation, with respect to (a) any misrepresentation, breach
or default of or under any of the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements contained in this Agreement, or (b) any failure to duly perform or
observe any term, provision, covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Agreement shall be
deemed to limit any rights or remedies in the event of fraud of a party; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that nothing set forth herein shall be deemed to
limit the right of Purchaser and Merger Sub to seek equitable relief. Without
limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, and except with respect to
a claim for fraud, no legal action sounding in contribution, tort or strict
liability may be maintained by any party hereto, or any of their respective
officers, directors, employees, stockholders, representatives, agents,
successors or assigns, against any other party hereto with respect to any
matter that is the subject of this Section 10.08.

Purchaser by the Shareholders\' Representative (or its
designated representatives).

 

(f) In connection with this Agreement, and any instrument, agreement or
document relating hereto or thereto, and in exercising or failing to exercise
all or any of the powers conferred upon the Shareholders\' Representative
hereunder, the Shareholders\' Representative (in its capacity
as Shareholders\' Representative) shall incur no responsibility whatsoever
to Purchaser, Merger Sub, the Surviving Entity or any Purchaser Indemnified
