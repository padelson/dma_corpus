Section 2.04. _Certificate of Formation and Limited Liability
Company Agreement of the Surviving Company_. At and after the Effective Time,
the certificate of formation and limited liability company agreement of Arrow
Bidco, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the
certificate of formation and limited liability company agreement of the
Surviving Company, in each case, until amended in accordance with the
Delaware Act.

  



  

Section 2.05. _Managers and Officers of the Surviving Company_. From
and after the Effective Time, the Persons serving as managers and/or officers
of Arrow Bidco immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial
managers and/or officers of the Surviving Company until their respective

earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of
formation and bylaws of the Surviving Company and applicable Law.

  



  

Section 2.06. _Effect on Membership Interests_. At and after the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
any Party or the holders of any of the securities of any Party, all
membership interests of Target Parent issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled, retired and shall
cease to exist, and the Seller shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

  



  

Section 2.07. _Merger Consideration_.

  



  

(a) The Membership Interests outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive
aggregate consideration in an amount equal to $820.0 million (which amount is
inclusive of amounts required to pay third party and
intercompany Indebtedness as of Closing as contemplated by _Section
2.08(a)(i)(A)_ and _(B)_ below and net of Transaction Expenses), of which (i)
$562.0 million shall be paid in cash (the "Cash Consideration") and (ii)
$258.0 million shall be paid in the form of 25,800,000 shares of common
stock, par value $0.0001, of ListCo in the same class as shares held by
Founders (the "Stock Consideration" and together with the Cash Consideration,
the "Merger Consideration");  _provided_ that the Cash Consideration paid to
Seller at Closing shall be increased by the amount of (i) any excess cash
proceeds received from the Debt Financing, Trust Account and Equity Offering,
if applicable, after taking into account the payments set forth in _Section
2.09(a)_ , and (ii) any Cash on the balance sheet of the combined businesses
of Target and Signor, after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by
the Signor Merger Agreement, in excess of $5.0 million; _provided further_
 that the Stock Consideration shall be reduced on a dollar for dollar basis
to the extent the Cash Consideration is increased pursuant to clause (ii)
above.

  



  

(b) The Cash Consideration will come from the following sources: (i)
the gross proceeds of debt financing to be obtained by the Holdco Acquiror in
an amount equal to at least $340.0 million (the "Debt Financing"); and (ii)
the aggregate gross cash proceeds, less Transaction Expenses, from (A) the
Trust Account, after giving effect to any and all redemptions, as of
the Closing Date (the "Trust Account Proceeds"), (B) upon the prior written
consent of the Seller, which may be granted or withheld in the Seller's sole
discretion, the proceeds from the Equity Offering ("Equity Offering
Proceeds"), and (C) upon the prior written consent of the Seller, any
additional equity capital outside the Trust Account through a
private investment in public equity (PIPE) or other equity offering to fund
any shortfall of Minimum Proceeds from the Trust Account, after taking into
account the Equity Offering Proceeds (the "Backstop Offering"); provided,
however, that the written consent of the Seller shall not be required under
this clause (C) if the Backstop Offering consists solely of the sale of
common shares of ListCo at a price per share of at least $10.00. For the
avoidance of doubt, the gross cash proceeds from (x) distributions of the
amounts held the Trust Account, after giving effect to redemptions of public
shares of Parent Acquiror, and (y) any Equity Offering Proceeds, before
paying Transaction Expenses, will equal at least $225.0 million (the "Minimum
Proceeds"). Seller may waive the requirement to deliver the Minimum Proceeds
and may cause ListCo to engage in Backstop Offering in which the Seller,
Arrow Holdings or their respective Affiliates may participate in their sole
discretion; provided that the Founders and their respective Affiliates and
designees shall have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase up to 50%
of the equity to be issued in connection with such Backstop Offering on the
same terms and conditions as the Seller, Arrow Holdings and their
Affiliates, as the case may be.

Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable and current determination
or opinion letter as to its qualification from the IRS and, to the Knowledge
of Seller, there are no existing circumstances or any events that have
occurred that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualified
status of any such plan; (iii) no Company Benefit Plan provides benefits,
including death or medical benefits (whether or not insured), with respect to
current or former employees or directors of the Acquired Companies beyond

pension benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA subject to Code

(e) Each Company Benefit Plan has been maintained and operated in
documentary and operational compliance with Section 409A of the Code or an
available exemption therefrom. No Acquired Company has any obligation under
any Company Benefit Plan to compensate any person for excise Taxes payable
pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code or for Taxes payable pursuant to Section
409A or 457A of the Code.

  



  

(f) (i) Each Company Benefit Plan that is not subject to U.S. Law
(each, a "Company Foreign Benefit Plan") has been established, maintained and
administered in compliance with its terms and applicable Laws and, if intended
to qualify for special tax treatment, meets all the requirements for such
treatment; (ii) all employer and employee contributions to each
Company Foreign Benefit Plan required by its terms or by applicable Law have

accounting practices in the applicable jurisdiction applied to such matters;
(iii) if they are intended to qualify for special tax treatment, meet all
requirements for such treatment; (iv) if required, are registered and approved
with any applicable Government Authority; and (v) the fair market value of
the assets of each funded Company Foreign Benefit Plan, the liability of each
insurer for any Company Foreign Benefit Plan funded through insurance or the
book reserve established for any Company Foreign Benefit Plan, together with
any accrued contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide for the accrued
benefit obligations, as of the date of this Agreement, with respect to all
current and former participants in such plan according to the actuarial
assumptions and valuations most recently used to determine employer
contributions to such Company Foreign Benefit Plan, and no Transaction shall
cause such assets or insurance obligations to be less than such benefit
obligations. No Company Foreign Benefit Plan is a defined benefit pension
plan or provides post-employment health or life insurance benefits. No Company
Foreign Benefit Plan is or is intended to be a "registered pension plan," a
"deferred profit sharing plan," a "retirement compensation arrangement," a
"registered retirement savings plan," a "pooled registered pension plan," or
a "tax-free savings account" as such terms are defined in the Income Tax Act
(Canada) and the regulations thereunder, as amended. Each Company Foreign
Plan has the level of insurance reserves that is reasonable and sufficient to
provide for all incurred but unreported claims.

  



  

(g) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan and Company Foreign
Benefit Plan, all required, declared, or discretionary (in accordance with
historical practices) payments, premiums, contributions, reimbursements or
accruals for all periods ending prior to, or as of, the date hereof, have
been properly paid or properly accrued on a balance sheet, or on the books and
records of the Acquired Companies, in all material respects. No insurance
policy or any other agreement affecting any Company Benefit Plan or Company
Foreign Benefit Plan requires or permits a retroactive increase in
contributions, premiums, or other payments due under such policy
or agreement.

3.12_ will apply.

permitted or contemplated by this Agreement and (d) for liabilities that have

Companies to perform under or comply with any applicable Law, Action,
judgment or Contract, but would include such liabilities and obligations if
there has been a default or failure to perform or comply by the Acquired
Companies with any such liability or obligation if such default or failure

all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Acquirors or such Acquired Companies, as the case may be, shall assume all of
the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.05_.

JOINT COVENANTS OF SELLER AND ACQUIRORS

  



  

Section 7.01. _Access; Confidentiality; Notice of Certain Events_.

  



  

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the Closing Date or the
date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Section 9.01_ , to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Seller and
Acquirors shall, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries (if
applicable), to afford to the other Party and to the Representatives of such
other Party reasonable access during normal business hours and upon
reasonable advance notice to all of their respective properties, offices,
books, Contracts, commitments, personnel and records (in each case, whether
in physical or electronic form) and, during such period, the Seller and
Acquirors shall, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to,
furnish reasonably promptly to the other Party any and all information
(financial or otherwise) concerning its and its Subsidiaries' business,
properties and personnel as such other Party may reasonably request.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Seller nor the Acquirors shall be
required by this _Section 7.01(a)_ to provide the other Party or the
Representatives of such other Party with access to, or to disclose information
that is subject to the terms of a confidentiality agreement with a third
party entered into prior to the date of this Agreement, the disclosure
of which would violate any Law or duty or that is subject to any attorney-
client, attorney work product or other legal privilege ( _provided_ , 
_however_ , that the withholding Party shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to allow for such access or disclosure to the maximum extent that
does not result in a loss of any such attorney-client, attorney work product
or other legal privilege). The Seller and Acquirors will use commercially
reasonable efforts to minimize any disruption to the business of the Acquired
Companies that may result from the requests for access, data and information
hereunder.

(b) The Seller and Acquirors will hold, and will cause their
respective Representatives and Affiliates to hold, any non-public
information, including any information exchanged pursuant to _Section
7.01(a)_ , in confidence in accordance with, and will otherwise comply with,
the terms of the confidentiality provisions of the Term Sheet.

  



  

(c) The Seller shall give prompt notice to the Acquirors, and the
Acquirors shall give prompt notice to the Seller (i) of any notice or other
communication received by such Party from any Governmental Authority in
connection with this Agreement or the Transactions, or from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection
with the Transactions; (ii) of any legal proceeding commenced or, to any
Party's knowledge, threatened against such Party or any of its Subsidiaries
or Affiliates or otherwise relating to, involving or affecting such Party or
any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, in each case in connection with,
arising from or otherwise relating to the Transactions; (iii) upon becoming
aware of the occurrence or impending occurrence of any event or circumstance
relating to it or any of the Subsidiaries of the Acquired Companies or the
Acquirors, that would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect or an Acquiror Material Adverse
Effect, or that would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay or
impede the consummation of the Transactions;  _provided_ , _however_ , that
the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 7.01(c)_ shall not cure
any breach of any representation or warranty requiring disclosure of such
matter prior to the date of this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the
remedies available hereunder to any Party. The failure to deliver any such
notice shall not affect any of the conditions set forth in _Article VIII_ or
give rise to any right to terminate under _Section 9.01_.

  



  

Section 7.02. _Preparation of Proxy Statement/Registration
Statement_.

  



  

(a) As promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement
(provided that the Seller has provided to the Acquirors all of
the information described in _Section 7.02(d)_ hereof), (i) the Acquirors
shall prepare and file with the SEC materials that shall include the proxy
statement/prospectus to be filed with the SEC as part of the Registration
Statement and sent to the shareholders of the Parent Acquiror relating to the
Acquiror Shareholders Meeting (such proxy statement/prospectus, together with
any amendments or supplements thereto, the "Proxy Statement") and (ii) the
Acquirors shall prepare (with the Seller's reasonable cooperation) and file
with the SEC the Registration Statement, in which the Proxy Statement will be
included as a prospectus, in connection with the registration under the
Securities Act of the Parent Ordinary Shares to be issued in connection with
the Domestication and the Transactions. The Acquirors shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement and the Proxy
Statement to comply with the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, to
have the Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act
as promptly as practicable after such filing and to keep the Registration
Statement effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Transactions.
The Parent Acquiror shall set a record date (the "Acquiror Record Date") for
determining the shareholders of the Parent Acquiror entitled to attend the
Acquiror Shareholders Meeting. The Acquirors also agree to use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law or "blue
sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the Transactions, and the
Seller shall furnish all information concerning the Acquired Companies and
any of their respective shareholders as may be reasonably requested in
connection with any such action. The Acquirors will cause the Proxy Statement
to be mailed to each shareholder who was a shareholder of the Parent Acquiror
as of the Acquiror Record Date promptly after the Registration Statement is
declared effective under the Securities Act.

  



    

 | 36| 
---|---|--- 

 

 | | 
---|---|--- 

    



  

(b) The Acquirors will advise the Seller, promptly after the
Acquirors receive notice thereof, of the time when the Proxy
Statement/Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement or
amendment has been filed, of the issuance of any stop order or the
suspension of the qualification of the Parent Ordinary Shares for offering or
sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or written threat of any
proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by the SEC for the
amendment or supplement of the Proxy Statement/Registration Statement or for
additional information. The Seller and its counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement/Registration
Statement and any other document each time before any such document is filed
with the SEC, and the Acquirors shall give reasonable and good faith
consideration to any comments made by the Seller and its counsel. The
Acquirors shall provide the Seller and its counsel with (i) any comments or
other communications, whether written or oral, that the Acquirors or their
counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect
to the Proxy Statement/Registration Statement promptly after receipt of those
comments or other communications and (ii) a reasonable opportunity to
participate in the response of the Acquirors to those comments and to provide
comments on that response (to which reasonable and good faith consideration
shall be given), including by participating in any discussions or meetings
with the SEC.

  



  

(c) The Seller and Acquirors shall ensure that none of the
information supplied by or on its behalf for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in (i) the Registration Statement will, at the time the
Registration Statement is filed with the SEC, at each time at which it is
amended and at the time it becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading or (ii)
the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to the
shareholders of the Acquirors and at the time of the Acquiror Shareholders
Meeting contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. If at any time prior to the Closing any information relating
to the Seller, Target, the Acquirors or any of their respective Subsidiaries,
Affiliates, directors or officers is discovered by the Seller or the
Acquirors that is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to
the Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement so that such document would
not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, the Party that discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other Party and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent
required by Law, disseminated to the shareholders of the Parent Acquiror.

  



  

(d) The Seller acknowledges that a substantial portion of the
Registration Statement will include disclosure regarding the Seller,
the Acquired Companies, their respective officers, directors and
stockholders, and their business, management, operations and
financial condition. Accordingly, the Seller agrees to, and agrees to cause
the Acquired Companies to, as promptly as reasonably practicable, use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Acquirors with all such
information that is required or reasonably requested by the Acquirors to be
included in the Registration Statement or any other statement, filing, notice
or application required to be made by or on behalf of the Acquirors to the
SEC or NASDAQ in connection with the Transactions.

  



  

Section 7.03. _Governmental Approvals and Other Third-party
Consents_.

  



  

(a) Each Party shall, as promptly as possible, use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain, or cause to be obtained, all consents,
authorizations, orders and approvals from all Governmental Authorities that
may be or become necessary for its execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the performance of its obligations pursuant to this Agreement.
Each Party shall cooperate fully with the other Party and its Affiliates in
promptly seeking to obtain all such consents, authorizations, orders and
approvals. The Parties shall not willfully take any action that will have the
effect of delaying, impairing or impeding the receipt of any required
consents, authorizations, orders or approvals.

  



    

 | 37| 
---|---|--- 

 

 | |

(b) All analyses, appearances, meetings, discussions, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, filings, arguments, and proposals made by or on behalf of
either Party before any Governmental Authority or the staff or regulators of
any Governmental Authority, in connection with the Transactions (but, for the
avoidance of doubt, not including any interactions between the Seller or the
Acquired Companies with Governmental Authorities in the ordinary course of
business, any disclosure that is not permitted by Law or any
disclosure containing confidential information) shall be disclosed to the
other Party in advance of any filing, submission or attendance, it being the
intent that the Parties will consult and cooperate with one another, and
consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with any such
analyses, appearances, meetings, discussions, presentations, memoranda,
briefs, filings, arguments and proposals. Each Party shall give notice to the
other party with respect to any meeting, discussion, appearance or contact
with any Governmental Authority or the staff or regulators of any
Governmental Authority, with such notice being sufficient to provide the
other Party with the opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting,
discussion, appearance or contact.

  



  

(c) The Seller and the Acquirors shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to give all notices to, and obtain all consents from, all
third parties that are described in _Section 3.04(b) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedules_ and _Section 4.03(b) of the Acquiror Disclosure Schedules_ ;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Seller shall not be obligated to pay any
consideration therefor to any third party from whom consent or approval is
requested.

  



  

Section 7.04. _Debt Financing_.

  



  

(a) The Holdco Acquiror has obtained a debt commitment letter, dated
as of the date hereof (such letter, together with all annexes and exhibits
attached thereto and the executed fee letter, dated as of the date hereof, as
amended, modified, waived, supplemented, extended or replaced in accordance
with the terms therein and herein, and in the case of the fee letter which may
be redacted in respect of numeric fee amounts, economic terms and "market
flex" provisions specified therein, collectively, the "Debt Commitment
Letter"), pursuant to which the Debt Financing Sources have committed, subject
to the terms and conditions thereof, to lend to the Holdco Acquiror the
amounts set forth therein for, among other things, the purposes of financing
the Transactions, to the extent set forth herein.

  



  

(b) Each of the Acquirors and the Seller shall, and the Seller shall
cause the Acquired Companies to, use commercially reasonable efforts to take
(or cause to be taken) all actions, and to do (or cause to be done) all things
necessary, proper or advisable such that prior to the Closing the Holdco
Acquiror may consummate the Debt Financing, which, together with the funds in
the Trust Account and the proceeds of the Equity Offering and the proceeds of
the Backstop Offering, if applicable, shall be sufficient to consummate the
Transactions, including by using commercially reasonable efforts to (i)
negotiate definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing (the "Debt
Financing Documents"); (ii) satisfy (or, if deemed advisable by the
Acquirors and the Seller, seek a waiver of) on a timely basis all conditions
in any Debt Financing Documents that are within its control and otherwise
comply with its obligations thereunder; (iii) maintain in effect any Debt
Financing Documents until the Transactions are consummated or this Agreement
is terminated in accordance with its terms; and (iv) enforce its rights under
any Debt Financing Documents in the event of a breach by any counterparty
thereto that would reasonably be expected to materially impede or delay the
Closing. The Seller and each of the Acquirors shall give the other Party
prompt oral and written notice of any material breach or default by any party
to any Debt Financing Documents or any Alternative Financing, in each case of
which it has become aware, and any purported termination or repudiation by
any party to any Debt Financing Documents or any Alternative Financing, in
each case of which it has become aware, or upon receipt of written notice of
any material dispute or disagreement between or among the parties to any Debt
Financing Documents or any Alternative Financing or any Debt Financing Source.
In the event any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the
terms and conditions contemplated in any Debt Financing Documents, each of the
Acquirors and the Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
promptly arrange to obtain alternative financing ("Alternative Financing")
from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to consummate the
Transactions on terms and conditions no less favorable to the Holdco Acquiror
than the terms and conditions under the Debt Commitment Letter. In such event,
the term "Debt Financing" as used in this Agreement shall be deemed to
include any Alternative Financing and the term "Debt Commitment Letter" as
used in this Agreement shall be deemed to include any commitment letters
entered into with respect to any Alternative Financing.

(c) From and after the date of this Agreement until the Closing, the
Seller shall, and shall cause the Acquired Companies to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Acquirors with all cooperation
reasonably requested by the Acquirors in connection with the Debt Financing,
including by using commercially reasonable efforts to (i) provide to the
Acquirors pertinent and customary financial and other information regarding
the Acquired Companies as reasonably requested by the Acquirors for purposes
of the Debt Financing and to cause Target's senior management to participate
in a reasonable number of meetings (upon reasonable advance notice and at
times and locations to be mutually agreed) to discuss any such information;
(ii) participate in a reasonable number of meetings (including customary one-
on-one meetings with the parties acting as lead arrangers or agents for, and
prospective lenders and purchasers of, the Debt Financing), conference calls,
presentations, road shows, due diligence (including accounting due
diligence) and drafting sessions and sessions with actual and prospective
Debt Financing Sources, prospective lenders, investors and rating agencies;
(iii) provide reasonable assistance in the preparation of those sections of
any customary prospectuses, offering memoranda, information memoranda or
other customary materials that relate to the Acquired Companies and the
business of the Acquired Companies; (iv) assist the Acquirors and the Debt
Financing Sources with their marketing efforts with respect to the
Debt Financing, including in the preparation of materials for rating agency
presentations, lender presentations, bank information memoranda, offering
documents, private placement memoranda, prospectuses, business projections or
other marketing documents customarily used to arrange the Debt Financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (and identifying any portion of
information provided that constitutes material non-public information); (v)
execute and deliver, as of the Closing, any definitive financing documents,
including any credit or purchase agreements, subscription agreements,
guarantees, pledge agreements, security agreements, mortgages, deeds of trust
and other security documents or other certificates, documents and instruments
relating to guarantees, or any amendments thereto, the pledge of collateral
and other matters ancillary to the Debt Financing as may be reasonably
requested by any Debt Financing Sources in connection with the applicable
Debt Financing and otherwise reasonably facilitating the pledging of
collateral, as applicable; and (vi) take all corporate or other actions
necessary to permit the consummation of the Debt Financing and to permit the
gross proceeds thereof to be made available on the Closing Date to consummate
the Transactions.

  



  

Section 7.05. _Public Announcements_. So long as this Agreement is
in effect, neither the Seller, the Acquirors, nor any of their respective
Affiliates, shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or
other public announcement with respect to this Agreement or the
Transactions without the prior consent of the other Parties; provided,
however, that such Party may issue or cause the publication of any
press release or other public announcement with respect to this Agreement or
the Transactions without the prior consent of the other Parties if such Party
(a) determines, after consultation with outside counsel, that such press
release or other public announcement is required by applicable Law, including
the Securities Act or Exchange Act, or in compliance with the requirements of
the Algeco Indentures and (b) endeavors, on a reasonable basis given the
circumstances, to provide a meaningful opportunity to the other Party to
review and comment on such press release or other public announcement in
advance and shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested thereto.

Section 7.06. _Employees; Benefit Plans_.

  



  

(a) As of the Closing Date, (i) the Excluded Employees shall no
longer be eligible to participate in the Company Benefit Plans and (ii) all
employees of the Acquired Companies who are not Excluded Employees and remain
employed immediately after the Closing (each a "Company Continuing Employee")
shall continue to be eligible to participate in the Company Benefit Plans
to the same extent such Company Continuing Employees participated in such
plans immediately prior to the Closing Date. Prior to the Closing Date, the
Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take all steps necessary
to ensure that the Company Benefit Plans are maintained and sponsored by the
applicable Acquired Company or any successor entity of such Acquired Company
without material interruption, such that the Company Continuing Employees (A)
are credited for service with the Acquired Companies for the pre-Closing
period, (B) continue to have pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at
work requirements and similar limitations, eligibility waiting periods and
evidence of insurability requirements waived to the extent satisfied by any
Company Continuing Employee under any Company Benefit Plan as of the Closing
Date, and (C) have any deductible, co-insurance and out-of-pocket
covered expenses paid on or before the Closing Date by any Company Continuing
Employee (or covered dependent thereof) continue to be taken into account for
purposes of satisfying applicable deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-
pocket provisions after the Closing Date in the year of the Closing. In
addition to the foregoing, the Seller and the Acquired Companies will use
commercially reasonably efforts prior to the Closing to adopt new long-term
incentive plans for the operative Acquired Companies to grant, on a
discretionary basis, any benefits not covered by the Company Benefit Plans to
be maintained by ListCo following the Closing (collectively, the  "New
Benefit Plans"), which New Benefit Plans will be adopted and become effective
on the Closing.

  



  

(b) This  _Section 7.06_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to
the benefit of the Parties, and nothing in this _Section 7.06_ , express or
implied, shall confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any
nature whatsoever under or by reason of this  _Section 7.06_. Nothing in this
_Section 7.06_ shall be construed to establish, amend or modify any benefit
plan, program, agreement or arrangement. The Parties acknowledge and agree
that the terms set forth in this _Section 7.06_ shall not create any right in
any employee or any other Person to any continued employment for any period
with any Acquired Company, the Acquirors or any of their respective
Affiliates, or continued receipt of any specific compensation or employee
benefit of any nature or kind whatsoever, or shall constitute an amendment
to, adoption of, or any other modification of the Company Benefit Plans.
Nothing in this _Section 7.06_ shall be deemed to limit the right of the
Seller, the Acquirors, the Acquired Companies or any of their respective
Affiliates to terminate employment or any of their respective employees or
other service providers at any time.

  



  

(c) Seller agrees to fully reimburse ListCo and the Acquired
Companies for any and all expenses incurred by Listco and/or the Acquired
Companies on or before December 31, 2019 in connection with any obligations
of the Acquired Companies to pay or provide compensation and/or benefits to
any Excluded Employees and any other Persons who are not Continuing Employees
or otherwise providing services to or employed by the Acquired Companies,
including the obligations set forth on _Section 7.06(c) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedules_  and certain remaining obligations under the Algeco
TSA.

use, stamp, registration, recording, value added and other such Taxes, fees
and charges (including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection
with this Agreement (including any real property transfer Tax and any other
similar Tax) shall be borne and paid equally by the Acquirors, on the one
hand, and the Seller, on the other hand. The Party required under applicable
Law to file any Tax Return or other document with respect to such Taxes or
fees shall, at its own expense, timely file any such Tax Return or other
document (and the other Parties shall cooperate with respect thereto as
necessary)

  



  

Section 7.08. _Closing Conditions_. From the date hereof until the
Closing, each Party shall, and shall cause its respective Affiliates and
Representatives to use commercially reasonable efforts to take such actions
as are necessary to expeditiously satisfy the closing conditions set forth in
_Article VIII_ hereof. Without limiting the foregoing, each Party hereby
covenants and agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to work together
to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as
practicable and shall, and shall cause its respective Affiliates to, execute
and deliver such additional documents, instruments, conveyances and
assurances, and take such further actions as may be reasonably required to
give effect to such transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this
_Section 7.08_ , shall not (a) require any Party to pay or commit to pay any
amount to (or incur any obligation in favor of) any Person to obtain any
consents, approvals or authorizations of any third parties that are required
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other
than nominal filing, attorneys or application fees), (b) require Seller to
waive any of the conditions set forth in _Section 8.01_ or waive or cause to
be satisfied any of the conditions set forth in _Section 8.02_ , (c) require
any Acquiror to waive any of the conditions set forth in _Section 8.01_ or
waive or cause to be satisfied any of the conditions set forth in _Section
8.03_ , or (d) limit any Party's right to terminate this Agreement in
accordance with the terms and conditions of _Section 9.01_.

  



  

Section 7.09. _Further Assurances_. Following the Closing, each
Party shall, and shall cause its respective Affiliates to, execute and deliver
such additional documents, instruments, conveyances and assurances, and take
such further actions as may be reasonably required to carry out the
provisions hereof and give effect to the Transactions.

  



  

Section 7.10. _Registration Rights Agreement_. Between the date
hereof and Closing, each Party shall, and shall cause its respective
Affiliates to, negotiate an amended and restated registration rights
agreement (the " _Registration Rights Agreement_ "), which shall amend and
restate in its entirety that certain Registration Rights Agreement, dated
January 11, 2018, by and among Parent Acquiror and the initial investors
named on the signature pages thereto, and shall be entered into and effective
as of the Closing Date, on commercially reasonable and customary terms for a
transaction similar to the Transactions and consistent with the terms set
forth in the "Registration Rights" section of the Term Sheet, and otherwise
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Acquirors and Seller.
The Parties agree that the Registration Rights Agreement shall contain lock-up
provisions that are consistent with the terms set forth in the
"Sale/Transfer/Registration Restrictions/Lock-up period" section of the Term
Sheet and customary joinder provisions, pursuant to which each other Person
who is issued or receives shares of common stock of ListCo in connection with
the Transactions shall become party thereto. For the avoidance of doubt,
parties to the Algeco Earnout Agreement would be deemed "Permitted
Transferees" of Seller under the Registration Rights Agreement.

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Seller and the Acquirors;

  



  

(b) by either the Seller or the Acquirors, if the Closing has not
taken place on or before such date that is 120 days from the date hereof (the
"Outside Date"); provided that such period may be extended for any additional
thirty (30) days by mutual written consent of the Seller and Acquirors, in
which case such later date shall be the Outside Date; provided further that
neither the Seller nor the Acquirors will be permitted to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.01(b)_ if the failure of the Closing to
occur by the Outside Date is attributable to a failure on the part of such
Party to perform any covenant or obligation in this Agreement required to be
performed by such Party at or prior to the Closing Date;

  



  

(c) by the Seller, if the Acquirors shall have breached any
representation or warranty or shall have failed to comply with any
covenant or agreement applicable to the Acquirors, in each case that would
cause any of the conditions set forth in _Section 8.01_  or _Section 8.02_
not to be satisfied, and such condition is incapable of being satisfied by the
Outside Date; provided, however, that the Seller is not then in material
breach of this Agreement;

  



  

(d) by the Acquirors, if the Seller shall have breached any
representation or warranty or failed to comply with any covenant or
agreement applicable to the Seller, in each case that would cause any of the
conditions set forth in _Section 8.01_ or _Section 8.03_  not to be
satisfied, and such condition is incapable of being satisfied by the Outside
Date; provided, however, that neither Acquiror is then in material breach of
this Agreement;

  



  

(e) by either the Seller or the Acquirors in the event of the
issuance of a final, non-appealable order by a Governmental Authority
restraining or prohibiting the Transactions;

  



  

(f) by either the Seller or the Acquirors if the Acquiror
Shareholder Approvals are not obtained at the Acquiror Shareholder Meeting
duly convened therefor (unless such the Acquiror Shareholder Meeting has been
adjourned, in which case at the final adjournment thereof) at which a vote on
the Transaction Proposals was taken; and

  



  

(g) by the Acquirors if Seller has not, within one (1) hour

satisfactory to the Acquirors that Seller, as holder of the Membership
Interests, has received and approved this Agreement and the Transactions.

  



  

Section 9.02. _Notice of Termination_. Any Party desiring to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01_ shall give written notice

---|---|--- 

    



  

Section 9.03. _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the
termination of this Agreement as provided in _Section 9.01_ , this Agreement
shall forthwith become void and there shall be no liability on the part of
any Party, except that the confidentiality provisions of the Term Sheet,
_Section 7.01(b)_ and this _Section 9.03_ shall survive such termination;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Agreement shall relieve a Party
from liability for (i) any breach by such Party of the terms and
provisions of this Agreement prior to such termination or (ii) fraud.

  



  

Section 9.04. _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing,
either the Seller or the Acquirors may (a) extend the time for the performance
of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Party, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained in this
Agreement, but such extension or waiver shall not operate as an extension or
waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure. Any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the Party granting such extension or waiver.

  



  

Section 9.05.   _Waiver of Claims_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, the Parties (each on behalf of itself and
its officers, directors, employees, agents, Affiliates and Representatives)
hereby waive any rights or claims, whether at law or at equity, in contract,
in tort, or otherwise against the Debt Financing Sources and hereby agree that
in no event shall the Debt Financing Sources have any liability or obligation
to the Parties or their respective officers, directors, employees, agents,
Affiliates and Representatives and in no event shall the Parties seek or
obtain any other damages of any kind against any Debt Financing
Source (including special, consequential, indirect or punitive damages or
damages of a tortious nature), in each case in connection with this
Agreement, the Debt Financing, the Debt Financing Documents or the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

  



  

Article X

  

INDEMNIFICATION

  



  

Section 10.01. _Indemnification by Seller_. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, including the representations and
warranties of the Acquired Companies set forth in _Article III_ , the Seller
shall indemnify and defend each Acquiror and their respective
Representatives (collectively, the "Indemnitees") against, and shall hold
each of them harmless from and against, and shall pay and reimburse each of
them for, any and all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, Actions,
judgments, interest, awards, penalties, fines, costs or expenses of whatever
kind (including reasonable attorneys' fees and the cost of enforcing
any right to indemnification hereunder) ("Losses") incurred or sustained by,
or imposed upon, the Indemnitees or the Acquired Companies relating to (i)
any breach of _Section 3.01(ii)_ , _Section 3.01(iii), Section 3.04(a)_ , or
any Action directly relating to or arising from the events or circumstances
that resulted in such breach, (ii) any breach of _Section 3.12(l)_ or any
Action directly relating to or arising from the events or circumstances that
resulted in such breach or (iii) any Environmental Liability related to the
operation of the Acquired Companies prior to the Closing Date; provided, that
any references to materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect shall be
disregarded in determining whether a breach has occurred for purposes of this
_Article X_.

  



  

Section 10.02. _Indemnification Procedures_. The party making a
claim under this _Article X_ is referred to as the "Indemnified Party," and
the party against whom such claims are asserted under this _Article X_ is
referred to as the "Indemnifying Party."

  



    

 | 46| 
---|---|--- 

 

 | | 
---|---|--- 

    



  

(a) _Third Party Claims_. If any Indemnified Party receives notice
of the assertion or commencement of any Action made or brought by any Person
who is not a party to this Agreement or an Affiliate of a party to this
Agreement or a Representative of the foregoing (a  "Third Party Claim")
against such Indemnified Party with respect to which the Indemnifying Party is
obligated to provide indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified
Party shall give the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice
thereof, but in any event not later than thirty (30) days after receipt of
such notice of such Third Party Claim. The failure to give such prompt
written notice shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
indemnification obligations, except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is
materially prejudiced by such failure to provide prompt written notice. Such
notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe the Third Party Claim in
reasonable detail, shall include copies of all material written
evidence thereof and shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably
practicable, of the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified
Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in or, by
giving written notice to the Indemnified Party, to assume the defense of any
Third Party Claim at the Indemnifying Party's expense and by the Indemnifying
Party's own counsel, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith
in all respects in such defense; _provided_ that such Indemnifying Party may
only assume such defense if it acknowledges in writing its obligation to
indemnify in full the Indemnified Party pursuant to this Agreement;
_provided_ , _further_ , that such Indemnifying Party shall not have the right
to defend or direct the defense of any such Third Party Claim that is
asserted directly by or on behalf of a Person that is a supplier or customer
of the Company. In the event the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any
Third Party Claim, subject to _Section 10.02(b)_ , it shall have the right to
take such action as it deems necessary to avoid, dispute, defend, appeal or
make counterclaims pertaining to any such Third Party Claim in the name and
on behalf of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall have
the right to participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim with counsel
selected by it subject to the Indemnifying Party's right to control the
defense thereof. The fees and disbursements of such counsel shall be at the
expense of the Indemnified Party;  _provided_ that if in the reasonable
opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party, (A) there are legal defenses
available to an Indemnified Party that are different from or additional to
those available to the Indemnifying Party or (B) there exists a
material conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party that cannot be waived, the Indemnifying Party shall be
liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the Indemnified
Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to defend such Third Party Claim
or, in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party, fails to
diligently prosecute the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified
Party may, subject to _Section 10.02(b)_ defend such Third Party Claim and
seek indemnification for any and all Losses based upon, arising from or
relating to such Third Party Claim.

  



  

(b) _Settlement of Third Party Claims_. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into
settlement of any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party, except as provided in this _Section 10.02(b)_. If an offer
is made to settle a Third Party Claim (a "Proposed Settlement") and such offer
would not lead to liability or the creation of a financial or other
obligation of the Indemnified Party and such offer provides for the
unconditional release of each Indemnified Party from all liabilities and
obligations in connection with such Third Party Claim, and the
Indemnifying Party desires to accept and agree to such offer, the
Indemnifying Party shall give written notice to that effect to the
Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm
offer within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of such notice, then the
Indemnified Party may contest or defend such Third Party Claim and, in such
event, the maximum liability of the Indemnifying Party with respect to such
Third Party Claim shall not exceed the amount of such Proposed Settlement. If
the Indemnified Party fails to consent to such Proposed Settlement and also
fails to assume defense of such Third Party Claim, then the
Indemnifying Party may settle the Third Party Claim upon the terms set forth
in such Proposed Settlement. If the Indemnified Party has assumed the defense
pursuant to _Section 10.02(a)_ , it shall not agree to any Proposed Settlement
without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

---|---|--- 

 

 | | 
---|---|--- 

    



  

(c) _Direct Claims_. Subject to the limitations set forth in
_Section 10.03(e)_ , any Action by an Indemnified Party on account of a Loss
that does not result from a Third Party Claim (a "Direct Claim") shall be
asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying Party reasonably
prompt written notice thereof, but in any event not later than thirty (30)
days after the Indemnified Party becomes aware of such Direct Claim. The
failure to give such prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations, except to the extent
the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure to provide
prompt written notice. Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe the
Direct Claim in reasonable detail, shall include copies of all material
written evidence thereof and shall indicate the estimated amount, if
reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the
Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have forty-five (45)
days after receipt of such notice to respond in writing to such Direct Claim.
The Indemnified Party shall allow the Indemnifying Party and its professional
advisors to investigate the matter or circumstance alleged to give rise to the
Direct Claim and to investigate whether and to what extent any amount is
payable in respect of the Direct Claim, and the Indemnified Party shall assist
the Indemnifying Party's investigation by giving such information and
assistance as the Indemnifying Party or any of its professional advisors may
reasonably request. If the Indemnifying Party does not so respond within such
forty-five (45)-day period, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have
rejected such claim, in which case the Indemnified Party shall be free to
pursue such remedies as may be available to the Indemnified Party on the
terms and subject to the provisions of this Agreement.

  



  

(d) _Mitigation_. The Acquirors agree to, and to cause the Company
to, take all commercially reasonable actions to mitigate all Losses incurred
or reasonably expected to be incurred by any Indemnified Party.

  



  

(e) _Payments_. Once a Loss is agreed to by the Indemnifying Party
or finally adjudicated to be payable pursuant to this _Article X_ ,
the Indemnifying Party shall satisfy its obligations within ten (10) Business
Days of such final, non-appealable adjudication by wire transfer of
immediately available funds.

  



  

(f) _Exclusive Remedy_. Notwithstanding anything contained herein
to the contrary, from and after the Closing, subject to any Person's right to
seek specific performance and/or injunctive or other equitable relief,
indemnification pursuant to the provisions of this  _Article X_ shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims relating
(directly or indirectly) to the subject matter of this Agreement or the
Transactions contemplated hereby (except for fraud), regardless of the legal
theory under which such liability or obligation may be sought to be imposed,
whether sounding in contract or tort, or whether at law or in equity, or
otherwise.

  



  

Section 10.03. _Limitations on Indemnification Obligations_.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the rights of the Indemnified
Parties to indemnification pursuant to the provisions of this _Article X_ are
subject to the following limitations:

  



  

(a) the amount of any and all Losses shall be determined net of (i)
any amounts actually recovered by any Indemnified Party under any
insurance policies from other collateral sources (such as contractual
indemnities of any Person which are contained outside of this Agreement) with
respect to such Losses (net of the cost of recovery and increases in insurance
premiums) and (ii) any cash Tax benefits actually realized by the Indemnified
Parties (or their direct or indirect beneficial owners) in the year of such
Loss or the next succeeding taxable year that are attributable to any
deduction, loss, credit or other Tax benefit resulting from or arising out of
such Loss;

  



  

(b) an Indemnified Party's right to make a claim for indemnification
under this _Article X_ shall expire on March 31, 2020;

  



    

 | 48| 
---|---|--- 

 

 | | 
---|---|--- 

    



  

(c) in no event shall the Indemnifying Parties have any obligation
to indemnify the Indemnified Parties with respect to any Losses
incurred under _Article X_ until the total amount of Losses the Indemnified
Parties would recover pursuant to _Section 10.01(i)_ ,  _Section 10.01(ii)_
and _Section 10.01(iii)_ in the aggregate equals or exceeds $500,000, at which
point, the Seller will be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Parties for
the entire amount of any such indemnifiable Losses;

  



  

(d) in no event shall the Indemnifying Parties' aggregate liability
for Losses arising (i) under _Section 10.01(i)_ exceed $82.0 million and (ii)
under _Section 10.01(iii)_ exceed $6,262,395; provided that the Indemnifying
Parties' liability for Losses arising under _Sections 10.01(i)_ and _(iii)_
shall not exceed $82.0 million in the aggregate; and provided further that
the Indemnifying Parties' aggregate liability for Losses arising under
_Section 10.01(ii)_ shall not be limited, except that any amounts actually
paid by the Indemnifying Parties with respect to any Losses incurred under
_Section 10.1(ii)_ shall be taken into account in determining the limitations
under this _Section 10.03(d)_ ; and

  



  

(e) in no event shall the Indemnifying Parties be liable for any
consequential, indirect, special, exemplary, punitive, incidental or enhanced
damages, or other similar types of damages, including, but not limited to,
damages for lost profits, lost revenues, lost business or diminution in
value, regardless of whether such damages were foreseeable and the legal or
equitable theory (contract, tort or otherwise) upon which the claim was made;
provided that the limitation in this _Section 10.03(e)_ shall not apply to
any such damages that are payable to a third party by an Indemnified Party as
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final, non-appealable
judgment.

Seller or the Acquirors contained herein or in any document delivered

in writing signed on behalf of the Seller or the Acquirors, as applicable.
Any delay in exercising any right under this Agreement shall not constitute a
waiver of such right. Any waiver of any term or condition shall not be
construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or a subsequent waiver of the
same term or condition, or a waiver of any other term or condition of this
Agreement.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no
amendment may be made to _Section 7.04_ (Debt Financing), _Section 9.05_
 (Waiver of Claims), this _Section 11.01_ (Amendment and Modification;

amendment affects the Debt Financing Sources) without the prior written
consent of the Debt Financing Sources.
