investment in public equity (PIPE) or other equity offering to fund any shortfall of Minimum Proceeds from the Trust Account, after

consent of the Seller shall not be required under this clause (C) if the Backstop Offering consists solely of the sale of common

their respective Affiliates and designees shall have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase up to 50% of the equity to
be issued in connection with such Backstop Offering on the same terms and conditions as the Seller, Arrow Holdings and their Affiliates,
as the case may be.</P>

the Indemnified Party may contest or defend such Third Party Claim and, in such event, the maximum liability of the Indemnifying
Party with respect to such Third Party Claim shall not exceed the amount of such Proposed Settlement. If the Indemnified Party
fails to consent to such Proposed Settlement and also fails to assume defense of such Third Party Claim, then the Indemnifying
Party may settle the Third Party Claim upon the terms set forth in such Proposed Settlement. If the Indemnified Party has assumed
the defense pursuant to <U>Section 10.02(a)</U>, it shall not agree to any Proposed Settlement without the written consent of the
