Section 2.08 _Intended Tax Treatment_. (a) For U.S. federal income tax
purposes (and for purposes of any applicable state or local Tax that follows
the U.S. federal income tax treatment), the parties hereto  intend that (i)
the First Merger and the Second Merger, taken together, will constitute an
integrated transaction that qualifies as a "reorganization" within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code, and (ii) this Agreement will constitute a
"plan  of reorganization" for the purposes of Section 368 of the Code and
Treasury Regulations Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) (clauses (i) and (ii)
collectively, the " _Intended Tax  Treatment_ ").

course of any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes that
is inconsistent with the Intended Tax Treatment, except, in each case, as
otherwise  required by a final determination by a taxing authority or a
change in applicable Law after the date of this Agreement.

 


 

 

(c) The parties shall cooperate with each  other and their respective counsel
and use their reasonable best efforts to cause the conditions set forth on
_Exhibit D_ to be satisfied. Neither the Company nor Parent  shall, or shall
cause or permit any of their respective Subsidiaries to, take or omit to take
any reasonable action not required or contemplated by this Agreement, as a
result of which the Mergers would reasonably be expected to fail to qualify
for  the Intended Tax Treatment.

 


 

 

(d) Parent shall reasonably promptly notify  the Company, and the Company
shall reasonably promptly notify the Parent, in each case if such party
becomes aware of any

 


 

 


 

 

 

24  


 

 


 

 

non-public fact or circumstance that would reasonably be likely to prevent or
impede the Mergers from qualifying for the Intended Tax Treatment.

 


 

 

ARTICLE III

 


 

 

DELIVERY OF MERGER CONSIDERATION

 


 

 

Section 3.01 _Election Procedures_. (a) Not less than 30 days prior to the
anticipated Effective Time (the " _Mailing Date_ "), Parent will  cause to be
mailed to each record holder of shares of Company Stock (other than shares of
Company Stock cancelled pursuant to _Section 2.04(c)_) as of five Business
Days  prior to the Mailing Date: (x) an election form in such form consistent
with the terms of this Agreement as Parent shall specify (which such form
shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company) (the " _Election Form_ ") and
(y) a letter of transmittal which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the shares of Company Stock shall be
deemed to pass, only upon proper delivery of the  Certificates (or affidavits
of loss in lieu thereof together with the required indemnity) or transfer of
the Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent, and shall be in a customary form
and have such other provisions as are reasonably acceptable to  the Company
and Parent, including instructions for use in effecting the surrender or
transfer (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ "). The Election Form shall state the
procedures  for electing the Merger Consideration and shall specify the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock and/or amount of cash that comprise
the Alternative Consideration as determined by Parent.

 


 

 

(b) Each Election Form will permit each  holder of shares of Company Stock to
specify (i) the number of shares of Company Stock with respect to which such
holder elects to receive the CVR Consideration, (ii) the number of shares of
Company Stock with respect to which such holder elects to  receive the Cash and
Stock Consideration or (iii) that such holder makes no election with respect
to such holder's shares of Company Stock. Any shares of Company Stock with
respect to which the Exchange Agent does not receive a properly  completed
Election Form during the period (the " _Election Period_ ") from the Mailing
Date to 5:00 p.m., Eastern time, on the date which Parent and the Company
shall agree is  as near as practicable to three Business Days preceding the
Closing Date, or such other date as Parent and the Company will, prior to the
Closing, mutually agree (the " _Election  Deadline_ "), will be deemed to be
No Election Shares. Parent and the Company shall publicly announce the date of
the Election Deadline at least three Business Days prior to the Election
Deadline. If the Closing Date is delayed to a  subsequent date, the Election
Deadline shall be similarly delayed to a subsequent date, and Parent and the
Company shall promptly announce any such delay and, when determined, the
rescheduled Election Deadline.

 


 

 

(c) Parent shall direct the Exchange Agent  to make Election Forms available
as may be reasonably requested from time to time by all Persons who become
holders of record of Company Stock between the date that is five Business Days
prior to the Mailing Date and the Election Deadline, and the  Company shall
provide to the Exchange Agent all information reasonably necessary for the
Exchange Agent to perform as specified in this Agreement and as specified in
any agreement between Parent and/or the Company and the Exchange Agent.

 


 

 


 

 

 

25  


 

 


 

 

(d) Any election made pursuant to this _Section 3.01_ will have been properly
made only if the Exchange Agent will have actually received a properly
completed Election Form during the Election Period. Any Election  Form may be
revoked or changed by the Person submitting it, by written notice received by
the Exchange Agent during the Election Period. In the event an Election Form
is revoked during the Election Period, the shares of Company Stock
represented  by such Election Form will be deemed to be No Election Shares,
except to the extent a subsequent election is properly made during the
Election Period. Any termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article
IX_ shall result in the revocation of all Election Forms delivered to the
Exchange Agent on or prior to the date of such termination. Subject to the
terms of this Agreement and of the Election Form, the  Exchange Agent will
have reasonable discretion to determine whether any election, revocation or
change has been properly or timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in
the Election Forms, and any good faith decisions of the Exchange Agent 
regarding such matters will be binding and conclusive. None of Parent, First
Merger Sub, Second Merger Sub, the Company or the Exchange Agent will be under
any obligation to notify any Person of any defect in an Election Form.

 


 

 

Section 3.02 _Exchange of Certificates_. (a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the
Mailing Date, Parent shall designate a commercial bank or  trust company
reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the " _Exchange Agent_
") for the exchange of shares of Company Stock in accordance with this
_Article III_. Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the
Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Stock
(other than shares of  Company Stock cancelled pursuant to _Section 2.04(c),
_Company Restricted Stock Awards and Appraisal Shares), for exchange in
accordance with this _Article III_ at or prior to the Effective Time, (i)
book-entry shares representing the aggregate Stock Consideration and any
shares of Parent Common Stock included in the aggregate Alternative 
Consideration (excluding any portion of the aggregate Stock Consideration or
Alternative Consideration deliverable in respect of shares of Company Stock
owned directly or indirectly by Parent, First Merger Sub or Second Merger Sub
and any part of  the aggregate Stock Consideration in respect of which cash
is to be paid in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 3.02(e)_), and
(ii) cash in an amount sufficient  to pay the aggregate Cash Consideration
and the cash portion, if any, of the Alternative Consideration (excluding any
Cash Consideration and the cash portion, if any, of the Alternative
Consideration payable in respect of shares of Company Stock  owned directly
or indirectly by Parent, First Merger Sub or Second Merger Sub), plus any cash
to be paid in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to _Section 3.02(e)_,
and  (iii) CVR Certificates representing the aggregate number of CVRs
issuable pursuant to the CVR Agreement, in the case of each of clauses (i),
(ii) and (iii), payable or deliverable pursuant to _Section 2.04(a)_. In
addition, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange
Agent, as necessary from time to time at or after the Closing any dividends or
distributions payable pursuant to _Section 3.02(c)_. All shares of Parent
Common Stock, cash (including any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional
shares pursuant to _Section 3.02(e)_) and CVR Certificates, together with any
dividends or distributions with respect thereto pursuant to _Section
3.02(c)_,  deposited with or provided to the Exchange Agent by or on behalf
of Parent, shall be referred to in this Agreement as the " _Exchange Fund_ ".
For avoidance of doubt, Parent  shall not be required to deposit any funds
related to any CVR with the Trustee unless and until such deposit is required
pursuant to the terms of the CVR Agreement. The cash portion of the Exchange
Fund shall be invested by the

 


 

 


 

 

 

26  


 

 


 

 

Exchange Agent as directed by Parent; _provided_ that the Exchange Fund shall
only be invested  into Designated Investments. Any interest or other income
from such investments shall be paid to and become income of Parent. Except as
contemplated by _Section 3.02(g)_,  the Exchange Fund shall not be used for
any purpose other than as specified in this _Section 3.02(a)_.

 


 

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. (i) As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, the parties shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of
record of shares of Company Stock as of the  Effective Time who is entitled
to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.04(a)_, as set
forth on the Closing Capitalization Schedule if such holder of  shares of
Company Stock has not already returned a valid, duly completed Letter of
Transmittal: (A) a Letter of Transmittal and (B) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates or transfer of the Book-Entry
Shares pursuant to  such letter of transmittal.

and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto and (B) with
respect to holders of Certificates, surrender  to the Exchange Agent of a
Certificate for cancellation, in each case, together with such other documents
as may be reasonably requested, the holder of such shares of Company Stock
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (I) cash in the  amount
equal to the Cash Consideration and, if applicable, the cash portion, if any,
of the Alternative Consideration that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to _Section 2.04(a)_  and this _Article III _(in each case, rounded
to the nearest cent); (II) book-entry shares representing the Stock
Consideration and, if applicable, any shares of Parent  Common Stock included
in the Alternative Consideration that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to _Section 2.04(a)_ and this _Article III_; (III) if applicable,
CVRs in the amount that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
_Section 2.04(a)_  and this _Article III_ (subject to and in accordance with
the CVR Agreement); (IV) cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock such holder is entitled to  receive pursuant to _Section
3.02(e)_ (rounded to the nearest cent) and (V) any dividends or other

3.02(c)_; and the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of
Company Stock  which is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, (I) cash in the amount equal to the Cash Consideration and, if
applicable, the cash portion, if any, of the Alternative Consideration that
such holder has the right to receive pursuant  to _Section 2.04(a)_ and this
_Article III _(in each case, rounded to the nearest cent);  (II) book-entry
shares representing the Stock Consideration and, if applicable, any shares of
Parent Common Stock included in the Alternative Consideration that such holder
has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.04(a)_ and this _Article III_;
(III), if applicable, CVRs in the amount that such holder has the right to
receive  pursuant to _Section 2.04(a)_ and this _Article III_ (subject to and
in accordance with the CVR  Agreement); (IV) cash in lieu of any fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to
_Section 3.02(e)_ (rounded to the nearest cent)  and (V) any dividends or
other distributions such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to _Section
3.02(c)_ may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate or Book‑Entry 
Shares representing such shares

 


 

 


 

 

 

27  


 

 


 

 

of Company Stock are presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that 
any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as
contemplated by _Section 2.04(a)_ and this _Section 3.02_, each Certificate or
Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at all times after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender, in each case, without
interest, the Merger Consideration,  cash in lieu of any fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share is
entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 3.02(e)_ and any  dividends or other
distributions such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to _Section
3.02(c)_.

 


 

 

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of Parent Common Stock_.
No dividends or other distributions declared or paid with a record date after
the Effective Time with respect to the Parent  Common Stock (and no cash
payment in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to
_Section 3.02(e)_) shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered 
Certificate or Book-Entry Share until the holder of such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share shall surrender such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance
with _Section 3.02(b)_.            Subject to the effect of escheat,
Tax or other applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share in accordance with _Section 3.02(b)_, there  shall be paid
to the record holder of shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange
therefor, without interest, at the appropriate payment date (or, if previously
paid, promptly), the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date  after the Effective Time but prior to surrender payable with respect to
such shares of Parent Common Stock and the amount of any cash payable in lieu
of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section 3.02(e)_.

 


 

 

(d) _No Further Rights in Company Stock_. All Merger Consideration issued or
paid upon surrender of Certificates or transfer of Book-Entry Shares in
accordance with the terms of this _Article III_ (including any cash paid
pursuant to _Section 3.02(c)_ or _Section 3.02(e)_) shall be deemed to have
been issued or paid, as the case may be, in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Company Stock formerly represented by such 
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

 


 

 

(e) _No Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall
be issued as Stock Consideration or Alternative Consideration, but in lieu
thereof each holder of Company Stock otherwise  entitled to a fractional
share of Parent Common Stock will be entitled to receive, from the Exchange
Agent in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 3.02(e)_ , a  cash
payment in lieu of such fractional share of Parent Common Stock in an amount
equal to the amount of such fractional share (expressed as a decimal)
multiplied by the Average Parent Stock Price. The parties hereto acknowledge
that payment of  such cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock was not separately bargained-for consideration but
merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of avoiding the
expense and inconvenience to Parent that  would otherwise be caused by the
issuance of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock. Such amounts payable to
holders of shares of Company Stock shall be without interest, rounded down to
the nearest whole cent and subject to the amount of any  withholding Taxes as
contemplated in _Section 3.02(i)_.

 


 

 


 

 

 

28  


 

 


 

 

(f) _Adjustments to Stock Consideration_. The calculation of the Aggregate
Stock Consideration and aggregate shares of Parent Common Stock, if any,
payable as Alternative Consideration shall be equitably  adjusted to reflect
appropriately the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities of a Subsidiary
of Parent or the Company or of securities convertible into Parent Common 
Stock or Company Stock), recapitalization, reclassification, combination,
exchange of shares or other like change with respect to Parent Common Stock or
Company Stock with a record date occurring on or after the date hereof and
prior to the  Effective Time; _provided_ that nothing in this _Section
3.02(f)_ shall be construed to permit  the Company or Parent to take any of
the foregoing actions with respect to Company Stock or Parent Common Stock, as
applicable, to the extent otherwise prohibited by the terms of this Agreement,
including _Section 6.01_ and _Section 6.02_.

 


 

 

(g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including proceeds of any investment thereof) that remains undistributed to
the holders of shares of Company Stock on the date that is  12 months after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders
of shares of Company Stock who have not theretofore complied with this
_Article III_  shall thereafter look only to Parent for the Merger
Consideration to which they are entitled pursuant to _Section 2.04(a)_, any
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent  Common Stock to which they are
entitled pursuant to _Section 3.02(e)_ and any dividends or other
distributions with respect to the Parent Common Stock to which they are 
entitled pursuant to _Section 3.02(c)_.

 


 

 

(h) _No Liability_. None of the Exchange Agent, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Surviving Entity shall be liable to any holder of shares of
Company Stock for any Merger Consideration from the  Exchange Fund (or
dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock) or other
cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law.

 


 

 

(i) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving
Entity, the Exchange Agent, Parent, First Merger Sub and Second Merger Sub
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any  amounts otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement or the CVR Agreement such amount as it is required
to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, the rules or regulations promulgated thereunder, any provision  of
applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law or any other Law. To the extent
that amounts are so deducted or withheld, such deducted or withheld amounts
shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement and the CVR Agreement as
having been paid to  the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

 


 

 

(j) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed  and, if required by Parent,
providing an indemnity agreement in customary form reasonably acceptable to
Parent against any claim that may be made against Parent with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such  lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration with respect to the shares
of Company Stock formerly represented by such Certificate to which the holder
thereof is entitled pursuant to

 


 

 


 

 

 

29  


 

 


 

 

_Section 2.04(a)_, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock to which the  holder thereof is entitled pursuant to _Section 3.02(e)_
and any dividends or other distributions to which the holder thereof is
entitled pursuant to _Section 3.02(c)_.

 


 

 

Section 3.03 _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Company Stock thereafter on  the
records of the Company. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares presented to the Exchange Agent or Parent for any reason
shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration with respect to
the shares of  Company Stock formerly represented by such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to

(c) On the Mailing Date, Parent will cause  to be provided to each holder of
Company Equity Awards an election form in such form consistent with the terms
of this Agreement as Parent shall specify (which such form shall be reasonably
acceptable to the Company) (the " _Equity Election Form_ "). The Equity
Election Form shall state the procedures for electing among the options for
the treatment of Rollover Awards and Cash-Out Awards described herein and
shall  specify the number of shares of Parent Common Stock and/or amount of
cash that comprise the Alternative Consideration as determined by Parent. Each
Equity Election Form will permit each holder of Company Equity Awards to
specify: (i) which  Cash-Out Awards such holder elects to treat as " _CVR
Cash-Out Awards_ "; (ii) which Cash-Out Awards such holder elects to treat as
" _Alternative Cash-Out Awards_ "; (iii) which Rollover Awards such holder
elects to treat as " _CVR Rollover Awards_ "; (iv) which Rollover  Awards
such holder elects to treat as " _Alternative Rollover Awards_ "; and/or (v)
that such holder makes no election with respect to some or all of such
holder's Company  Equity Awards (any Company Equity Awards described in this
clause (v) and any other Company Equity Awards for which Parent does not
receive a properly completed Equity Election Form during the Election Period,
the " _No Election Awards_ "). The treatment of each of the CVR Cash-Out
Awards, Alternative Cash-Out Awards, CVR Rollover Awards and Alternative
Rollover Awards is described below. Any No Election Award  shall be treated
for all purposes, except as set forth below, as a CVR Cash-Out Award or a CVR
Rollover Award, as applicable. Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement
or any Election Form to the contrary, any Company Stock Option that is a 
Rollover Award and that has an exercise price that is greater than or equal to
the sum of (x) the Cash Consideration and (y) an amount equal to the product
of (I) the Stock Consideration and (II) the Average Parent Stock Price shall
be treated as  an Alternative Rollover Award. _Section 3.01(d)_ shall apply
to the Equity Election Forms mutatis mutandis.

 


 

 

(d) Immediately prior to, and contingent on,  the Effective Time, each
Company Stock Option (or portion thereof) that is a Rollover Award shall be
canceled in exchange for the right to receive (i) in the case of a CVR
Rollover Award only, a number of fully vested CVRs equal to the number of 
shares of Company Class A Common Stock subject to such Rollover Award
immediately prior to such cancelation and (ii) an option to acquire a number
of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product (rounded down to the
nearest whole share) of  (A) the number of shares of Company Class A Common
Stock subject to such Rollover Award immediately prior to such cancelation,
and (B) the applicable Equity Award Ratio, at an exercise price per share
(rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to  the quotient obtained by
dividing (x) the exercise price per share of Company Class A Common Stock of
such Rollover Award immediately prior to such cancelation by (y) the Equity
Award Ratio (such options, " _Parent Stock Options_ "); _provided_ that the
exercise price and the number of shares of Parent Common Stock purchasable
pursuant to such  Parent Stock Option shall be determined in a manner
consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and Section 422
of the Code (to the extent applicable); _provided  further_ , that the
parties intend that the actions provided for in the foregoing with respect to
CVR Rollover Awards shall be implemented by means of a deemed partial exercise
of the Company Stock Option in exchange for Company  Restricted Stock Awards
covering a number of shares with an aggregate value equal to the aggregate
value of the CVRs to be received in exchange for such Rollover Award, with
such Company Restricted Stock Awards immediately thereafter canceled in 
exchange for the fully vested CVRs provided

 


 

 


 

 

 

31  


 

 


 

 

for above in accordance with the election of the holder of such CVR Rollover
Awards (and, for clarity, the remainder of the Company Stock Option converted
into the Parent  Stock Option provided for above in a manner consistent with
the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and Section 422 of the Code (to
the extent applicable)).

 


 

 

(e) For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Equity Award Ratio_ " shall mean:

 


 

 

(i) in the case of a CVR  Rollover Award, a fraction (A) the numerator of
which is the sum of (x) the Cash Consideration and (y) an amount equal to the
product of (I) the Stock Consideration and (II) the Average Parent Stock Price
and (B) the denominator of which is the  Average Parent Stock Price

 


 

 

(ii) in the case of an  Alternative Rollover Award, a fraction (A) the
numerator of which is the sum of (x) the cash portion of the Cash and Stock
Consideration (which includes the cash portion of the Alternative
Consideration (if any)) and (y) an amount equal to the  product of (I) the
stock portion of the Cash and Stock Consideration (which includes the stock
portion of the Alternative Consideration (if any)) and (II) the Average Parent
Stock Price and (B) the denominator of which is the Average Parent Stock 
Price.

 


 

 

(f) Immediately prior to, and contingent  upon, the Effective Time, each
Company Restricted Stock Award (or portion thereof) that is a Rollover Award
shall be canceled in exchange for the right to receive (i) in the case of a
CVR Rollover Award only, a number of fully vested CVRs equal to  the number
of shares of Company Class A Common Stock subject to such Rollover Award
immediately prior to such cancelation and (ii) a number of restricted shares
of Parent Common Stock equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole
share)  of (A) the number of shares of Company Class A Common Stock subject
to such Rollover Award immediately prior to such cancelation and (B) the
applicable Equity Award Ratio (such restricted shares, " _Parent Restricted
Stock_ ").

 


 

 

(g) Immediately prior to, and contingent  upon, the Effective Time, each
Company RSU Award (or portion thereof) that is a Rollover Award shall be
canceled in exchange for the right to receive (i) in the case of a CVR
Rollover Award only, a number of fully vested CVRs equal to the number of 
shares of Company Class A Common Stock subject to such Rollover Award
immediately prior to such cancelation and (ii) a restricted stock unit with
respect to a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product
(rounded down to the nearest  whole share) of (A) the number of shares of
Company Class A Common Stock subject to such Rollover Award immediately prior
to such cancelation, and (B) the applicable Equity Award Ratio (such
restricted stock units, collectively with the Parent  Stock Options and
Parent Restricted Stock, the " _Parent Awards_ ").

 


 

 

(h) Except as specifically provided in this  _Section 3.04_ , following the
Effective Time, each Parent Award shall continue to be governed by the terms
and conditions that applied to the applicable Rollover Award  immediately
prior to the applicable cancelation, including, for the avoidance of doubt,
any service-based and performance-based vesting criteria that are not
satisfied or deemed satisfied prior to the Effective Time (including pursuant
to

 


 

 


 

 

 

32  


 

 


 

 

_Sections 3.04(a)_ and _(b)_ ).           Notwithstanding the
foregoing, solely to the extent set forth on _Section 3.04(b) of the Company
Disclosure Letter_ , Parent Awards in respect of Rollover Awards that are 
Performance-Vesting Awards shall no longer be subject to any performance-
vesting criteria following the Effective Time.

 


 

 

(i) Immediately prior to, and contingent on,  the Effective Time, each Cash-
Out Award shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive for each
share of Company Stock subject to such Cash-Out Award as of immediately prior
to such cancelation, in full satisfaction of the rights of the  applicable
holder with respect thereto, (i) in the case of a CVR Cash-Out Award, the CVR
Consideration or (ii) in the case of an Alternative Cash-Out Award, the Cash and
Stock Consideration, in each case, less (A) in the case of any Cash-Out 
Award that is a Company Stock Option, the applicable exercise price for such
share and (B) in the case of all Company Equity Awards, any required
withholding Taxes ((A) and (B) together, the " _Cash-Out Deductions_ ", and
the net consideration payable hereunder in respect of a Cash-Out Award, the "
_Cash-Out Award Consideration_ "). Any  Cash-Out Deductions shall be
satisfied by reducing the cash portion of the applicable consideration by the
amount of such Cash-Out Deductions, but not below zero. In the event such cash
portion has a value that is less than such Cash-Out  Deductions, such cash
portion shall be reduced to zero and in addition Parent shall retain a portion
of the stock portion of the applicable consideration that  has a value equal
to the amount by which the Cash-Out Deductions exceed such cash portion. The
Cash-Out Award Consideration shall be paid as promptly as practicable
following the Effective Time (and in no event later than five (5) Business
Days  thereafter) through Parent's, the Surviving Entity's or the applicable
Subsidiary of the Surviving Entity's payroll. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
to the extent that any Cash-Out Award Consideration relates to a Company RSU
Award that is  nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of
the Code, Parent, the Surviving Entity or the applicable Subsidiary shall pay
such amounts at the earliest time, as applicable, that will not trigger a Tax
or penalty under Section 409A  of the Code, but no later than five (5)
Business Days after such time.

 


 

 

(j) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the  event any Cash-Out Award
Consideration would result in the payment of a fractional share of Parent
Common Stock, all such fractional shares a holder of Company Equity Awards in
respect of Company Equity Awards would be entitled to shall be  aggregated
and paid in (i) a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to such
aggregated number rounded down to the nearest whole share and (ii) an amount
in cash equal to the product of (A) such aggregated number minus the number of
whole  shares determined in clause (i) and (B) the Average Parent Stock
Price.

 


 

 

(k) No later than the Effective Time, Parent  shall, if registration of the
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable under the Company Stock Plan or other
Plan is required under the Securities Act and such registration is not covered
by any Form S-4 filed in connection with the Transactions,  file with the SEC
a registration statement on Form S-8, as the case may be (or any successor
form), or another appropriate form with respect to such Parent Common Stock
and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to have such registration 
statement declared effective no later than the Effective Time.

 


 

 


 

 

 

33  


 

 


 

 

(l) At or prior to the Effective Time, the  Company, the Company Board or a
committee of the Company Board, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and
take any actions which are necessary to effectuate the provisions of this
_Section 3.04_.

 


 

 

(m) Notwithstanding anything in this  Agreement to the contrary, any Taxes
required to be withheld in connection with CVRs issued in respect of any
Company Equity Award pursuant to this _Section 3.04_ (other  than in respect
of any Cash-Out Awards, which are covered solely by _Section 3.04(i)_ ) shall
be satisfied by reducing the cash portion of the applicable consideration
that  would otherwise be received by the holder of the applicable Company
Equity Award by the amount of such required Tax withholding, but not below
zero and, in the event such cash portion has a value that is less than such
required Tax withholding,  such cash portion shall be reduced to zero and in
addition Parent shall retain a portion of the stock portion of the applicable
consideration that would  otherwise be received by the holder of the
applicable Company Equity Award that has a value equal to the amount by which
the required Tax withholding exceeds such cash portion. In the event the cash
and stock portion has a value that is less than  such required Tax
withholding, the Company shall determine an alternative means of satisfying
such Tax withholding that is reasonably acceptable to Parent.

 


 

 

Section 3.05 _Appraisal Rights_. (a) Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Stock that are outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any  holder who
has not voted in favor of the Mergers or consented thereto in writing, has not
waived appraisal rights in connection with the Mergers, and properly demands
appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and in accordance with, Section 262 of
the  DGCL (" _Appraisal Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 2.04(a)_ , but
instead shall be entitled to only those rights as are granted by Section 262
of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder shall fail to
perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal
under Section 262 of the DGCL, or a court of competent jurisdiction  shall
determine such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of
the DGCL, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such
holder's Appraisal Shares under Section 262 of the DGCL shall cease and such
Appraisal  Shares shall thereupon be treated as if they were No Election
Shares and shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time
into, and shall represent only the right to receive, the CVR Consideration as
provided in _Section 2.04(a)_ upon the surrender of such shares in the manner
provided in _Section 3.02_.

 


 

 

(b) The Company shall give prompt notice to  Parent of any demands received
by the Company for appraisal of any shares of Company Stock, any attempted
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the
DGCL and received by the Company relating to be paid the "fair  value" of the
Appraisal Shares, as provided in Section 262 of the DGCL, and Parent shall
have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and Actions with
respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, 
without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to,
or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the
foregoing. Parent shall not, except with the prior written consent of the
Company, require the  Company to make any payment with respect to any demands
for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

Parent IP owned by Parent is currently in compliance with any and all formal
legal  requirements necessary to record, perfect and maintain Parent or any

Intellectual Property that is used, held for use or planned for use in the
conduct of Parent's business in the manner in which it is currently being
conducted, except where  failure to own or otherwise possess rights to any
such Intellectual Property would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. To the
knowledge of Parent, the consummation of this Agreement  and compliance by
Parent and its Subsidiaries with the provisions of this Agreement will not
conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, or default (with or
without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of,
or  result in, termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or
to the loss of a benefit under, or result in the creation of any Encumbrance
(other than a Permitted Encumbrance) in or upon, any Parent IP.

redacted provisions would adversely affect the amount or availability of the
Financing  on the Closing Date) of which have been provided to the Company
(collectively, the " _Financing Commitments_ "), pursuant to which the
Financing Sources party thereto have  committed, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth therein, to lend the amounts set forth therein for the
purposes of financing the Transactions and related Expenses (together with any

date hereof in  any material respect and (ii) the respective commitments
contained in the Financing Commitments have not been withdrawn or rescinded in
any material respect (it being understood that the exercise of "market flex"

respect to the Financing, there are no side letters or contracts, agreements
or understandings to which Parent, First Merger Sub or  Second Merger Sub is
a party related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the Financing
other than as expressly set forth in the Financing Commitments. Parent has
fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees in connection with  the
Financing Commitments that are payable on or prior to the date of this

relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles.
There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the
funding of the full amount of the Financing Commitments,  other than as

compliance by the Company with the covenants set forth in this Agreement and

65  


 

 


 

 

Commitments on the part of Parent, First Merger Sub or Second Merger Sub or,
to the knowledge of Parent, First Merger Sub and Second Merger Sub, any other
party thereto.   Subject to the accuracy of the representations and
warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement and compliance by the
Company with the covenants set forth in this Agreement, as of the date hereof,

VIII_ ),           Parent, First Merger Sub and Second Merger Sub

not misleading.

 


 

 

(b) Each of the consolidated financial  statements (including, in each case,
any notes thereto) contained (or incorporated by reference) in the Parent SEC
Reports was prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis
throughout the periods indicated (except as may be  indicated in the notes

the SEC) and each fairly presents, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial condition, results of operations, changes in stockholders'  equity
and cash flows of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the
respective dates thereof and for the respective periods indicated therein
(subject, in the case of unaudited financial statements, to normal year-end
adjustments).

 


 

 

(c) Parent maintains disclosure controls and  procedures required by Rule
13a‑15 or Rule 15d‑15 under the Exchange Act and such controls and procedures

December 31, 2019 in the ordinary course of business, (iii) incurred in
connection with the negotiation, execution, delivery or performance of, or
pursuant to the  terms of, this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents

of this Agreement shall not be deemed a liability "incurred in connection with
the negotiation, execution,  delivery or performance of, or pursuant to the
terms of, this Agreement) or (iv) that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 


 

 

(e) Since December 31, 2019, (i) there has  not been any Parent Material
Adverse Effect and (ii) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken
any action that, if taken after the date of this Agreement, would constitute a
breach of any of the covenants set forth in _Section 6.02_.

inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Registration Statement and the
Consent Solicitation Statement does not contain any untrue  statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 


 

 

Section 5.11 _Absence of Litigation_. There is no Action pending or, to the
knowledge of Parent, threatened (i) against or involving Parent, First Merger
Sub or Second Merger Sub, any of their respective  Subsidiaries or any of
their respective assets, officers, directors or key employees (in the case of
officers, directors or key employees, arising out of such officer's,
director's or key employee's relationship with Parent, First Merger Sub or 
Second Merger Sub, as applicable) that, individually or in the aggregate, had
or would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, or
(ii) that seeks to restrain or enjoin the consummation of the Transactions or
that would  reasonably be expected to affect the ability of Parent, First
Merger Sub or Second Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this
Agreement or prevent or materially impede or delay the consummation of the
Transactions. There is no Order of any  Governmental Authority or arbitrator
outstanding against, or, to the knowledge of Parent, investigation by any
Governmental Authority involving, Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective assets, officers, directors or key employees  (in the case
of such officers, directors or key employees, such as would affect Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries) that would reasonably be expected to affect the
ability of Parent, First Merger Sub or Second Merger Sub to perform its
obligations  under this Agreement or prevent or materially impede or delay
the consummation of the Transactions. There is no material Action pending by
Parent, First Merger Sub or Second Merger Sub or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, or which Parent,  First Merger Sub or Second Merger Sub or any
of their respective Subsidiaries intends to initiate, against any other
Person, except where the failure of which would not have, or would not
reasonably be expected to have, a Parent Material Adverse  Effect.

otherwise cooperate in any way with respect to, any  Competing Proposal,
(iii) agree to, approve, endorse, recommend or consummate any Competing
Proposal, (iv) enter into, or propose to enter into, any Competing Transaction
Agreement, or (v) resolve, propose or agree, or authorize or permit any 
Representative to do any of the foregoing. The Company shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to and will direct its and its Subsidiaries' Representatives
to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions or
negotiations  with any Persons conducted prior to the execution of this
Agreement by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or its or any of their
respective Representatives with respect to any Competing Proposal, request the
prompt return or destruction of all  confidential information previously
furnished and terminate access to any physical or electronic data rooms
related to a potential Competing Proposal previously granted to such Person.

 


 

 

(b) The Company shall promptly, and in any  event within 24 hours of the
Company obtaining knowledge of the receipt thereof, advise Parent in writing
of any Competing Proposal, the financial and other material terms and
conditions of any such Competing Proposal (including any changes  thereto)
and the identity of the Person making any such Competing Proposal. The Company
shall (i) keep Parent reasonably informed of the status and material details
(including any change to the terms thereof) of any such Competing Proposal
and  (ii) provide to Parent, as soon as practicable after receipt or delivery
thereof (and in any event, within 24 hours of such receipt or delivery),
copies of all correspondence (other than non-substantive written
correspondence) and other written  material (including all draft and final
versions (and any amendments thereto) of agreements (including schedules and
exhibits thereto) and any comments thereon) relating to any such Competing
Proposal exchanged between the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries (or their
Representatives), on the one hand, and the Person making such Competing
Proposal (or its Representatives), on the other hand.

 


 

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary  in this Agreement, at any time
prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approvals, the Company may,
subject to compliance with _Section 7.02(b)_, furnish information  to, and
enter into discussions with, a Person who has made, after the date hereof, an
unsolicited, written, bona fide Competing Proposal so long as such Competing
Proposal did not result from a breach of this _Section 7.02_ and, prior to
furnishing such information and entering into such discussions, the Company
Board has (i) reasonably determined, in its good faith judgment (after having
received the  advice of a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation and outside legal counsel) that (A) such Competing Proposal
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal
and (B) the failure to furnish such  information to, or enter into such
discussions with, the Person who made such Competing Proposal would be
inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary duties to the Company and its
stockholders under applicable Law, (ii) previously provided all  such
information to Parent (or provides such information to Parent substantially
concurrent with the time it is provided to such Person), and (iii) obtained
from such Person an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement.

 


 

 


 

 

 

76  


 

 


 

 

(d) Except as set forth in this _Section 7.02(d)_, neither the Company Board
nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) fail to make, withdraw, qualify,
modify or amend, or propose publicly to fail to make,  withdraw, qualify,
modify or amend, the Company Recommendation or fail to include the Company
Recommendation in the Consent Solicitation Statement, (B) adopt or recommend,
or propose publicly to adopt or recommend, any Competing Proposal, or (C) 
enter into any agreement relating to a Competing Proposal (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement), or (ii) make any public statement
inconsistent with the Company Recommendation (any of the actions described in
the foregoing clauses  (i) and (ii), a " _Change in the Company
Recommendation_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time prior to the
receipt of the Company Stockholder Approvals and  subject to compliance with
_Section 7.02(b)_ the Company Board determines in its good faith judgment
(after having received the advice of a financial advisor of nationally 
recognized reputation and outside legal counsel) that the failure of the
Company Board to make a Change in the Company Recommendation would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board to the Company and
its stockholders under  applicable Law, then the Company Board may make a
Change in the Company Recommendation; _provided_ , _however_ ,  that no
Change in the Company Recommendation may be made that relates to a Competing
Proposal unless such Competing Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the Company shall not be entitled to exercise
its right to make a Change in the Company Recommendation until after the
fourth Business Day following Parent's  receipt of written notice from the
Company advising Parent that the Company Board intends to make a Change in the
Company Recommendation (a " _Notice of Adverse Recommendation_
")           and specifying the reasons therefor, including the
terms and conditions of any Superior Proposal and including an unredacted copy
of any proposed agreement (including schedules and exhibits thereto) relating
to such Superior Proposal (it being  understood and agreed that any
subsequent amendment to the financial terms or any other material term of such
Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Adverse Recommendation and a
three Business Day notice period). The Company agrees that,  during the
applicable four or three Business Day notice period prior to the Company Board
making a Change in the Company Recommendation, the Company and its
Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with Parent and its
Representatives regarding  any revisions to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by Parent. In determining whether to make a Change in the Company
Recommendation, the Company Board shall take into account any changes to the
financial or other terms of this Agreement  proposed by Parent in response to
a Notice of Adverse Recommendation or otherwise. At the end of the four
Business Day notice period (or three Business Day notice period with respect
to any amendment to the financial terms or any other material  term of such
Superior Proposal) the Company Board may effect a Change in the Company
Recommendation if the Company Board shall again make a determination in good
faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors
(and  taking into account any adjustment or modification of the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Parent), that the Competing Proposal continues to be a
Superior Proposal and that the Change in the Company Recommendation is
required to comply with the  fiduciary duties of the Company Board to the
Company and its stockholders under applicable Law.

 


 

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this  Agreement to the contrary, (i) neither
the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall withdraw, revoke, rescind,
modify or amend in any manner the Drag-Along Resolution and (ii) in no event
shall any Change in the Company

Recommendation (A) affect the validity and enforceability of this Agreement or
the other Transaction Documents, including the obligations of the Company and
the Company's  stockholders that are party to the Transaction Documents to
consummate the Mergers or the other Transactions and to deliver (or cause to
be delivered) the written consent contemplated by Section 3(b) of the Selling
Investor Support Agreement, or (B)  cause any state corporate takeover
statute or other similar statute to be applicable to the Mergers or the other
Transactions.

 


 

 

Section 7.03 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. (a) Except as otherwise
prohibited by applicable Law, from the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause its  Subsidiaries to,
provide to Parent and Parent's Representatives reasonable access during normal
business hours upon reasonable prior notice to the officers, employees and
other personnel, agents, properties, offices and other facilities of the 
Company and its Subsidiaries and to the books and records thereof (including
for purposes of conducting regulatory compliance reviews and audits to allow
Parent to be in compliance with its policies and procedures and any applicable
Law at the  Effective Time); _provided_ , _however_ , that (x) the Company
shall not be required to provide  access to or disclose any such information
to the extent such access or disclosure would result in the loss of attorney-
client privilege of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries ( _provided_  
that the Company and its Subsidiaries shall use their reasonable best efforts
to allow for such access or disclosure in a manner that does not result in a
loss of attorney-client privilege) and (y) the Company may limit physical
access to the  properties, offices and other facilities of the Company and
its Subsidiaries to the extent the Company reasonably determines, in light of
COVID-19, that such access would jeopardize the health and safety of any
employee of the Company or its  Subsidiaries or to the extent necessary to
comply with applicable Laws.

 


 

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of the  foregoing, the Company covenants
and agrees that, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time,
the Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed as to the Company's FDA
regulatory strategy with respect to non-immaterial communications  with FDA,
pre-submissions to FDA, submissions to FDA, and any other regulatory issues
under consideration for presentation to FDA, including IDEs, clinical trials
(whether new or on-going), and medical technology, including by providing
copies of  material information to Parent; _provided_ , that the Company
shall not be required to provide such information to the extent providing such
information would result in the  loss of attorney-client privilege of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries ( _provided_ that the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall use their reasonable best efforts to  provide such
information in a manner that does not result in a loss of attorney-client
privilege). In order to keep Parent reasonably informed regarding the
Company's regulatory relationship with FDA, the Company also agrees to in a
reasonably  timely manner provide Parent with any and all material
communications with FDA with respect to its pre-submissions, submissions, and
other non-immaterial regulatory issues such as IDEs, clinical trials (whether
new or on-going), medical technology  and any other subject which would
likely have a material impact on the Company's current or future business.
Nothing contained in this _Section 7.03(b)_ is intended to  give Parent,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the FDA regulatory
strategy of the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time.

 


 

 


 

 

 

78  


 

 


 

 

(c) Except as otherwise prohibited by  applicable Law, from the date of this
Agreement until the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, provide to the Company and the Company's Representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours upon reasonable  prior notice
to Parent's personnel and records on a basis consistent with the Company's
access to such personnel and records prior to the date hereof in connection
with the Company's due diligence review of Parent and its Subsidiaries in
connection  with the Transactions.

 


 

 

(d) All information obtained by the parties  hereto pursuant to this _Section
7.03 _shall be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement.

 


 

 

(e) No investigation pursuant to this _Section 7.03_ shall affect any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement of any party
hereto or any condition to the obligations of the parties hereto.

 


 

 

Section 7.04 _Employee Benefits Matters_. (a) From and after the Effective
Time, Parent shall (or shall cause its Affiliates, including the Surviving
Entity and its Subsidiaries to), honor in accordance with  their terms, all
Plans and all other contracts, agreements, arrangements, policies, plans and
commitments of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time that are applicable to current or 
former Service Providers. For the period beginning on the Closing Date and
continuing through the first anniversary of the Closing Date (or, if shorter,
during the period of employment), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Entity and its  Subsidiaries to, provide each employee of the Company or its
Subsidiaries who continues to be employed by the Company or the Surviving
Entity or their respective Affiliates after the Closing Date (collectively,
the " _Continuing Employees_ ") with (i) an annual base salary or hourly wage
rate, as applicable, and annual cash target bonus or other recurring cash
incentive opportunity that is no less favorable, in the  aggregate, than the
annual base salary or hourly wage rate, as applicable, and annual target cash
bonus or other recurring cash incentive opportunity provided to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, in the
aggregate,  and (ii) health, welfare and retirement benefits that are
substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to either, in Parent's sole
discretion, (A) the health, welfare and retirement benefits provided to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to  the Effective Time or (B) the
health, welfare and retirement benefits provided to similarly situated
employees of Parent and its Affiliates, in each case and for the avoidance of
doubt, excluding defined benefit pension benefits. Without limiting  the
foregoing, the Chief Executive Officers of each of Parent and the Company, or
each of their respective designees, shall cooperate to design and implement an
annual bonus program, including performance goals, for the benefit of the
Continuing  Employees for the first full calendar year commencing after the
Closing Date (the " _Post-Closing Bonus Plan_ "), with the bonus payouts to be
based on the attainment of  performance goals applicable to the business of
the Company and its Subsidiaries for such year (and not, for the avoidance of
doubt, performance goals applicable to the business of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries other than the Company and its  Subsidiaries). Each Continuing
Employee shall be entitled to participate in the Post-Closing Bonus Plan with
an annual bonus target equal to the greater of (x) such Continuing Employee's
annual bonus target under the Closing Year VCP (as defined  below) and (y)
the

 


 

 


 

 

 

79  


 

 


 

 

annual bonus target of a similarly-situated employees of Parent (as reasonably
determined by Parent where such targets constitute a range).

 


 

 

(b) For all purposes under the employee  benefit plans of Parent and its
Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Continuing Employee after the Effective
Time (including the Plans), but excluding any retiree health or welfare plans
or programs and (solely for purposes of vesting) any equity  compensation
arrangements (the " _New Plans_ "), Parent shall credit each Continuing
Employee with his or her years of service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their  respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to
the same extent as such Continuing Employee was entitled, immediately prior to
the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar Plan in which
such Continuing Employee  participated or was eligible to participate
immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that the foregoing shall
not apply to the extent that its application would  result in a duplication
of benefits with respect to the same period of service. In addition, and
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall (or shall cause
its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries,  to)
cause (i) each Continuing Employee to become immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent
coverage under such New Plan is replacing coverage under a Plan in which such
Continuing Employee  participated immediately prior to the Effective Time,
and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee, all pre-
existing condition exclusions or limitations, evidence  of insurability
requirements, required physical examinations and actively-at-work requirements
of such New Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her
covered dependents, to the extent such conditions were inapplicable or
waived  under the comparable Plans in which such Continuing Employee
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall (or shall
cause its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries,
to) cause any eligible expenses  incurred by any Continuing Employee and his
or her covered dependents during the portion of the Plan year ending on the
date such Continuing Employee's participation in the corresponding New Plan
begins to be taken into account under such New Plan  for purposes of
satisfying all applicable deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in 
accordance with such New Plan.

 


 

 

(c) To the extent any payments to  "disqualified individuals" of the Company
or its Subsidiaries (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code) could be
characterized as "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Section
280G(b)(1) of the Code in connection with the  Transactions, the Company
shall (i) no later than the Closing (and in any event prior to obtaining the
consent of any recipient of such payment in accordance with (ii) below),
disclose its calculations with respect to the potential excess parachute 
payments to Parent, and provide any other information reasonably requested by
Parent that is necessary in order for Parent to review and understand such
calculations (it being understood that the Company shall not be required to
provide documents  and information not in the Company's possession or to
prepare or draft any calculations or documents (other than the waivers,
disclosure and solicitation documents and calculations of excess parachute
payments otherwise referenced in this _Section 7.04(c)_ )), (ii) use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from any disqualified individual a
waiver of his or her rights to any such potential excess parachute

 


 

 


 

 

 

80  


 

 


 

 

payment absent approval by the Company's shareholders in accordance with this
_Section 7.04(c)_,  and (iii) prior to the Closing, submit such payments for
approval or disapproval by a vote of the stockholders of the Company entitled
to vote on such matters in a manner intended to meet the requirements of
Section 280G of the Code and the  applicable treasury regulations thereunder.
Parent shall have the right to review and comment on any waiver required by
clause (ii) and any disclosure and solicitation documents required by clause
(iii) before such waiver or consent is sought or  document is distributed, as
applicable, and the Company shall consider any such comments in good faith.
Parent shall, no later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing,
provide to the Company any Parent plans or arrangements that could  result in
the payment of any excess parachute payment that would be subject to the
foregoing; _provided_ that, in any event, the Company's failure to include
such Parent  plans or arrangement in the stockholders voting materials
described herein due to Parent's failure to provide such plans and
arrangements as contemplated hereby will not result in a breach of the
covenants set forth in this _Section 7.04(c)_.

 


 

 

(d) Parent shall maintain (or cause its  Subsidiaries, including, following
the Closing, the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries, to maintain) the
Company's annual Variable Compensation Plan for the year in which the Closing
Date occurs (the " _Closing Year VCP_ ") until at least December 31st of the
year in which the Closing Date occurs, and shall pay (or cause its 
Subsidiaries, including, following the Closing, the Surviving Entity or its
Subsidiaries, to pay) to each Continuing Employee who was a participant in the
Closing Year VCP immediately prior to the Closing an award thereunder for the
calendar year  in which the Closing occurs based on the greater of (x) actual
performance under the Closing Year VCP (which, for the avoidance of doubt, may
be up to 150%) and (y) target performance (each, a " _VCP Bonus_ "), subject
to each such Continuing Employee's continued employment with the Surviving
Entity or its Subsidiaries through the applicable payment date and otherwise
in accordance with the terms of the Closing Year  VCP. If any such Continuing
Employee's employment is involuntarily terminated prior to the payment of his
or her VCP Bonus, he or she will remain eligible to receive his or her VCP
Bonus following the end of the applicable calendar year (but in no  event
later than March 15th of the year following the year in which the Closing Date
occurs).

 


 

 

(e) Following the Closing, Parent shall  provide each Continuing Employee
with equity-based compensation (" _Parent Equity Awards_ ") in accordance and
consistent with Parent's standard incentive equity grant  practices, which
shall include (without limitation), grants of Parent Equity Awards no less
frequently than, in amounts and values that are no less than, and with terms
and conditions (including vesting conditions) that are no less favorable
than,  Parent Equity Awards granted to similarly-situated Parent employees
from time to time.

 


 

 

(f) Without limiting the generality of _Section 11.05_, the provisions of this
_Section 7.04_ are for the sole benefit of the parties to  this Agreement and
nothing herein, express or implied, is intended or shall be construed as to
confer upon or give any Person (including for the avoidance of doubt, any
Continuing Employee or other current or former Service Provider), other than 
the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any
legal or equitable or other rights or remedies (including with respect to the
matters provided for in this _Section           7.04_ ) under or by
reason of any provision of this Agreement. Nothing contained in this
Agreement, express or implied, shall (i) be treated as an amendment to any
Plan, New Plan or other compensation or benefit plan, program, policy, 
agreement, arrangement or understanding

 


 

 


 

 

 

81  


 

 


 

 

for any purpose, (ii) obligate Parent or the Surviving Entity or any of their
Subsidiaries to (A) maintain any particular benefit plan or arrangement or (B)
retain the  employment of any particular employee or (iii) prevent Parent or
the Surviving Entity or any of their Subsidiaries from amending or terminating
any benefit plan or arrangement, in each case, subject to compliance with the
other provisions of this _Section 7.04_.

 


 

 

Section 7.05 _Directors ' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance_. (a)
Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to assume, and shall cause the
Surviving Entity to comply with (including by providing the  Company with
sufficient funds to comply with), the obligations with respect to all rights
to indemnification, advancement of expenses, and exculpation from liabilities,
for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now
existing  in favor of the current or former directors or officers of the
Company as provided in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Company or any indemnification contract between such directors or officers and
the Company (in each case, as in  effect on the date hereof), without further
action, as of the Effective Time, and such obligations shall survive the
Mergers and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms. For the avoidance of doubt, the applicable  rights of indemnification,
advancement of expenses, and exculpation contemplated by this _Section 7.05_
and pursuant to the terms of the certificate of incorporation or  bylaws of
the Company as in effect at or prior to the Effective Time shall not be
impaired by any modification of such terms in any amendment or restatement of
such certificate of incorporation or bylaws following the Effective Time.

 


 

 

(b) Parent shall obtain, at the Effective  Time, a prepaid (or "tail")
directors' and officers' liability insurance policy in respect of acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time for six years from the
Effective Time, covering each Person currently covered by the  Company's
directors' and officers' liability insurance policies (a true and complete
copy of which has been heretofore made available to Parent), on terms with
respect to such coverage and amounts no less favorable than those of such
policy in  effect on the date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no
event shall the Surviving Entity be  required to expend pursuant to this
_Section 7.05(b)_ an aggregate amount in excess of 300% of the last annual
premium paid by the Company for such insurance; _provided_ , _further_ , that,
if the aggregate amount necessary to procure such insurance coverage  exceeds
such maximum amount, Parent shall only be obligated to provide as much
coverage as may be obtained for such maximum amount.

 


 

 

(c) In the event the Surviving Entity or any  of their respective successors
or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving limited liability company or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially  all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Entity, as the case may be, or at Parent's option, Parent, shall assume the
obligations  set forth in this _Section 7.05_.

 


 

 

Section 7.06 _Notification of Certain Matters_. (a) The Company shall give
prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company,
of (i) the occurrence, or non‑occurrence, of any change,  event, fact or
development which would reasonably be expected to cause any of their
respective representations or warranties contained in this Agreement to become
untrue or inaccurate such that the conditions set forth in

 


 

 


 

 

 

82  


 

 


 

 

_Section 8.02(a)_ or _Section 8.03(a)_  would not be satisfied and (ii) any
failure of the Company, Parent, First Merger Sub or Second Merger Sub, as the
case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to
be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement  such that the
conditions set forth in _Section 8.02(b)_ or _Section 8.03(b)_ would not be 
satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant
to this _Section 7.06_ shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies
available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

 


 

 

(b) The Company shall give prompt notice to  Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, of any notice or other communication from any
Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions or from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required  in connection
with the Transactions.

 


 

 

Section 7.07 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Further Action_. (a) Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties
hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take,  or cause to be
taken, all actions that are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and
make effective the Transactions, including using its reasonable best efforts
to accomplish the following: (i) the satisfaction of the conditions
precedent  set forth in Article VIII, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary
consents, approvals or waivers from third parties, including pursuant to the
contracts set forth on _Section 4.04 of  the Company Disclosure Letter_ ;
_provided_ that, notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries be obligated to bear  any expense or pay any fee
(other than the payment of nominal administrative, processing or similar fees
or charges) or grant any concession in connection with obtaining the consents,
approvals or waivers referred to in this clause (ii), (iii) the  obtaining of
all necessary actions or nonactions and consents from, and the giving of any
necessary notices to, Governmental Authorities and third parties and the
making of all necessary registrations, declarations and filings under the HSR
Act,  which shall be made as soon as reasonably practicable following the
date hereof and in any event no later than fifteen (15) Business Days
following the date hereof, or are required or advisable under other applicable
antitrust, competition or  pre-merger notification Laws of any jurisdiction
(collectively, " _Antitrust Laws_ "), if any, (iv) the taking of all
reasonable steps to provide any supplemental information  requested by any
Governmental Authority, including participating in meetings with officials of
such entity in the course of its review of this Agreement or the Transactions,
including the Merger, (v) the taking of all reasonable steps as may be 
necessary to avoid any Action by any Governmental Authority or third party
that would otherwise have the effect of materially delaying or preventing the
consummation of the Merger and (vi) the defending or contesting of any Actions
challenging this  Agreement or the consummation of the Merger, including
seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court
or other Governmental Authority vacated or reversed. In connection with and
without limiting the generality of the  foregoing, reasonable best efforts
shall include (and with respect to remedies, shall be limited to) Parent and
its Subsidiaries offering and agreeing to undertake Permitted Restrictions as
reasonably necessary to obtain pre-merger clearance in as  timely a manner as
reasonably possible from Governmental Authorities under Antitrust Laws in the
United States and, if applicable, the UK and Germany (specifically, for (1)
any waiting period applicable to the Mergers under the HSR Act to have been 
terminated or expired and the avoidance of an Action in the US seeking to
prohibit consummation of the Merger, and (2) any antitrust clearance required
to be obtained in the UK and Germany (if applicable)). Notwithstanding the
foregoing or any  other provision of this

 


 

 


 

 

 

83  


 

 


 

 

Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall Parent or its Subsidiaries
(including First Merger Sub and Second Merger Sub and, after the Effective
Time, the Surviving  Corporation and its Subsidiaries and, after the Second
Effective Time, the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries) be required to
agree to or accept (A) any commitment, undertaking or Order to divest, hold
separate or otherwise dispose of any portion  of its or their respective
businesses or assets, including after giving effect to the Transactions, or
(B) any limitation on the ability of Parent or its Subsidiaries to acquire or
hold or exercise full rights of ownership of any capital stock of the 
Company or its Subsidiaries, including after giving effect to the
Transactions; _provided_ , however, it being understood that Permitted
Restrictions affecting the operations  of Parent or its Subsidiaries
(including, for this purpose, the Company and its Subsidiaries) shall be
deemed not to be a limitation on the ability to exercise full rights of
ownership. In no event shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries be 
permitted to commit or agree to any remedy (including any matter described in
clauses (A) and (B) and any Permitted Restriction) without Parent's prior
written consent. Nothing in this _Section           7.07(a)_ shall
require any party to take or agree to take any action with respect to its
business or operations pursuant to this _Section 7.07(a)_ unless the 
effectiveness of such agreement or action is conditioned upon the Closing.

 


 

 

For purposes of this Agreement, " _Permitted Restrictions_ " shall mean the 
actions described in _Section 7.07 of the Company Disclosure Letter_.

 


 

 

(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall  (i) reasonably cooperate with each
other in connection with any filing or submission with any Governmental
Authorities in connection with the Transactions and any consents from any
Governmental Authority in connection therewith and any  investigation or
other inquiry related thereto and in connection with resolving any such
investigation or inquiry with respect to any such filing or the Mergers, (ii)
not extend any waiting or suspension period under any applicable Antitrust
Laws  or enter into any agreement with any Governmental Authority not to
consummate the Mergers, except with the prior written consent of the other
party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
(iii) respond as promptly as  practicable to any applicable inquiries or
requests received from any Governmental Authority for additional information
or documentation, (iv) promptly make any applicable further filings or
information submissions pursuant thereto that may be  necessary or advisable
and (v) promptly make any requisite filings or submissions required or
advisable under any applicable Antitrust Laws. Each of Parent and the Company
shall (A) promptly notify the other party of any written or oral 
communication to that party or its Subsidiaries or Representatives from any
Governmental Authority regarding the parties' collaborative efforts to obtain
consents to the Mergers under Antitrust Laws, (B) subject to applicable Law
and to the extent  reasonably practicable, permit the other party to review
and comment on any substantive written communication regarding such efforts
prior to providing such communication to any Governmental Authority and (C) to
the extent reasonably practicable,  not agree to participate, or permit its
Subsidiaries or Representatives to participate, in any substantive meeting or
discussion with any Governmental Authority in respect of any filings,
investigation or inquiry concerning consents to the Mergers  under Antitrust

discussions between Parent and the Company, the implementation of such
communication, strategy or process will be controlled by Parent after good
faith  consideration of the views of Company. Without limiting the foregoing,
neither party shall make any filings, submissions or substantive written
communications to any Governmental Authority to obtain consents to the Mergers
under Antitrust Laws  without first providing a written copy of such filing,
submission or communication to the other party (or as appropriate to such
party's outside counsel) and allowing the other party a reasonable opportunity
to provide comments on such filing,  submission or communication prior to
submission. Parent and the Company covenant and agree to incorporate all

(b) None of Parent, First Merger Sub or  Second Merger Sub shall agree to any
amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or
remedy under the Financing Commitments, without the prior written consent of
the Company if such amendments, modifications or waivers  would, or would
reasonably be expected to, (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing;
(ii) impose new conditions (or expand any existing conditions) to the receipt
of the Financing (in the case of each of (i) and (ii), only if such 
amendments, modifications or waivers would reasonably be expected to (x)
interfere with Parent's ability to make available to the Exchange Agent at or

of Parent's, First  Merger Sub's and Second Merger Sub's obligations under
this Agreement, including the payment of the Merger Consideration and the

Parent, First Merger Sub or Second Merger Sub become aware; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event will Parent, First Merger Sub and Second Merger
Sub be under any obligation to disclose any information that is subject to
attorney-client or similar privilege. If any  portion of the Financing
becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions (including the "market flex"
provisions) contemplated in the Financing Commitments and such portion is
necessary to consummate the Mergers, Parent shall use its reasonable best 
efforts to arrange and obtain alternative financing from alternative sources
in an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement upon terms and conditions not materially less favorable to Parent
than those in the  Financing Commitments (including, as necessary, the
"market flex" provisions contained in any fee letter related to the Financing
Commitments) (the " _Alternative Financing_ ")  as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event and prior to when the conditions to
Mergers set forth in _Article VIII_ (other than those conditions that by

commitment letters and related fee letters (which may be redacted) in
connection with an Alternative Financing shall constitute Financing
Commitments under this Agreement.

that nothing herein shall require such cooperation to the extent it would
interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company or its
Subsidiaries in  any material respect; _provided_ , _further_ , that neither
the Company nor any of its  Subsidiaries shall be required to commit to take
any action that is not contingent upon the Closing (including the entry into
any agreement) or that would be effective prior to the Effective Time other

extent so required or otherwise reasonably necessary to permit Parent to
prepare pro forma financial  statements customary for Financings of the
applicable type (all such information in clauses (A) and this clause (B), the

information (excluding any projections, forecasts, pro forma financial
information and other forward-looking information), to the knowledge of the
Company, taken as  a whole, is not correct in all material respects, contains

necessary to make such information supplied in writing by or on behalf of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries  not materially misleading.

 


 

 

(c) Nothing in this _Section 7.19 _shall require such cooperation to the

require the Company to incur any other liability or obligation prior to the
Effective Time (it being understood, however, that the Company shall bear all
costs and expenses of its annual audit and quarterly reviews of its financial

Parent)), or (iii) cause any condition to the Mergers set forth in _Article

connection with the Financing (other than arising from fraud, willful
misconduct or misrepresentations,  misstatements or omissions) and any
information utilized in connection therewith (other than written information

(d) For the avoidance of doubt and  notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, Parent acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein are not  conditioned upon the
availability or consummation of the Financing or any other debt financing, the
availability of any equity financing or the receipt of the proceeds therefrom.

 


 

 

(e) Without limiting in any respect the  liabilities of the Financing Sources
to Parent, First Merger Sub, Second Merger Sub or their Affiliates, or the
remedies of Parent, First Merger Sub, Second Merger Sub or their Affiliates
against the Financing Sources under any

 


 

 


 

 

 

92  


 

 


 

 

other agreement to which they are both parties, none of the Financing Sources
shall have any liability to the parties or their Affiliates relating to or
arising out of this  Agreement, whether at law or equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise, and neither the parties nor any of their Affiliates will

Section 7.19(e) as if they were a party to this Agreement).

 


 

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary  herein, it is understood and
agreed that the condition precedent set forth in _Section 8.02(b)_, as applied
to the Company's obligations under this _Section 7.19_, shall be deemed to be
satisfied unless the financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter has
not been obtained as a direct result of the Company's Intentional Breach of
its  obligations under this _Section 7.19._

 


 

 

(g) The Company and Parent agree to the  matters set forth on _Section
7.19(g) of the Company Disclosure Letter_.

 


 

 

Section 7.20 _Resignations of Directors and Officers_. At or prior to the
Closing, the Company shall request that each director and officer of the
Company deliver to Parent written resignation and release letters,  effective
as of the Closing Date, of each of the directors and officers of the Company
requested by Parent in writing at least five Business Days prior to the
Closing, effectuating his or her resignation from such position as a member of
the  Company Board or as an officer (although not as an employee, if
applicable, unless otherwise so requested by Parent), in form and substance

Intentional Breach prior to such termination of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive any termination
of this Agreement.

 


 

 

Section 9.03 _Fees and Expenses_. (a) In the event that:

 


 

 


 

 

 

97  


 

 


 

 

(i) Parent or the Company  terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section
9.01(b)(i)_ and, at the time of such termination, one or more of the
conditions set forth in _Section 8.01(c)_ (if the failure of such condition to
be satisfied is a result of a Restraint arising under Antitrust Laws),
_Section 8.01(d)_  or _Section 8.02(d)_ were not satisfied or waived;

 


 

 

(ii) Parent or the  Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section
9.01(b)(ii)_ as a result of a Restraint arising under Antitrust Laws; or

 


 

 

(iii) Parent terminates  this Agreement pursuant to Section _9.01(c)(ii)_ ,

 


 

 

and, in the case of each of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), at the time of such
termination (A) all of the other conditions set forth in _Article VIII_ have
been satisfied or validly waived (except for those conditions that by their
terms must be satisfied at the Closing, _provided_   that such conditions
would have been so satisfied if the Closing would have occurred) and (B) the
Company and the Selling Investors are not in breach in any material respect of
its obligations under this Agreement or Selling Investor Support  Agreement,
as applicable, in any manner that shall be the proximate cause of the failure
of any of the conditions referred to in clause (i) above or the imposition of
the Restraint in clause (ii) above or the imposition of any remedies (x) other
than  Permitted Restrictions or (y) unless such remedy is part of an
agreement between Parent and its Subsidiaries and a Governmental Authority, as
applicable, then Parent shall pay to the Company a fee equal to $300,000,000
(the " _Regulatory Termination Fee_ "), by wire transfer on the second
Business Day following the date of termination of this Agreement. In no event
shall Parent be required to pay the Regulatory  Termination Fee on more than
one occasion.

 


 

 

(b) All Expenses incurred in connection with  this Agreement and the

Statement and the Consent Solicitation Statement (including filing fees) shall
be borne by Parent, whether or not the Mergers or any other Transaction is
consummated.

 


 

 

(c) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree  that the agreements contained
in _Section 9.03(a)_ are an integral part of the Transactions, and that,
without these agreements, the parties hereto would not enter into  this
Agreement; accordingly, if Parent fails promptly to pay the Regulatory
Termination Fee, and, in order to obtain such payment, the Company commences a
suit that results in a judgment against Parent for the Regulatory Termination
Fee, Parent  shall pay to the Company its costs and expenses (including
attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, in each case,
together with interest on the amount of the Regulatory Termination Fee, as
applicable, from the date such payment  was required to be made until the
date of payment at the prime rate set forth in The Wall Street Journal, in
effect on the date such payment was required to  be made. Each party further
acknowledges that the Regulatory Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather
is a reasonable amount that will compensate the receiving party in the
circumstances in which such payment is payable for the efforts and  resources
expended and opportunities forgone while negotiating this Agreement and in
reliance

 


 

 


 

 

 

98  


 

 


 

 

on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
Transactions contemplated hereby, which amounts would otherwise be impossible
to calculate with  precision.

 


 

 

(d) Subject to the proviso at the end of  this sentence, in the event the
Regulatory Termination Fee is required to be paid and is paid to the Company
pursuant to _Section 9.03(a)_ , such payment of the Regulatory  Termination
Fee shall constitute liquidated damages and be the sole and exclusive monetary
remedy of the Company and its Subsidiaries and the Company's and its
Subsidiaries' respective current or future stockholders, employees, directors,
officers  or Affiliates (collectively, the " _Company Related Parties_ ")
against Parent, First Merger Sub and Second Merger Sub and their respective
current, former or future  Representatives (collectively, the " _Parent
Related Parties_ ") for all losses, damages, costs or expenses in respect of
this Agreement (or the termination thereof) or the  Transactions (or the
failure of such transactions to occur for any reason or for no reason) or any
breach of any covenant or agreement or otherwise in respect of this Agreement
or any oral representation made or alleged to be made in connection 
herewith, and upon payment of the Regulatory Termination Fee, none of the
Parent Related Parties shall have any further monetary liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions, and none of
the Company, its  Subsidiaries or any other Company Related Party shall seek
to recover any other monetary damages; _provided_ , _however_ , that (x)
_Section 7.19(c)_ shall survive any such termination and (y) in the event of
any Intentional Breach by Parent, First Merger Sub  or Second Merger Sub
prior to such termination, the Company shall be entitled to the payment of the
Regulatory Termination Fee (to the extent owed pursuant to _Section
9.03(a))_  and to seek any damages (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
damages of the type referred to in _Section 11.05(ii)_), to the extent proven,
resulting from or arising out  of such Intentional Breach (as reduced by any
Regulatory Termination Fee paid by Parent).

 


 

 

Section 9.04 _Continuation Payments; Additional Termination Payment; Equity
Issuance Fees and Expenses_. (a) In the event (i) the Effective Time has not
occurred on or before 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on December  20, 2020, and

Continuation Payment (as defined below) is due, Parent shall make a payment to
the Company of $35 million (each, a " _Continuation   Payment_ "), by wire
transfer on the next Business Day following such date and on the 20th day of
each month thereafter until the earlier of (a) the Closing Date or (b) the
termination of this Agreement by either Parent or  the Company pursuant to
_Section 9.01_ (such date, the " _Continuation End Date_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent shall have no obligation to make any Continuation
Payment which is  an Excess Continuation Payment unless and until the Company
Conditions have been satisfied (it being understood that any Excess
Continuation Payment(s) that would have been required to be paid if the
Company Conditions have been satisfied will be  paid by Parent to the Company
promptly following satisfaction of the Company Conditions); _provided_ ,
_further_ ,  that the Company may waive Parent's obligation to make any

 


 

  
 


 

 


 

 

 

99  


 

 


 

 

Excess Continuation Payment. For the avoidance of doubt, no additional

(b) In the event that this Agreement is  terminated in a circumstance where
the Regulatory Termination Fee becomes payable by Parent in accordance with

the proximate cause of the failure of such Company Conditions to be
satisfied),  at the Company's election, by written notice to Parent no later
than the date which is ten (10) Business Days after such termination, Parent
shall pay to the Company an additional amount specified by the Company up to
$300 million (the " _Additional Termination Payment_ ") on or prior to the
date which is three (3) Business Days after the later of: (i) the date of the
Company's written election referred to in  this _Section 9.04(b)_, and (ii)
the satisfaction of the Company Conditions (unless Parent's breach of this
_Section 9.04_  is the proximate cause of the failure of such Company
Conditions to be satisfied, in which case the Additional Termination Payment
shall be payable upon the date specified in clause (i)).

 


 

 

(c) Upon the date which is the later of (i)  sixty (60) days after the date
of termination of this Agreement (the " _Termination Date_ "), and (ii) three

Issuance Conditions, as consideration for any Excess Continuation Payments and
the Additional Termination Payment, in each case, actually made by Parent, as

validly  issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Series E-1 Preferred

Termination Payment  actually paid by Parent to the Company ((A) plus (B)
being the " _Investment Amount_ "), minus (C) an amount (if any) specified by
the Company in its sole discretion (the " _Reduction Amount_ "), divided by

Reduction Amount (if any); _provided that_ , prior to consummation of the
Equity Issuance, the Company may elect (in its sole discretion) to pay to
Parent an amount of  cash equal to the Investment Amount, and, upon such
payment being made to Parent, the Company shall have no further liability
pursuant to this _Section 9.04_ and, for the  avoidance of doubt, will not be
obliged to consummate the Equity Issuance or follow the process set forth in
_Section 9.04(f)_.

 


 

 

(d) The Company shall use its reasonable  best efforts to cause the Company
Conditions to be satisfied prior to the earlier to occur of (i) in
circumstances where the Regulatory Termination Fee is payable, the Termination
Date, and (ii) prior to the date that the first payment by Parent to  the
Company of any Excess Continuation Payment is payable. Parent irrevocably
agrees that it shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to), upon the written
request of the Company, vote any shares of capital stock of the Company held
by it to approve  all matters and execute any written consents and/or

Equity Issuance (and have not yet been covered  by an Alternative Capital
Raise pursuant to this _Section 9.04(f)(ii)_ ), and (2) the actual number of

_provided_ that, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section
9.04(f)_ , at any time between the Equity Issuance End Date and the
Alternative Financing End Date, the Company may elect (in its sole discretion)
to pay to Parent an  amount of cash equal to the Investment Amount, and, upon
such payment being made to Parent, the Company shall have no further
obligations or liability pursuant to this _Section 9.04_   in respect of the

connection with the Equity Issuance and/or such alternative structure by: (i)
providing Parent with such information as Parent reasonably requests  in
writing in connection with making any filings required under Antitrust Laws,
(ii) at Parent's reasonable request (and at Parent's sole cost and expense)
making such administrative filings with Governmental Authorities that are
required by  Antitrust Law to be made by the Company in connection with the
Equity Issuance or such alternative structure, (iii) at Parent's reasonable
request (and at Parent's sole cost and expense), attending and participating
in meetings with any  Governmental Authorities which are reasonably required
in connection with obtaining clearance under Antitrust Laws, (iv) promptly

Governmental Authority relating to such  approvals or clearance, (v)

 


 

 


 

 

 

103

providing such communication to any Governmental Authority and (vi) to extent
reasonably practicable, not agree to participate, or permit its Subsidiaries
or Representatives to participate, in any  substantive meeting or discussion
with any Governmental Authority with respect to the Equity Issuance or such
alternative structure unless it consults with Parent in advance and, to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Authority and reasonably  practicable,
gives Parent the opportunity to attend and participate. For the avoidance of
doubt, and notwithstanding any provision in this _Section 9.04(g)_ , nothing
in this  _Section 9.04(g)_ shall obligate the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to offer, agree to or accept any commitment, remedy, undertaking
or Order of any kind.

 


 

 

Section 9.05 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto
by action taken by or on behalf of their respective boards of directors at any
time prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that, after the
Company Stockholder Approvals have been obtained, no amendment  may be made
that under applicable Law or in accordance with the rules of any relevant
stock exchange requires further approval by the stockholders of the Company
without such approval having been obtained. This Agreement may not be amended
except  by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties hereto.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 9.05_, none of
_Section 5.08_, _Section 7.18_, _Section 7.19_, _Section 9.05_, _Section
11.05_, _Section 11.07_  and _Section 11.09_ (or any other provision of this
Agreement the amendment or waiver of which has the effect of modifying such
Sections) may be amended, modified,  terminated or waived in a manner that is
adverse to the Financing Sources without the prior written consent of such
Financing Sources (it being expressly agreed that the Financing Sources in
their capacities as such shall be third party  beneficiaries of this _Section
9.05_ and shall be entitled to the protections of the provisions contained in
this _Section 9.05_ as if they were a party to this Agreement).

 


 

 

Section 9.06 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party
hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance of any obligation or other
act of any other party hereto, (b) to the extent permitted by  applicable
Law, waive any breach of or inaccuracy in the representations and warranties
of any other party contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto and (c) to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waive
compliance  with any agreement of any other party or any condition to its own
obligations contained in this Agreement. No extension or waiver by the Company
shall require the approval of the stockholders of the Company, unless required
by applicable Law.   Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by
the Company or Parent, First Merger Sub or Second Merger Sub in exercising any
right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any  other or future exercise of any other
right hereunder. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid if set forth in
an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby.

 


 

 

Section 9.07 _Procedure for Termination or Amendment_. A termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01_ or an amendment of this  Agreement
pursuant to _Section 9.04_ shall, in order to be effective, require, in the
case of Parent or the Company, action by its board of directors or, with
respect to  any amendment of this Agreement pursuant to

CVR HOLDER REPRESENTATIVE

 


 

 

Section 10.01 _Designation and Replacement of CVR Holder Representative_. The
parties have agreed that it is desirable to designate a  representative to
act on behalf of those holders of Company Stock and Company Equity Awards who
receive CVRs pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (each, a " _Holder_ ")
for all purposes under the CVR Agreement (the " _CVR Holder Representative_
"). The Company (and, upon execution of a Letter of Transmittal, each Holder)
will, promptly following the date hereof, subject to the prior written consent
of Parent (not  to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
designate an initial CVR Holder Representative, and appoint the CVR Holder
Representative as agent and attorney-in-fact for and on behalf of the other
Holders for all purposes under the CVR  Agreement; _provided_ that
notwithstanding the foregoing, the  Company may appoint Fortis Advisors LLC
(or any of its Affiliates) or Shareholder Representative Services LLC (or any
of its Affiliates) as the CVR Holder Representative without Parent's consent.
The CVR Holder Representative may resign at any  time by five days' prior
written notice to Parent. The CVR Holder Representative may be removed
pursuant to the terms of the CVR Agreement. In the event that the CVR Holder
Representative has resigned or been removed, a new CVR Holder 
Representative, as applicable, shall concurrently be appointed pursuant to the
CVR Agreement. All power, authority, rights and privileges conferred in this
Agreement and the CVR Agreement to the initial CVR Holder Representative will
apply to any  successor CVR Holder Representative. The designation of any
Person as a CVR Holder Representative is and shall be coupled with an
interest, and, except as set forth in this _Article X_ , such designation is
irrevocable and shall not be affected by the death, incapacity, illness,
bankruptcy, dissolution or other  inability to act of any of the stockholders
of the Company.

 


 

 

Section 10.02 _Authority and Rights of the CVR Holder Representative;
Limitations on Liability_. The CVR Holder Representative shall have such
powers and authority as are necessary to carry out the  functions, on behalf
of the Holders, assigned to it under the CVR Agreement, as applicable;
_provided_ , _however_ ,  that the CVR Holder Representative shall have no
obligation to act, except as expressly provided herein. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, each Holder agrees that the CVR Holder
Representative has full power, authority and  discretion, on behalf of each
Holder and his, her or its successors and assigns, to (a) interpret the terms
and provisions of the CVR Agreement and the documents to be executed and
delivered by the Holders in connection therewith, (b) execute and  deliver
and receive deliveries of all agreements, certificates, statements, notices,
approvals, extensions, waivers, undertakings, amendments and other documents
required or permitted to be given in connection with the consummation of the 
transactions contemplated by the CVR Agreement, as applicable, (c) receive
service of process in connection with any claims under the CVR Agreement or
any document or agreement contemplated to be executed or delivered in
connection with the CVR  Agreement, (d) agree to, negotiate and enter into
settlements and compromises of, and assume the defense of, claims, and demand
arbitration and comply with Orders and awards of arbitrators

 


 

 


 

 

 

105  


 

 


 

 

with respect to such claims, and take all actions necessary or appropriate in
the judgement of the CVR Holder Representative for the accomplishment of the
foregoing, (e)  give and receive notices and communications, and (f) take all
actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the CVR Holder
Representative in connection with the CVR Agreement. All actions taken by the
CVR Holder Representative under the CVR  Agreement shall be binding upon the
Holders and their successors as if expressly confirmed and ratified in writing
by each of them. The CVR Holder Representative shall not, in its capacity as
such, have any liability to any Holder with respect to  actions taken or
omitted to be taken in its capacity as the CVR Holder Representative, except
that the CVR Holder Representative will be liable for its willful misconduct
or actual fraud, as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction 
from which no further appeal may be taken. The CVR Holder Representative shall
at all times be entitled to rely on any directions received from the Majority
Holders (as defined in the CVR Agreement); _provided_ , _however_ , that the
CVR Holder Representative shall not be required to follow any such direction,
and shall be under no obligation to  take any action in its capacity as the
CVR Holder Representative, unless the CVR Holder Representative has been
provided with other funds, security or indemnities which, in the sole
determination of the CVR Holder Representative are sufficient to  protect the
CVR Holder Representative against the costs, expenses and liabilities which
may be incurred by the CVR Holder Representative in responding to such
direction or taking such action. At no cost to the Parent, First Merger Sub,
Second Merger  Sub or the Company, the CVR Holder Representative shall be
entitled to engage such counsel, experts and other agents and consultants as
it shall deem necessary in connection with exercising its powers and
performing its function hereunder and (in the  absence of bad faith on the
part of the CVR Holder Representative) shall be entitled to conclusively rely
on the opinions and advice of such Persons. The CVR Holder Representative
shall be entitled to reimbursement from the Holders or the holders of  the
CVRs, as applicable, for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances
(including fees and disbursements of their counsel, experts and other agents
and consultants) incurred by the CVR Holder Representative in such capacity,
and shall be  entitled to indemnification from the Holders against any loss,
liability or expenses arising out of actions taken or omitted to be taken in
its capacity as the CVR Holder Representative (except in each case for those
arising out of the CVR Holder  Representative's, as applicable, gross
negligence or willful misconduct), including the costs and expenses of
investigation and defense of claims. Parent and the Company shall be able to
rely conclusively (without liability) on any instructions given  and actions
taken by the CVR Holder Representative as the instruction and decision of each
Holder in all matters referred to therein, including instructions with respect
to the payment and distribution of any amounts payable pursuant to or in 
relation to the CVR Agreement. No Holder shall have any cause of action
against Parent or the Company for any action taken by Parent or the Company in
reliance upon the written instructions or decisions of the CVR Holder
Representative, or otherwise  on account of payments or distributions made by
or on behalf of Parent in accordance with the instructions of the CVR Holder
Representative. The annual administration or retainer fees payable to the CVR
Holder Representative shall be borne by  Parent. Other than such annual
administration or retainer fees, none of Parent, the Company or their
respective Subsidiaries shall be responsible for or pay any other fees,
expenses or other costs of the CVR Holder Representative. Notwithstanding 
anything to the contrary in this _Article X_ , in the event of a conflict
between the terms of the CVR Agreement and this _Article X_ , the CVR
Agreement shall control.

Section 11.01 _Non-Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants and
Agreements; Exclusive Remedy_. The representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements in this Agreement and in any certificate delivered  pursuant

agreements contained in this Agreement (including, without limitation,
_Article II_, _Article III_, _Section 7.04_, _Section 7.05_,  _Article X_ and
this _Article XI_) that by their terms are to be performed in whole or in

Post-Closing Covenants,  following the Effective Time, none of Parent, First
Merger Sub, Second Merger Sub, the Company or any holder of Company Stock or
Company Equity Awards (each, an " _Equityholder_ ")           shall
have any other rights or remedies in connection with any breach of this
Agreement or any other liability arising out of the negotiation, entry into or
consummation of the Transactions, whether at law or in equity or based on
contract, tort,  statute or otherwise. The provisions of and the limited
remedies provided in this _Section 11.01_ were specifically bargained for

the Merger Consideration. After the Closing, no party or its Affiliates may
seek the rescission of the Transactions.

Section 11.03 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by virtue of any rule of
Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions  of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other 
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually
acceptable manner in  order that the Transactions be consummated as
originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 


 

 

Section 11.04 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement (including the
exhibits and schedules hereto, including the Company Disclosure Letter), the
other Transaction Documents and the Confidentiality Agreement  constitute the
entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written
and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject

matter hereof and thereof. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties, in
whole or in part  (whether pursuant to a merger, by operation of Law or
otherwise), without the prior written consent of the other parties, except
that Parent, First Merger Sub and Second Merger Sub may assign all or any of
their rights and obligations under this  Agreement to any Affiliate of
Parent, _provided_ that no such assignment shall relieve the assigning party
of its obligations under this Agreement if such assignee does not  perform
such obligations.

 


 

 

Section 11.05 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon,
inure solely to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, only the parties
hereto, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is  intended to or
shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, except (i) as specifically
provided in _Section 7.05_,  _Section 7.18_, _Section 7.19_, _Section
9.05_,  _Section 11.05_, _Section 11.07_ and _Section 11.09_ (which is
intended to be for the benefit of the Persons expressly covered thereby and
may be enforced by such Persons) and (ii) that the Company shall have the
right to pursue damages on behalf of its  stockholders in the event of
Parent's, First Merger Sub's or Second Merger Sub's Intentional Breach of this
Agreement, which right is hereby acknowledged by Parent, First Merger Sub and
Second Merger Sub.

 


 

 

Section 11.06 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that the

breached. Accordingly, the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the performance of the terms of this Agreement, in addition to any other
remedy at law  or in equity. The parties further agree that no party to this
Agreement shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar
instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any such legal or
equitable relief and each party  waives any objection to the imposition of
such relief or any right it might have to require the obtaining, furnishing or
posting of any such bond or similar instrument.

 


 

 

Section 11.07 _Governing Law_. (a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without
giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provisions or  rule (whether
of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the
application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.
All Actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions
shall  be heard and determined exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of
Delaware (or in the event, but only in the event, that the Court of Chancery

submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State 
of Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of

or, if subject matter jurisdiction over the action or proceeding is vested
exclusively in the federal courts of the United States of America, the United
States District  Court for the District of Delaware and, in each case, the
appellate court(s) therefrom) for the purpose of any Action arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the Transactions brought by any party hereto,
(ii) irrevocably waive, and agree not  to assert by way of motion, defense or
otherwise, in any such Action, any claim that it is not subject personally to
the jurisdiction of the above‑named courts, that its property is exempt or
immune from attachment or execution, that the Action is  brought in an
inconvenient forum, that the venue of the Action is improper, or that this
Agreement or the Transactions may not be enforced in or by the above‑named
courts, and (iii) agree that such party will not bring any Action arising out
of or  relating to this Agreement or the Transactions in any court other than
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or in the event, but only in
the event, that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware does not have
subject matter  jurisdiction, the Superior Court of the State of Delaware
(Complex Commercial Division) or, if subject matter jurisdiction over the
action or proceeding is vested exclusively in the federal courts of the United
States of America, the United States  District Court for the District of
Delaware). Service of process, summons, notice or document to any party's
address and in the manner set forth in _Section 11.02_ shall be  effective

irrevocably agrees (i) that any Action (whether at law, in equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise) arising out of, or in any way relating to, the
Financing or the performance of services thereunder or related  thereto
against or by any Financing Source in its capacity as such shall be subject to
the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in the
Borough of Manhattan, New York, New York, and any appellate court therefrom,
and each  party hereto submits for itself and its property with respect to
any such Action to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts, (ii) not to
bring or permit any of its Affiliates to bring or support anyone else in
bringing any such Action in any  other court, (iii) to waive and hereby
waive, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection which any of them
may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such  Action in any such court,
(iv) that a final judgment in any such Action shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by Law and (v) that any such Action shall be governed by,  and
construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York (it being
expressly agreed that the Financing Sources in their capacities as such shall
be third party beneficiaries of this Section 11.07 and shall be entitled to
enforce the  provisions contained in this Section 11.07 as if they were a
party to this Agreement).

 


 

 

Section 11.08 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile transmission or .pdf) in counterparts, and by the
different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which  when
executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together
shall constitute one and the same agreement.

 


 

 

SECTION 11.09 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY HERETO AND EACH AFFILIATE OF
PARENT ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT  ISSUES, AND
THEREFORE, EACH OF THE

 


 

 


 

 

 

110  


 

 


 

 

PARTIES HERETO AND EACH AFFILIATE OF PARENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY
RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL  BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY
OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
(INCLUDING THE COMMITMENT LETTER AND ANY FINANCING CONTEMPLATED BY PARENT OR
ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES IN CONNECTION WITH THIS  AGREEMENT). EACH OF THE
PARTIES HERETO CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH
OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE  THE
FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) EACH SUCH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) EACH SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) EACH SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS  BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS IN

acknowledges that Latham and Watkins LLP and other legal counsel (" _Prior 
Company Counsel_ ") have, on or prior to the Closing Date, represented one or
more of the Selling Investors, Equityholders, the Company, and its
Subsidiaries and other Affiliates, and their respective officers, employees
and directors  (each such Person, other than the Company and its Subsidiaries
and their respective officers and employees, a " _Designated Person_ ") in one
or more matters relating to this  Agreement or any other agreements or
transactions contemplated hereby (including any matter that may be related to
a litigation, claim or dispute arising under or related to this Agreement or
such other agreements or in connection with such  transactions) (excluding,
for the avoidance of doubt, the Company's planned initial public offering)
(each, an " _Existing Representation_ "). Each of Parent and the Company (on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates) waives and shall not assert, and agrees
after the Closing to cause its Affiliates to waive and to not assert, any 
attorney-client privilege, attorney work-product protection or expectation of
client confidence with respect to any communication between any Prior Company
Counsel, on the one hand, and any Designated Person or the Company or any of
its  Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Pre-Closing Designated Persons_ "), 
or any advice given to any Pre-Closing Designated Person by any Prior Company
Counsel, occurring during one or more Existing Representations in connection
with any representation by one or more Prior Company Counsel of one or more
Designated  Persons, in each case, in connection with one or more post-
Closing matters relating to this Agreement or any other agreements or
transactions contemplated hereby (including any matter that may be related to
a litigation, claim or dispute arising  under or related to this Agreement or
such other agreements or in connection with such transactions) (collectively,
" _Pre-Closing Privileges_ "), it being the intention of the parties hereto
that all rights to such Pre-Closing Privileges, and all rights to waiver or
otherwise control such Pre-Closing Privilege,  shall be retained by such
Designated Persons and shall not pass to or be claimed or used by Parent or
the Company, except as provided in the last sentence of this _Section 11.10_.
Furthermore, each of Parent and the  Company (on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates) acknowledges and agrees that any advice given to or communication
with any of the Designated Persons in connection with any Existing

 


 

 


 

 

 

111  


 

 


 

 

Representation shall not be subject to any joint privilege (whether or not the
Company or one more of its Subsidiaries also received such advice or
communication) and shall  be owned solely by such Designated Persons.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) in the event that a dispute arises between
Parent or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and a third
party other than a Designated Person, on the  other hand, the Company may
assert the Pre-Closing Privileges on behalf of the Designated Persons to
prevent disclosure to such third party, _provided_ , _however_ , that such
privilege may be waived only with the prior written consent of the Designated
Persons, acting on behalf of the applicable Designated Persons (such consent
not  to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and (ii) the
foregoing provisions of this _Section 11.10_ shall not extend to any
communication or materials not  involving the negotiation, documentation and
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any claims
brought in connection with such transactions or this Agreement.

 


 

 

Section 11.11 _Release by Equityholders_. (a) Effective as of the Effective
Time, upon execution of a Letter of Transmittal, each Equityholder, on behalf

absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably release, acquit and forever
discharge the Company and each of its  respective past, present and future
controlled Affiliates, parent(s) and subsidiary companies, joint ventures,

firms, corporations, limited liability companies, partnerships, trusts,
associations, organizations, stockholders, members, managers, directors,
officers, employees, partners, trustees, principals, consultants, contractors,

and assigns (collectively the " _Released Parties_ "), of and from any and all
manner of action or  inaction, cause or causes of action, Actions,
Encumbrances, contractual obligations, promises, liabilities or damages
(whether for compensatory, special, incidental or punitive damages, equitable
relief or otherwise) of any kind or nature  whatsoever, past, present or
future, at law, in equity or otherwise (including with respect to conduct
which is negligent, grossly negligent, willful, intentional, with or without
malice, or a breach of any duty, applicable Law or rule), whether  known or
unknown, whether fixed or contingent, whether concealed or hidden, whether
disclosed or undisclosed, whether liquidated or unliquidated, whether
foreseeable or unforeseeable, whether anticipated or unanticipated, whether
suspected or  unsuspected (" _Claims_ "), which such Equityholder Releasing
Parties, or any of them, ever have had or ever in the future may have against
the Released Parties, or any of  them, in each case, to the extent arising
solely as a result of the ownership or purported ownership of any of Company
Stock, Company Stock Options or other security or interest of the Company and
which, in each case, are based on acts, events or  omissions occurring prior
to or contemporaneously with the Effective Time (the " _Equityholder Released
Claims_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing release shall not
release, impair or diminish, and the term "Equityholder __ Released Claims"
shall not include, in any respect (i) an _Equityholder 's_ right pursuant to
the Transaction Documents,  including the right to receive its respective
portion of the Merger Consideration; (ii) any Claims for indemnification,
insurance benefits, reimbursement or advancement of expenses in such
_Equityholder 's_ capacity as a director, officer or employee of the Company
under the Company's

organizational documents or any indemnification agreement in effect as of the
date hereof (or any fiduciary insurance policy maintained by the Company or
the Surviving  Entity for the benefit of the _Equityholder_ , or any
indemnification agreements with the _Equityholder_   or its board designee)
with respect to any act, omission, event or transaction occurring prior to or
contemporaneously with the Effective Time; or (iii) the rights of any
_Equityholder_   Releasing Party in his or her capacity as an employee of the
Company.

 


 

 

(b) Upon execution of a Letter of  Transmittal, each _Equityholder_ shall
represent and acknowledge that he, she or it has read this release and the
Merger Agreement and other Transaction Documents and  understands their terms
and has been given sufficient opportunity to review this release and the
Transaction Documents and to ask questions of the Company's Representatives.
Each _Equityholder_   will further represent that, in signing the Letter of
Transmittal, he, she or it does not rely, and has not relied, on any
representation or statement made by any Representative of the Company or any
other Person with respect to the subject matter,  basis or effect of this
release or otherwise, except such express representations and warranties set
forth in the Merger Agreement or this Agreement.

 


 

 

(c) Without limiting the  generality of _Section 11.11(a)_ , with respect to
the Equityholder Released Claims, each _Equityholder_ ,  upon execution of a
Letter of Transmittal, will acknowledge that he, she or it is familiar with
Section 1542 of the Civil Code of the State of California (" _Section
1542_")  and expressly waive all rights under Section 1542 and any similar
applicable Law or common law principle in any applicable jurisdiction
prohibiting or restricting the waiver of unknown claims. Section 1542 reads as
follows:

 


 

 

"A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS THAT THE CREDITOR OR RELEASING
PARTY DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER  FAVOR AT THE TIME OF
EXECUTING THE RELEASE AND THAT, IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER, WOULD HAVE MATERIALLY
AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR OR RELEASED PARTY."

 


 

 

(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1542 or any similar applicable
Law or common law principle in any applicable jurisdiction, upon execution of
a Letter of Transmittal, each _Equityholder_ will expressly acknowledge that
the foregoing release is intended to include in its effect all claims within
the scope of such release which any _Equityholder_ does not know or suspect to
exist in his, her or its favor against any of the Released Parties (including,
without limitation, unknown and contingent claims), and  that the foregoing
release expressly contemplates the extinguishment of all such claims (except
to the extent expressly set forth in this _Section 11.11_ ).

in good faith by Parent and the Holder Representative. Non-cash consideration
consisting of publicly traded securities shall be valued as set forth in the
definitive  agreement for the transaction or, if not so specified, at the
average of their closing prices for the five trading days immediately prior to

a Covered Product and Service for any purpose under this CVR Agreement for so
long as it is not a Bundled Product or Service and does not and would not
generate Covered Revenues on a standalone basis.

 


 

 

" _Covered Revenues_ " means, for any Covered Revenues Measuring Period  or
any Threshold Measuring Period (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the
First Threshold Measuring Period and the Final Threshold Measuring Period),

Parent directly or indirectly, by a sale or swap of assets or other  rights,
merger, reorganization, joint venture, lease, license or any other transaction
or arrangement, sells, transfers, conveys, licenses or otherwise disposes of
their respective rights in and to the business of Parent and its Subsidiaries
that  would generate Covered Revenues after the Closing Date and prior to the
Commencement Date, the Consideration received in connection with such sale or
swap of assets or other rights, merger, reorganization, joint venture, lease,

of Parent and its Subsidiaries that would generate Covered Revenues shall be
included in Covered Revenues in the First Threshold Measuring Period.

during the Covered Revenues Term; _provided_ that (a) if the Commencement Date
does not fall on the first day of Parent's fiscal quarter, the first Covered 
Revenues Measuring Period shall commence on the Commencement Date and end on

falls and (b) the final Covered Revenues Measuring Period shall end on the End
Date.

 


 

 

" _Covered Revenues Payment_ " means, subject to any reductions pursuant  to

recognized in such Covered Revenues Measuring Period _plus_ (ii) for any
Covered Revenues recognized in the  applicable Threshold Measuring Period in
excess of an amount equal

 


 

 


 

 

 

4  


 

 


 

 

to $2,737,850.79 _multiplied_ _by_ the number of days in such Threshold
Measuring Period, 9.0% of such Covered Revenues recognized in such Covered
Revenues Measuring Period, in the case of each of (x) and (y), _multiplied_
_by_ (II) a fraction, the numerator of which is the aggregate number of CVRs
Outstanding as of the applicable Covered  Revenues Payment Date, and the
denominator of which is the Total Equity Count; _provided_ that in no event
will any Covered Revenues Payment become payable on account of  Covered
Revenues recognized in the period after the End Date; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that if  Parent or any of its Subsidiaries enters into an agreement
(including any license, settlement, covenant not to sue or other similar
agreement and including any agreement with collaboration, licensing, asset
sale, intellectual property enforcement  or other similar terms) that
requires payment to a third party for any significant know how, trade secrets,
patents or other Intellectual Property after the Closing Date that is utilized
to generate any Covered Revenue (" _Specified Covered Revenue_ "), 9.0% of the
amounts payable under such agreement shall be deducted from the Covered
Revenues Payments payable in respect of Specified Covered Revenue under 
clauses (x)(ii) and (y)(ii) above, provided that the total amount deducted
shall not exceed 1.0% of all Covered Revenues for which Covered Revenues
Payments are payable under clauses (x)(ii) and (y)(ii) above (i.e., in no
event will a Covered  Revenues Payment with respect to a Covered Revenues

applicable period and (y) an itemized calculation of Net Sales  for such
Covered Products and Services showing deductions for such Covered Revenues
Measuring Period provided for in accordance with the definition of Net Sales

(d) Where any Person  is required to make, give or execute two or more
applications, requests, consents, certificates, statements, opinions or other
instruments under this CVR Agreement, they may, but need not, be consolidated
and form one instrument.

 


 

 

Section 1.4. _Acts of Holders_.

 


 

 

(a) Any request,  demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver
or other action provided by this CVR Agreement to be given or taken by Holders
may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially
similar tenor signed by such  Holders in person or by an agent duly appointed
in writing; and, except as herein otherwise expressly provided, such action
shall become effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered to
the Trustee and, where it is hereby  expressly required, to Parent. Such
instrument or instruments (and the action embodied therein and evidenced
thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "Act" of the Holders signing
such instrument or instruments. Proof of execution of any  such instrument or
of a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of
this CVR Agreement and (subject to Section 3.1) conclusive in favor of the
Trustee and Parent, if made in the manner provided in this Section 1.4. 
Parent may set a record date for purposes of determining the identity of
Holders entitled to vote or consent to any action by vote or consent
authorized or permitted under this CVR Agreement. If not previously set by
Parent, (i) the record  date for determining the Holders entitled to vote at
a meeting of the Holders shall be the date preceding the date notice of such
meeting is mailed to the Holders, or if notice is not given, on the day next
preceding the day such meeting is  held, and (ii) the record date for
determining the Holders entitled to consent to any action in writing without a
meeting shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting
forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is  delivered to Parent. If a
record date is fixed, those Persons who were Holders of CVRs at such record
date (or their duly designated proxies), and only those Persons, shall be
entitled to take such action by vote or consent or, except with  respect to
clause (d) below, to revoke any vote or consent previously given, whether or
not such Persons continue to be Holders after such record date. No such vote
or consent shall be valid or effective for more than 120 days after such
record  date.

 


 

 

(b) The fact and date  of the execution by any Person of any such instrument
or writing may be proved in any reasonable manner which the Trustee deems
sufficient.

 


 

 

(c) The ownership of  CVRs shall be proved by the CVR Register. Neither
Parent nor the Trustee nor any agent of Parent or the Trustee shall be
affected by any notice to the contrary.

 


 

 

(d) At any time prior  to (but not after) the evidencing to the Trustee, as
provided in this Section 1.4, of the taking of any action by the Holders of
the CVRs specified in this CVR Agreement in connection with such action, any
Holder of a CVR the serial number of  which is shown by the evidence to be
included among the serial numbers of the CVRs the Holders of which have
consented to such action may, by filing written notice at the Corporate Trust
Office and upon proof of holding as provided in this  Section 1.4, revoke
such action so far as concerns such CVR. Any request, demand, authorization,
direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action by the Holder of any CVR
shall bind every future Holder of the same CVR or the Holder of every  CVR
issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in
lieu thereof, in respect of anything done, suffered or omitted to be done by
the Trustee, any Paying Agent or Parent in reliance thereon, whether or not
notation  of such action is made upon such CVR.

 


 

 

(e) The Holders,  including any permitted transferee (in each case by their
acceptance of the CVRs hereby), shall be deemed to have acknowledged the
rights and privileges of the Holder Representative set forth in this CVR
Agreement.

Section 1.5. _Notices, etc., to Trustee and Parent_. Any request, demand,
authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or Act of Holders or other
document provided or permitted by  this CVR Agreement to be made upon, given
or furnished to, or filed with:

 


 

 

(a) the Trustee by  any Holder or by Parent shall be sufficient for every
purpose hereunder if made, given, furnished or filed, in writing, to or with
the Trustee at its Corporate Trust Office; or

 


 

 

(b) Parent by the  Trustee or by any Holder shall be sufficient for every
purpose hereunder if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to
Parent addressed to it at 5200 Illumina Way, San Diego, California 92122, or
at any other address previously  furnished in writing to the Trustee by
Parent.

 


 

 

Section 1.6. _Notice to Holders ; Waiver_.

 


 

 

(a) Where this CVR  Agreement provides for notice to Holders of any event,
such notice shall be sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein expressly
provided) if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each
Holder affected by such event, at the  Holder's address as it appears in the
CVR Register, not later than the latest date, and not earlier than the
earliest date, prescribed for the giving of such notice. In any case where
notice to Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to  mail such notice,
nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder shall affect
the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders. Where this CVR
Agreement provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived  in
writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after
the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of
notice by Holders shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not
be a  condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance
upon such waiver.

 


 

 

(b) In case by reason  of the suspension of regular mail service or by reason
of any other cause, it shall be impracticable to mail notice of any event as
required by any provision of this CVR Agreement, then any method of giving
such notice as shall be satisfactory  to the Trustee shall be deemed to be a
sufficient giving of such notice.

 


 

 

Section 1.7. _Conflict with Trust Indenture Act_. If any provision hereof
limits, qualifies or conflicts with another provision hereof which is required
to be included in this CVR  Agreement by any of the provisions of the Trust
Indenture Act, such required provision shall control.

 


 

 

Section 1.8. _Effect of Headings and Table of Contents_. The Article and
Section headings herein and the Table of Contents are for convenience only and
shall not affect the construction  hereof.

 


 

 

Section 1.9. _Benefits of Agreemen_ t. Nothing in this CVR Agreement or in the
CVRs, express or implied, shall give to any Person (other than the Parties
hereto and their successors and  permitted assigns and, solely in accordance
with the express terms of this CVR Agreement and subject to Sections 1.4,
1.13, 2.2 and 7.6, the Holders) any benefit or any legal or equitable right,
remedy or claim under this CVR Agreement or under  any covenant or provision
herein contained.

 


 

 

Section 1.10. _Governing Law_.2 This CVR Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance  with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without
giving effect to any choice or conflict of Law provisions or rule (whether of
the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the
application of the Laws of any jurisdiction  other than the State of
Delaware. All litigation, suits, actions or proceedings (collectively, "
_Actions_ ") arising out of or relating to this CVR Agreement shall be  heard
and

determined exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and
any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or if the
Court of  Chancery of the State of Delaware does not have subject matter
jurisdiction, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware and the
appellate court(s) therefrom). Each of Parent, the Trustee, the Holder
Representative and each of the  Holders by their acceptance of the CVRs
hereby (a) irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom
within the State of Delaware (or if the Court of  Chancery of the State of
Delaware does not have subject matter jurisdiction, any state or federal court
within the State of Delaware and the appellate court(s) therefrom) for the
purpose of any Action arising out of or relating to this CVR  Agreement
brought by any party hereto, (b) irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert
by way of motion, defense or otherwise, in any such Action, any claim that it
is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above named courts,
that  its property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that the
Action is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the Action is
improper, or that this CVR Agreement may not be enforced in or by the above
named courts, and (c)  agrees that such party will not bring any Action
arising out of or relating to this CVR Agreement in any court other than the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or if the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware does not have subject  matter jurisdiction, any state or
federal court within the State of Delaware and the appellate court(s)
therefrom).

 


 

 

Section 1.11. _Legal Holidays_. In the event that a Payment Date shall not be
a Business Day, then (notwithstanding any provision of this CVR Agreement or
the CVRs to the contrary)  payment on the CVRs need not be made on such date,
but may be made, without the accrual of any interest thereon, on the next
succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on such
Payment Date.

 


 

 

Section 1.12. _Separability Clause_. In the event any provision in this CVR
Agreement or in the CVRs shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the
validity, legality and enforceability  of the remaining provisions shall not
in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

 


 

 

Section 1.13. _No Recourse Against Others_. No current or former director,
officer or employee, as such, of Parent or the Trustee or of their respective
Affiliates shall have any  liability for any obligations of Parent or the
Trustee under the CVRs or this CVR Agreement or for any claim based on, in
respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation. By accepting a
CVR, each Holder waives and releases all  such liability. The waiver and
release are part of the consideration for the issue of the CVRs.

 


 

 

Section 1.14. _Counterparts_. This CVR Agreement shall be signed in any number
of counterparts with the same effect as if the signatures to each counterpart
were upon a single  instrument, and all such counterparts together shall be
deemed an original of this CVR Agreement.

 


 

 

Section 1.15. _Acceptance of Trust_. [●], the Trustee named herein, hereby
accepts the trusts in this CVR Agreement declared and provided, upon the terms
and conditions set forth herein.

 


 

 

Section 1.16. _Termination_. This CVR Agreement shall automatically terminate
and be of no further force or effect and shall be deemed satisfied and
discharged, and the Parties hereto  shall have no liability hereunder (other
than with respect to monies due and owing by Parent to the Trustee) (i) on the
expiration of the final Review Request Period following the End Date or (ii)
in the event that all of the CVR Certificates  not previously cancelled shall
have become due and payable pursuant to the terms hereof, in each case,
provided that all disputes with respect to amounts payable to the Holders
brought pursuant to the terms and conditions of this CVR Agreement  have been
resolved, and Parent has paid or caused to be paid or deposited with the
Trustee all amounts payable to the Holders under this CVR Agreement (including
any amounts determined in accordance with Section 6.5). Notwithstanding the 
satisfaction and discharge of this CVR Agreement, the obligations of Parent
under Section 3.6(c) shall survive. For the avoidance of doubt,

in no event will any Covered Revenues Payment become payable on account of
Covered Revenues recognized after the End Date.

herein by this reference, with such appropriate insertions, omissions,
substitutions and other variations as are  required or permitted by this CVR
Agreement and may have such letters, numbers or other marks of identification
and such legends or endorsements placed thereon as may be required to comply
with the rules of any securities exchange or as may be  required by Law or
any rule or regulation pursuant thereto, all as may be determined by the
officers executing such CVRs, as evidenced by their execution of the CVRs. Any
portion of the text of any CVR may be set forth on the reverse thereof,  with
an appropriate reference thereto on the face of the CVR.

 


 

 

(b) The definitive  CVRs shall be typewritten, printed, lithographed or
engraved on steel engraved borders or produced by any combination of these
methods or may be produced in any other manner permitted by the rules of any
securities exchange on which the CVRs  may be listed, all as determined by
the officers executing such CVRs, as evidenced by their execution of such
CVRs.

 


 

 

Section 2.2. _Title and Terms_.

 


 

 

(a) The CVRs  represent the rights of Holders to receive contingent cash
payments pursuant to this CVR Agreement. The aggregate number of CVRs in
respect of which CVR Certificates may be authenticated and delivered under
this CVR Agreement is limited to a  number equal to [●]3. The initial Holders
shall be determined pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement and this CVR
Agreement, and a list of the initial  Holders shall be furnished to the
Trustee by or on behalf of Parent in accordance with Section 4.1. From and
after the Effective Time, no CVRs shall be issued except as provided in, and
in accordance with the terms and conditions of, the  Merger Agreement or as
otherwise expressly permitted by this CVR Agreement.

 


 

 

(b) The CVRs shall be  known and designated as the "Contingent Value Rights"
of Parent.

 


 

 

(c) The CVRs may not  be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, encumbered or
in any other manner transferred or disposed of, in whole or in part, other
than through a Permitted Transfer in compliance with applicable United States
federal and state securities Laws.

 


 

 

(d) On or prior to  each Covered Revenues Payment Date, Parent shall pay to
the Trustee, by wire transfer to the account designated by the Trustee, the
Covered Revenues Payment due, if any, in respect of the Covered Revenues
Measuring Period ended immediately  preceding such Covered Revenues Payment

Business Days, the Trustee shall pay each Holder a Pro Rata Portion of such
Covered Revenues Payment; _provided_ that Parent may retain any Covered
Revenues Payment due to Parent or any of its Affiliates with respect to any
CVRs owned by Parent or such Affiliates. The final such Covered  Revenues
Measuring Period shall end on the End Date.

(e) The Holders of  the CVRs, by acceptance thereof, agree that no joint
venture, partnership or other fiduciary relationship is created hereby or by
the CVRs.

 


 

 

(f) Other than in the  case of interest on amounts due and payable after the
occurrence of an Event of Default or with respect to any CVR Shortfall, no
interest shall accrue on any amounts payable in respect of the CVRs.

 


 

 

(g) The rights of the  Holders of CVRs are limited to those contractual
rights expressed in this CVR Agreement and the CVR Certificate. A Holder of
any CVR or CVR Certificate is not, and shall not, by virtue thereof, be,
entitled to any rights of a holder of any  other equity security or other
ownership interest of Parent or in any constituent company to the Mergers or
any of their respective Affiliates, either at Law or in equity. The CVRs shall
not have any voting or dividend rights.

 


 

 

(h) Except as  provided in this CVR Agreement (including Section 6.5), none
of Parent or any of its Affiliates shall have any right to set-off any amounts
owed or claimed to be owed by any Holder to any of them against such Holder's
CVRs or any Covered  Revenues Payment or other amount payable to such Holder
in respect of such CVRs.

 


 

 

Section 2.3. _Registrable Form_. The CVRs shall be issuable only in registered
form.

 


 

 

Section 2.4. _Execution, Authentication, Delivery and Dating_.

 


 

 

(a) The CVRs shall be  executed on behalf of Parent by its chairman of the
Board of Directors or its president or any vice president or its treasurer,
but need not be attested. The signature of any of these officers on the CVRs
may be manual or facsimile.

 


 

 

(b) CVRs bearing the  manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were,
at the time of execution, the proper officers of Parent shall bind Parent,
notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such
offices prior to the authentication  and delivery of such CVRs or did not
hold such offices at the date of such CVRs.

 


 

 

(c) At any time and  from time to time after the execution and delivery of
this CVR Agreement, Parent may deliver CVRs executed by Parent to the Trustee
for authentication, together with a Parent Order for the authentication and
delivery of such CVRs; and the  Trustee, in accordance with such Parent
Order, shall authenticate and deliver such CVRs as provided in this CVR
Agreement and not otherwise.

 


 

 

(d) Each CVR shall be  dated the date of its authentication.

 


 

 

(e) No CVR shall be  entitled to any benefit under this CVR Agreement or be
valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such CVR a
certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein
duly executed by the Trustee, by manual or  facsimile signature of an
authorized officer, and such certificate upon any CVR shall be conclusive
evidence, and the only evidence, that such CVR has been duly authenticated and
delivered hereunder and that the Holder is entitled to the  benefits of this
CVR Agreement.

 


 

 

Section 2.5. _Temporary CVRs_.

 


 

 

(a) Pending the  preparation of definitive CVRs, Parent may execute, and upon
Parent Order, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary CVRs which
are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise produced,
substantially of the tenor  of the definitive CVRs in lieu of which they are
issued and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and
other variations as the

 


 

 


 

 

 

19  


 

 


 

 

officers executing such CVRs may determine with the concurrence of the
Trustee. Temporary CVRs may contain such reference to any provisions of this
CVR Agreement as  may be appropriate. Every temporary CVR shall be executed
by Parent and be authenticated by the Trustee upon the same conditions and in
substantially the same manner, and with like effect, as the definitive CVRs.

 


 

 

(b) If temporary CVRs  are issued, Parent will cause definitive CVRs to be
prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive CVRs,
the temporary CVRs shall be exchangeable for definitive CVRs upon surrender of
the temporary CVRs at the office  or agency of Parent designated for such
purpose pursuant to Section 6.2, without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender
for cancellation of any one or more temporary CVRs, Parent shall execute and
the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in  exchange therefor a like
amount of definitive CVRs. Until so exchanged, the temporary CVRs shall in all
respects be entitled to the same benefits under this CVR Agreement as
definitive CVRs.

 


 

 

Section 2.6. _Registration, Registration of Transfer and Exchange_.

 


 

 

(a) Parent shall  cause to be kept at the office of the Trustee a register
(the " _CVR Register_ ") in which, subject to reasonable regulations as it may
prescribe, Parent shall provide for  the registration of the CVRs and any
Permitted Transfers of CVRs. The Trustee is hereby initially appointed "CVR
Registrar" for the purpose of registering the CVRs and any Permitted Transfers
of CVRs as herein provided.

 


 

 

(b) Subject to the  restrictions on transferability set forth in Section
2.2(c), every request made to transfer a CVR must be in writing and
accompanied by a written instrument of transfer and other requested
documentation in form reasonably satisfactory to the  Trustee and Parent,
duly executed by the Holder thereof, setting forth in reasonable detail the
circumstances relating to the transfer. Upon receipt of such written notice
and surrender for registration of transfer of the CVR Certificates, the 
Trustee shall, subject to its reasonable determination that the transfer
instrument is in proper form, notify Parent that it has received such written
notice. Upon receipt of such notice from the Trustee, Parent shall determine,
in good faith,  whether the transfer otherwise complies with the other terms
and conditions of this CVR Agreement (including the provisions of Section
2.2(c)), and if it determines that it does so comply, Parent shall instruct
the Trustee in writing to, and  the Trustee shall, upon surrender for
registration of transfer of such CVR Certificate at the Corporate Trust
Office, authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or
transferees, one or more new CVR Certificates  representing the same
aggregate number of CVRs represented by the CVR Certificate so surrendered
that are to be transferred and Parent shall execute and the Trustee shall
authenticate and deliver, in the name of the transferor, one CVR  Certificate
representing the aggregate number of CVRs represented by such CVR Certificate
that are not to be transferred. If Parent determines in good faith that the
proposed transfer does not comply with the other terms and conditions of
this  CVR Agreement (including the provisions of Section 2.2(c)), Parent
shall provide the Trustee with written notice of such determination, which
notice shall include, in reasonable detail, the rationale for such
determination, including which  provisions of this CVR Agreement the proposed
transfer does not comply.

 


 

 

(c) At the option of  the Holder, CVR Certificates may be exchanged for other
CVR Certificates that represent in the aggregate the same number of CVRs as
the CVR Certificates surrendered at the Corporate Trust Office. Every CVR
presented or surrendered for exchange  shall (if so required by Parent or the
Trustee) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of
exchange in form satisfactory to Parent and the Trustee. Whenever any CVR
Certificates are so surrendered for exchange, Parent shall  execute, and the
Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the CVR Certificates which the Holder
making the exchange is entitled to receive.

 


 

 

(d) Parent and the  Trustee may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover
any stamp or other Tax or governmental charge that is imposed in connection
with any such registration of transfer or

 


 

 


 

 

 

20  


 

 


 

 

exchange, other than pursuant to Sections 2.7 and 5.6, not involving a
transfer. The Trustee shall have no duty or obligation to take any action
under any section  of this CVR Agreement that requires the payment of
applicable Taxes or governmental charges unless and until the Trustee is
satisfied that all such Taxes or governmental charges have been paid or
otherwise not due and owing.

 


 

 

(e) All CVRs issued  upon any registration of transfer or exchange of CVRs as
provided for herein shall be the valid obligations of Parent, evidencing the
same rights, and entitled to the same benefits under this CVR Agreement, as
the CVRs surrendered upon such  registration of transfer or exchange.

 


 

 

(f) A Holder may make  a written request to the Trustee to change such
Holder's address of record in the CVR Register. The written request must be
duly executed by the Holder. Upon receipt of such written request, the Trustee
is hereby authorized to record the  change of address in the CVR Register.

 


 

 

Section 2.7. _Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen CVRs_.

 


 

 

(a) If (i) any  mutilated CVR is surrendered to the Trustee, or (ii) Parent
and the Trustee receive evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction,
loss or theft of any CVR, and there is delivered to Parent and the Trustee
such security or indemnity as may  be required by them to save each of them
harmless, then, in the absence of notice to Parent or the Trustee that such
CVR has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, Parent shall execute and, upon
delivery of a Parent Order, the Trustee shall  authenticate and deliver, in
exchange for any such mutilated CVR or in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or
stolen CVR, a new CVR Certificate of like tenor and amount of CVRs, bearing a
number not contemporaneously Outstanding.

 


 

 

(b) In case any such  mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen CVR has become or
is to become finally due and payable within 15 days, Parent in its discretion
may, instead of issuing a new CVR Certificate, pay to the Holder of such CVR
on the applicable Payment Date, as  the case may be, all amounts due and
payable with respect thereto.

 


 

 

(c) Every new CVR  issued pursuant to this Section 2.7 in lieu of any
destroyed, lost or stolen CVR shall constitute an original additional
contractual obligation of Parent, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen
CVR shall be at any time enforceable by  anyone, and shall be entitled to all
benefits of this CVR Agreement equally and proportionately with any and all
other CVRs duly issued hereunder.

 


 

 

(d) The provisions of  this Section 2.7 are exclusive and shall preclude (to
the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the
replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen CVRs

 


 

 

Section 2.8. _Payments with Respect to CVRs_. Payment of any amounts with
respect to the CVRs shall be made in such coin or currency of the United
States of America as at the time is  legal tender for the payment of public
and private debts. Parent may, at its option, pay such amounts by wire
transfer or check payable in such money.

 


 

 

Section 2.9. _Persons Deemed Owners_. Prior to the time of due presentment for
registration of transfer, Parent, the Trustee and any agent of Parent or the
Trustee may treat the Person  in whose name any CVR is registered as the
owner of such CVR for the purpose of receiving payment on such CVR and for all
other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such CVR be overdue, and neither
Parent, the Trustee nor any agent of Parent or  the Trustee shall be affected
by notice to the contrary.

 


 

 

Section 2.10. _Cancellation_. All CVRs surrendered for payment, registration
of transfer or exchange shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the
Trustee, be delivered to the  Trustee and shall be promptly canceled by it.
Parent may at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any CVRs
previously

 


 

 


 

 

 

21  


 

 


 

 

authenticated and delivered hereunder which Parent may have acquired in any
manner whatsoever, and all CVRs so delivered shall be promptly canceled by the
Trustee.  No CVRs shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any
CVRs canceled as provided in this Section 2.10, except as expressly permitted
by this CVR Agreement. All cancelled CVRs held by the Trustee shall be
destroyed and a certificate of  destruction shall be issued by the Trustee to
Parent, unless otherwise directed by a Parent Order.

 


 

 

Section 2.11. _Ability to Abandon CVR; Certain Acquisitions_. A Holder may at
any time, at such Holder's option, abandon all of such Holder's remaining
rights in a CVR by transferring  such CVR to Parent or any of its Affiliates
without consideration therefor. Nothing in this CVR Agreement shall prohibit
Parent or any of its Affiliates from offering to acquire or acquiring any CVRs
from the Holders, in private transactions or  otherwise, in its sole
discretion.

 


 

 

Section 2.12. _CUSIP Numbers_. Parent in issuing the CVRs may use "CUSIP"
numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall use "CUSIP"
numbers in any Call Notice as a  convenience to Holders; _provided_ that any
such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of
such numbers either as printed on the CVRs or  as contained in any Call
Notice and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification
numbers printed on the CVRs, and such Call Notice shall not be affected by any
defect in or omission of such numbers. Parent shall promptly notify  the
Trustee in writing of any change in the "CUSIP" numbers.

THE TRUSTEE

 


 

 

Section 3.1. _Certain Duties and Responsibilities_.

 


 

 

(a) With respect to  the Holders, the Trustee, prior to the occurrence of an
Event of Default with respect to the CVRs and after the curing or waiving of
all Events of Default which may have occurred, undertakes to perform such
duties and only such duties as are  specifically set forth in this CVR
Agreement and no implied covenants shall be read into this CVR Agreement
against the Trustee. In the event that an Event of Default with respect to the
CVRs has occurred (which has not been cured or waived),  the Trustee shall
exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this CVR Agreement, and
use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent person
would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his or  her
own affairs.

 


 

 

(b) In the absence of  bad faith or willful misconduct on its part, prior to
the occurrence of an Event of Default and after the curing or waiving of all
such Events of Default which may have occurred, the Trustee may conclusively
rely, as to the truth of the  statements and the correctness of the opinions
expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee
which conform to the requirements of this CVR Agreement; but in the case of
any such certificates or opinions which by any  provision hereof are
specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee shall be
under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they conform to
the requirements of this CVR Agreement.

 


 

 

(c) No provision of  this CVR Agreement shall be construed to relieve the
Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure
to act, or its own bad faith or willful misconduct, except that (i) this
subsection (c) shall not be construed  to limit the effect of subsections (a)
and (b) of this Section 3.1; (ii) the Trustee shall not be liable for any
error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer, unless it shall

the books, records and premises of Parent, personally or by agent or attorney,
as reasonably necessary for such inquiry or investigation;

 


 

 

(g) the Trustee may  execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or perform

to the CVRs, the Trustee shall give the Holders notice of any such default
actually known to it as and to  the extent applicable and provided by the

reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to Law or to the requirements
of a supervising or examining authority, then for  the purposes of this
Section 3.8, the combined capital and surplus of such corporation shall be
deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent
report of condition so published. If at any time the Trustee shall  cease to
be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3.8, it shall

Trustee may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment
of a successor Trustee.

 


 

 

(c) The Trustee may  be removed at any time by an act of the Majority
Holders, delivered to the Trustee and to Parent.

 


 

 

(d) If at any time:

 


 

 

(1) the Trustee shall fail to comply with Section 3.7 after written request
therefor by Parent or by any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a CVR
for at least six months, or

 


 

 

(2) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible under Section 3.8 and shall fail to
resign after written request therefor by Parent or by any such Holder, or

 


 

 

(3) the Trustee shall become incapable of acting or shall be adjudged a
bankrupt or insolvent, or a receiver of the Trustee or of its property shall
be appointed, or any public officer shall take charge or control of the
Trustee or of its  property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation,
conservation or liquidation, then, in any case, (i) Parent, by a Board
Resolution, may remove the Trustee, or (ii) the Holder of any CVR who has been
a bona fide Holder of a CVR for at  least six months may, on behalf of
himself or herself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of
competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a
successor Trustee.

 


 

 


 

 

 

25  


 

 


 

 

(e) If the Trustee  shall resign, be removed or become incapable of acting,
or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of Trustee for any cause, Parent, by
a Board Resolution, shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee. If, within one
year after any removal by  Holders of a majority of the Outstanding CVRs, a
successor Trustee shall be appointed by act of the Majority Holders, as
applicable, delivered to Parent and the retiring Trustee, the successor
Trustee so appointed shall, forthwith upon its  acceptance of such
appointment in accordance with Section 3.10, become the successor Trustee and
supersede the successor Trustee appointed by Parent. If no successor Trustee
shall have been so appointed by Parent or the Holders and accepted 
appointment within 60 days after the retiring Trustee tenders its resignation
or is removed, the retiring Trustee may, or any Holder who has been a bona
fide Holder for at least six months may on behalf of himself and all others
similarly  situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the
appointment of a successor Trustee.

 


 

 

(f) Parent shall give  notice of each resignation and each removal of the
Trustee and each appointment of a successor Trustee by mailing written notice
of such event by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the Holders of CVRs as
their names and addresses appear in  the CVR Register. Each notice shall
include the name of the successor Trustee and the address of its Corporate
Trust Office. If Parent fails to send such notice within 10 days after
acceptance of appointment by a successor Trustee, it shall not  be a default
hereunder, but the successor Trustee shall cause the notice to be mailed at
the expense of Parent.

 


 

 

Section 3.10. _Acceptance of Appointment of Successor_.

 


 

 

(a) Every successor  Trustee appointed hereunder shall execute, acknowledge
and deliver to Parent and to the retiring Trustee an instrument accepting such
appointment, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee
shall become effective and such  successor Trustee, without any further act,
deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts
and duties of the retiring Trustee; but, upon request of Parent or the
successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall, upon  payment of its charges,
execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor Trustee all
the rights, powers and trusts of the retiring Trustee, and shall duly assign,
transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and  money held
by such retiring Trustee hereunder. Upon request of any such successor
Trustee, Parent shall execute any and all instruments for more fully and
certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor Trustee all such rights,

which it may be consolidated, or  any corporation resulting from any merger,
conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any

business of the Trustee, by sale or otherwise, shall  be the successor of the
Trustee hereunder; _provided_ such corporation shall be otherwise qualified
and eligible under this Article 3, without the execution or filing  of any
paper or any further act on the part of any of the Parties hereto. In case any
CVRs shall have been authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee then in
office, any successor by merger, conversion, sale or consolidation to such 
authenticating Trustee may adopt such authentication and deliver the CVRs so
authenticated with the same effect as if such successor Trustee had itself
authenticated such CVRs; and such certificate shall have the full force which
it is anywhere  in the CVRs or in this CVR Agreement provided that the
certificate of the Trustee shall have the same; _provided_ , _further_ , that
the right to adopt the certificate of authentication of any predecessor
Trustee shall apply only to its successor or successors by merger, conversion
or consolidation.

 


 

 

Section 3.12. _Preferential Collection of Claims Against Parent_. If and when

secured or unsecured, of Parent (or  any other obligor upon

such additional covenant, restriction, condition or provision, such amendment
may provide for a particular period of grace after default  (which period may
be shorter or longer than that allowed in the case of other defaults) or may
provide for an immediate enforcement upon such an Event of Default or may
limit the remedies available to the Trustee upon such an Event of Default  or
may limit the right of the Majority Holders to waive such an Event of Default;

 


 

 

(d) to cure any  ambiguity, or to correct or supplement any provision herein
or in the CVRs which may be defective or inconsistent with any other provision

(including consents obtained in  connection with a purchase of, or tender

approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, but it shall be 
sufficient if such Act shall approve the substance thereof.

 


 

 

Section 5.3. _Execution of Amendments_. In executing any amendment permitted
by this Article 5, the Trustee (subject to Section 3.1) shall be fully
protected in relying upon an Opinion  of Counsel stating that the execution

Trustee, bear a notation in form approved by the Trustee as to any matter
provided for in such amendment. If Parent  shall so determine, new CVRs so
modified as to conform, in the opinion of the Trustee and the Board of
Directors, to any such amendment may be prepared and executed by Parent and
authenticated and delivered by the Trustee in exchange for  Outstanding CVRs.

COVENANTS

 


 

 

Section 6.1. _Payment of Amounts, if any, to Holders_. Parent will duly and
punctually pay or cause to be paid the amounts, if any, owed with respect to
the CVRs in accordance with the  terms of the CVRs and this CVR Agreement.
Such amounts shall be considered paid on or prior to the applicable Payment
Date if on such date, the Trustee or the Paying Agent holds in accordance with
this CVR Agreement money sufficient to pay all  such amounts then due. Each
of the Surviving Entity, Parent (or any of its Affiliates), the Trustee and
the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts
otherwise payable pursuant to this CVR Agreement or the Merger  Agreement
such amount as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code, the rules or regulations promulgated
thereunder, any provision of applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law or any
other  Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld, such
deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for purposes of this CVR

respect of which such deduction  and withholding was made. The consent of the
Holders shall not be required for any such withholding.

CVRs may be presented or surrendered for payment, (ii) where CVRs may be
surrendered for registration of transfer  or exchange and (iii) where notices
and demands to or upon Parent in respect of the CVRs and this CVR Agreement
may be served. Parent hereby initially designates the Corporate Trust Office
as such office or agency of Parent, unless Parent shall  hereafter designate
and maintain some other office or agency for one or more of such purposes.
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent, registrar or
transfer agent; _provided_ that such Person shall take appropriate actions to
avoid the commingling of funds. Parent will give prompt written notice to the
Trustee of any change in the location of any such office or agency. If at
any  time Parent shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof,
such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at
the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and Parent hereby appoints the
Trustee as its agent  to receive all such presentations, surrenders, notices
and demands.

(b) Parent may from  time to time designate one or more other offices or
agencies (in or outside of the City of New York) where the CVRs may be
presented or surrendered for any or all such purposes, and may from time to
time rescind such designation; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such
designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve Parent  of its
obligation to maintain an office or agency in the Borough of Manhattan, the
City of New York for such purposes. Parent will give prompt written notice to
the Trustee of any such designation or rescission and any change in the
location of  any such office or agency.

 


 

 

Section 6.3. _Money for Covered Revenues Payments to Be Held in Trust_.

 


 

 

(a) If Parent shall  at any time act as the Paying Agent, it will, on or
before the Payment Date, as the case may be, segregate and hold in trust for
the benefit of the Holders all sums held by such Paying Agent for payment on
the CVRs until such sums shall be paid  to the Holders as herein provided,
and will promptly notify the Trustee of any failure of Parent to make payment
on the CVRs.

 


 

 

(b) Whenever Parent  shall have one or more Paying Agents for the CVRs, it
will, on or before a Payment Date, deposit with a Paying Agent a sum in same
day funds sufficient to pay the amount, if any, so becoming due, such sum to
be held in trust for the benefit of  the Persons entitled to such amount.

 


 

 

(c) Parent will cause  each Paying Agent other than the Trustee to execute
and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such Paying Agent shall
agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section 6.3, that
(i) such Paying Agent will hold all sums  held by it for the payment of any
amount payable on CVRs in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled
thereto until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of
as herein provided, and will notify the Trustee of the sums  so held, and
(ii) that it will give the Trustee notice of any failure by Parent (or by any
other obligor on the CVRs) to make any payment on the CVRs when the same shall
be due and payable.

 


 

 

(d) Any money  deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held
by Parent, in trust for the payment on any CVR and remaining unclaimed for one
year after the Payment Date shall be paid to Parent on Parent Request, or (if
then held by Parent) shall  be discharged from such trust, and the Holder of
such CVR shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to
Parent for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying
Agent with respect to such trust money shall  thereupon cease.

 


 

 

Section 6.4. _Books and Records_. Parent shall keep, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to keep, true, complete and accurate records in sufficient detail
to enable the Holders and their  consultants or professional advisors to
determine the amounts payable hereunder.

 


 

 

Section 6.5. _Audits_.

 


 

 

(a) Upon the written  request of the Holder Representative or the Majority
Holders, as the case may be (the " _Requesting Party_ "), provided to Parent
within 120 days following the date on  which Parent delivers a Covered
Revenues Statement with respect to a Covered Revenues Measuring Period ending
upon the last day of any Threshold Measuring Period pursuant to Section 4.4(b)
(the " _Review Request Period_ "), Parent shall permit, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to permit, an independent certified public accounting firm of
nationally recognized standing selected by the Requesting Party and Parent 
(failing agreement on which each shall designate an independent public
accounting firm of its own selection, which firms shall in turn appoint an
independent public accounting firm for such purpose) (the " _Independent
Accountan_ t") to have access during normal business hours to such of the
records of Parent as may be reasonably necessary to verify the accuracy of any
Covered Revenues Statements  delivered with respect to the Threshold
Measuring Period most recently ended and the figures underlying the
calculations set forth therein for any period within such Threshold Measuring
Period, and subject to customary confidentiality  provisions (it being
understood that such review shall not include any matter addressed in Section
6.5(b) below). Parent

 


 

 


 

 

 

31  


 

 


 

 

shall pay, or cause to be paid, the fees charged by the Independent
Accountant; _provided_ ,  that, in the event that the Independent Accountant
determines that the Covered Revenues included in the Covered Revenues
Statements is either at least 95.5% of the Covered Revenues that should have
been included in the Covered Revenues Statement  or within $10,000,000 of the
Covered Revenues that should have been included in the Covered Revenues
Statement, the Holders shall pay, or cause to be paid, the fees charged by
such Independent Accountant, which amount Parent may deduct from any  future
Covered Revenues Payments payable to Holders pursuant to this CVR Agreement.
The Independent Accountant, acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator,
shall be charged to come to a final determination as promptly as practicable
(and in any  event within 30 days) with respect to those specific items in
the applicable Covered Revenues Statement that the Requesting Party and Parent
disagree on and submit to it for resolution, and the scope of the disputes to
be resolved by the  Independent Accountant shall be limited to such specific
items. If issues are submitted to the Independent Accountant for resolution,
Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, furnish to the Independent
Accountant such access, work  papers and other documents and information
related to those disputed issues as the Independent Accountant may request and
as are available to Parent and subject to customary confidentiality
provisions. The Independent Accountant shall disclose  to the Requesting
Party the amounts that the Independent Accountant believes to be due and
payable by Parent and details concerning any discrepancy from the amount paid
and the amount due, and shall disclose no other information revealed in such 
audit. The Independent Accountant shall provide Parent with a copy of all
disclosures made to the Requesting Party.

 


 

 

(b) During the Review  Request Period, the Requesting Party may also provide
notice in writing to Parent challenging Parent's determination that a given
activity does not generate Covered Revenue recognized in any Covered Revenues
Measuring Period for which any  Covered Revenues Statement has been delivered
with respect to the Threshold Measuring Period most recently ended, which
notice shall (i) identify in reasonable detail why the Requesting Party
believes such activity generated Covered Revenue  recognized in such Covered
Revenues Measuring Period, including identifying the activity and the clause
of "Covered Revenue" at issue (the " _Specified Dispute_ "),  including with
respect to challenges regarding Intellectual Property, identifying in
reasonable detail the item(s) of Intellectual Property at issue and alleged
infringing items (it being understood that such Specified Dispute shall not
include  any matter addressed in Section 6.5(a) above), and (ii) propose a
relevant subject matter expert of nationally recognized standing to be
appointed to resolve the Specified Dispute pursuant to the terms of this
Section 6.5(b). Within 10  Business Days of the receipt of such notice,
Parent shall either accept the appointment of such expert or shall propose in
writing to the Requesting Party a different independent relevant subject
matter expert of nationally recognized standing.  For the next 15 Business
Days thereafter, Parent and the Requesting Party shall discuss the selection
of such expert and failing agreement, the experts proposed by Parent and the
Requesting Party shall in turn appoint an independent relevant  subject
matter expert to resolve such dispute pursuant to the terms of this Section
6.5 (the " _Subject Matter Expert_ "), which expert shall be selected no later
than the  end of such 15-Business Day period. Within one month after the
appointment of the Subject Matter Expert, each of Parent and the Requesting
Party shall submit in writing to the Subject Matter Expert its arguments
regarding the Specified  Dispute. The Subject Matter Expert, acting as an
expert and not as an arbitrator, shall be charged to come to a final
determination with respect to the Specified Dispute as promptly as practicable
(and in any event within one month) by adopting  the position of either
Parent or the Requesting Party. The Subject Matter Expert shall not be
permitted to make any determination other than adopting the position of either
Parent or the Requesting Party, and the scope of the disputes to be  resolved
by the Subject Matter Expert shall be limited to the Specified Dispute. Parent
shall permit, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to permit, the Subject Matter
Expert to have access during normal business hours to such of the records of 
Parent as may be reasonably necessary to resolve the Specified Dispute,
subject to customary confidentiality provisions. Parent shall pay, or cause to
be paid, the fees charged by the Subject Matter Expert; provided, that, in the
event that the  Subject Matter Expert determines that the Covered Revenues
included in the Covered Revenues Statements is either at least 95.5% of the
Covered Revenues that should have been included in the Covered Revenues
Statement or within $10 million of  the

 


 

 


 

 

 

32  


 

 


 

 

Covered Revenues that should have been included in the Covered Revenues
Statement, the Holders shall pay, or cause to be paid, the fees charged by
such Subject  Matter Expert, which amount Parent may deduct from any future
Covered Revenues Payments payable to Holders pursuant to this CVR Agreement.
Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, furnish to the Subject
Matter Expert such reasonable  access, work papers and other documents and
information related to disputed issues as the Subject Matter Expert may
request and as are available to Parent, and subject to customary
confidentiality provisions. The Subject Matter Expert shall  disclose to the
Requesting Party only the amounts that the Subject Matter Expert believes to
be due and payable by Parent, details concerning any discrepancy from the
amount paid and the amount due, and shall disclose no other information 
revealed in such audit. The Subject Matter Expert shall provide Parent with a
copy of all disclosures made to the Requesting Party.

 


 

 

(c) Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary, only one, and not both, of the
Holder Representative or the Majority Holders may provide notice requesting an
audit pursuant to Sections 6.5(a) or 6.5(b) during each Review Request Period.

 


 

 

(d) All other items  in the Covered Revenues Statement that the Requesting
Party and Parent do not submit, prior to the end of the Review Request Period,
to the Independent Accountant or to the Subject Matter Expert for resolution
shall be deemed to be agreed by  the Requesting Party and Parent and neither
the Independent Accountant nor the Subject Matter Expert shall be charged with
calculating or validating those agreed upon items.

 


 

 

(e) If the  Independent Accountant or Subject Matter Expert concludes that
any Covered Revenues Payment amount should have been greater than the Covered
Revenues Payment set forth in an applicable Covered Revenues Statement (the
difference being the " _CVR Shortfall_ "), Parent shall pay the CVR Shortfall
within 60 days of the date the Requesting Party deliver to Parent the
Independent Accountant's or Subject Matter  Expert's written report (the "
_Shortfall Report_ "); _provided_ that the CVR Shortfall amount  shall bear
interest at the Shortfall Interest Rate beginning from 30 days after the date
the Requesting Party delivers to Parent the Shortfall Report until payment is
made to the Trustee. The decision of such Independent Accountant and Subject 
Matter Expert shall be final, conclusive and binding on Parent and the
Holders, shall be non-appealable and shall not be subject to further review.

 


 

 

(f) If, upon the  expiration of the Review Request Period, neither the Holder
Representative nor the Majority Holders have requested a review of the
applicable Covered Revenues Statement in accordance with this Section 6.5, the
calculation of the Covered  Revenues Payment payable with respect to all
Covered Revenues Measuring Periods within the applicable Threshold Measuring
Period shall be conclusive and binding on each Holder, and Parent shall be
released from any liability or accountability  with respect to payments in
respect of such Covered Revenues Measuring Periods in excess of such Covered
Revenues Payment.

 


 

 

(g) Each Person  seeking to receive information from Parent in connection
with a review pursuant to this Section 6.5 shall enter into, and shall cause
its accounting firm to enter into, a reasonable and mutually satisfactory
confidentiality agreement with  Parent or any Subsidiary obligating such
party to retain all such financial information disclosed to such party in
confidence pursuant to such confidentiality agreement and not use such
information for any purpose other than the completion of  such review.

 


 

 

(h) Parent shall use,  and shall cause its Affiliates to use, its (and their)
commercially reasonable efforts to include a provision in any license or
distribution agreement with any third party with respect to any Covered
Product or Service that would allow any  Independent Accountant appointed
pursuant to this Section 6.5 such access to the records of the other party to
such license or distribution agreement as may be reasonably necessary to
perform its duties pursuant to this Section 6.5 provided,  that this
provision shall not apply if the underlying license agreement with Parent or
Affiliates would not customarily include audit

 


 

 


 

 

 

33  


 

 


 

 

rights. The parties hereto agree that, if Parent or its Affiliates have
exercised audit rights under any collaboration, license, sublicense or
distribution  agreement, or any agreement referred to in the final proviso of
the definition of "Covered Revenues Payment", prior to the Requesting Party's
request for an audit under this Section 6.5 and under such collaboration,
license, sublicense,  distribution or other agreement Parent and its
Affiliates cannot request another audit, the results of Parent's prior audit
of the counterparty shall be used for purposes of the audit requested by the
Requesting Party under this Section 6.5 and  that Parent shall not have any
further obligation to provide access to the Independent Accountant or Subject
Matter Expert with respect to such counterparty until such time as Parent may
again exercise its rights of audit under the collaboration,  license,
sublicense, distribution or other agreement with such counterparty.

 


 

 

(i) Each of the  Requesting Party and Parent shall bear its own costs and
expenses in connection with the reviews and audits provided for in this
Section 6.5, except that the fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant
and/or the Subject Matter Expert will  be borne as provided in Section 6.5(a)
and Section 6.5(b), respectively.

 


 

 

Section 6.6. _Certain Covenants and Acknowledgements_.

 


 

 

(a) During the  Covered Revenues Term, Parent shall operate its business and
its Subsidiaries' businesses in good faith and shall not take any action, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries not to take any action, for the primary purpose
of avoiding or reducing the  amount of Covered Revenues Payments payable to
the Holders.

 


 

 

(b) So long as any of  the CVRs remain Outstanding, Parent shall not enter
into any binding agreement, arrangement or understanding, which would, or
would reasonably be expected to, delay or prevent Parent's ability to timely
make any Covered Revenues Payment that  becomes due under this CVR Agreement.

 


 

 

(c) Parent shall use,  and shall cause its Subsidiaries to use, Diligent
Efforts to obtain regulatory approval and clearance for the Existing Products;
_provided_ , however, that such  obligation to use Diligent Efforts shall
terminate upon the earlier of (i) the End Date and (ii) such time as the data
generated in an appropriate clinical trial does not support further
development of such Product. Parent shall use, and shall  cause its
Subsidiaries to use, Diligent Efforts to Sell and commercialize Products of
Parent and its Subsidiaries that are included in the definition of Covered
Products and Services, in each case in the Field utilizing any Methylation-
based  Technology; _provided_ , _however_ , that such obligation to use
Diligent Efforts shall  terminate upon the End Date.

 


 

 

Without limiting the provisions of this Section 6.6, each of the Trustee and
Holder Representative (by execution of this CVR Agreement) and the Holders (by
their  acceptance of the CVRs hereby) shall be deemed to have acknowledged
that (i) Parent may make decisions regarding the operation of the businesses
of Parent and its Subsidiaries, including the investment and allocation of
resources, on the basis of  the strategic objectives of Parent and its
Affiliates taking into account any relevant factors (including technical,
commercial, legal, scientific and/or medical factors), and that such decisions
may adversely affect the amount of Covered  Revenues Payments payable to the
Holders, and (ii) it is Parent's present intention to operate the Company
business as a stand-alone division within Parent and Parent may in its
discretion develop, package, distribute and sell products and  services
separately, in each case of (i) and (ii), so long as such actions taken or not
taken do not conflict with or breach the provisions of this CVR Agreement,
including this Section 6.6.

 


 

 

Section 6.7. _Notice of Default_. Parent shall file with the Trustee written
notice of the occurrence of any Event of Default or other default under this
CVR Agreement within five  Business Days of its becoming aware of any such
default or Event of Default.

 


 

 


 

 

 

34  


 

 


 

 

Section 6.8. _Confidentiality_. The Trustee, the Holder Representative and the
Holders hereby agree that any confidential or non-public information
(including Covered Revenues  Statements) they receive from or on behalf of
Parent or any Affiliate of Parent, which receipt arises out of the
transactions contemplated by this CVR Agreement (the "
_Confidential        Information_ "), shall: (a) not be used for any
purpose other than for purposes permitted under this CVR Agreement; (b) not be
used directly or indirectly in any way that is for competitive purposes; and
(c) not be disclosed by,  and be kept confidential by, the Trustee, the
Holder Representative and the Holders and its directors, officers, members,
managers, employees, affiliates, and agents (collectively, " _Representatives_
");        _provided_ , _however_ , that any such Confidential
Information may be disclosed only to their  Representatives (including the
Independent Accountant) who (i) need to know such Confidential Information and
(ii) are bound in writing to a non-disclosure agreement no less restrictive
than this Section 6.8. It is understood that such  Representatives shall be
informed by the Trustee, the Holder Representative or the applicable Holder of
the confidential nature of such Confidential Information, and that the
Trustee, the Holder Representative or such Holder, as applicable,  shall be
responsible for any disclosure or use made by its Representatives in breach of
obligations under this CVR Agreement to the same extent as if such disclosure
or use had been made directly by the Trustee or such Holder, as applicable. 
Each of the Trustee, the Holder Representative and the Holders will promptly
notify Parent of any breach of this CVR Agreement of which they become aware,
and will use reasonable efforts to assist and cooperate with Parent in
minimizing the  consequences of such breach. "Confidential Information" shall
not include any information that is (A) publicly available other than because
of disclosure by the Trustee, the Holder Representative or the Holders or any
of their respective  Representatives or (B) is lawfully disclosed to the
Trustee, the Holder Representative or Holders by sources (other than Parent or
its Affiliates) rightfully in possession of the Confidential Information. If
the Trustee, the Holder  Representative, the Holders or their respective
Representatives are legally required or requested to disclose any Confidential
Information, they will in advance of such disclosure, unless otherwise
prohibited by Law, promptly notify Parent of  such request or requirement so
that Parent may seek to avoid or minimize the required disclosure and/or
obtain an appropriate protective order or other appropriate relief to ensure
that any Confidential Information so disclosed is maintained in  confidence
to the maximum extent possible by the Person receiving the disclosure, or, in
Parent's discretion, to waive compliance with the provisions of this CVR
Agreement. In any such case, the Trustee, the Holder Representative and the 
Holders agree to cooperate and use reasonable efforts to avoid or minimize the
required disclosure and/or obtain such protective order or other relief. If,
in the absence of a protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, the
Trustee,  the Holder Representative, Holders or their respective
Representatives are legally obligated to disclose any Confidential
Information, they will disclose only so much thereof to the party compelling
disclosure as they reasonably believe in good  faith, on the basis of advice
of counsel, is required by Law. The Trustee, the Holder Representative and
Holders shall give Parent prior written notice of the specific Confidential
Information that they believe they are required to disclose  under such
circumstances. All Confidential Information disclosed by or on behalf of
Parent or any of its Affiliates shall be, and shall remain, the property of
Parent or such Affiliate.

 


 

 

Section 6.9. _Non-Use of Name_. None of the Trustee, the Holder Representative
or the Holders shall use the name, trademark, trade name, or logo of Parent,
its Affiliates, or their  respective employees in any publicity or news
release relating to this CVR Agreement or its subject matter, without the
prior express written permission of Parent.

REMEDIES OF THE TRUSTEE AND HOLDER

 


 

 

ON EVENT OF DEFAULT

 


 

 

Section 7.1. _Event of Default Defined ; Waiver of Default_. " _Event of
Default_ " with respect to the CVRs,  means each one of the following events
which shall have occurred and be continuing (whatever the reason for such
Event of Default and whether it shall be voluntary or involuntary or be
effected by

 


 

 


 

 

 

35  


 

 


 

 

operation of Law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or
any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body):

 


 

 

(a) default in the  payment of all or any part of any Covered Revenues
Payment after a period of 10 Business Days after such Covered Revenues Payment
shall become due and payable on a Payment Date or otherwise; or

 


 

 

(b) material default  in the performance, or breach in any material respect,
of any covenant or warranty of Parent in respect of the CVRs (other than a
covenant or warranty in respect of the CVRs, a default in whose performance or
whose breach is elsewhere in this  Section 7.1 specifically dealt with), and
continuance of such default or breach for a period of 90 days after there has
been given, by registered or certified mail, to Parent by the Trustee or to
Parent and the Trustee by the Majority Holders,  a written notice specifying
such default or breach and requiring it to be remedied and stating that such
notice is a "Notice of Default" hereunder; or

 


 

 

(c) a court having  jurisdiction in the premises shall enter a decree or
order for relief in respect of Parent in an involuntary case under any
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar Law now or hereafter in
effect, or appointing a receiver, liquidator,  assignee, custodian, Trustee
or sequestrator (or similar official) of Parent or for any substantial part of
its property or ordering the winding up or liquidation of its affairs, and
such decree or order shall remain unstayed and in effect for  a period of 90
consecutive days; or

 


 

 

(d) Parent shall  commence a voluntary case under any applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency or other similar Law now or hereafter in effect, or consent to the
entry of an order for relief in an involuntary case under any such Law, or
consent to the appointment of or  taking possession by a receiver,
liquidator, assignee, custodian, Trustee or sequestrator (or similar official)
of Parent or for any substantial part of its property, or make any general
assignment for the benefit of creditors.

 


 

 

Except where authorization and/or appearance of each of the Holders is
required by applicable Law, if an Event of Default described above occurs 
and is continuing, then, and in each and every such case, either the Trustee
or the Trustee upon the written request of the Majority Holders by notice in
writing to Parent (and to the Trustee if given by the Majority Holders), shall
bring suit to  protect the rights of the Holders, including to obtain payment
for any amounts then due and payable, which amounts shall bear interest at the
Default Interest Rate until payment is made to the Trustee.

 


 

 

The foregoing provisions, however, are subject to the condition that if, at
any time after the Trustee shall have begun such suit, and before any 
judgment or decree for the payment of the moneys due shall have been obtained
or entered as hereinafter provided, Parent shall pay or shall deposit with the
Trustee a sum sufficient to pay all amounts which shall have become due (with
interest  upon such overdue amount at the Default Interest Rate to the date
of such payment or deposit) and such amount as shall be sufficient to cover
reasonable compensation to the Trustee, its agents, attorneys and counsel, and
all other expenses and  liabilities incurred and all advances made, by the
Trustee, and if any and all Events of Default under this CVR Agreement shall
have been cured, waived or otherwise remedied as provided herein, then and in
every such case the Majority Holders, by  written notice to Parent and to the
Trustee, may waive all defaults with respect to the CVRs, but no such waiver
or rescission and annulment shall extend to or shall affect any subsequent
default or shall impair any right consequent thereof.

 


 

 

Section 7.2. _Collection by the Trustee ; the Trustee May Prove Payment
Obligations_. Parent covenants that in the case default shall be made in the
payment of all or any part of the  CVRs when the same shall have become due
and payable, whether at a Payment Date or otherwise, then upon demand of the
Trustee, Parent will pay to the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders the
whole amount that then shall

 


 

 


 

 

 

36  


 

 


 

 

have become due and payable on all CVRs (with interest from the date due and
payable to the date of such payment upon the overdue amount at the Default
Interest  Rate); and in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be
sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including reasonable
compensation to the Trustee and each predecessor Trustee, their respective
agents, attorneys and  counsel, and any expenses and liabilities incurred,
and all advances made, by the Trustee and each predecessor Trustee, except as
a result of its negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct.

 


 

 

The Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights
and the rights of the Holders by such appropriate judicial proceedings  as
the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights,
whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this CVR
Agreement or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce
any  other remedy.

 


 

 

In case Parent shall fail forthwith to pay such amounts upon such demand, the
Trustee, in its own name and as Trustee of an express trust, shall  be
entitled and empowered to institute any action or proceedings at Law or in
equity for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, and may prosecute any
such action or proceedings to judgment or final decree, and may enforce any
such judgment  or final decree against Parent or other obligor upon such CVRs
and collect in the manner provided by Law out of the property of Parent or
other obligor upon such CVRs, wherever situated, the moneys adjudged or
decreed to be payable.

 


 

 

In any judicial proceedings relative to Parent or other obligor upon the CVRs,
irrespective of whether any amount is then due and payable with  respect to
the CVRs, the Trustee is authorized:

 


 

 

(a) to file and prove  a claim or claims for the whole amount owing and
unpaid in respect of the CVRs, and to file such other papers or documents as
may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee
(including any claim for reasonable  compensation to the Trustee and each
predecessor Trustee, and their respective agents, attorneys and counsel, and
for reimbursement of all expenses and liabilities incurred, and all advances
made, by the Trustee and each predecessor Trustee,  except as a result of
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct) and of the Holders allowed in any
judicial proceedings relative to Parent or other obligor upon the CVRs, or to
their respective property;

 


 

 

(b) unless prohibited  by, and only to the extent required by, applicable
Law, to vote on behalf of the Holders in any election of a Trustee or a
standby Trustee in arrangement, reorganization, liquidation or other
bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings or a Person  performing similar
functions in comparable proceedings; and

 


 

 

(c) to collect and  receive any moneys or other property payable or
deliverable on any such claims, and to distribute all amounts received with
respect to the claims of the Holders and of the Trustee on their behalf; and
any Trustee, receiver, or liquidator,  custodian or other similar official is
hereby authorized by each of the Holders to make payments to the Trustee, and,
in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of payments directly
to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee such  amounts as shall be sufficient to
cover reasonable compensation to the Trustee, each predecessor Trustee and
their respective agents, attorneys and counsel, and all other expenses and
liabilities incurred, and all advances made, by the Trustee  and each
predecessor Trustee, except as a result of its negligence, bad faith or
willful misconduct, and all other amounts due to the Trustee or any
predecessor Trustee pursuant to Section 3.6. To the extent that such payment
of reasonable  compensation, expenses, disbursements, advances and other
amounts out of the estate in any such proceedings shall be denied for any
reason, payment of the same shall be secured by a lien on, and shall be paid
out of, any and all distributions,  dividends, moneys, securities and other
property which the Holders may be entitled to receive in such proceedings,
whether in liquidation or under any plan of reorganization or arrangement or
otherwise.

 


 

 


 

 

 

37  


 

 


 

 

Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize
or consent to or vote for or accept or adopt on behalf of any  Holder any
plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the
CVRs, or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote
in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding except, as 
aforesaid, to vote for the election of a Trustee in bankruptcy or similar
person.

 


 

 

All rights of action and of asserting claims under this CVR Agreement, or
under any of the CVRs, may be enforced by the Trustee without the  possession
of any of the CVRs or the production thereof and any trial or other
proceedings instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as
Trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment, subject to the
payment of the  expenses, disbursements and compensation of the Trustee, each
predecessor Trustee and their respective agents and attorneys, shall be for
the ratable benefit of the Holders.

 


 

 

In any proceedings brought by the Trustee (and also any proceedings involving
the interpretation of any provision of this CVR Agreement to which  the
Trustee shall be a party) the Trustee shall be held to represent all the
Holders, and it shall not be necessary to make any Holders of such CVRs
parties to any such proceedings (unless required by applicable Law).

 


 

 

Section 7.3. _Application of Proceeds_. Any monies collected by the Trustee
pursuant to this Article 7 in respect of any CVRs shall be applied in the
following order at the date or  dates fixed by the Trustee upon presentation
of the several CVRs in respect of which monies have been collected and
stamping (or otherwise noting) thereon the payment in exchange for the
presented CVRs if only partially paid or upon surrender  thereof if fully
paid:

 


 

 

FIRST: To the payment of costs and expenses in respect of which monies have
been collected, including  reasonable compensation to the Trustee and Holder
Representative and each predecessor Trustee and predecessor Holder
Representative, as applicable, and their respective agents and attorneys and
of all expenses and liabilities incurred, and all  advances made, by the
Trustee and Holder Representative and each predecessor Trustee and predecessor
Holder Representative, as applicable, except as a result of their respective
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct, and all other amounts  due to
the Trustee and Holder Representative or any predecessor Trustee or
predecessor Holder Representative pursuant to Section 3.5;

 


 

 

SECOND: To the payment of the whole amount then owing and unpaid upon all the
CVRs, with interest at the  Default Interest Rate on all such amounts, and in
case such monies shall be insufficient to pay in full the whole amount so due
and unpaid upon the CVRs, then to the payment of such amounts without
preference or priority of any security over any  other CVR, ratably to the
aggregate of such amounts due and payable; and

 


 

 

THIRD: To the payment of the remainder, if any, to Parent or any other Person
lawfully entitled thereto.

 


 

 

Section 7.4. _Suits for Enforcement_. In case an Event of Default has
occurred, has not been waived and is continuing, the Trustee may in its
discretion proceed to protect and enforce  the rights vested in it by this
CVR Agreement by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall
deem most effectual to protect and enforce any of such rights (unless
authorization and/or appearance of each of the Holders is required  by
applicable Law), either at Law or in equity or in bankruptcy or otherwise,
whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement contained in
this CVR Agreement or in aid of the exercise of any power granted in this CVR
Agreement  or to enforce any other legal or equitable right vested in the
Trustee by this CVR Agreement or by Law.

Section 7.5. _Restoration of Rights on Abandonment of Proceedings_. In case
the Trustee or any Holder shall have proceeded to enforce any right under this
CVR Agreement and such  proceedings shall have been discontinued or abandoned
for any reason, or shall have been determined adversely to the Trustee or to
such Holder, then and in every such case Parent and the Trustee and the
Holders shall be restored respectively to  their former positions and rights
hereunder, and all rights, remedies and powers of Parent, the Trustee and the
Holders shall continue as though no such proceedings had been taken.

 


 

 

Section 7.6. _Limitations on Suits by Holders_. Subject to the right of the
Holder Representative and the Majority Holders under Section 6.5, no Holder of
any CVR shall have any right  by virtue or by availing itself of any
provision of this CVR Agreement to institute any Action at law or in equity or
in bankruptcy or otherwise upon or under or with respect to this CVR
Agreement, or for the appointment of a trustee, receiver,  liquidator,
custodian or other similar official or for any other remedy hereunder, unless
(a) such Holder previously shall have given to the Trustee written notice of
default and of the continuance thereof, as hereinbefore provided; (b) the 
Majority Holders shall have made written request upon the Trustee to institute
such action or proceedings in its own name as Trustee hereunder and shall have
offered to the Trustee such reasonable indemnity as it may require against the
costs,  expenses and liabilities to be incurred therein or thereby; and (c)
the Trustee for 15 days after its receipt of the latter of such notice,
request and offer of indemnity shall have failed to institute any such action
or proceeding and no  direction inconsistent with such written request shall
have been given to the Trustee pursuant to Section 7.9. For the protection and
enforcement of the provisions of this Section 7.6, each and every Holder and
the Trustee shall be entitled to  such relief as can be given either at Law
or in equity.

 


 

 

Section 7.7. _Unconditional Right of Holders to Institute Certain Suits_.
Notwithstanding any other provision in this CVR Agreement and any provision of
any CVR, the right of any Holder  of any CVR to receive payment of the
amounts payable in respect of such CVR on or after the respective due dates
expressed in such CVR, or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such
payment on or after such respective dates, shall not be  impaired or affected
without the consent of such Holder.

 


 

 

Section 7.8. _Powers and Remedies Cumulative ; Delay or Omission Not Waiver of
Default_.

 


 

 

(a) Except as  provided in Section 7.6, no right or remedy herein conferred
upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders is intended to be exclusive
of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent
permitted by Law, be  cumulative and in addition to every other right and
remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at Law or in equity or
otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or
otherwise, shall not prevent the  concurrent assertion or employment of any
other appropriate right or remedy.

 


 

 

(b) No delay or  omission of the Trustee or of any Holder to exercise any
right or power accruing upon any Event of Default occurring and continuing as
aforesaid shall impair any such right or power or shall be construed to be a
waiver of any such Event of  Default or an acquiescence therein; and, subject
to Section 7.6, every power and remedy given by this CVR Agreement or by Law
to the Trustee or to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as
often as shall be deemed expedient, by the  Trustee or by the Holders.

 


 

 

Section 7.9. _Control by Holders_.

 


 

 

(a) The Majority  Holders shall have the right to direct the time, method,
and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the
Trustee, or exercising any power conferred on the Trustee with respect to the
CVRs by this CVR Agreement; _provided_ that such direction shall not be
otherwise than in accordance with Law and the provisions of this CVR
Agreement; and _provided_ , _further_ , that (subject to the provisions of
Section 3.1) the Trustee shall have the right to decline to follow any such

 


 

 


 

 

 

39  


 

 


 

 

direction if (i) the Trustee, being advised by counsel, shall determine that
the action or proceeding so directed may not lawfully be taken or if the
Trustee in good  faith by its board of directors, the executive committee,
(ii) a committee of directors or Responsible Officers of the Trustee shall
determine that the action or proceedings so directed would involve the Trustee
in personal liability or (iii) the  Trustee in good faith shall so determine
that the actions or forbearances specified in or pursuant to such direction
would be unduly prejudicial to the interests of Holders not joining in the
giving of said direction.

 


 

 

(b) Nothing in this  CVR Agreement shall impair the right of the Trustee in
its discretion to take any action deemed proper by the Trustee and which is
not inconsistent with such direction or directions by Holders.

 


 

 

Section 7.10. _Waiver of Past Defaults_.

 


 

 

(a) In the case of a  default or an Event of Default specified in clause (b),
(c) or (d) of Section 7.1, the Majority Holders may waive any such default or
Event of Default, and its consequences except a default in respect of a
covenant or provisions hereof which  cannot be modified or amended without
the consent of the Holder of each CVR affected. In the case of any such
waiver, Parent, the Trustee and the Holders shall be restored to their former
positions and rights hereunder, respectively; but no  such waiver shall
extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent
thereon.

 


 

 

(b) Upon any such  waiver, such default shall cease to exist and be deemed to
have been cured and not to have occurred, and any Event of Default arising
therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, and not to have occurred for
every purpose of this CVR  Agreement; but no such waiver shall extend to any
subsequent or other default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent
thereon.

 


 

 

Section 7.11. _The Trustee to Give Notice of Default, But May Withhold in
Certain Circumstances_. The Trustee shall transmit to the Holders, as the
names and addresses of such Holders  appear on the CVR Register (as provided
under Section 313(c) of the Trust Indenture Act, if applicable), notice by
mail of all defaults which have occurred and are known to the Trustee, such
notice to be transmitted within 90 days after the  occurrence thereof, unless
such defaults shall have been cured before the giving of such notice (the term
"default" for the purposes of this Section 7.11 being hereby defined to mean
any event or condition which is, or with notice or lapse of  time or both
would become, an Event of Default); _provided_ that, except in the case of
default in the payment of the amounts payable in respect of any of the CVRs,
the  Trustee shall be protected in withholding such notice if and so long as
the board of directors, the executive committee, or a trust committee of
directors or Trustees and/or Responsible Officers of the Trustee in good faith
determines that the  withholding of such notice is in the interests of the
Holders.

 


 

 

Section 7.12. _Right of Court to Require Filing of Undertaking to Pay Costs_.
All Parties to this CVR Agreement agree, and each Holder of any CVR by his or
her acceptance thereof shall  be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in
its discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy
under this CVR Agreement or in any suit against the Trustee for any action
taken, suffered or omitted by it as the  Trustee, the filing by any party
litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and
that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including
attorneys' fees, against any party litigant in such suit,  having due regard
to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party
litigant; but the provisions of this Section 7.12 shall not apply to any suit
instituted by the Trustee, to any suit instituted by any Holder or group  of
Holders holding in the aggregate more than 10% of the CVRs Outstanding or to
any suit instituted by any Holder for the enforcement of the payment of any
CVR on or after the due date expressed in such CVR.

ARTICLE 8

 


 

 

CONSOLIDATION, MERGER, SALE OR CONVEYANCE

 


 

 

Section 8.1. _Parent May Consolidate, etc., on Certain Terms_.

 


 

 

(a) Parent shall not  merge or consolidate with or into any other Person, or
sell or convey all of its assets to any Person (other than a wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent), unless (i) Parent shall be the continuing Person, or
the successor Person or the Person  which acquires by sale or conveyance all
the assets of Parent (including the shares of the Company), Parent shall be a
Person organized under the Laws of the United States of America or any State
thereof and shall expressly assume by an  instrument supplemental hereto,
executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form satisfactory to the Trustee,
the due and punctual payment of the CVRs, according to their tenor, and the
due and punctual performance and observance of all of the  covenants and
conditions of this CVR Agreement to be performed or observed by Parent and
(ii) Parent, or such successor Person, as the case may be, shall not,
immediately after such merger or consolidation, or such sale or conveyance, be
in  default in the performance of any such covenant or condition.

 


 

 

(b) Except as  otherwise provided in Section 8.1(a) or in a Minority
Transaction, Parent and its Subsidiaries shall not consummate a Disposition of
their respective rights in and to Applicable Products to any third party
(including the sale of substantially  all, but not all, the assets of
Parent), except in a bona fide transaction and unless Parent obtains the
agreement of the transferee to (i) (x) at all times after any such
Disposition, include such Applicable Products (or Services or other  assets
and rights included in such Disposition, if applicable) in the calculation of
Covered Revenues, in accordance with the terms hereunder (with the transferee
substituted for Parent as necessary) as if such transferee was Parent and
(y)  include in the contract for such Disposition appropriate provisions for
such treatment and a requirement that the transferee comply with the covenants
in this Section 8.1(b) to the same extent as Parent, and (ii) adjust the
dollar amounts set  forth in the definition of "Covered Revenues Payment" as
agreed upon by Parent and the Holder Representative as a result of such
transaction to apportion such thresholds between the portion of the business
retained by Parent and its  Subsidiaries and the portion of the business
attributable to the Applicable Products (and Services and such other assets
and rights, if applicable) acquired by the transferee (which apportionment
shall be based on the relative percentage of  projected Covered Revenues
transferred and the percentage of projected Covered Revenues retained for the
period from the closing of the transaction to the End Date) (any transaction
in which the transferee agrees to such inclusions, a " _Specified Asset Sale_
"). For purposes of clarification, this Section 8.1(b) will not apply to (A)
Sales of Products or Services made by Parent or its wholly owned 
Subsidiaries or (B) ordinary course licensing arrangements between Parent and
its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and third party licensees, on the other
hand, in each case of clauses (A) and (B) in the ordinary course of business
and which are  taken into account in the calculation of Net Sales in
accordance with the terms of this CVR Agreement. If any transaction covered by
this Section 8.1(b) also involves the Disposition of assets or other rights
other than Applicable Products,  any commercial arrangement between Parent or
any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the acquirer or any Affiliate of
the acquirer on the other hand, or any other consideration paid or deemed paid
by Parent to the transferee in such  Disposition, then the Consideration
allocated to the Applicable Products, assets or other rights included in
Covered Revenues shall be calculated based on their actual value in proportion
to the aggregate value of such Applicable Products,  assets or other rights
taking into account the value of all components of such transaction (the "
_Appropriate Allocation_ "). If a Product or Service that was a Bundled 
Product or Service ceases to be a Bundled Product or Service, then effective
as of the date on which such Product or Service ceases to be a Bundled Product
or Service, it will not be an Applicable Product for purposes of this Section
8.1(b) for  so long as it is not a Bundled Product or Service and does not
and would not generate Covered Revenues on a standalone basis.

 


 

 


 

 

 

41  


 

 


 

 

(c) Except as  otherwise provided in Section 8.1(a), Section 8.1(b), this
Section 8.1(c) or in a Minority Transaction, Parent and its Subsidiaries shall
not consummate a Disposition of their respective assets or rights in and to
the business of Parent and its  Subsidiaries that generate Covered Revenues
to any third party without the prior written consent of the Majority Holders
or the Holder Representative, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Section 8.1(b) and  this Section 8.1(c) shall not
apply with respect to the Disposition of assets that are ancillary to and are
not required for the generation of Covered Revenues (e.g., real property);
_provided_ , _however_ , Covered Products and Services, Data described in the
definition of "Sale of Data", Samples described in clause (d) of the 
definition of "Covered Revenues", and any assets in the Field utilizing
Existing IP (and, in each case, any rights therein) and/or any assets that are
integral thereto, shall not be deemed or considered ancillary for this purpose
and shall be  covered by Section 8.1(b) and the first sentence of this
Section 8.1(c).

 


 

 

(d) In the event  Parent and Holder Representative are unable to agree on any
matters that are the subject of Section 8.1(b) (including (i) whether a given
transaction is a "Minority Transaction", (ii) whether a particular transaction
is subject to Section  8.1(b), (iii) whether the proceeds of any particular
transaction constitute Covered Revenues (including any Appropriate Allocation,
as applicable) or (iv) the applicable adjustments described in Section
8.1(b)(ii)), within 30 days of notice  from one party to the other, either
Parent or Holder Representative may provide written notice to the other of its
(x) election to have such disagreement resolved by a Subject Matter Expert and
(y) its proposal of the applicable Subject Matter  Expert. Within 10 Business
Days of the receipt of such notice, the receiving party shall either accept
the proposal of such Subject Matter Expert or shall propose in writing to the
other party a Subject Matter Expert. For the next 15 Business  Days
thereafter, Parent and the Holder Representative shall discuss the selection
of such expert and failing agreement, the experts proposed by Parent and the
Holder Representative shall in turn appoint an independent relevant Subject
Matter  Expert to resolve such dispute, which expert shall be selected no
later than the end of such 15-Business Day period. Within one month after the
appointment of the Subject Matter Expert, each of Parent and the Holder
Representative shall submit  in writing to the Subject Matter Expert its
arguments for such disputed matter(s). The Subject Matter Expert, acting as an
expert and not as an arbitrator, shall be charged to come to a final
determination with respect to the proposed  adjustment as promptly as
practicable (and in any event within one month) by adopting the position of
either Parent or the Holder Representative. The Subject Matter Expert shall
not be permitted to make any determination other than adopting the  position
of either Parent or the Holder Representative, and the scope of the disputes
to be resolved by the Subject Matter Expert shall be limited to the disputed
matter(s). Parent shall permit, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to permit,
the  Subject Matter Expert to have access during normal business hours to
such of the records of Parent as may be reasonably necessary to resolve the
disputed matter(s). The person whose position was not adopted by the Subject
Matter Expert shall  pay, or cause to be paid, the fees charged by the
Subject Matter Expert. Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
furnish to the Subject Matter Expert such access, work papers and other
documents and information related to the  adjustment dispute as the Subject
Matter Expert may request and as are available to Parent.

 


 

 

Section 8.2. _Successor Person Substituted_.

 


 

 

(a) In case of any  such consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance, and
following such an assumption by the successor Person in accordance with the
terms of this CVR Agreement, Parent shall be discharged from all obligations
and covenants under this CVR Agreement  solely with respect to the business
and assets transferred in such bona fide consolidation, merger, sale or
conveyance, but, for the avoidance of doubt, Parent will remain bound by all
obligations and covenants with respect to any business or  assets retained by
Parent or its Subsidiaries that generate Covered Revenues, and such successor
Person shall succeed to and be substituted for Parent with the same effect as
if it had been named herein (it being understood, for the avoidance  of
doubt, that the calculations of Covered Revenues and Net Sales shall not
include any revenue or Sales of any Affiliates of the successor Person other
than the revenue and Sales of the business and assets of Parent and its
Subsidiaries). Such  successor Person may cause to be signed, and

 


 

 


 

 

 

42  


 

 


 

 

may issue either in its own name or in the name of Parent prior to such
succession any or all of the CVRs issuable hereunder which theretofore shall
not have been  signed by Parent and delivered to the Trustee, and, upon the
order of such successor corporation instead of Parent and subject to all the
terms, conditions and limitations in this CVR Agreement prescribed, the
Trustee shall authenticate and shall  deliver any CVRs which previously shall
have been signed and delivered to the Trustee for authentication, and any CVRs
which such successor corporation thereafter shall cause to be signed and
delivered to the Trustee for that purpose. All of the  CVRs so issued shall
in all respects have the same legal rank and benefit under this CVR Agreement
as the CVRs theretofore or thereafter issued in accordance with the terms of
this CVR Agreement as though all of such CVRs had been issued at the  date of
the execution hereof.

 


 

 

(b) In case of any  such consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance, such
changes in phraseology and form (but not in substance) may be made in the CVRs
thereafter to be issued as may be appropriate. The successor entity to such
consolidation, merger, sale or  conveyance may satisfy the obligations of
Section 4.4(a)(i)(A) and (B) of this CVR Agreement by providing copies of such
successor entity's Exchange Act Documents in the case of Section 4.4(a)(i)(A)
or such successor entity's financial  information in the case of Section
4.4(a)(i)(B).

 


 

 

(c) In the event of  any such sale, transfer or conveyance (other than a
conveyance by way of lease) Parent or any Person which shall theretofore have
become such in the manner described in this Article 8 shall be discharged from
all obligations and covenants under  this CVR Agreement and the CVRs and may
be liquidated and dissolved.

 


 

 

Section 8.3. _Opinion of Counsel to the Trustee_. The Trustee, subject to the
provisions of Sections 3.1 and 3.2, shall receive an Officer's Certificate and
Opinion of Counsel, prepared  in accordance with Sections 1.3 and 1.4, as
conclusive evidence that any such consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance,
and any such assumption, and any such liquidation or dissolution, complies
with the applicable provisions of this CVR  Agreement, and if a supplemental
agreement is required in connection with such transaction, such supplemental
agreement complies with this Article 8 and that there has been compliance with
all conditions precedent herein provided for or  relating to such
transaction.

 


 

 

Section 8.4. _Successors_. All covenants, provisions and agreements in this
CVR Agreement by or for the benefit of Parent, the Trustee, the Holder
Representative or the Holders shall  bind and inure to the benefit of their
respective permitted successors, assigns, heirs and personal representatives,
whether so expressed or not. Parent may assign this CVR Agreement without the
prior written consent of the other Parties to  this CVR Agreement to one or
more of its direct or indirect Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ ,  that
in the event of any such assignment Parent shall remain subject to its
obligations and covenants hereunder, including, but not limited to, its
obligation to make any Covered Revenues Payments.

 


 

 

ARTICLE 9

 


 

 

REDEMPTION OF SECURITIES

 


 

 

Section 9.1. _Notice to Trustee_. If Parent elects to redeem CVRs pursuant to
the optional redemption provisions of Section 9.5 hereof, it shall furnish to
the Trustee, at least 45 days  (unless a shorter period shall be agreed to by
the Trustee) but not more than 60 days before a redemption date (but in any
event prior to the notice provided pursuant to Section 9.2 hereof), an
Officer's Certificate setting forth (i) the clause  of this CVR Agreement
pursuant to which the redemption shall occur, (ii) the redemption date, (iii)
the amount of CVRs to be redeemed and (iv) the Redemption Price.

 


 

 

Section 9.2. _Notice of Redemption_. At least 30 days but not more than 60
days before a redemption date, Parent shall mail or cause to be mailed, by
first-class mail, a notice of  redemption to each

 


 

 


 

 

 

43  


 

 


 

 

Holder whose CVRs are to be redeemed at its registered address. The notice
(the " _Call Notice_ ")        shall identify the amount of CVRs to be
redeemed and shall state:

 


 

 

(a) the redemption  date;

 


 

 

(b) the Redemption  Price;

 


 

 

(c) the name and  address of the paying agent;

 


 

 

(d) that CVRs called  for redemption must be surrendered to the Paying Agent
to collect the Redemption Price;

 


 

 

(e) that, unless  Parent defaults in making such redemption payment, all
right title and interest in and to the CVRs and any Covered Revenues Payment
or any other amounts due under this CVR Agreement, if any, on CVRs called for
redemption ceases to accrue on and  after the redemption date;

 


 

 

(f) the clause of  this CVR Agreement pursuant to which the CVRs called for
redemption are being redeemed; and

 


 

 

(g) that no  representation is made as to the correctness or accuracy of the
CUSIP and ISIN number, if any, listed in such notice or printed on the CVRs.

 


 

 

At Parent's request, the Trustee shall give the notice of redemption in
Parent's name and at its expense; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall
have delivered to the Trustee at least 45 days (unless a shorter period shall
be agreed to by the Trustee)  but not more than 60 days prior to the
redemption date, an Officer's Certificate requesting that the Trustee give
such notice and setting forth the information to be stated in such notice as
provided in the preceding paragraph.

 


 

 

Section 9.3. _Effect of Notice of Redemption_. Once notice of redemption is
mailed in accordance with Section 9.2 hereof, CVRs called for redemption shall
become irrevocably due and  payable on the redemption date at the Redemption
Price. A notice of redemption shall be deemed to be given when mailed, whether
or not the Holder receives the notice. In any event, failure to give such
notice, or any defect in such notice,  shall not affect the validity of the
proceedings for the redemption of the CVRs held by Holders to whom such notice
was properly given.

 


 

 

Section 9.4. _Deposit of Redemption Price_. On or one Business Day prior to
the redemption date, Parent shall deposit with the Trustee or with the Paying
Agent (if different from the  Trustee) money sufficient to pay the Redemption
Price of all CVRs to be redeemed on that date. The Trustee or the paying agent
shall promptly return to Parent any money deposited with the Trustee or the
paying agent by Parent in excess of the  amounts necessary to pay the
Redemption Price of all CVRs to be redeemed.

 


 

 

If Parent complies with the provisions of the preceding paragraph, on and
after the redemption or purchase date, as applicable, all right title and
interest of a  Holder to any Covered Revenues Payment, if any, shall cease to
accrue on the CVRs called for redemption or subject to purchase. If any CVR
called for redemption or subject to purchase shall not be so paid upon
surrender for redemption or purchase  because of the failure of Parent to
comply with the preceding paragraph, interest shall be paid on the unpaid
redemption price from the redemption date or purchase date, as applicable,
until such redemption price is paid at the Default Interest  Rate.

 


 

 


 

 

 

44  


 

 


 

 

Section 9.5. _Optional Redemption by Parent_. Parent may, at any time on and
after the Redemption Eligibility Date, redeem all (but not less than all) of
the outstanding CVRs at the  Redemption Price.

 


 

 

ARTICLE 10

 


 

 

HOLDER REPRESENTATIVE

 


 

 

Section 10.1. _Authority and Rights of the Holder Representative; Limitations
on Liability_.

 


 

 

(a) The Holder  Representative shall have such powers and authority as are
necessary to carry out the functions, on behalf of the Holders, assigned to it
under this CVR Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Holder
Representative shall have no obligation to act, except as expressly provided
herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each  Holder agrees
that the Holder Representative has full power, authority and discretion, on
behalf of each Holder and his, her or its successors and assigns, to (a)
interpret the terms and provisions of this CVR Agreement and the documents to
be  executed and delivered by the Holders in connection herewith, (b) execute
and deliver and receive deliveries of all agreements, certificates,
statements, notices, approvals, extensions, waivers, undertakings, amendments
and other documents  required or permitted to be given by it under this CVR
Agreement, (c) receive service of process in connection with any claims under
this CVR Agreement or any document or agreement contemplated to be executed or
delivered in connection with  this CVR Agreement, (d) agree to, negotiate and
enter into settlements and compromises of, and assume the defense of, claims,
and demand arbitration and comply with Orders and awards of arbitrators with
respect to such claims, and take all  actions necessary or appropriate in the
judgement of the Holder Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing
(e) give and receive notices and communications as provided under this CVR
Agreement and (f) take all actions necessary or  appropriate in the judgment
of the Holder Representative on behalf of the Holders in carrying out the
provisions of this CVR Agreement applicable to the Holders. All actions taken
by the Holder Representative under this CVR Agreement shall be  binding upon
the Holders and their successors as if expressly confirmed and ratified in
writing by each of them. The Holder Representative shall, in its capacity as
such, have no liability to any Holder with respect to actions taken or
omitted  to be taken in their capacity as the Holder Representative, except
that the Holder Representative will be liable for its willful misconduct or
actual fraud, as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction from
which no further appeal  may be taken. The Holder Representative shall at all
times be entitled to rely on any directions received from the Majority
Holders; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Holder Representative shall not be
required to follow any such direction, and shall be under no obligation to
take any action in its capacity as the  Holder Representative, unless the
Holder Representative has been provided with other funds, security or
indemnities which, in the sole determination of the Holder Representative, are
sufficient to protect the Holder Representative against the  costs, expenses
and liabilities which may be incurred by the Holder Representative in
responding to such direction or taking such action. At no cost to Parent, the
Company or the Trustee, the Holder Representative shall be entitled to
engage  such counsel, experts and other agents and consultants as it shall
deem necessary in connection with exercising its powers and performing its
function hereunder and the Holders (including any permitted transferees) agree
by their acceptance of  the CVRs that the Holder Representative shall be
entitled to (in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Holder
Representative) conclusively rely on the opinions and advice of such Persons.
The Holder Representative shall be entitled to  reimbursement for all
reasonable expenses incurred or reasonably estimated to be incurred,
disbursements and advances (including fees and disbursements of their counsel,
experts and other agents and consultants) incurred by the Holder 
Representative in such capacity, and in the event of an Event of Default, and
upon notice to the Trustee, such reimbursement shall be paid to the Holder
Representative in accordance with Section 7.3 (it being understood that none
of Parent, the  Company or their respective Affiliates shall be responsible
for such reimbursement). The Holder Representative shall be entitled to
indemnification from the Holders against any loss, liability or expenses
arising out of actions taken or omitted  to be taken in its capacity as the
Holder Representative (except for

 


 

 


 

 

 

45  


 

 


 

 

those arising out of the Holder Representative's gross negligence or willful
misconduct), including the costs and expenses of investigation and defense of
claims.  Parent and the Company shall be able to rely conclusively (without
liability) on any instructions given and actions taken by the Holder
Representative as the instruction and decision of each Holder in all matters
applicable to the Holder referred  to herein. No Holder shall have any cause
of action against Parent, the Company or the Trustee for any action taken by
Parent, the Company or the Trustee in reliance upon the written instructions
or decisions of the Holder Representative, or  otherwise on account of
payments or distributions made by or on behalf of Parent or the Trustee in
accordance with the instructions of the Holder Representative. Each Holder by
accepting the CVR, including any permitted transferee, acknowledges  and
agrees to the terms and conditions of this Section 10.1.

 


 

 

(b) Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary herein, any action that may be
taken by the Holder Representative (including the making of any consents or
other agreements) under this CVR Agreement may instead by taken by the
Majority Holders and in such case Parent  shall be entitled to conclusively
rely on the agreement or consent of the Majority Holders.

[Form of Reverse of CVR Certificate]

 


 

 

1. This CVR Certificate is issued under and in  accordance with the Contingent Value Rights Agreement, dated as of [●] (the " _CVR Agreement_ "), among Parent and [●], a national banking association, as trustee (the " _Trustee_ ," which term includes any successor Trustee under the CVR Agreement), and [●], a [●], as Holder Representative (the " _Holder Representative_ "), and is subject to the terms and provisions contained in the CVR Agreement, to all of which terms and provisions the Holder of this CVR Certificate consents by acceptance hereof. The  CVR Agreement is hereby incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof. Reference is hereby made to the CVR Agreement for a full statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties, obligations and immunities thereunder  of Parent, the Trustee and the Holders of the CVRs. All capitalized terms used in this CVR Certificate without definition shall have the respective meanings ascribed to them in the CVR Agreement. Copies of the CVR Agreement can be obtained by  contacting the Trustee.

 


 

 

2. On each Covered Revenues Payment Date, Parent  shall pay to the Holder hereof, for each CVR represented hereby, a Pro Rata Portion of the Covered Revenues Payment, if any, with respect to the Covered Revenues Measuring Period ended immediately prior to such Covered Revenues Payment Date.

 


 

 

3. In the event of any conflict between this CVR  Certificate and the CVR Agreement, the CVR Agreement shall govern and prevail.

 


 

 

4. Each Covered Revenues Payment, if any, and  interest thereon, if any, shall be payable by Parent in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time is legal tender for the payment of public and private debts; provided, however, Parent may pay such amounts by its  check or wire transfer payable in such money. [TRUSTEE] has been initially appointed as Paying Agent at its office or agency in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York.

 


 

 

5. Except where authorization and/or appearance of  each of the Holders is required by applicable Law, if an Event of Default described above occurs and is continuing, then, and in each and every such case, either the Trustee or the Trustee upon the written request of the Majority Holders by  notice in writing to Parent (and to the Trustee if given by the Majority Holders), shall bring suit to protect the rights of the Holders, including to obtain payment for any amounts then due and payable, which amounts shall bear interest at the  Default Interest Rate until payment is made to the Trustee.

 


 

 

6. The CVRs may not be sold, assigned, transferred,  pledged, encumbered or in any other manner transferred or disposed of, in whole or in part, other than through a Permitted Transfer in compliance with the terms of the CVR Agreement and applicable United States federal and state securities  Laws.

 


 

 

7. As provided in the CVR Agreement and subject to  certain limitations therein set forth, every request made to transfer a CVR must be in writing and accompanied by a written instrument of transfer and other requested documentation in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee and Parent, duly  executed by the Holder thereof, and setting forth in reasonable detail the circumstances relating to the transfer. Upon receipt of such written notice and surrender for registration of transfer of the CVR Certificates, the Trustee shall,  subject to its reasonable determination that the transfer instrument is in proper form, notify Parent that it has received such written notice. Upon receipt of such notice from the Trustee, Parent shall determine whether the transfer otherwise  complies with the other terms and conditions of the CVR Agreement (including the provisions of Section 2.2(c) of the CVR Agreement), and if it determines that it does so comply, Parent shall instruct the Trustee in writing to, and the Trustee  shall, upon surrender for registration of transfer of such CVR Certificate at the Corporate Trust Office, authenticate and deliver,

 


 

 


 

   


 

 


 

 

in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new CVR
Certificates representing the same aggregate number of CVRs represented by the
CVR  Certificate so surrendered that are to be transferred and Parent shall
execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the
transferor, one new CVR Certificate representing the aggregate number of CVRs
represented by such  CVR Certificate that are not to be transferred.

 


 

 

8. At the option of the Holder, CVR Certificates may  be exchanged for other CVR Certificates that represent in the aggregate the same number of CVRs as the CVR Certificates surrendered at the Corporate Trust Office. Every CVR presented or surrendered for exchange shall (if so required by Parent  or the Trustee) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of exchange in form satisfactory to Parent and the Trustee. Whenever any CVR Certificates are so surrendered for exchange, Parent shall execute, and the Trustee shall  authenticate and deliver, the CVR Certificates which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.

 


 

 

9. Parent and the Trustee may require payment of a  sum sufficient to cover any stamp or other Tax or charge that is imposed in connection with any such registration of transfer or exchange as provided for in Sections 2.6(b) and 2.6(c) of the CVR Agreement and described in clauses (7) and (8)  above. The Trustee shall have no duty or obligation to take any action under any section of the CVR Agreement that requires the payment of applicable Taxes or charges unless and until the Trustee is satisfied that all such Taxes or charges have  been paid.

 


 

 

10. All CVRs issued upon any registration of transfer  or exchange of CVRs as provided for in the CVR Agreement shall be the valid obligations of Parent, evidencing the same rights, and entitled to the same benefits under the CVR Agreement, as the CVRs surrendered upon such registration of transfer  or exchange.

 


 

 

11. Neither Parent nor the Trustee has any duty or  obligation to the holder of this CVR Certificate, except as expressly set forth herein or in the CVR Agreement.

 


 

 

12. _Redemption_.

 


 

 

(a) _Notice to Trustee_. If Parent elects to redeem CVRs pursuant to the
optional redemption provisions of Section 9.5 of the CVR Agreement, it shall
furnish to the Trustee, at least forty five (45) days (unless a  shorter
period shall be agreed to by the Trustee) but not more than sixty (60) days
before a redemption date (but in any event prior to the notice provided
pursuant to Section 9.2 of the CVR Agreement), an Officer's Certificate
setting forth  (i) the clause of the CVR Agreement pursuant to which the
redemption shall occur, (ii) the redemption date, (iii) the amount of CVRs to
be redeemed and (iv) the redemption price.

 


 

 

(b) Notice of Redemption. At least thirty (30) days  but not more than sixty
(60) days before a redemption date, Parent shall mail or cause to be mailed,
by first-class mail, a notice of redemption to each Holder whose CVRs are to
be redeemed at its registered address. The notice shall identify  the amount
of CVRs to be redeemed and shall state:

 


 

 

(i) the        redemption date;

 


 

 

(ii) the        redemption price;

 


 

 

(iii) the        name and address of the paying agent;

 


 

 

(iv) that        CVRs called for redemption must be surrendered to the
Paying 
 

 


 

 


 

   


 

 


 

 


  Agent to collect the redemption price;

 


 

 

(v) that,        unless Parent defaults in making such redemption
payment, all right title and interest in and to the CVRs and any Covered
Revenues Payment or any other amounts due under this CVR Agreement, if any, on
CVRs called for redemption ceases to accrue  on and after the redemption
date;

 


 

 

(vi) the        clause of this CVR Agreement pursuant to which the CVRs
called for redemption are being redeemed; and

 


 

 

(vii) that        no representation is made as to the correctness or
accuracy of the CUSIP and ISIN number, if any, listed in such notice or
printed on the CVRs.

 


 

 

At Parent's request, the Trustee shall give the notice of redemption in
Parent's name and at its expense; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall
have delivered to the Trustee at least forty five (45) days (unless a shorter
period shall be agreed to by  the Trustee) but not more than sixty (60) days
prior to the redemption date, an Officer's Certificate requesting that the
Trustee give such notice and setting forth the information to be stated in
such notice as provided in the preceding  paragraph.

 


 

 

(c) _Effect of Notice of Redemption_. Once notice of redemption is mailed in
accordance with Section 9.2 of the CVR Agreement, CVRs called for redemption
shall become irrevocably due and payable on the redemption date at  the
redemption price. A notice of redemption shall be deemed to be given when
mailed, whether or not the Holder receives the notice. In any event, failure
to give such notice, or any defect in such notice, shall not affect the
validity of the  proceedings for the redemption of the CVRs held by Holders
to whom such notice was properly given.

 


 

 

(d) _Deposit of Redemption Price_. On or one (1) Business Day prior to the
redemption date, Parent shall deposit with the Trustee or with the Paying
Agent (if different from the Trustee) money sufficient to pay the  redemption
price of all CVRs to be redeemed on that date. The Trustee or the paying agent
shall promptly return to Parent any money deposited with the Trustee or the
paying agent by Parent in excess of the amounts necessary to pay the 
redemption price of all CVRs to be redeemed.

 


 

 

If Parent complies with the provisions of the preceding paragraph, on and
after the redemption or purchase date, as applicable, all right title and
interest of a  Holder to any Covered Revenues Payment, if any, shall cease to
accrue on the CVRs called for redemption or subject to purchase. If any CVR
called for redemption or subject to purchase shall not be so paid upon
surrender for redemption or purchase  because of the failure of Parent to
comply with the preceding paragraph, interest shall be paid on the unpaid
redemption price from the redemption date or purchase date, as applicable,
until such redemption price is paid at the Default Interest  Rate.

 


 

 

(e) _Optional Redemption by Parent_. Parent may, at any time on and after the
Redemption Eligibility Date, redeem all (but not less than all) of the
outstanding CVRs at a cash redemption price equal to the Redemption  Price.

 


 

 

13\. The Holders, including any permitted transferee, (by their acceptance of
this CVR hereby) shall be deemed to have acknowledged the rights and 
privileges of the Holder Representative set forth in the CVR Agreement.

(e) _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including any Schedules hereto) and
the Merger Agreement constitute  the entire agreement, and supersedes all
other prior agreements, understandings, representations and warranties both
written and oral, among the parties hereto, with respect to the subject matter
hereof.

 


 

 

(f) _Parties in Interest; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Subject to Section
20(i), and without relieving any  party of any obligation hereunder, this
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. This Agreement
is not intended to, and does not, confer upon  any Person other than the
parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder.

 


 

   


 

 

(g) _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable
and the invalidity or  unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any provision of
this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any circumstance,
is invalid or unenforceable,  (i) a suitable and equitable provision
negotiated in good faith by the parties hereto shall be substituted therefor
in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and
purpose of such invalid or unenforceable  provision and (ii) the remainder of
this Agreement and the application of such provision to other Persons or
circumstances shall not, subject to clause (i) above, be affected by such
invalidity or unenforceability, except as a result of such  substitution, nor
shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity or
enforceability of such provision, or the application thereof, in any other
jurisdiction.

 


 

 

(h) _Interpretation_.

 


 

 

(i) The Section headings or captions  herein are for convenience of reference
only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to
limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. Where a reference in
this Agreement is made to a Section or Schedule,  such reference shall be to
a Section of or Schedule to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated.
Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in this
Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without 
limitation". The words "hereof", "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar
import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole
and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. The word "or" when used
in  this Agreement is not exclusive. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the
extent" shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and
such phrase shall not mean simply "if". All terms defined in this Agreement
shall have the  defined meanings when used in any certificate or other
document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined therein.
The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as
well as the plural forms of  such terms and to the masculine as well as to
the feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any statute defined or referred
to herein means such statute as from time to time amended, modified or
supplemented, including by succession of  comparable successor statutes. Any
agreement or instrument defined or referred to herein includes all attachments
thereto and instruments incorporated therein.

 


 

 

(ii) The parties have participated  jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties, and no presumption or burden of  proof shall arise favoring
or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement.

 


 

 

(i) _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation of law
or otherwise without the prior  written consent of each of the parties. Any
purported assignment in contravention of the preceding sentence shall be null
and void.

 


 

   


 

 

(j) _Expenses_. All costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such cost or expense, whether
or not the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement or the Merger
Agreement are consummated.

 


 

 

(k) _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that
irreparable damage would occur and  that the parties would not have any
adequate remedy at law if any provision of this Agreement were not performed
in accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that
monetary damages, even if available, would not be an  adequate remedy
therefor. It is accordingly agreed that Parent shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof in any  court
referred to in Section 20(c), without proof of actual damages (and each party
hereby waives any requirement for the security or posting of any bond in
connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to
which  they are entitled at law or in equity. The parties further agree not
to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is an unenforceable, invalid,
contrary to applicable Law or inequitable remedy for any reason, and not to
assert that a  remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy
for any such breach or that Parent otherwise has an adequate remedy at law.
