POST COMPLETION MATTERS 

| 
---|--- 

10.1.

|

Each Seller agrees in respect only of itself that the Seller shall, for so
long as the Seller remains the registered holder of any of the Relevant Shares
after Completion, hold those Relevant Shares with all rights and benefits
attaching or accruing to them on or after the date of this Agreement as bare
trustee for the Buyer absolutely. 

| 
---|--- 

10.2.

|

For a period of [***] after Completion each Seller hereby irrevocably
undertakes to the Buyer pending registration by the Company of the transfer of
the Seller's Relevant Shares to the Buyer, to exercise any votes attaching to
any of the Seller's Relevant Shares or sign any consent to short notice of a
general meeting (or written resolution in lieu thereof) as the Buyer may
reasonably direct. 

| 
---|--- 

10.3.

|

Each Seller acting severally shall execute and shall procure the execution of,
all documents and deeds and/or do or procure the doing of, all acts and things
that the Buyer reasonably requires after Completion to vest in the Buyer legal
title to and the full benefit of the Relevant Shares held by such Seller. 

| 
---|--- 

10.4.

|

Subject to clause 10.5, each of the Sellers (for itself and for and on behalf
of each of its Affiliates) hereby irrevocably agrees that, with effect from
and conditional upon Completion: 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

the Shareholder Arrangements are hereby terminated; 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

any and all rights of any Seller and/or any of its Affiliates and any and all
obligations of the Company under, pursuant to or in connection with the
Shareholder Arrangements, along with any other claim or demand of any Seller
or any of its Affiliates against the Company, which are subsisting or
outstanding at the date of this Agreement are expressly waived and released,
including any and all such rights and obligations, claims and demands which
may have accrued in respect of any period prior to Completion; and 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

any and all other debts or liabilities (whether actual, contingent or
prospective and including any interest thereon) of the Company to any Seller
under, pursuant to or in connection with the Shareholder Arrangements or
otherwise which are subsisting or outstanding at the date of this Agreement
are expressly waived, released and discharged. 

| 
---|--- 

10.5.

|

Each Seller shall ensure that at Completion there will be no amounts owing by
the Company to such Seller in respect of itself and its Affiliates only, other
than by way of accrued but unpaid salary or consultancy fees or unreimbursed
expenses incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice owed to employees or consultants of the Company.

10.6.

|

The Buyer shall, within 20 Business Days of Completion, procure that the name
of the Company is changed to such name as the Buyer may decide provided that
it does not include the word "F-star". 

| 
---|--- 

10.7.

|

The Buyer intends to make an election under Section 338(g) of the United
States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "IRC") (and any
corresponding election under state and local Tax law) with respect to the
purchase of the Shares under this Agreement (collectively, the "Section 338
Election"). The Buyer may make the Section 338 Election in its sole
discretion; provided, however, that the Sellers shall not be liable in respect
of a Tax Warranty Claim for any liability of the Company for Taxes arising
directly or indirectly from the Section 338 Election and the Buyer shall
indemnify the Sellers and the Company on an after-Tax basis against any Tax
liability, losses and all reasonable costs and expenses of the Sellers or the
Company which arise directly or indirectly as a result of the Section 338
Election being made excluding any Tax liability, losses or costs and expenses
that would have not have arisen had all of the Tax Warranties made by the
Company and Sellers been true, correct and complete. In addition, in the case
of any Seller, the calculation of any increase in Tax liability of such Seller
resulting from the Section 338 Election shall be made assuming (a) that such
Seller and any of its direct or indirect owners has made a timely and valid
election under Section 1295 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "Code") and the regulations thereunder to treat its shares in the
Company as a "qualified electing fund" within the meaning of Section 1295
effective with the first day of such Seller's holding period in the Company's
shares and (b) that the Company is not, and has not at any time during the
five (5) taxable years preceding the Completion Date, been a "controlled
foreign corporation" within the meaning of Section 957 of the IRC. For
clarify, Purchaser shall not be required under this Section 10.7 to indemnify
the Company or any Seller for any Tax liability that would not have arisen had
a Seller (or its direct or indirect owners) elected to treat the Company as a
qualified electing fund and/or had the Company not been a controlled foreign
corporation, as described in the previous sentence.

(b)

provision, might operate to exonerate or discharge the Buyer or otherwise
reduce or extinguish its liability under this guarantee. 

|

11.5.

Any release, discharge or settlement between the Buyer and F-star in relation
to this guarantee shall be conditional on no right, disposition or payment to

provided in or contemplated by this Agreement and each agreement and document
ancillary thereto to be performed by such Seller or the Sellers'

| 
---|--- 

12.2.

|

Each Seller hereby irrevocably (by way of security for the performance of his
obligations under this Agreement) appoints the Sellers' Representative as its
agent with full authority on his behalf and in the Seller's name, as
applicable, or otherwise, to do all acts and to execute and deliver such
documents or deeds as are required by law or as may, in the reasonable opinion
of the Sellers' Representative, be required or convenient to give effect to
the matters described in clause 12.1.

The Sellers' Representative shall act in good faith in accordance with what
the Sellers' Representative believes to be the best interests of the Sellers

---|--- 

12.4.

|

Save in the event of fraud, any action undertaken or omitted by the Sellers'

provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, such approval shall not be

| 
---|---

The Sellers' Representative may resign at any time. The Sellers'
Representative may consult with any Seller to the extent a claim is threatened

undertakes to do all such things as may be necessary to novate the Escrow

|

|

Any action taken or any exercise of powers under this Agreement by the

of any nature whatsoever, of the Sellers' Representative shall be borne by the
Sellers in the proportions set out in column D of the table in Schedule 1 (The
Sellers). 

| 
---|--- 

12.11.

|

The Sellers' Representative shall have no liability or obligation to take any
action on behalf of any Seller under the powers and authorities conferred on
the Sellers' Representative by this Agreement where such action may result in
the Sellers' Representative incurring any cost, expense or liability unless
the Sellers' Representative is satisfied with any arrangements made by (or on
behalf of) the Sellers for the satisfaction or re-imbursement of such costs,
expenses and liabilities.

Upon Completion, and subject to receipt by the Sellers' Representative of the
cash sum provided for in clause 3.3(a), the Sellers' Representative will
retain an amount of [***] from such sum (the "Expense Fund"), which will be
used for the purposes of paying directly, or reimbursing the Sellers'
Representative for, any third party expenses pursuant to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby. The Sellers will not receive any
interest or earnings on the Expense Fund and irrevocably transfer and assign
to the Sellers' Representative any ownership right that they may otherwise
have had in any such interest or earnings. The Sellers' Representative will
not be liable for any loss of principal of the Expense Fund other than as a
result of its gross negligence or wilful misconduct. The Sellers'
Representative will hold these funds separate from its corporate funds in a
segregated client account, will not use these funds for its operating expenses
or any other corporate purposes and will not voluntarily make these funds
available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy. As soon as practicable
following the completion of the Sellers' Representative's responsibilities,

to the Payments Administrator for further distribution to the Sellers. For tax
purposes, the Expense Fund shall be treated as having been received and
voluntarily set aside by the Sellers at the time of Completion. The parties
agree that the Sellers' Representative is not responsible for any tax
withholding or reporting or acting as a withholding agent or in any similar
capacity in connection with the Expense Fund.

|

12.13.

|

The Sellers' Representative will incur no liability of any kind with respect
to any action or omission by the Sellers' Representative in connection with
Sellers' Representative's services pursuant to this Agreement and any
agreements ancillary hereto, except in the event of liability directly
resulting from the Sellers' Representative's gross negligence or wilful
misconduct. The Sellers' Representative shall not be liable to any Seller as a
result of any action or omission that is taken (or not taken) in good faith
pursuant to the advice of external legal counsel in the proper performance of
its obligations under this Agreement. The Sellers will, severally and not
jointly, on a pro rata basis equal to the portion of Total Consideration each
such Seller is entitled to receive pursuant to this Agreement compared to the
aggregate Total Consideration entitled to be received by all Sellers,
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Sellers' Representative from and
against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, claims, penalties, fines,
forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and expenses (including the fees and
expenses of counsel and experts and their staffs and all expense of document
location, duplication and shipment) (collectively, "Representative Losses")
arising out of or in connection with the Sellers' Representative's execution
and performance of this Agreement and any agreements ancillary hereto, in each
case as such Representative Loss is suffered or incurred; provided, that in
the event that any such Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to have
been directly caused by the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of the
Sellers' Representative, the Sellers' Representative will reimburse the
Sellers the amount of such Representative Loss to the extent attributable to
such gross negligence or wilful misconduct. If not paid directly to the
Sellers' Representative by the Sellers, any such indemnified Representative
Losses may be recovered by the Sellers' Representative from (i) the funds in
the Expense Fund, (ii) the amounts in the Escrow Amount at such time as
remaining amounts would otherwise be distributable to the Sellers, and (iii)
from any Milestone Payments at such time as any such amounts would otherwise
be distributable to the Sellers; provided, that while this section allows the
Sellers' Representative to be paid from the Expense Fund, the Escrow Amount
and the Milestone Payments, this does not relieve the Sellers from their
obligation to promptly pay such Representative Losses as they are suffered or
incurred, nor does it prevent the Sellers' Representative from seeking any
remedies available to it at law or otherwise. In no event will the Sellers'
Representative be required to advance its own funds on behalf of the Sellers
or otherwise. For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the limitations on liability of the Sellers set
forth elsewhere in this Agreement are not intended to be applicable

Part D: Preparation of Management Accounts 

--- 

1\. ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

a. PRESENTATION OF MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTS 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY 

In the application of the Company\'s accounting policies, management make
judgments, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates
and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other
factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from
these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period of the revision
and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. 

--- 

b. OVERALL CONSIDERATIONS

The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the management
accounts are set out below. 

i. BASIS OF PREPARATION OF MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTS 

These management accounts have been prepared in accordance with EU endorsed
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and interpretations issued
by the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) and the Companies Act 2006
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The management accounts have
been prepared under the historical cost convention.

| 
---|--- 

ii.

|

GOING CONCERN 

Management prepare management accounts on a going concern basis unless they
intend to liquidate the business or to cease trading, or have no realistic
alternative but to do so. In deciding whether the going concern basis is
appropriate, the directors examine existing budgets and forecasts, assess
borrowing requirements, and review other information as needed. 

--- 

iii. NEW AND AMENDED STANDARDS ADOPTED BY THE COMPANY 

In any period, new or amended standards and interpretations are considered for
adoption. Other standards, amendments and interpretations which are effective
for the period are considered where they material to the Company.




 

--- 
| | 

CONFIDENTIAL

|

 

--- 

c. RECEIVABLES 

Receivables are recognised initially at fair value less provision for
impairment. The Company provides an allowance for uncollectible accounts based
on prior experience and management's assessment of the collectability of
existing specific accounts.

| 
---|--- 

d.

|

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 

Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash on hand and demand deposits, and
other short‑term and highly liquid investments with original maturities of
three months or less that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash
and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. 

--- 

e. EQUITY AND RESERVES 

 

Ordinary and preferred shares are classified as equity. Issued capital
represents the nominal value of shares that have been issued. Retained
earnings includes all current period retained profits and accumulated losses.



| 
---|--- 

f.

|

TRADE PAYABLES 

Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been
acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. Trade and other
payables are stated at cost, which approximates fair value due to the short
term nature of these liabilities. Trade payables are classified as current
liabilities if payment is due within one period or less. If not, they are
presented as non-current liabilities.



| 
---|--- 

g.

|

REVENUE RECOGNITION 

 

Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or
receivable and is stated net of value added taxes. Revenue is recognised when
it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Company and
those benefits can be measured reliably. Revenue on the sale of an asset (e.g.
the outright sale or assignment of a licence) is only recognised when, inter
alia, the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to
the buyer and the Company does not retain either control of the goods, or
continuing involvement, to the degree associated with ownership.

Where, as part of a licence agreement, services are performed by an
indeterminate number of acts over a specified period of time, revenue for such
services is recognised on a straight-line basis over the specified period
unless there is evidence that some other method represents better the stage of
completion.

h. SHARE BASED PAYMENTS




 

--- 
| | 

CONFIDENTIAL

|


A share option compensation charge is not recognised in the monthly management
accounts.



| 
---|--- 

i.

|

TAXATION AND DEFERRED TAX 

A tax credit or charge is not reflected in the monthly management accounts.

Deferred tax is not reflected in the monthly management accounts.

| 
---|--- 

j.

|

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 

| 
---|--- 

i.

|

FINANCIAL ASSETS 

All financial assets relate to trade and other receivables, which are stated
at their recoverable amount, which approximates the fair value due to the
short term nature of these assets. 

--- 

ii. RISK MANAGEMENT POLICY 

The Company undertakes transactions denominated in foreign currencies and as
such is exposed to currency risk due to fluctuations in foreign exchange
rates. The Company does not use derivative instruments to reduce exposure to
foreign exchange risk. 

--- 

iii. FINANCIAL LIABILITIES 

Trade and other payables are stated at cost. This approximates fair value due
to the short term nature of these liabilities.

| 
---|--- 

k.

|

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION 

Foreign currency transactions are translated at the rates of exchange in
effect at the dates of the transaction. Resulting foreign currency denominated
monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange in
effect at the balance sheet date. Gains and losses on foreign exchange are
recognised in the income statement.

If in connection with a payment of Contingent Consideration that has become

permitted under paragraph 11.1 above, the Buyer shall, within three (3)

Sellers' Representative and each Warrantor a notice in writing (a "Set Off
Notice") of such Claim, which Set Off Notice shall state in reasonable detail
the nature of the Claim, the grounds on which it is based (including which
Warranty has or Warranties have been breached) and a good faith estimate of
the amount claimed (the "Set Off Claim"). If the Sellers' Representative
wishes to dispute the Set Off Claim on behalf of the Sellers or any Seller, it
may, within twenty (20) Business Days of receipt of the Set Off Notice,
indicate the same by written notice to the Buyer (the "Set Off Dispute
Notice") which also shall state in reasonable the basis for the Sellers'
Representative's dispute and the grounds on which it is based, in which case,
either the Buyer or the Sellers' Representative may then elect to initiate an

---|--- 

13.1.

|

The provisions of this paragraph 13 shall apply in the event that any third
party brings or makes (or threatens to bring or make) any claim, demand,
action or proceedings against any of the Buyer or a Buyer's Group Undertaking
which may reasonably be considered likely to give rise to a Claim (a "Third
Party Claim").

keep the Sellers reasonably informed (through the Sellers' Representative) of
the progress of, and all material developments in relation to, the Third Party
Claim; 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

provide the Sellers' Representative with copies of all material information
and correspondence relating to the Third Party Claim; and 

|

give (and cause each relevant Buyer's Group Undertaking to give) the Sellers'
Representative and/or its professional advisers access at reasonable times
(and on reasonable prior notice) to its premises and personnel, and to any
relevant assets, accounts, documents or records within its control, for the
purposes of enabling the Sellers to assess the Third Party Claim and to
exercise their rights under this paragraph 13.2. 

| 
---|--- 

13.3.

|

The Buyer shall have the right in its sole discretion to conduct the defence
of and to settle or resolve such Third-Party Claim. However, without the prior
written consent of the Sellers' Representative, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned [***]. In the event that the
Sellers' Representative has consented in writing [***], neither the Sellers'
Representative nor any Seller shall have any power or authority to object
[***]. 

| 
---|--- 

13.4.

|

The Sellers shall indemnify the Buyer in respect of all costs, charges and
expenses that are reasonably and properly incurred by the Buyer (or any other
member of the Buyer's Group) in connection with the defence of a Third Party
Claim.

of the Sellers under this Agreement or grant any time or indulgence to that
Seller without affecting the liability of any other Seller.

| 
---|--- 

17.

|

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES 

If any potential Claim arises as a result of a contingent or unquantifiable
liability of any Buyer's Group Undertaking, each Seller will not be obliged to
pay any sum in respect of the potential Claim until the liability either
ceases to be contingent or becomes quantifiable; provided, however, that this
paragraph 17 shall not restrict the Buyer from setting off and deducting the
Buyer's reasonable estimate of any such potential Claim from Contingent
Consideration, as permitted by paragraph 11.
