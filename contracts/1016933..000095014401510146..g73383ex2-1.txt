Section 6.3(l) is satisfied, RandG; shall issue the RandG; Debenture to the LLC
and RandG; shall make all required payments under the RandG; Debenture to the
LLC, which in turn shall distribute such payments to its members. To the
extent that the condition set forth in Section 6.3(l) is not satisfied, RandG;
will take the actions specified in Section 2.7(c) hereof with respect to the
RandG; Debenture. Group has Previously Disclosed each person\'s pro rata

Time, any holder has not satisfied the requirements of Section 2.7 (a)(1),
RandG; and Holdings shall distribute the Merger Consideration to which those
holders not satisfying such requirements are entitled in accordance with the
requirements of Section 2.7(b) hereof.   (b) Subject to Sections 2.7(a) and

Group Common Stock, a letter of transmittal and instructions for use in

promptly cause to be issued to such persons entitled thereto a check and,
subject to Section 6.3(l) hereto, to the LLC, an RandG; Debenture, in each
case, in the amount to which such persons are entitled (which shall be
determined based upon each person\'s pro rata holdings of Group Common Stock
which has been Previously Disclosed by Group and the Bank), after giving
effect to any required tax withholdings. If payment of the Merger
Consideration is to be made to a person other than the registered holder of
the Group Certificate(s) surrendered, it shall be a condition of such payment
that the Group Certificate(s) so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such
payment shall pay any transfer or other    8     taxes required by
reason of the payment to a person other than the registered holder of the
Group Certificate(s) surrendered or established to the satisfaction of RandG;
or Holdings that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.   (c) To the
extent that the condition set forth in Section 6.3(l) is not satisfied, at
the Effective Time, RandG; shall issue the RandG; Debenture to an exchange agent
selected by RandG; ("Exchange Agent") in trust to be held for the exclusive
benefit of the holders of Group Common Stock entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration. Under such circumstances, RandG; shall make all
required payments under the RandG; Debenture to the Exchange Agent, which will

entitled thereto.  2.8 DISSENTING SHARES   Each outstanding share of
Group Common Stock, the holder of which has perfected his right to dissent
under Section 607.1302 of the FBCA and has not effectively withdrawn or lost
such right as of the Effective Time (the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be
converted into or represent a right to receive the Merger Consideration
hereunder and the holder thereof shall be entitled only to such rights as are
granted by Section 607.1302 of the FBCA. If any holder of Dissenting Shares
shall fail to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost the right
to dissent, the Dissenting Shares held by such holder shall thereupon be
treated as though such Dissenting Shares had been converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with the applicable provisions
of this Agreement. Group shall give RandG; prompt notice upon receipt by Group
of any such written demands for payment of the fair value of shares of Group
Common Stock and of withdrawals of such demands and any other

vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in the Surviving

properties or assets of Group acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving
Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger, or (ii)
otherwise carry out the purposes of this Agreement, each of the Group and its

of such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation and

quarter of each calendar year ending December 31), (i) Group and Bank will

to the provisions of this Section 5.8, all employees of Group and the Bank

or the Bank immediately following the Effective Time ("Transferred
Employees") will either (i) continue to be covered by Group\'s or the Bank\'s
employee benefit plans or (ii) be covered by the employee benefit plans of
RandG; or its Subsidiaries in a manner which compares with the
employee benefits previously provided to the Transferred Employees by Group
and the Bank. Notwithstanding the foregoing, RandG; may determine to terminate
any of Group\'s or the Bank\'s employee benefit plans, or to merge any such
employee benefit plan with the benefit plans of RandG; and/or its Subsidiaries,
provided the result is the provision of benefits to Transferred Employees

and the Bank. Except as specifically provided in this Section 5.8 and as
otherwise prohibited by law, Transferred Employees\' service with Group or
the Bank shall be recognized as service with RandG; or its Subsidiaries for
purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting, if applicable (but not
for    34      purposes of benefit accrual) under the benefit plans
of RandG; and/or its Subsidiaries subject to applicable break-in-service
rules.   (b) RandG; and Holdings anticipate that most employees of Group
and the Bank as of the Effective Time shall continue as employees of the
Bank following the Effective Time, provided that RandG; and Holdings shall have
no obligation to continue the employment of any such person and nothing
contained in this Agreement shall give any employee of Group or the Bank a
right to continuing employment with the Bank following the Effective
Time.  5.9 INDEMNIFICATION   From and after the Effective Time through the
third anniversary of the Effective Time, RandG; (the "Indemnifying Party"),

employee of Group and the Bank, determined as of the Effective Time (the
"Indemnified Parties"), against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time,
only and to the fullest extent to which Group and the Bank is or was required
by law or their Bylaws to indemnify such Indemnified Parties and in the
manner to which it could indemnify such parties under the Bylaws of Group or
the Bank, as in effect on the date hereof; provided, however, that the
Indemnifying Party shall maintain directors\' and officers\'
insurance coverage for three years of not less than $3,000,000 for the
benefit of the Indemnified Parties.  5.10 ADDITIONAL COVENANTS   (a)

other party pursuant hereto with respect to any matter hereafter
arising which, if existing, occurring or known at the date of this Agreement,
would have been required to be set forth or described in materials Previously
Disclosed to the other party or which is necessary to correct any information
in such materials which has been rendered inaccurate thereby; no such
supplement or amendment to such    35     materials shall be deemed
to have modified the representations, warranties and covenants of a party for
the purposes of determining whether the conditions set forth in Article VI
hereof have been satisfied.  5.12 FAILURE TO FULFILL CONDITIONS   In the
event that any of the parties hereto determines that a condition to its
respective obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby cannot be fulfilled on or prior to the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.1 hereof, it will promptly notify the other party or
parties. Each party will promptly inform the other party or parties of any
facts applicable to it that would be likely to prevent or materially delay
approval of the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby by any
Governmental Entity or third party or which would otherwise prevent or
materially delay completion of the Merger and the transactions contemplated
hereby.  5.13 CERTAIN ADDITIONAL ACTION   (a) Prior to the Effective Time,
Group shall cause to be transferred to the LLC the assets identified in
Schedule 5.13(a) hereto. Concurrent with such transfer, Group shall cause the
LLC to execute and deliver to RandG; the Indemnification Letter the form which
is set forth as Exhibit J hereto.   (b) Prior to the Effective Time, Group
shall caused to be sold for cash the assets identified in Schedule 5.13(b)
hereto. To the extent that, as of the Effective Time, the condition set forth
in Section 6.3 (k) is satisfied, RandG; or Group shall distribute to the LLC on
behalf of the holders of Group Common Stock any cash held by Group in excess
of Twelve Million Dollars ($12,000,000). The LLC agrees to indemnify RandG; and
Group for any Tax imposed in connection with the sales contemplated by this
Section 5.13(b), which may be satisfied by any amounts due to the LLC
pursuant to Section 5.13(c) hereof.   (c) It is expected that Group will
write-down the value of its investment in Fortune Financial, Inc. ("FFI") for
both accounting and Tax purposes as of December 31, 2001. Group expects that
the amount of such write-down for federal income Tax purposes will equal or
exceed that amount which, if such write-down had not occurred, would have
been its taxable income for purposes of computing its federal income Tax
liability for the year ended December 31, 2001. RandG; agrees to pay (the
"Initial Additional Payment"), an amount equal to (x) the excess of (A)
Group\'s federal income Tax liability for the year ended December 31, 2001
computed as if Group had not written-down the value of its investment in FFI
over (B) Group\'s federal income Tax liability for the year ended December
31, 2001 as actually computed, reduced by (y) any Tax cost to Group or RandG;
resulting from such write-down plus the reasonable costs and expenses
incurred in the analysis and preparation of requirements of this Section
5.13(c). The Initial Additional Payment, if any, shall be due and shall be
payable to the LLC on behalf of the holders of Group Common Stock
promptly after Group\'s federal income Tax Return for the year ended December
31, 2001 is filed. In addition, RandG; agrees to make as an additional payment
(a "Subsequent Additional Payment"), an amount equal to any refund of federal
income Tax actually realized by Group with respect to Tax years of Group
ending prior to December 31, 2001 that is realized due to a carryback of any
portion of the write-down of FFI. Any Subsequent Additional Payment shall be
due and payable to the LLC on behalf of the holders of Group Common Stock
promptly upon receipt of such refund. The computation and determination of
the Initial Additional Payment and any Subsequent Additional Payment shall
be    36     made solely by RandG; in good faith, which such
determination shall be final absent manifest error, provided that upon
request from the LLC, RandG; agrees that it will make available to the LLC the
method of making such computation and determination, provided further that
nothing in this Agreement shall require RandG; to make available its or any of
its affiliates\' Tax Returns to the LLC. If, subsequent to the payment of the
Initial Additional Amount or any Subsequent Additional Amount, any portion of
the write-down is successfully challenged by the IRS (which such challenge
shall be controlled by RandG;), the LLC shall pay to RandG; an amount, computed
on an after-tax basis, equal to the sum of (x) the amount of any Tax assessed
as a result of such challenge, including any interest and penalties thereon,
plus (y) the reasonable costs and expenses (including attorney\'s fees)
incurred in connection with such challenge; provided, however, that RandG;
shall consult with the LLC prior to taking any action in response to such
challenge.   ARTICLE VI   CONDITIONS PRECEDENT  6.1 CONDITIONS PRECEDENT

manner which does not satisfy the requirements of Section 6.1(b) hereof, and

seeking to terminate to perform or observe in any material respect
its agreements set forth herein to be performed or observed by such party at
or before the Effective Time;   (d) by any party hereto in writing, if the
Effective Time has not occurred by the close of business on June 30, 2002,

cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement to be consummated by such date; or   (e) by the Board of
Directors of RandG; and Holdings, (i) at any time on or prior to January 31,
2002 if the results of RandG;\'s investigation of the business, operations,
assets, liabilities, prospects, affairs and condition (financial or

Adverse Effect on Group and the Bank considered as one enterprise, (ii) at
any time if the Valuation Analysis of Bank\'s mortgage servicing
portfolio delivered pursuant to Section 5.6(e) hereof demonstrates an
impairment of the value of such mortgage servicing portfolio which is greater

contemplated hereby pursuant to Section 5.2 hereof or (iv) if any party to
the Stockholder Agreement shall have failed to deliver his or its consent to

Financial Corporation RandG; Plaza 280 Jesus T. Pinero Avenue San Juan,
Puerto Rico 00918  Gentlemen:   The undersigned, a director or executive
officer or stockholder of The Crown Group, Inc. ("Group") or Crown Bank, a
Federal Savings Bank ("Bank") understands that RandG; Financial Corporation
("RandG;") and RandG; Acquisition Holdings Corporation ("Holdings") are about to
enter into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the "Agreement") with
Group and Bank. The Agreement provides for the merger of Holdings with and
into Group and the related conversion of all of the outstanding common stock
of Group into the Merger Consideration set forth in the Agreement.   In
order to induce RandG; and Holdings to enter into the Agreement, and intending
to be legally bound hereby, the undersigned represents, warrants and agrees
that in connection with the solicitation of Group shareholder
consents contemplated by Section 5.2 of the Agreement, the undersigned will
provide a written consent to and approval of the Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby with respect to the shares of Group Common
Stock beneficially owned by the undersigned individually or, to the extent of
the undersigned\'s proportionate voting interest, jointly with other persons,
as well as (to the extent of the undersigned\'s proportionate voting
interest) any other shares of Group Common Stock over which the undersigned
may hereafter acquire beneficial ownership (collectively, the "Shares").
Subject to the final paragraph of this agreement, the undersigned further
agrees that he will use his best efforts to cause a consent to and approval
of the Agreement and the transactions referenced therein to be provided with
respect to any other shares of Group Common Stock over which he has or shares
voting power.   The undersigned represents and warrants that he has or
shares the beneficial ownership of the number of shares of Group Common Stock
set forth at the bottom hereof.   The undersigned further represents,
warrants and agrees that until the earlier of (i) the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Agreement or (ii) the termination of the
Agreement in accordance with its terms, the undersigned will not, directly or
indirectly:   (a) vote any of the Shares or provide a consent with respect
to such Shares, or cause or permit any of the Shares to be voted or consented
to, in favor of any other merger, consolidation, plan of liquidation, sale
of assets, reclassification or other transaction involving Group or the Bank
which would have the effect of any person, other than RandG; or an affiliate of
RandG;, acquiring control over Group or the Bank or any substantial portion of
the assets of Group    A-1     or the Bank. As used herein, the term
"control" means (1) the ability to direct the voting of 10% or more of the
outstanding voting securities of a person having ordinary voting power in the
election of directors or in the election of any other body having similar
functions or (2) the ability to direct the management and policies of a
person, whether through ownership of securities, through any contract,
arrangement or understanding or otherwise.   (b) sell or otherwise transfer
any of the Shares, or cause or permit any of the Shares to be sold or
otherwise transferred (i) pursuant to any tender offer, exchange offer or
similar proposal made by any person, other than RandG; or an affiliate of RandG;,
(ii) to any person known by the undersigned to be seeking to obtain control
of Group or the Bank or any substantial portion of the assets of Group or the
Bank or to any other person, other than RandG; or an affiliate of RandG;, under
circumstances where such sale or transfer may reasonably be expected to
assist a person seeking to obtain such control or (iii) for the principal
purpose of avoiding the obligations of the undersigned under
this agreement.   It is understood and agreed that this agreement relates
solely to the capacity of the undersigned as a shareholder or other
beneficial owner of the Shares and, to the extent applicable, is not in any
way intended to affect the exercise by the undersigned of the undersigned\'s
responsibilities as a director or officer of Group or Bank. It is further
understood and agreed that this agreement is not in any way intended to
affect the exercise by the undersigned of any fiduciary responsibility which
the undersigned may have in respect of any Shares as of the date hereof.  
Use of the masculine gender herein shall be considered to represent
the masculine, feminine or neuter gender whenever appropriate.    Very

Avenue San Juan, Puerto Rico 000918  Gentlemen:  The undersigned, the
_____________ of Cresleigh Bancorp, LLC ("Cresleigh") understands that RandG;
Financial Corporation ("RandG;") and RandG; Acquisition Holdings Corporation
("Holdings") have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the
"Agreement") with The Crown Group, Inc. ("Group") and Crown Bank, a Federal
Savings Bank ("Bank"). The Agreement provides for the merger of Holdings with
and into Group and the related conversion of all the outstanding common stock
of Group into the Merger Consideration set forth in the Agreement.   1. In
order to induce RandG; and Holdings to enter into the Agreement, and intending
to be legally bound thereby, the undersigned, on behalf of Cresleigh, agrees
for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is
hereby acknowledged, to indemnify and defend RandG;, Holdings, their
subsidiaries and each of their officers, directors, employees and
stockholders (each, an "Indemnitee") against, and hold each
Indemnitee harmless from, any loss, liability, obligation, damage or expense,
including without limitation, attorneys\' fees and disbursements
(collectively, "Damages"), that any Indemnitee may suffer or incur (whether
or not in connection with or incidental to any claim or any Proceeding (as
defined below) by a third party against such Indemnitee) based on or arising
from, any loan transactions involving AABCO Mortgage Loans and Investments,
Inc. ("AABCO") originated after the sale of AABCO by Group to Cresleigh or in
connection with the sale transaction of AABCO by Group to Cresleigh. For
purposes of this letter agreement, "Proceedings" shall mean any lawsuits or
other legal, administrative, arbitration or other proceedings or claims,
actions, disputes, audits, subpoenas or investigations.   2. Promptly after
notice to an Indemnitee of any claim or the commencement of any Proceeding,
including any Proceeding by a third party, involving any Damage referred to
herein, the Indemnitee shall give written notice to Cresleigh of the
commencement of such claim or Proceeding, setting forth in reasonable detail
the nature thereof and the basis upon which such party seeks indemnification
hereunder; provided, however, that the failure of the Indemnitee to give such
notice shall not relieve Cresleigh of its obligations, except to the extent
that is actually prejudiced by the failure to give such notice.   
I-1      3. In the case of any such Proceedings by a third party against
the Indemnitee, Cresleigh shall, upon receipt of notice as provided above,
assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to
the Indemnitee, and, after notice from Cresleigh to the Indemnitee of its
assumption of the defense thereof, shall not be liable to the Indemnitee for
any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee in
connection with the defense thereof (but the Indemnitee shall have the right,
but not the obligation, to participate at its own cost and expense in such
defense by counsel of its own choice) or for any amounts paid or foregone by
the Indemnitee as a result of the settlement or compromise thereof without
the written consent of Cresleigh.   4. Notwithstanding Section 3 hereto, if
both Cresleigh and the Indemnitee are named as parties or subject to such
Proceedings and either such party determines with advice of counsel that
there may be one or more legal defenses available to it that are different
from or additional to those available to the other party or that a material
conflict of interest between such parties may exist in respect of such
Proceedings, then Cresleigh may decline to assume the defense on behalf of
the Indemnitee or the Indemnitee may retain the defense on its own behalf,
and, in either such case, after notice to such effect is duly given hereunder
to the other party, Cresleigh shall be relieved of its obligation to assume
the defense on behalf of the Indemnitee, but shall be required to pay any
legal or other expenses, including without limitation reasonable attorneys\'
fees and disbursements, incurred by the Indemnitee in such defense; provided,
however, that Cresleigh shall not be liable for such expenses on account of
more than one separate firm of attorneys (and, if necessary, local counsel)
at any time representing the Indemnitee in connection with any Proceedings or
separate Proceedings in the same jurisdiction arising out of or based upon
substantially the same allegations or circumstances.   5. If Cresleigh
assumes the defense of any such Proceedings, the Indemnitee shall cooperate
fully in all reasonable respects with Cresleigh and shall appear and give
testimony, produce documents and other tangible evidence, allow Cresleigh
access to the books and records of the Indemnitee and otherwise assist
Cresleigh in conducting such defense. Cresleigh shall not, without the
consent of the Indemnitee (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld),
consent to entry of any judgement or enter into any settlement or compromise
which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the
claimant or plaintiff to the Indemnitee of a release from all liability in
respect to such claim or Proceeding.   6. If Cresleigh shall fail to
promptly and diligently to assume the defense of any Proceeding following
receipt of notice from an Indemnitee as provided in Section 2 above, then the
Indemnitee may respond to, consent and defend against such Proceedings (but
Cresleigh shall have the right to participate at its own cost and expense in
such defense by counsel of its own choice) and may make in good faith any
compromise or settlement with respect thereto, and recover from Cresleigh the
entire cost and expense thereof, including without limitation reasonable
attorneys\' fees and disbursements and all amounts paid or lost directly as a
result of such Proceeding, or the settlement or compromise thereof; provided
that in no event shall Cresleigh be liable or otherwise have any obligation
with respect to any settlement, compromise or determination of any claim
agreed to by the Indemnitee without the prior written consent of Cresleigh
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld). The indemnification required
hereunder shall be made by periodic payments of the amount thereof during the
course of the investigation    I-2    or defense, as and when bills or
invoices are received or loss, liability, obligation, damage or expense is
actually suffered or incurred.   7. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this letter agreement were not performed in accordance with its specific
terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that RandG; and
Holdings shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this letter agreement by Cresleigh and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any
state having competent jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which it is entitled at law or in equity.   8. This Agreement is
to be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. If any provision hereof deemed unenforceable,
the enforceability of the other provisions shall not be affected.    Yours
