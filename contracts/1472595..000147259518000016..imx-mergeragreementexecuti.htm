Satisfaction Date"), or at such other place and time or on such other date as

2.03 Effective Time. In connection with the Closing, the Company and Merger
Sub shall duly execute and file a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of
Merger") in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL. The Merger
shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed

Corporation and applicable Law.

ARTICLE III

EFFECT OF THE MERGER

3.01 Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock and Company Options.

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holder of any shares of Company Common Stock or any shares of
capital stock of Merger Sub:

(i) Each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of Merger Sub shall automatically be converted into and become one
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

(ii) Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by (A) the Company or
(B) any of Parent or Merger Sub (or any of Parent's or Merger Sub's respective
Affiliates) shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.



(iii) Each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock (other than
(A) shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled in accordance with Section
3.01(a)(ii) and (B) the Appraisal Shares (such shares identified in the
immediately preceding clauses (A) and (B), the "Specified Shares")), shall be
converted into, and shall thereafter represent the right of the holder thereof
to receive, subject to Section 3.02(a) and Section 3.08, the Per Share Common
Stock Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, all shares of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired
and shall cease to exist, and each Company Stockholder shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such Company Common Stock except the right to receive
the Per Share Common Stock Merger Consideration.

(iv) Each Company Option issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, at the Effective Time, be cancelled without
consideration and shall have no further force or effect.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares (the
"Appraisal Shares") of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time that are held by any Company Stockholder who is
entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to,
and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the
DGCL ("Section 262") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Per
Share Common Stock Merger Consideration as provided in Section 3.01(a)(iii),
but instead such holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such
shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262\. At the Effective
Time, all Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of
Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the fair value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance
with the provisions of Section 262\. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any
such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose
the right to appraisal under Section 262 or a court of competent jurisdiction
shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by
Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such
holder's Appraisal Shares under Section 262 shall cease and each such
Appraisal Share shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time
into, and shall have become, the right to receive the Per Share Common Stock
Merger Consideration as provided in Section 3.01(a)(iii). The Company shall
deliver prompt written notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any
shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate
in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands; provided,
that, prior to the Closing, the Company and, following the Closing the
Surviving Corporation, shall be entitled to direct and control all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to any demand for appraisal in
accordance with the DGCL, including all hearings and trials before the
Delaware Court of Chancery pursuant to Section 262 and shall keep Parent (for
any such proceedings pre-Closing) or the Securityholder Representative (for
any such proceedings post-Closing), as applicable, informed of the status of
any such negotiations and proceedings; provided, further, that, prior to the
Closing, Parent and the Securityholder Representative shall jointly consent
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to any
payment with respect to, or settlement offer or agreement with respect to, any
such demand or proceeding. Except with the prior written consent of Parent and
the



Securityholder Representative, the Company shall not make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands for appraisal, or
agree to do any of the foregoing.

3.02 Exchange Procedures.

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, the Company shall
mail or cause to be mailed or otherwise delivered to each Company Stockholder
a copy of the stockholders agreement of EMS Parent (the "EMS Stockholders
Agreement") and a Letter of Transmittal, substantially in the form of Exhibit
D attached hereto (the "Letter of Transmittal") which, for the avoidance of
doubt, shall include the obligation of each Company Stockholder to agree to
Section 10.15 of this Agreement, together with any notice required pursuant to
Section 262 and a request to have such Company Stockholder deliver an executed
completed Letter of Transmittal and an executed IRS Form W-9 or appropriate
IRS Form W-8, as applicable, together with any other documentation expressly
required by its terms to be provided in connection with the Letter of
Transmittal, to the Paying Agent. Upon the delivery of a duly executed
counterpart of the EMS Stockholders Agreement and Letter of Transmittal,
together with any other documentation expressly required by its terms to be
provided in connection with the Letter of Transmittal, completed in accordance
with the instructions thereto, each such Company Stockholder shall be entitled
to receive, at or after the Effective Time, subject to the terms and
conditions hereof, the Per Share Common Stock Merger Consideration in respect
of each of its, his or her shares of Company Common Stock (other than
Specified Shares) in accordance with Section 3.01(a)(iii), Section 3.02(b),
and Section 3.06. The Paying Agent and the Company shall provide the
Securityholder Representative and Parent with a copy of each Letter of
Transmittal it receives prior to or as of the Effective Time.

(b) SRS Acquiom shall act, at Parent's expense, as paying agent (the "Paying
Agent") in effecting the exchanges of Company Common Stock provided for herein
pursuant to the Paying Agent Agreement, which will be substantially in the
form attached hereto as Exhibit E, between Parent, the Securityholder
Representative and the Paying Agent (the "Paying Agent Agreement"). Following
delivery of a duly executed Letter of Transmittal in accordance with the
instructions thereto and Section 3.02(a) above and an executed IRS Form W-9 or
appropriate IRS Form W-8, as applicable, each Company Stockholder shall be
entitled to receive (and Parent shall direct the Paying Agent to pay), in
exchange for each share of Company Common Stock such Company Stockholder holds
(other than any Specified Shares), by wire transfer of same day funds (with
respect to any cash proceeds) on the Closing Date (if such Company Stockholder
has delivered such Letter of Transmittal at least three Business Days prior to
the Closing Date) or after the Closing, within three Business Days of receipt
of such Letter of Transmittal, (A) the Per Share Closing Cash Amount and (B)
the Per Share Additional Merger Consideration, if any, at the time of its
distribution pursuant to this Agreement.

3.03 Estimated Cash Merger Consideration; Certain Closing Date Payments.

together with reasonable supporting detail of each of the calculations set
forth in the Estimated Closing Statement. Parent shall be entitled to review
the Estimated Closing Statement prior to the Closing and to submit comments
thereon to the Company. The Company shall consider in good faith any such
comments and may (but is not required to) revise the Estimated Closing
Statement prior to the Closing to reflect such comments. To the extent the
Company does not accept Parent's comments, the Estimated Closing Statement
shall be in the form initially presented to Parent pursuant to this Section
3.03(a). No comments delivered by Parent, or Parent's failure to deliver any
comments, will be deemed to constitute any waiver or release of any of
Parent's rights under this Agreement, including Section 3.06.

(b) Certain Closing Date Payments. In each case subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time:

(i) Parent and R1 shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying
Agent in accordance with the Paying Agent Agreement cash representing the
Estimated Cash Merger Consideration for further payment by the Paying Agent to

Agreement;

(iii) Parent and R1 shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to an account

Business Days prior to the Closing, the Securityholder Representative Expense
Amount in cash, to be held and disbursed in accordance with this Agreement;
and

(iv) The Company shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to each Company
Stockholder the certificates or evidence of book-entry shares representing the
number of shares of capital stock of EMS Parent equal to the Per Share EMS

(c) All consideration paid upon the surrender of Company Common Stock (other
than in respect of the Specified Shares) in accordance with the terms of this
Article III shall be



deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
shares of Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(d) None of Parent, R1, Merger Sub, the Company, the Securityholder
Representative or any other Person shall be liable to any Person in respect of
any cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

3.04 Company Transaction Expenses. Simultaneously with the Closing, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds on behalf of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, Parent and R1 shall pay, or cause to be paid, the
Company Transaction Expenses in accordance with wire transfer instructions
provided by each payee thereof and delivered to Parent by the Company in
writing not less than three Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

3.05 Funded Indebtedness. Simultaneously with the Closing, Parent and R1 shall
(i) repay, or cause to be repaid, on behalf of the Company, the Funded
Indebtedness as set forth on Section 3.05 of the Company Disclosure Schedule
by wire transfer of immediately available funds in accordance with wire
transfer instructions set forth in payoff letters provided to Parent by the
Company and (ii) backstop or provide other necessary credit support with
respect to any outstanding letters of credit. Such payoff letters shall be in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent and shall, among other
things include the payoff amount and provide that Encumbrances (and
guarantees) (other than credit support provided in respect of outstanding
letters of credit), if any, granted in connection therewith shall, upon the
payment of the amount set forth in the applicable payoff letter and the
backstop or provision of other necessary credit support with respect to any
outstanding letters of credit in accordance with clause (ii) above at the
Closing, be released and terminated.

3.06 Post-Closing Determination of Merger Consideration Adjustment;
Transaction Accounting Principles.

(a) Within 90 days after the Closing Date, Parent shall deliver to the
Securityholder Representative (i) an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of
the Company as of the Determination Time, prepared in accordance with GAAP and
utilizing the Transaction Accounting Principles, and (ii) a statement (the
"Closing Statement") setting forth Parent's good faith calculation of the
Company's Working Capital, Indebtedness, Cash and Company Transaction
Expenses, in each case, as of the Determination Time, together with reasonable
supporting detail of each of the calculations set forth in the Closing
Statement.

(b) During the 45 days immediately following the Securityholder
Representative's receipt of the Closing Statement (the "Review Period") and
prior to the appointment of the Referee, the Securityholder Representative and
its Representatives shall be permitted, at reasonable times and following
reasonable advance notice, to review Parent's and R1's working papers and the
working papers of Parent's and R1's independent accountants, if any, relating
to the preparation of the Closing Statement and the calculation of Working
Capital, Indebtedness,



Cash and Company Transaction Expenses therein, as well as the relevant books
and records of the Company, relating to the preparation of the Closing
Statement and the calculation of Working Capital, Indebtedness, Cash and
Company Transaction Expenses therein; provided, however, that the independent
accountants of Parent and R1 shall not be obligated to make any working papers
available to the Securityholder Representative unless and until the
Securityholder Representative has signed a customary confidentiality and hold
harmless agreement relating to such access to working papers in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to such independent accountants. The
Securityholder Representative shall notify Parent in writing (the "Notice of
Disagreement") prior to the expiration of the Review Period if the
Securityholder Representative disagrees with the Closing Statement or the
Working Capital, Indebtedness, Cash or Company Transaction Expenses set forth
therein. The Notice of Disagreement shall set forth in reasonable detail the
basis for such disagreement, the amounts involved and the Securityholder
Representative's determination of the amount of the Working Capital,
Indebtedness, Cash and Company Transaction Expenses, in each case, as of the
Determination Time, together with reasonably detailed supporting
documentation.

(c) During the 30 days immediately following the delivery of a Notice of
Disagreement, the Securityholder Representative and Parent shall seek in good
faith to resolve any disagreement that they may have with respect to the
matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement. If no Notice of Disagreement
is received by Parent on or prior to the expiration date of the Review Period,
then the Closing Statement and the Working Capital, Indebtedness, Cash and
Company Transaction Expenses set forth in the Closing Statement shall be
deemed to have been accepted by the Securityholder Representative and shall
become final and binding upon Parent and the Company Stockholders. If the
parties cannot agree on the Working Capital, Indebtedness, Cash and Company
Transaction Expenses within such 30 day period, the Working Capital,
Indebtedness, Cash and/or Company Transaction Expenses, in each case, solely
to the extent not agreed between the Securityholder Representative and Parent,
shall be determined by PricewaterhouseCoopers (such firm or any replacement
firm appointed pursuant to the terms of this Section 3.06(c), the "Referee").
The Securityholder Representative and Parent shall furnish the Referee with a
statement setting forth the items from the Notice of Disagreement which are
still in dispute (the "Referee Dispute Notice"); provided, that all items
which are not in dispute, and thus not included on the Referee Dispute Notice
and/or Notice of Disagreement, shall be considered final and binding. In the
event that PricewaterhouseCoopers refuses or is otherwise unable to act as the
Referee, the Securityholder Representative and Parent shall cooperate in good
faith to appoint an independent certified public accounting firm in the United
States of national recognition mutually agreeable to the Securityholder
Representative and Parent, in which event "Referee" shall mean such firm.
Within 30 days after the submission of such matters to the Referee, or as soon
as practicable thereafter, the Referee, acting as an expert and not as an
arbiter, will make a final determination (based only on the terms and
definitions in this Agreement and the information provided by the
Securityholder Representative and Parent (and not by independent review)),
binding on the Securityholder Representative and Parent, of the appropriate
amount of each of the line items in the Closing Statement as to which there is
disagreement as specified in the Referee Dispute Notice. With respect to each
disputed line item, such determination, if not determined to be the position
of either the Securityholder Representative or Parent, shall not be in excess
of the higher, nor less than the lower, of the amounts specified by either the
Securityholder Representative in the Notice of Disagreement or Parent in the
Closing Statement with respect to such disputed line item. For the avoidance
of doubt, the



Referee shall not review any line items or make any determination with respect
to any matter other than those matters in the Referee Dispute Notice that are
in dispute. The statement of each of Working Capital, Indebtedness, Cash and
Company Transaction Expenses, in each case, as of the Determination Time, and
the determination of the Working Capital, Indebtedness, Cash and Company
Transaction Expenses therefrom that are final and binding on the
Securityholder Representative and Parent, as determined either through
agreement of the Securityholder Representative and Parent (deemed in
accordance with the second sentence of this Section 3.06(c) or otherwise
evidenced in writing and executed by each of the Securityholder Representative
and Parent) or through the determination of the Referee pursuant to this
Section 3.06(c) are referred to herein as the "Final Working Capital," "Final
Indebtedness," "Final Cash," and "Final Company Transaction Expenses,"
respectively. During the review by the Referee, the Securityholder
Representative, Parent and R1 shall each make available to the Referee such
individuals and such information, books, records and work papers, as may be
reasonably requested by the Referee to fulfill its obligations under this
Section 3.06(c); provided, however, that the independent accountants of the
Securityholder Representative, R1 or Parent shall not be obligated to make any
working papers available to the Referee unless and until the Referee has
signed a customary confidentiality and hold harmless agreement relating to
such access to working papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
such independent accountants.

(d) The cost of the Referee's review and determination shall be borne on a
proportionate basis by Parent and R1, on the one hand, and the Company
Stockholders, on the other (whose share shall be paid on their behalf by the
Securityholder Representative from the Securityholder Representative Expense
Amount), based on the percentage which the portion of the contested amount not
awarded in favor of each such Person bears to the aggregate amount actually
contested.

(e) The Final Cash Merger Consideration shall be calculated by using the Final
Working Capital, Final Indebtedness, Final Cash, the Final Company Transaction
Expenses and otherwise using the components of Estimated Cash Merger
Consideration as set forth in the definition of Estimated Cash Merger
Consideration.

(i) If the Final Cash Merger Consideration is less than the Estimated Cash
Merger Consideration paid at the Closing (such amount, the "Deficiency
Amount"), Parent shall be entitled to promptly receive, and Parent and the
Securityholder Representative shall deliver joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent to cause the Escrow Agent to make payment to Parent within five
Business Days after the Final Working Capital, Final Indebtedness, Final Cash
and Final Company Transaction Expenses have been agreed upon (deemed in
accordance with the second sentence of Section 3.06(c) or otherwise evidenced
in writing and executed by each of the Securityholder Representative and
Parent) or determined by the Referee, in either case in accordance with
Section 3.06(c), from the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account in an
amount equal to such Deficiency Amount; provided, however, (x) if the
Deficiency Amount exceeds the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow, then Parent
shall have the right to request the Securityholder Representative to provide
joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to release an amount equal to
the balance of such shortfall from the Specified Matters Escrow Amount and (y)
such Deficiency



Amount shall be satisfied solely and exclusively from the Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Amount and the Specified Matters Escrow Amount held by the
Escrow Agent and in no event shall the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any
Company Stockholder have any obligation or liability to Parent in excess of
the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount and the Specified Matters Escrow
Amount.

Company Disclosure Schedule, there has not been, with respect to the Company

on Section 4.08(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, (i) each Lease (A)
constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company or the Company

defects as do not interfere with the intended use thereof in the conduct of
normal operations.

the Intellectual Property owned or used by the Company or any of the Company

obtained or made would not reasonably be expected to materially impair or
delay Parent's, R1's or Merger Sub's ability to perform its respective
obligations under this Agreement or consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Financing.

5.04 Proceedings. Except as disclosed in the R1 SEC Documents, there are no
Actions, suits, arbitrations, proceedings, investigations or claims of any
kind whatsoever, at Law or in equity, pending, or to the knowledge of R1,
threatened against Parent, R1, Merger Sub or any of their Subsidiaries that
would if adversely determined have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Except as
disclosed in the R1 SEC Documents, none of Parent, R1, Merger Sub or any of
their Subsidiaries is subject to any Governmental Order or is in breach or
violation of any Governmental Order, except as would not have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

5.05 Sufficient Funds.

(a) R1 and Parent have delivered to the Company true, correct, and complete
copies of (i) executed commitment letters from each of the financial
institutions identified therein, dated as of the date hereof (including all
exhibits, schedules and annexes thereto, the "Senior Debt



Commitment Letter"), (ii) executed commitment letters from each of the
subordinated lenders identified therein, dated as of the date hereof
(including all exhibits, schedules and annexes thereto, the "Subordinated Debt
Commitment Letter" and together with the Senior Debt Commitment Letter, the
"Debt Commitment Letter") and (iii) the fee letter referred to in the Senior
Debt Commitment Letter (the "Fee Letter") (with only fee amounts and customary
market flex provisions redacted (but none of the redacted terms would
adversely affect the amount or availability of the Debt Financing)) (the Debt
Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter, together the "Commitment Letters", and
the commitments under the Debt Commitment Letter, the "Debt Financing
Commitments" or the "Financing Commitments"), pursuant to which, and subject
to the terms and conditions of which, the lenders party thereto (the
"Lenders") have committed to lend the amounts set forth therein to Parent (the
"Debt Financing" or the "Financing").

(b) The Commitment Letters are in full force and effect and have not been
withdrawn, rescinded, or terminated, or otherwise amended or modified in any
respect and are a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and to the
knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, enforceable in accordance with
their terms except as may be limited by the Enforceability Exceptions. Other
than the Commitment Letters and the Fee Letter, there are no other agreements,
side letters or arrangements relating to the Financing Commitments that would
affect the availability of the Financing. Neither R1, Parent nor Merger Sub is
in breach of any of the terms or conditions set forth in the Commitment
Letters. As of the date of this Agreement and assuming the closing conditions
set forth in Section 7.01 and Section 7.02 have been satisfied and compliance
in all material respects by the Company with Section 6.12, neither R1, Parent
nor Merger Sub is aware nor has any reason to believe that any of the
conditions to the Financing required to be satisfied by such party will not be
satisfied on or prior to the date on which the Closing would otherwise occur
pursuant to this Agreement, or that the Financing will not be available to R1,
Parent or Merger Sub on the date on which the Closing would otherwise occur
pursuant to this Agreement. R1, Parent or Merger Sub has fully paid any and
all commitment fees or other fees required by the Financing Commitments to be
paid on or before the date of this Agreement. Assuming the closing conditions
set forth in Article VII and the Commitment Letters have been satisfied and
compliance in all material respects by the Company with Section 6.12, and
assuming the Financing is funded in accordance with the terms of the
Commitment Letters, the aggregate proceeds from the Financing, together with
cash on hand, will be sufficient for satisfaction of all of Parent's
obligations under this Agreement in an amount sufficient to consummate the
Transactions, including the payment of the Final Cash Merger Consideration,
repayment of the Funded Indebtedness, and the payment of all associated costs
and expenses (including, without limitation, the Company Transaction Expenses)
(collectively, the "Required Amount"). The Commitment Letters contain all of
the conditions precedent to the obligations of the parties thereunder to make
the full amount of the Financing available to Parent on the terms set forth
therein. As of the date of this Agreement, none of the Financing Commitments
has been terminated or withdrawn and no Lender has notified R1, Parent or
Merger Sub in writing of its intention to terminate or withdraw the Debt
Financing Commitments.

(c) The obligations of R1, Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement are not
subject to any conditions regarding R1's, Parent's, Merger Sub's, their
respective Affiliates', or any other Person's ability to obtain financing for
the consummation of the Transactions contemplated hereby.



5.06 Solvency. Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
Section 7.01 and Section 7.02, and assuming the representation and warranties
set forth in Article IV are true and correct in all material respects,
immediately after giving effect to the Transactions (including the Financing
and any alternative financing permitted by this Agreement), the Closing
Payments, the payment of any and all fees and expenses required to be paid by
Parent and R1 in connection with the Transactions and the other Transaction
Agreements, and the satisfaction of all of Parent's and R1's other payment
obligations contemplated hereby, Parent, R1, the Surviving Corporation and
their respective Subsidiaries shall be Solvent. No transfer of property is
being made and no obligation is being incurred in connection with the
transactions hereby with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present
or future creditors of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries.

5.07 Ownership and Operations of Merger Sub. Parent owns of record and
beneficially owns all outstanding shares of capital stock of Merger Sub.
Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the Transactions,
and has engaged in no other business or other activities or incurred any
liabilities, other than in connection with or as contemplated in this
Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements.

5.08 Brokers and Finders. No agent, broker, investment banker, financial
advisor or other Person is or will become entitled to receive any commission,
brokerage, finder's fee or other similar compensation in connection with the
consummation of the Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf
of Parent, R1 or Merger Sub for which the Company could have any liability
prior to Closing.

5.09 Disclaimer of Warranties. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS
ARTICLE V, THE OTHER TRANSACTION AGREEMENTS AND THE CERTIFICATE DELIVERED
PURSUANT TO SECTION 7.03(C) HEREBY AND THEREBY, PARENT, R1 AND MERGER SUB
EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND OR NATURE,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN
ARTICLE V AND THE CERTIFICATE DELIVERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 7.03(C), PARENT,
R1 AND MERGER SUB HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL LIABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY
REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY OR STATEMENT MADE, OR COMMUNICATED, OR OTHER
INFORMATION FURNISHED OR MADE AVAILABLE (IN ALL OF THE FOREGOING, WHETHER
ORALLY OR IN WRITING) TO THE COMPANY, THE COMPANY STOCKHOLDERS OR THEIR
RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES OR REPRESENTATIVES.

shall cause their Affiliates to, provide to the Company Employees, base
salary, a cash bonus opportunity and employee benefits (including, without

prior to the Closing.

(b) Parent and R1 shall, or shall cause their Affiliates to, as applicable,
give Company Employees full credit for such Company Employees' service with

and vesting and for purposes of determining future vacation accruals and
severance amounts to the same extent and for the same purpose as recognized by
the Company immediately prior to the Closing, under the corresponding Company

result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of
service.

(c) Parent and R1 shall, or shall cause their Affiliates to, as applicable use
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive any preexisting condition
limitations otherwise applicable to Company Employees and their eligible
dependents under any plan of Parent or any of its Affiliates that provides

of-pocket maximums incurred by Company Employees and their eligible dependents
under the health plans in which they participated immediately prior to the

maximums under health plans of Parent or any of its Affiliates in which they

under the analogous Company Benefit Plan, and (iii) waive any waiting period
limitation, actively-at-work requirements or evidence of insurability
requirement that would otherwise be applicable to a Company Employee and his
or her eligible dependents on or after the Closing, in each case to the extent

to any similar limitation or requirement under an analogous Company Benefit
Plan prior to the Closing.

(d) Effective no later than the Closing Date, the Company shall take or cause
to be taken all actions necessary or appropriate to cease participation,

Company Subsidiaries (and spouses and covered dependents thereof) who

(e) Nothing contained in this Section 6.05, express or implied, shall be
construed (i) to establish, amend, or modify any benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement, (ii) to prevent R1 or any of its Affiliates
(including, after the transaction, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries)
from terminating or modifying the terms of employment of any employees or
terminating or modifying any Company Benefit Plan or any other employee
benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement, or (iii) to confer upon any
individual (including employees, retirees, or dependents or beneficiaries of
employees or retirees) any right as a third-party beneficiary of this
Agreement. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the terms set forth
in this Section 6.04 shall not create any right in any Company Employee or any
other Person to any continued employment with the Company, Parent, R1 or any
of their respective Affiliates, successors, or assigns.

6.06 Publicity. The initial press release announcing this Agreement, any
ancillary agreements and the transactions contemplated herein shall be in
substantially the form mutually agreed upon by Parent and Merger Sub, on the
one hand, and the Securityholder Representative, on the other hand. No other
press release, public announcement or public filing related to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated herein, or prior to the Closing any other
announcement or communication to the employees, customers or suppliers of the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries, shall be issued or made by any party
hereto without the prior written approval of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Securityholder Representative and the Company (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), unless required by Law (in the
reasonable opinion of counsel) or the rules and regulations of an applicable
securities exchange, in which case, Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand,
and the Company and the Securityholder Representative, on the other hand,
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to consult with the other and
provide the other party the right to review such press release, announcement,
public filing or communication and provide comments which will reasonably be
taken into account, in each case,



prior to issuance, distribution or publication, in each case, to the extent
reasonably practicable. The parties understand and agree that Parent, R1 or
their Affiliates intend to publicly disclose this Agreement and the
Transactions subsequent to the execution of this Agreement as required
pursuant to the rules or regulations of an applicable securities exchange;
provided that any such initial disclosure shall require the joint approval of
Parent, R1 and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company and the
Securityholder Representative, on the other hand (which approval shall not
unreasonably be withheld). For the avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge
and agree that Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P. and its Affiliates may provide
information about the subject matter of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby to their respective limited partners and investors in the
ordinary course of business, subject to customary confidentiality obligations
with respect thereto.

6.07 Confidentiality. Each of Parent and R1 acknowledges that the information
provided to it and its Representatives in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby are subject to the terms of the Non-
Disclosure Agreement between R1 and Intermedix Corporation, dated as of April
12, 2017 (as amended or modified from time to time, the "Confidentiality
Agreement"). The terms of the Confidentiality Agreement are hereby
incorporated by reference. The Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate on
the earlier of (i) at the date of its expiration in accordance with its terms
and (ii) at the Closing.

6.08 Access to Information.

(a) Prior to the Closing Date and subject to applicable Laws and Section 6.07,
Parent shall be entitled, through its officers, employees and Representatives
(including its legal advisors, financing sources and accountants), to have
such access to the information, properties, businesses and operations of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries and such examination of the books and
records of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as it reasonably requests
upon reasonable advance written notice. Any such access and examination shall
be conducted during regular business hours and under circumstances that do not
unreasonably interfere with the normal operations of the business and shall be
subject to restrictions under applicable Law. The Company shall cause the
officers, employees, consultants, agents, accountants, attorneys and other
Representatives of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to cooperate with
Parent and Parent's Representatives in connection with such access and
examination, and Parent and its Representatives shall cooperate with the
Company and its Representatives and shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to minimize any disruption to the business. Any disclosure during such
investigation by Parent or its Representatives shall not constitute any
enlargement or additional representation or warranty of the Company beyond
those specifically set forth in Article IV. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, no such access or examination shall be permitted to the extent
that it (i) relates to the negotiation of this Agreement and the Transactions,
(ii) would unreasonably disrupt the operations of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries or (iii) would require the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries to disclose information that in the reasonable judgment and good
faith of counsel to the Company, is subject to attorney-client privilege or
may conflict with any applicable Law or confidentiality obligations to which
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is bound provided, however,
that in each such case, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to take those actions



reasonable necessary so that the Company or the Company Subsidiaries is able
to provide such information to Parent or a Representative of Parent (which
efforts shall not require the Company to waive its attorney-client privilege
or violate any material Contract or applicable Law).

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, prior to the
Closing, (i) without the written consent of the Company (which may be withheld
in the Company's sole discretion), Parent and R1 shall not contact any
customers of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, other than in the ordinary
course of the business of Parent, R1 or any of their Affiliates with respect
to matters not related to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, and
provided that the Company shall have the right to have one (1) Representative
present during any such contact in the event that it consents to such contact,
and (ii) Parent and R1 shall have no right to perform invasive or subsurface
investigations of the properties or facilities of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries without the prior written consent of the Company (which
consent may be withheld for any reason).

6.09 Regulatory Approvals.

(a) The Company, Parent, R1 and Merger Sub will, as promptly as practicable
and no later than ten (10) Business Days following the date of this Agreement,
file with the United States Federal Trade Commission and the United States
Department of Justice, the notification form required pursuant to the HSR Act
for the Transactions, which form will specifically request early termination
of the waiting period prescribed by the HSR Act. The Company, Parent, R1 and
Merger Sub will use reasonable best efforts to make all other necessary
filings with such Governmental Entities as promptly as practicable following
the date of this Agreement. Each of the Company, Parent, R1 and Merger Sub
will furnish to each other's counsel such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as the other may request in connection with its preparation of any
filing or submission that is necessary under the HSR Act and will provide any
supplemental information requested by any Governmental Entity as promptly as
practicable. The Company, Parent, R1 and Merger Sub will use all reasonable
best efforts to comply as promptly as practicable with any requests made for
any additional information in connection with such filings. All fees and
expenses in connection with any filing pursuant to the HSR Act, Competition
Laws or any application or filing before a Governmental Entity shall be borne
by Parent and R1.

(b) Subject to the immediately following sentence, the Company, Parent, R1 and
Merger Sub will use their reasonable best efforts to promptly obtain any
clearance required under the HSR Act for the consummation of the Transactions
and will keep each other apprised of the status of any communications with,
and any inquiries or requests for additional information from, any
Governmental Entity and will comply as promptly as practicable with any such
inquiry or request. Parent, R1 and Merger Sub will use their respective
reasonable best efforts to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under
the HSR Act that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity so as to enable
the parties to close the Transactions by no later than the Outside Date,
including but not limited to (i) proposing, negotiating, committing to or
effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture or disposition of its assets, properties or businesses or of the
assets, properties or businesses to be acquired, and the entrance into such
other arrangements, as necessary or advisable in order to avoid the entry of,
and the commencement of



litigation seeking the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any
injunction or other order in any suit or proceeding which would otherwise have
the effect of materially delaying or preventing the consummation of the
Transactions; (ii) opposing or defending through completion of litigation on
the merits any claim, Action, suit, investigation or other proceeding brought
by any Governmental Entity or other Person challenging the Transactions under
any Law, including any such action as reasonably necessary to appeal and
overturn any Order preventing or enjoining the Transactions; and (iii)
agreeing to such limitations on conduct or actions of members of Parent, R1
and their Affiliates after the Closing as may be required in order to obtain
satisfaction of the closing conditions set forth in Section 7.01 prior to the
Outside Date; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing or
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall Parent, R1 or
any of their respective Affiliates be required to, nor shall the Company or
any of its Affiliates, without prior written consent of Parent, take any
actions under this paragraph if such actions would result in a material
adverse effect, as measured on the Company.

(c) The parties hereto commit to instruct their respective counsel to
cooperate with each other and use reasonable best efforts to facilitate and
expedite the identification and resolution of any issues arising under the HSR
Act at the earliest practicable dates. Such reasonable best efforts and
cooperation include counsel's undertaking (i) to keep each other appropriately
informed of material communications from and to personnel of the reviewing
Governmental Entities in connection with the Transactions and (ii) to confer
with each other regarding appropriate contacts with and to the extent
practicable, consult with the others prior to any response to personnel of
such Governmental Entities in respect of any filings, applications,
investigation or other inquiry concerning the Transactions and the content of
any such contacts or presentations. The Company, Parent, R1 and Merger Sub
will, to the extent practicable, consult with the other parties prior to any
meeting or discussion with any Governmental Entity with respect of any such
filings, applications, investigation or other inquiry, and will give the other
party prior notice of the meeting or discussion and, to the extent permitted
by the relevant Governmental Entity, the opportunity to attend and participate
in such meeting or discussion (which, at the request of either Parent or the
Company, will be limited to outside antitrust counsel only). Each of Parent
and the Company will have the right to review (subject to appropriate
redactions for confidentiality and attorney-client privilege concerns) and
approve the content of any presentations, white papers or other written
materials to be submitted to any Governmental Entity in advance of any such
submission.

(d) Prior to the Closing, Parent and Merger Sub will not, and will not permit
any of their respective Subsidiaries to, acquire or agree to acquire (by
merging or consolidating with, or by purchasing a substantial portion of the
assets of or equity in, or by any other manner), any Person or portion
thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets, if the entering
into a definitive agreement relating to, or the consummation of, such
acquisition, merger or consolidation would reasonably be expected to (i)
impose any material delay in the obtaining of, or materially increase the risk
of not obtaining, any permits, orders or other approvals of any Governmental
Entity necessary to consummate the Transactions or the expiration or
termination of any applicable waiting period, (ii) increase the risk of any
Governmental Entity entering an order prohibiting the consummation of the
Transactions or (iii) delay the consummation of the Transactions to a date
later than the Outside Date.



6.10 Director and Officer Liability; Indemnification.

(a) The certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or equivalent governing
documents) of each of the Surviving Corporation and the Company Subsidiaries
shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of former or present directors,
managers and officers (the "Indemnified Individuals") than are set forth in
the respective organizational documents of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries (as applicable) (or equivalent governing documents) as of the
Effective Time, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that
would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such individuals, in each
case, except and only to the extent as required by applicable Law.

(b) The Company shall purchase prior to the Effective Time a "tail" insurance
policy for a period of six years after the Effective Time, with reputable and
financially sound carriers of at least the same coverage and amounts and
containing terms and conditions that are no less advantageous than the current
policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries with respect to claims arising from or
related to facts or events that occurred at or before the Effective Time.
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to take, and the Surviving
Corporation shall take, all necessary actions to maintain such policies in
full force and effect and fulfill its obligations thereunder throughout such
six-year period following the Effective Time. Nothing in this Section 6.10 is
intended to replace the rights of the Persons who are beneficiaries of the
"tail" policy described in this Section 6.10(b) (including Parent, R1, the
Surviving Corporation and their Subsidiaries). The costs of the tail insurance
policy referred to in this Section 6.10(b) shall be borne by Parent and R1.

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Action (whether
arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is made against any
Indemnified Individual on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective
Time, the provisions of this Section 6.10 shall continue in effect until the
final disposition of such Action.

(d) This covenant is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Individuals and their respective heirs
and legal representatives. The indemnification provided for herein shall not
be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Individual is
entitled, whether pursuant to law, contract or otherwise.

(e) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or Parent or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a
majority of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such
case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, shall succeed to the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.10. In addition, the Surviving
Corporation shall not distribute, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any
of its assets in a manner that would reasonably be expected to render the
Surviving Corporation unable to satisfy its obligations under this Section
6.10.



(f) No right or remedy herein conferred by this Agreement is intended to be
exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every other right and remedy shall
be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder
or now or hereafter existing at Law or in equity or otherwise.

6.11 Reasonable Best Efforts. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
herein provided and Section 6.09 which specifically governs the parties'
obligations with respect to filings under the HSR Act, each of the parties
hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all
actions, to do or cause to be done and to assist and cooperate with the other
party in doing all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws
to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner reasonably
practicable, the transactions contemplated hereby and by the other Transaction
Agreements, and in any event, no later than the Outside Date, including: (a)
the satisfaction (but not waiver) of the conditions precedent to the
obligations of any of the parties; (b) the obtaining of applicable consents,
waivers or approvals of any Governmental Entities or third parties; (c) the
defending of any actions challenging this Agreement or the performance of the
obligations hereby; and (d) the execution and delivery of such instruments,
and the taking of such other actions, as the other party may reasonably
require in order to carry out the intent of this Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, none of the Company, Parent, R1, Merger Sub nor any of their
respective Affiliates shall be obligated to make any non-de minimis payments
or otherwise pay any non-de minimis consideration to any third party to obtain
any applicable consent, waiver or approval.

6.12 Financing and Financing Assistance.

(a) [Reserved].

(b) Giving due regard to the Marketing Period, R1, Parent and Merger Sub shall
use their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, as promptly as possible all things
necessary to arrange and obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions
described in the Debt Commitment Letter, including using reasonable best
efforts to (i) until the funding of the Debt Financing at or prior to the
Closing, maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letter, (ii) negotiate and
enter into definitive financing agreements with respect to the Debt Financing
that are on terms and conditions contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter
(including any related market flex provisions set forth in the Fee Letter),
(iii) satisfy or cause to be satisfied, on a timely basis, taking into account
the Marketing Period, all conditions applicable to Parent and Merger Sub
obtaining the Debt Financing set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter that are
within their control, including the payment of any commitment, engagement, or
placement fees required as a condition to the Debt Financing, (iv) upon
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter,
consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to the date that the Closing is
required to be effected in accordance with this Agreement (Parent and Merger
Sub acknowledge and agree that it is not a condition to Closing under this
Agreement, nor to the consummation of the Merger, for R1, Parent and Merger
Sub to obtain the Debt Financing or any alternative financing), (v) enforce
its rights under the Debt Commitment Letter and/or the definitive agreements
relating to the Debt Financing; and (vi) comply with its obligations under the
Debt Commitment Letters. Upon written request of the Company,



Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed on a current basis and in
reasonable detail of material developments in respect of the status of its
efforts to arrange the Debt Financing. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the Company prompt notice (x)
of any breach or default by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter or the
definitive agreements relating to the Debt Financing of which Parent or Merger
Sub become aware that would delay or prevent the Closing or result in
insufficient financing to make all payments required to be made by Parent on
the Closing Date pursuant to Section 3.03(b), (y) of the receipt of (A) any
written notice or (B) other written communication, in each case from any
Lender party to the Debt Commitment Letter with respect to any (i) actual or
potential breach, default, termination or repudiation by such Lender related
to the Debt Financing or (ii) material dispute or disagreement between or
among any parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements
related to the Debt Financing (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any
ordinary course negotiations with respect to the terms of the Debt Financing)
to the extent such dispute would delay or prevent the Closing or result in
insufficient financing to make all payments required to be made by Parent on
the Closing Date pursuant to Section 3.03(b), or (z) any expiration or
termination of the Debt Commitment Letter. Prior to the Closing, Parent and
Merger Sub shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, agree
to, or permit, any amendment or modification of, or waiver under, the Debt
Commitment Letter (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any provision of the
Fee Letter), if such amendment, modification or waiver would (1) reduce the
aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (except to the extent there is a
corresponding increase in a Replacement Financing or other debt financing) to
an amount less than the amount required to make all payments required to be
made by the Parent on the Closing Date pursuant to Section 3.03(b), or, (2)
impose new or additional conditions or expand upon (or amend or modify in any
manner adverse to the interests of the Company) the conditions precedent to
the receipt of the Debt Financing as set forth in the Commitment Letter in a
manner that would reasonably be expected to (I) materially delay or prevent
the Closing, or (II) make the funding of any portion of the Debt Financing (or
satisfaction of any condition to obtaining any portion of the Debt Financing)
less likely to occur. For purposes of this Section 6.12, the definitions of
"Commitment Letters," "Debt Commitment Letter" "Financing Commitments" and
"Debt Financing Commitments" shall include the applicable documents for any
Replacement Financing, and references to "Debt Financing", and "Financing"
shall include any Replacement Financing. Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly
deliver to the Company copies of any such amendment, modification or waiver.
Further, for the avoidance of doubt, if the Debt Financing (or any alternative
financing) has not been obtained, R1, Parent and Merger Sub shall continue to
be obligated to consummate the Transactions subject only to the satisfaction
or waiver of the conditions set forth in Sections 7.01 and 7.02.

(c) If, notwithstanding the use of reasonable best efforts by Parent and
Merger Sub to satisfy its obligations under Section 6.12(a), any of the Debt
Financing (after giving effect to any other equity and/or debt financing that
may then be available to cover such unavailable amount) on the terms and
conditions contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (after taking into
account any related market flex provisions set forth in the Fee Letter) Parent
and Merger Sub shall use their respective reasonable best efforts promptly to
arrange for alternative debt financing on terms and conditions in the
aggregate not materially less favorable to Parent and Merger Sub than the Debt
Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as in effect on the date
of this Agreement (after taking into account any related market flex
provisions set forth in the Fee



Letter) in an amount sufficient to replace any unavailable portion of the Debt
Financing (any such alternative debt financing, a "Replacement Financing") and
the provisions of this Section 6.12 shall be applicable to the Replacement
Financing. It is understood and agreed that in no event will the reasonable
best efforts of Parent or Merger Sub be deemed or construed to require Parent
or Merger Sub to pay any fees materially in excess of those contemplated by
the Debt Commitment Letter or the Fee Letter (including market flex provisions
set forth therein) as in effect on the date of this Agreement (whether to
secure waiver of any conditions contained therein or otherwise). Parent shall
deliver to the Company copies of any commitment letter associated with a
Replacement Financing.

(d) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and
the Company Subsidiaries' officers, employees and advisors to, provide to
Parent all cooperation that is reasonably requested by Parent or Merger Sub in
connection with arranging, syndicating and obtaining the Debt Financing,
including the following, in each case to the extent applicable under the
relevant Debt Commitment Letter: (i) causing the Company's senior officers to
participate in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations and conference
calls with rating agencies that are customary for financings of a type similar
to the Debt Financing; (ii) assisting with the preparation of (A)
presentations and other customary documents and materials for rating agency
presentations, and (B) bank information memoranda and lender presentations and
other customary marketing documents and materials (including customary
authorization letters with respect to the presence or absence of material non-
public information with respect to the Company and the accuracy in all
material respects of the information with respect to the Company contained in
the disclosure and marketing materials)) for any portion of the Debt
Financing; (iii) assisting in the preparation of, and executing and
delivering, definitive financing documents, including credit agreements,
guarantee and collateral documents and customary closing certificates and
other customary documents and instruments as may be required in connection
with the Debt Financing as may be reasonably requested by Parent or the
Lenders and that are not effective until as of, or after, the Closing; (iv)
assisting Parent with Parent's preparation of pro forma financial statements
necessary to satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 4 of the Senior Debt
Commitment Letter and Annex III thereto; provided, that neither the Company
nor any of the Company Subsidiaries or Company Representatives shall be
responsible in any manner for information relating to the proposed debt and
equity capitalization that is required for such pro forma financial
information; (v) facilitating, effective as of the Closing Date, the granting
of a security interest (and perfection thereof) in collateral and the
termination of the existing guarantee and collateral arrangements, release of
encumbrances and obtaining payoff letters in accordance with Section 3.05 in
respect of the holders of the Funded Indebtedness as set forth on Section 3.05
of the Company Disclosure Schedule; (vi) reasonably cooperating with Parent's
legal counsel in connection with any legal opinions that such legal counsel
may be required to deliver in connection with the Debt Financing; (vii) if
necessary, periodically update the Financing Information so that, to the
Knowledge of the Company, such Financing Information does not contain any
untrue statement of material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
in order to make the statements contained therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they were made, not materially misleading (other than
information supplied by or on behalf of Parent or any of its Affiliates);
(viii) if reasonably requested in writing at least ten Business Days prior to
Closing, providing at least five Business Days prior to Closing, and as
reasonably requested by Parent, all documentation and other



information with respect to the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their
respective Affiliates that the Lenders have reasonably determined is required
by regulatory authorities in connection with applicable "know your customer"
and anti-money laundering rules and regulations (including the USA PATRIOT
Act); (ix) causing direct contact between the Company\'s senior management, on
the one hand, and the Financing Sources, on the other hand, at such times and
locations mutually agreed upon; and (x) taking all corporate actions, subject
to the occurrence of the Closing, reasonably requested by Parent to permit the
consummation of the Debt Financing and to permit the proceeds thereof to be
made available on the Closing Date to fund the amounts required to be funded
on the Closing Date pursuant to Section 3.03(b); provided that,
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, until the
Effective Time occurs, neither the Company nor the Company Subsidiaries shall
(1) be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee, (2) other than
delivery of customary authorization letters with respect to information
provided by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, be required to execute
any document relating to the Debt Financing that will be effective prior to
Closing, (3) be required to incur any liability in connection with the Debt
Financing, (4) be required to provide any cooperation or information that does
not pertain to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries (it being understood
that no officer or employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be
required to take any action other than on behalf of the Company and/or the
applicable Company Subsidiary in his, her or their capacity as an officer of
employee of the Company or the applicable Company Subsidiary), or (5) be
required to deliver any financial statements other than the Company Financial
Statements. R1 and Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless, the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries, and their respective officers, employees and
representatives, from and against any and all liabilities or losses suffered
or incurred by them in connection with the cooperation provided pursuant to
this Section 6.12(d) or any information provided in connection therewith,
except in the event such liabilities or losses arose out of or result from a
material misstatement in, or failure to state a material fact pertinent to,
the written information provided by or on behalf of the Company or any fraud
or any intentional misrepresentations with respect to any such written
information. Notwithstanding anything in this paragraph, such requested
cooperation shall not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries. The Company hereby consents to the
reasonable use of the Company's and the Company Subsidiaries' logos in
connection with the Debt Financing; provided that such logos are used in a
manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries. Promptly following the request
of the Company, Parent will reimburse the Company for any out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by the Company and/or any of the Company Subsidiaries in
connection with the assistance required by this Section 5.13.

(e) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, Parent and Merger
Sub shall have the right from time to time to amend, replace, supplement or
otherwise modify, or waive any of its rights under, the Commitment Letters or
definitive agreements relating to the Debt Financing; provided that: (i)
without the prior written consent of the Company, no such amendment,
replacement, supplement, modification or waiver shall (1) reduce (or have the
effect of reducing) the aggregate amount of the Financing (including by
increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount in respect
of the Financing) to less than the Required Amount (after giving effect to
Parent's and Merger Sub's available cash on hand following the transactions
otherwise contemplated by this Agreement), (2) add new conditions precedent or
contingencies to the



Financing or amend, replace, supplement or modify any existing conditions
precedent or contingencies to the Financing in a manner adverse to Parent (or
its Affiliates) or that would reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or
delay or make less likely to occur, the funding of the Financing (or
satisfaction of the conditions or contingencies to the Financing) on the
Closing Date, (3) delay the funding of the Financing or reasonably be expected
to prevent, impede or delay the availability of the Financing on the date upon
which the Closing Date is required to occur pursuant to Section 2.02, (4)
waive any remedy available to Parent or Merger Sub thereunder or adversely
impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to enforce or cause the enforcement
of its rights under the Commitment Letters or the definitive agreements
relating to the Financing or (5) impose obligations on the Company or its
Affiliates that would be effective prior to the Effective Time or violate any
other provision of the proviso to Section 6.12(d) above. Parent shall provide
the Company with a copy of the commitment letter and/or fee letter (and any
related agreements) relating to any amendment, replacement, supplementation or
other modification contemplated by this Section 6.12(e).

6.13 Preservation of Records. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, preserve and keep the records of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries for a period of seven years following the Closing Date (or longer
if required by applicable Law) and shall make such records (or copies) and
reasonably appropriate personnel available, during regular business hours and
upon reasonable advance notice, to the Securityholder Representative or any
Company Stockholder, at the Securityholder Representative's or such Company
Stockholder's expense, as may be reasonably required by such party in
connection with any insurance claims by, legal proceedings (other than legal
proceedings or Actions between Parent or R1, on the one hand, and such Person,
on the other hand) or Tax audits against, governmental investigations of, or
compliance with applicable Laws by, the Securityholder Representative, the
Company Stockholders or any of their Affiliates in respect of the Company.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no such access or examination
shall be permitted to the extent that it (i) would unreasonably disrupt the
operations of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or (ii) would
require the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to disclose information
that, in the reasonable judgment and good faith of counsel to the Company, is
subject to attorney-client privilege or may conflict with any applicable Law
or confidentiality obligations to which the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries is bound; provided, that in each such case, the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take those
actions reasonably necessary so the Company or the Company Subsidiaries is
able to provide such information to the Securityholder Representative or
Company Stockholder (which efforts shall not require the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries to waive its attorney-client privilege or violate any
Contract or applicable Law).

6.14 Escrow Agreement and Paying Agent Agreement. At the Closing, each of
Parent and the Securityholder Representative shall duly execute and deliver to
the other, and shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Escrow
Agent and Paying Agent to duly execute and deliver to Parent and the
Securityholder Representative, the Escrow Agreement and the Paying Agent
Agreement, respectively.



6.15 FIRPTA Certificate. On or prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
deliver to Parent a certificate in compliance with Treasury Regulation Section
1.1445-2 and Treasury Regulation Section 1.897-2(h), certifying that the
shares of Company Common Stock are not United States real property interests
within the meaning of Section 897 of the Code together with a notice that
Parent may provide to the Internal Revenue Service in accordance with the
provisions of Treasury Regulations Section 1.897-2(h)(2), in each case in the
form attached hereto as Exhibit F (the "FIRPTA Certificate"). In the event
that the Company is unable to provide such a certificate, Parent's sole remedy
shall be to make an appropriate withholding under Sections 897 and 1445 of the
Code.

6.16 [Reserved].

6.17 [Reserved].

6.18 Tax Matters.

(a) Transfer Taxes. At the Closing or, if due thereafter, promptly when due
thereafter, all Transfer Taxes, whether imposed on the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries or imposed on any holder of Company Common Stock resulting from
the Transactions will be paid by R1. The party required by law will prepare
and file any Tax Returns with respect to such Taxes and the other parties will
cooperate with the preparing party in the preparation and filing of such Tax
Returns.

(b) Cooperation on Tax Matters. R1, the Surviving Corporation and the
Securityholder Representative will cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by any other party hereto, in connection with the filing
of Tax Returns, any Tax audits, Tax proceedings or other Tax-related claims.
Such cooperation will include, at the other party's request and expense,
providing records and information that are reasonably relevant to any such
matters, making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explaining any materials provided pursuant to this
Section 6.18(b).

(c) None of Parent, R1, Merger Sub, the Company or any of their Affiliates
will make any election under Sections 338 or 336(e) of the Code (or any
similar provision under state, local or foreign Law) with respect to the
Transactions. None of EMS Parent or any of its Affiliates shall make any
election under Section 336(e) of the Code (or any similar provision under
state, local or foreign Law) with respect to the Reorganization.

(d) None of R1, Merger Sub, the Company or any of their Affiliates shall take
any action that would cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to
constitute part of a transaction that is the same as, or substantially similar
to, the "intermediary transaction tax shelter" described in IRS Notices
2001-16 and 2008-111.

(e) Straddle Period Allocation. For purposes of determining Indebtedness and
Working Capital, in the case of any Tax other than a property, ad valorem or
similar Tax imposed with respect to a Straddle Period, the portion of such Tax
that is allocable to the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing
Date shall be deemed equal to the amount which would be



payable if the relevant Straddle Period ended on the Closing Date (and, for
such purposes, the taxable period of any Subsidiary of the Company that is a
partnership or other pass-through entity or a "controlled foreign corporation"
(as defined under Section 957 of the Code), shall be deemed to terminate at
the end of the day on the Closing Date, such that any income Tax liability
arising during such Pre-Closing Tax Period is allocated to the holder of each
beneficial interest immediately before the end of the short taxable year
ending on the Closing Date), provided that all permitted allowances, credits,
exemptions and deductions that are normally computed on the basis of an entire
year period (such as depreciation and amortization deductions) shall accrue on
a daily basis and shall be allocated between the pre-Closing portion of the
Straddle Period and the post-Closing portion of the Straddle Period in
proportion to the number of days in each such period. In the case of any
property, ad valorem or similar Taxes that are payable with respect to a
Straddle Period, the portion of such Taxes attributable to the portion of such
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date will be equal to the product of all
such Taxes multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
days in the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date, and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period.

(f) Pre-Closing Tax Matters. Except to the extent required by Law, without the
prior written consent of the Securityholder Representative (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Parent and its Affiliates
shall not, and Parent and its Affiliates shall not permit the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries to, take the following actions to the extent such
action could reasonably be expected to increase an amount of Taxes for which
the Company Stockholders are liable hereunder: (i) amend or otherwise modify
any Tax Return relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (ii) make or change any
Income Tax election or accounting method or practice with respect to, or that
has retroactive effect to, any Pre-Closing Tax Period; (iii) make or initiate
any voluntary contact with a Taxing Authority that is intended to lead to a
voluntary disclosure agreement or could reasonably be expected to result in an
increase in a Tax liability for any Pre-Closing Tax Period; or (iv) take any
action relating to Taxes on the Closing Date after the Closing (other than as
expressly contemplated by this Agreement) that is outside the ordinary course
of business.

(g) Tax Treatment. The parties hereto agree that (1) the fair market value of
the capital stock of EMS Parent as of the Closing (the "EMS Parent Stock
Value") will be equal to the value described in the valuation of EMS Parent
made available to Parent prior to the date hereof (the "EMS Valuation"),
provided, however, that the Company shall cause the EMS Valuation to be
updated and provided to Parent on or before the Closing Date setting forth an
updated valuation of EMS Parent as of the Closing Date, which updated EMS
Valuation shall apply the same methodology as used to prepare the EMS
Valuation delivered to Parent prior to the date hereof, and the EMS Parent
Stock Value will be equal to the value described in such updated EMS
Valuation, and (2) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) a portion of the
Company Common Stock shall be treated as having been exchanged for shares of
capital stock of EMS Parent in a redemption that is integrated with the Merger
pursuant to Zenz v. Quinlivan, 213 F.2D 917 (6th Cir. 1954), and (ii) the
other shares of Company Common Stock shall be treated as having been exchanged
for all other aggregate Per Share Common Stock Merger Consideration in a
purchase of such Company Common Stock by Parent. Except as required under
applicable Law, no party hereto shall take any position that is



inconsistent with the value described in, or the treatment set forth in, this

consummate the reorganization transactions described on Exhibit A hereto in a
manner substantially consistent with the terms therein. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, from time to time after the date hereof, the Company may modify any

modification adversely affects Parent or R1, then the Company shall be
required to obtain the consent of Parent or R1, as applicable, prior to
implementing such modification (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned).

6.20 No Solicitation of Transactions. From the date hereof until the earlier

the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or (iv) similar transaction or business
combination involving the Company or any Company Subsidiary or a material
amount of their businesses or assets; provided that, for the avoidance of
doubt, the foregoing shall not limit the Company's and the Company
Subsidiaries' ability to effect the Reorganization (each such transaction, an
"Acquisition Transaction"). Promptly and in any event no later than five (5)
Business Days following the date hereof, the Company will instruct any third
parties to return or destroy all confidential information of the Company and

commercially reasonable efforts to prepare and deliver to Parent after the
date hereof the Company Financial Statements. The Company shall provide Parent

good faith to finalize the ASC 606 Paper as soon as reasonably practicable
after the date hereof, which ASC 606 Paper will be subject to Parent's
reasonable review and comment. Parent will lead the process related to the ASC
606 Paper. Parent shall pay (i) 50% of the documented and reasonable third
party expenses incurred after the date hereof in connection with the
preparation of the ASC 606 Paper in an aggregate amount not to exceed One
Million Dollars ($1,000,000) and (ii) 100% of such expenses in excess of One

6.25 280G Matters. To the extent that any "disqualified individual" (within
the meaning of Section 280G(c) of the Code and the regulations thereunder) has
the right to receive any payments or benefits that could be deemed to
constitute "parachute payments" (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2)(A)
of the Code and the regulations thereunder), then, the Company will (i) prior
to the Closing Date, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from each
such "disqualified individual" a waiver of such disqualified individual's
rights to some or all of such payments or benefits (the "Waived 280G
Benefits") so that any remaining payments and/or benefits shall not be deemed
to be "excess parachute payments" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the
Code and the regulations thereunder), and (ii) prior to the Closing Date, with
respect to each individual who agrees to the waiver described in clause (i),
submit to a vote of holders of the equity interests of the Company entitled to
vote on such matters, in a manner intended to comply with Section 280G(b)(5)
of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder, along with adequate
disclosure intended to satisfy such requirements (including QandA 7 of Section
1.280G-1 of such regulations), the right of any such "disqualified individual"
to receive the Waived 280G Benefits. At least three (3) Business Days prior to
soliciting such waivers and approval, the Company shall provide drafts of such
waivers and disclosure and approval materials, including the underlying
Section 280G calculations, to Parent for its review and comment prior to
soliciting such waivers, provided that the Company shall accept all reasonable
and timely comments provided by Parent. If any of the Waived 280G Benefits
fail to be approved as contemplated above, such Waived 280G Benefits shall not
be made or provided. To the extent applicable, the Company shall deliver to
Parent evidence that a vote of holders of the equity interests of the Company
was solicited in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.25
and that either (i) the requisite number of votes of holders of the equity
interests of the Company was obtained with respect to the Waived 280G Benefits
(the "280G Approval") or (ii) the 280G Approval was not obtained, and, as a
result, no Waived 280G Benefits shall be made or provided.

(d) by Parent if (i) none of Parent, R1 or Merger Sub is in material breach of
any of their respective representations, warranties or covenants hereunder and
(ii) the Company is in material breach of any of its representations,
warranties or covenants hereunder that would render any condition set forth in

(i) by the Company, unless, on or prior to such time that is two (2) hours

Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, the right to terminate this

under this Agreement has been the primary cause of, or primarily resulted in,
the failure to satisfy any condition to the obligations of the other party
hereunder.

8.02 Effect of Termination. The party desiring to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.01, shall give written notice thereof to the other party
or parties hereto. In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated in
accordance with Section 8.01, this Agreement will forthwith become void and of
no effect, each of the parties shall be relieved of its duties and obligations
arising under this Agreement and such termination shall be without any
liability to the Company, Parent, R1 or Merger Sub or their respective
Subsidiaries, officers or directors; provided, however, that (i) subject to
the terms of this Section 8.02, no such termination shall relieve any party
hereto from liability for any intentional and material breach occurring prior
to such termination, (ii) the provisions of Section 6.07, this Section 8.02,
8.03 and Article X shall remain in full force and effect and survive any
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms and (iii) in the
event the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(g) or
Section 8.01(h), as applicable, Parent, R1 or Merger Sub's obligations shall
be limited in all respects to Parent paying the Reverse Termination Fee or the
Ascension Termination Fee, as applicable. In the event of the termination of
this Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in Section 8.01:
(a) each party, if so requested by any other party, will return or destroy
promptly every document furnished to it by such other party (or any Affiliate
or Representative of such other party) in connection with the Transactions,
whether so obtained before or after the execution of this Agreement, and any
copies thereof (except for copies of documents publicly available) that may
have been made, and will use reasonable best efforts to cause its
Representatives and any Representatives of financial institutions, financing
sources and others to whom such documents were furnished promptly to return or
destroy such documents and any copies thereof any of them may have made; and
(b) the Confidentiality Agreement will remain in full force and effect and
survive the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

8.03 Termination Fees.

(a) In the event that the Company validly terminates this Agreement pursuant
to Section 8.01(g), then Parent shall pay to the Company, within three (3)
Business Days of such termination, a fee in an amount equal to $23,000,000
(the "Reverse Termination Fee") in cash by wire of immediately available funds
to an account or accounts designated by the Securityholder Representative. In
the event that the Company validly terminates this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.01(h), then Parent shall pay to the Company, within five (5)
Business Days of such termination, a fee in an amount equal to $32,200,000
(the "Ascension Termination Fee", and together with the Reverse Termination
Fee, the "Termination Fees") in cash by wire of immediately available funds to
an account or accounts designated by the Securityholder Representative. For
the avoidance of doubt, the Company will not be permitted to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(h) (or collect the Ascension Termination
Fee as a result of a termination pursuant to Section 8.01(h)) if Parent has
irrevocably waived the condition set forth in Section 7.02(h) on or prior to
the Ascension Measurement Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement or the prior termination of this Agreement, Parent shall be
entitled, within five (5) Business Days of the Company's termination of this
Agreement in accordance with this Section



8.03, in its sole discretion, to settle any claims arising from or relating to
this Agreement by consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
in accordance with the terms hereof.

(b) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that the agreements
contained in Section 8.03 are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these agreements, the parties
hereto would not enter into this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto further
acknowledges that the payment by Parent of either of the Termination Fees is
not a penalty, but constitutes liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that
will compensate the Company in the circumstances in which such fee is payable
for the efforts and resources expended and the opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which
amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. The parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that in no event shall Parent be required to pay
(i) both the Reverse Termination Fee and the Ascension Termination Fee or (ii)
the Reverse Termination Fee or the Ascension Termination Fee on more than one
occasion.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but subject to
the Company's rights expressly set forth in Section 10.13, each of the parties
hereto expressly acknowledges and agrees that the Company's right to terminate
this Agreement under Section 8.01(g) or Section 8.01(h) and the Company's
right to receive payment of either of the Termination Fees (if payable
pursuant to Section 8.03(a)) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries and each of the foregoing Person's former,
current or future Affiliates, their and their respective Affiliates'
management companies, investment vehicles, controlling persons, officers,
directors, employees, stockholders, general or limited partners, members,
managers, agents, Representatives, successors and assigns (each a "Company
Related Party") against the Parent, R1, Merger Sub, the Financing Sources,
Ascension Health and each of the foregoing Person's former, current or future
Affiliates, management companies, investment vehicles, controlling persons,
officers, directors, employees, stockholders, general or limited partners,
members, managers, agents Representatives, successors and assigns (each a
"Parent Related Party") with respect to any losses in respect of this
Agreement or the Transactions, and the Company Related Parties shall be deemed
to have waived all other remedies (including equitable remedies) with respect
to any losses suffered as a result of the failure of the Closing to occur or
for a breach or failure to perform hereunder, under the Debt Commitment Letter
or otherwise, and, upon payment of either of the Termination Fees to the
Company pursuant to Section 8.03(a), none of the Parent Related Parties shall
have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the Transactions (except that Parent shall continue to be
obligated to the Company for amounts only to the extent payable under Section
8.03(d)). Except for a claim to recover any Termination Fee (to the extent
payable), no Company Related Party shall bring, and the Company shall direct
all other Company Related Parties not to bring, and shall in no event support,
facilitate or encourage, the bringing of any Action (under any legal theory,
whether sounding in law or in equity (in each case whether for breach of
contract, in tort or otherwise)) against a Parent Related Party with respect
to, arising out of, or in connection with, the failure of the Closing to occur
or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder, under the Debt Commitment
Letter or otherwise (in any case, whether willfully, intentionally,
unintentionally or otherwise), and the Company shall cause any such Action
pending as of any termination of this Agreement to be



dismissed with prejudice as promptly as practicable after such termination.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (including this
Section 8.03), following the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
its terms, under no circumstances will any Company Related Party, or the
Company Related Parties in the aggregate, be entitled to monetary damages or
monetary remedies for any claims, damages or other losses suffered as a result
of the failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or in the
Debt Commitment Letter to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform
hereunder or thereunder or for any representation made or alleged to have been
made in connection herewith or therewith, in excess of the amount of the
applicable Termination Fee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this
Section 8.03 shall be in any way limit or modify the rights of Parent and its
Affiliates under the Debt Commitment Letter or the obligations of the
Financing Sources under the Debt Commitment Letter.

(d) If Parent fails to pay either of the Termination Fees when due, Parent
shall also pay to the Company all of the Company's reasonable costs and
expenses (including attorneys' fees) in connection with all Actions to collect
such Termination Fee and such other amounts to the extent such Termination Fee
is paid, or ordered or otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction
in a final, non-appealable order with respect thereto, to be paid, to the
Company.

ARTICLE IX

the parties contained in this Agreement shall not survive the Closing and
there shall be no liability in respect thereof, whether such liability has

Affiliates or any of their respective officers, directors, agents or other
Representatives, except that (i) those covenants and agreements that by their

such covenant is completed (after which such covenant shall terminate) (the
"Surviving Covenants") and (ii) this Article IX shall survive the Closing and
continue in full force and effect until the twenty-four (24) month anniversary
of the Closing Date. No Claim (as defined below) may be made for

good faith delivers written notice pursuant to Section 9.03 to the other party
of a Claim prior to the twenty-four (24) month anniversary of the Closing
Date, such Claim shall survive (and any applicable statute of limitations
shall be tolled), but solely with respect to the matter that is the subject of
such notice, until resolved by the parties or judicially determined by a court
of competent jurisdiction.

9.02 Indemnification for Specified Matters. Subject to the limitations set
forth in this Article IX, from and after the Closing, each of the Company
Stockholders, agrees to indemnify and hold Parent, R1, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation, their Subsidiaries and Affiliates and each of their
respective equityholders, directors, officers, employees, members, partners,
agents, representatives, successors and assigns (collectively, the
"Indemnified Parties") harmless and reimburse, solely and exclusively from the
Specified Matters Escrow Account, from, in connection with, against and in
respect of, any and all Losses incurred or suffered by any of them to the

(i) a claim for indemnification against an Indemnifying Party (as defined
below) pursuant to Section 9.02 (a "Direct Claim") or (ii) receives notice of
the assertion of any claim, the issuance of any order or the commencement of
any Action by any Person who is not a party to this Agreement or an Affiliate
of such party, including any Governmental Entity, against such Indemnified
Party (a "Third-Party Claim" and together with any Direct Claim, each, a
"Claim"), for which any Company Stockholder is or may be required to provide
indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall give written
notice thereof to the indemnifying party (the "Indemnifying Party")
(including, in each case to the extent known, by providing reasonable detail
of the facts giving rise to such Claim and the amount or estimated amount of
Losses, resulting from or based upon such Claim), together with a statement of
any available information regarding such Claim, promptly but in any event
within thirty (30) days after learning of such Claim (or within such shorter
time as may be necessary to give the Indemnifying Party a reasonable
opportunity to respond to and defend any Third-Party Claim); provided that the
failure to so notify an Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying
Party of its obligations hereunder except to the extent that (and only to the
extent that) the Indemnifying Party has been materially prejudiced thereby.

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right (subject to the limitations
set forth below), upon written notice to the Indemnified Party within thirty
(30) days after receipt from the Indemnified Party of notice of any Third-
Party Claim, to conduct at its expense the defense against such Third-Party
Claim by appointing counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party to
be the lead counsel in connection with such defense; provided, that prior to
the Indemnifying Party assuming control of such defense it shall first verify
to the Indemnified Party in writing that such Indemnifying Party shall
(subject to any dollar limitations set forth herein) be responsible for all
liabilities and obligations relating to such Third-Party Claim and that
(subject to any dollar limitations set forth herein) it shall provide
indemnification to the Indemnified Party with respect to such Action giving
rise to such Third-Party Claim. In the event that the Indemnifying Party
elects to conduct the defense of the subject Third-Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall control such defense, and the Indemnified Party will
cooperate with and make available to the Indemnifying Party such assistance
and materials as may be reasonably requested by it. The Indemnified Party
shall have the right to participate in the defense assisted by counsel of its
own choosing, it being understood that the Indemnifying Party shall control
such defense, provided that the Indemnifying Party will not be liable to the
Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses incurred by the Indemnified
Party in connection with the defense thereof, except in the event that the
Indemnified Party determines in good faith and upon the reasonable opinion of
outside counsel to the Indemnified Party that there exists a conflict of
interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party that cannot
be waived, in which case the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the
reasonable fees and expenses of one (1) counsel to the Indemnified Party,
subject to the limitations in this Article IX. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to
assume control of such defense if (1) the Third-Party Claim relates to or
arises in connection with any criminal or regulatory action taken by a
Governmental Entity, indictment, allegation or investigation, (2) the Third-
Party Claim does not involve money damages and primarily seeks an injunction
or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party, (3) upon



petition by the Indemnified Party, the appropriate court rules that the
Indemnifying Party failed or is failing to diligently prosecute or defend such
Third-Party Claim, (4) the Indemnifying Party reasonably believes in good
faith that the Losses relating to the Third-Party Claim could exceed the
maximum amount that such Indemnified Party could then be entitled to recover
under the applicable provisions of this Article IX, or (5) it is reasonably
expected that the Indemnified Party (as opposed to the Indemnifying Party)
will bear a greater portion of the Losses with respect to such Third-Party
Claim. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third-Party Claim,
no compromise or settlement of such Third-Party Claim may be effected by the
Indemnifying Party without the Indemnified Party's prior written consent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided
that if (x) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full
by the Indemnifying Party or (y) such compromise or settlement expressly and
unconditionally releases the Indemnified Party from all liabilities and
obligations with respect to such claim, then the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party is not required. If a firm offer is made to settle a Third-
Party Claim, which offer the Indemnifying Party is permitted to settle under
this Section 9.03 only upon the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party, and the Indemnifying Party desires to accept and agree to such offer,
the Indemnifying Party will give prompt written notice to the Indemnified
Party to that effect. If the Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm
offer within ten (10) days after its receipt of such notice, the Indemnified
Party may continue to contest or defend such Third-Party Claim and, in such
event, the maximum liability of the Indemnifying Party as to such Third-Party
Claim will not exceed the amount of such settlement offer. If the Indemnified
Party fails to consent to a firm offer made to settle a Third-Party Claim and
also fails to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying
Party may settle the Third-Party Claim upon the terms set forth in such firm
offer to settle such Third-Party Claim. Notwithstanding anything contained
herein to the contrary, no Indemnified Party shall settle any Third-Party
Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(c) Any Direct Claim by an Indemnified Party for indemnification not involving
a Third-Party Claim may be asserted by giving the Indemnifying Party written
notice thereof in accordance with Section 9.03(a). The Indemnifying Party
shall have thirty (30) calendar days after its receipt of such notice to
respond in writing to such Direct Claim. If the Indemnifying Party has timely
disputed its liability with respect to such Direct Claim, the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
negotiate in good faith a resolution of such dispute and, if not resolved
through negotiations within sixty (60) days after the conclusion of the thirty
(30)-day response period, such dispute shall be resolved by litigation in an
appropriate court of competent jurisdiction or by any other means to which the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall agree. If the Indemnifying
Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) calendar days
following its receipt of such notice that the Indemnifying Party disputes its
liability to the Indemnified Party, such Direct Claim specified by the
Indemnified Party in such notice shall be conclusively deemed an obligation of
the Indemnifying Party hereunder, and the Indemnified Party will direct the
Escrow Agent to pay the amount of such Losses to the Indemnified Party on
demand.



9.04 Certain Limitations.

(a) The amount of any Losses payable under this Article IX by the Indemnifying
Party shall be net of (i) any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified
Party under applicable insurance policies or from any other Person alleged to
be responsible therefor and (ii) any reduction in cash Taxes otherwise payable
(determined on a with and without basis) to the extent actually realized by
the Indemnified Party arising from the incurrence or payment of any such
Losses no later than the second taxable year after the taxable year in which
the indemnification payment is made. If the Indemnified Party or any Affiliate
thereof receives any amounts under applicable insurance policies, or from any
other Person alleged to be responsible for any Losses, subsequent to an
indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party, or actually realizes such a
reduction in Taxes (calculated as described in the preceding sentence)
subsequent to an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party, in each
case that was not taken into account under the immediately preceding sentence,
then such Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party
for any such payment made or expense incurred by such Indemnifying Party in
connection with providing such indemnification payment up to the amount
received or realized by the Indemnified Party net of any expenses incurred by
such Indemnified Party in collecting such amount and any increases in
insurance premiums.

(b) The Indemnified Parties agree to take all reasonable steps to mitigate any
Losses arising out of or relating to the Specified Matters consistent with
Delaware Law.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, recovery from
the Specified Matters Escrow Account shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
available to any Indemnified Party for Losses related to, in connection with
or arising from the Specified Matters, and on the date that the amount of cash
in the Specified Matters Escrow Account is reduced to zero, the Indemnified
Parties shall have no further rights to indemnification under this Article IX.

9.05 Release of Escrow Funds. Subject to any other limitations set forth
herein, in the event of any Remaining Specified Matters Escrow Amount on the
day that is twenty-four (24) months following the Closing Date that is not
subject to a then pending Claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 9.02,
such Remaining Specified Matters Escrow Amount shall be released to the Paying
Agent (for distribution to the Company Stockholders) pursuant to the terms of
the Escrow Agreement.

9.06 Exclusive Remedy. Each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that, from
and after the Closing (except for (i) disputes under Section 3.06, which
disputes will be resolved in accordance with the dispute mechanism set forth
in Section 3.06, (ii) any claims based upon Fraud, (iii) any claims made
pursuant to the RWI Policy or (iv) any claims based upon breach of any
Surviving Covenant) its sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all
claims relating to the subject matter of this Agreement and the Company
Disclosure Schedule and the Transactions shall be pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this Article IX; provided, however,
that each party hereto shall be entitled to specific performance for failure
of the other party to perform its obligations hereunder, as provided in
Section 10.13. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Article IX shall
limit any claims based upon Fraud.



9.07 Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. All indemnification payments
made under this Agreement shall be treated by the parties as an adjustment to
the Final Cash Merger Consideration for Tax purposes, unless otherwise
required by Law.

court), and any appellate court from any thereof, in any Action arising out of
or relating to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of
this Agreement (including any Action based upon, arising out of or related to

contained in this Agreement, each Company Related Party and each of the other
parties hereto (i) agrees that it will not bring or support any action, cause
of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description,

against the Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising
out of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing or the performance thereof

waives and hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of,
and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such
action in any such court and (iv) agrees that a final judgment in any such
action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit
on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.

10.03 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE COMPANY RELATED PARTIES AND EACH OF
OTHER PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES TO THE

10.09 Company Disclosure Schedule.

(a) The Company Disclosure Schedule and the information and disclosures
contained therein relate to and qualify certain of the representations,
warranties, covenants and obligations made by the Company in this Agreement
and shall not be construed or otherwise deemed to constitute, any
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of the Company or any other
Person except to the extent explicitly provided in the Agreement and shall not
be deemed to expand in any way the scope or effect of any of such
representations, warranties, covenants or obligations. No reference to or
disclosure of any item or other matter in the Company Disclosure Schedule
shall be construed as an admission or indication, in and of itself, that such
item represents a material



exception or material fact, event or circumstance, that such item has had or
would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, or
that such item or other matter is required to be referred to or disclosed in
the Company Disclosure Schedule. Such additional matters are set forth for
informational purposes only. No reference in the Company Disclosure Schedule
to any agreement or document, in and of itself, shall be construed as an
admission or indication that such agreement or document is enforceable or
currently in effect or that there are any obligations remaining to be
performed or any rights that may be exercised under such agreement or
document. No disclosure in the Company Disclosure Schedule relating to any
possible breach or violation of, or non-compliance with, any agreement, law or
regulation, in and of itself, shall be construed as an admission or indication
that any such breach, violation or non-compliance exists or has actually
occurred, and nothing in the Company Disclosure Schedule shall constitute an
admission of any liability or obligation of any Person to any other Person or
shall confer or give any third party any remedy, claim, liability,
reimbursement, cause of action or any other right whatsoever. Neither the
specification of any item or matter in any representation or warranty
contained in the Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in the
Company Disclosure Schedule is intended to imply that such item or matter, or
other items or matters, are or are not in the ordinary course of business, and
no party shall use the fact of the setting forth or the inclusion of any such
item or matter in any dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether
any obligation, item or matter not described in the Agreement or included in
the Company Disclosure Schedule is or is not in the ordinary course of
business for purposes of the Agreement. The Company Disclosure Schedule is
arranged in sections corresponding to the Sections in the Agreement and any
items or matters set forth in one section or subsection of the Company
Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to apply to and qualify the Section or
subsection of this Agreement to which it corresponds and each other Section or
subsection of the Agreement to the extent the relevance of such items or
matters to such other Section or subsection of this Agreement is reasonably
apparent on the face of such disclosure. The inclusion of any cross-references
to any Schedules, or the failure to include such cross-references, shall not
be deemed to mean that the relevance of any disclosure is not reasonably
apparent on its face for the purposes of the immediately preceding sentence.
The headings contained in the Company Disclosure Schedule are included for
convenience and reference only, and are not intended to limit the effect of
the disclosures contained in the Company Disclosure Schedule or to expand,
modify or influence the scope of the information required to be disclosed in
the Company Disclosure Schedule or the interpretation of this Agreement.

(b) The information contained in the Company Disclosure Schedule is
confidential, proprietary information of the Company, and Parent, R1 and
Merger Sub shall be obligated to maintain and protect such confidential
information pursuant to this Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement. In
disclosing the information in the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company
expressly does not waive any attorney-client privilege or other similar
privilege associated with such information or any protection afforded by the
work-product doctrine or other similar doctrine with respect to any of the
matters disclosed or discussed herein.

10.10 Waiver and Amendment. This Agreement may be amended, modified or
supplemented only by a mutual written agreement executed and delivered by the
Company (with the consent of the Securityholder Representative) and Parent.
Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any failure of any party to
comply with any obligation, covenant, agreement or condition



herein may be waived by the party entitled to the benefits thereof only by a
written instrument signed by the party granting such waiver, but such waiver
or failure to insist upon strict compliance with such obligation, covenant,
agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with
respect to, any subsequent or other failure. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this Section 10.10, no amendment or modification or waiver in
any manner of Section 8.03(c), Section 10.02, Section 10.03, Section 10.10,
Section 10.12, Section 10.13(b) and Section 10.16(b) (and the related
definitions in this Agreement (solely as such definitions are used therein))
that is adverse to the Financing Sources shall become effective without the
prior written consent of the adversely affected Financing Sources.

10.11 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, including by means of facsimile or email in Portable Document
Format, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of this Agreement
and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute one and
the same agreement.

10.12 Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, only the parties hereto
and their respective successors and permitted assigns except (a) as set forth
in Section 6.10, Section 10.15, and Section 10.16, (b) for the right of the
Company on behalf of the Company Stockholders to pursue damages in the event
the Closing has not occurred as a result of Parent's, R1's or Merger Sub's
breach of this Agreement or (c) after the Effective Time, if Parent or R1
shall not have made payments in accordance with Article III, the right of the
Securityholder Representative (on behalf of each Company Stockholder) to
enforce directly the Company Stockholders' right to receive the amounts
payable pursuant to Article III. Nothing herein, express or implied, is
intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or remedy
of any nature whatsoever, including any rights of employment for any specified
period, under or by reason of this Agreement; provided that the provisions of
Section 8.03(c), Section 10.02, Section 10.03, Section 10.10, this Section
10.12, Section 10.13(b) and Section 10.16(b) (and the related definitions in
this Agreement (solely as such definitions are used therein)), in each case,
solely as and to the extent pertaining to the Financing Sources, are intended
to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Financing Sources.

10.13 Remedies.

(a) Immediate, extensive and irreparable damage would occur for which monetary
damages would not be an adequate remedy in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or are otherwise breached. Accordingly, subject to Section
10.01, Section 10.02, and Section 10.13(b), if for any reason the Company,
Parent, R1 or Merger Sub shall have failed to perform its obligations under
this Agreement or otherwise breached this Agreement prior to Closing or the
earlier valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01, then the
party seeking to enforce this Agreement against such nonperforming party under
this Agreement shall be entitled to specific performance and the issuance of
immediate injunctive and other equitable relief without the necessity of
proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy, and the parties further
agree to waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in
connection with the obtaining of any such injunctive or other equitable
relief, this being in addition to and not in limitation of any other remedy to
which they



are entitled at law or in equity. Prior to the Closing or the earlier valid
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01, to the extent any
party hereto brings any Action, claim, complaint or other proceeding, in each
case, before any Governmental Entity to enforce specifically the performance
of the terms and provisions of this Agreement prior to the Closing, the
Outside Date shall automatically be extended by (i) the amount of time during
which such Action, claim, complaint or other proceeding is pending, plus 20
Business Days, or (ii) such other time period established by the court
presiding over such Action, claim, complaint or other proceeding.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (including the
provisions of Section 10.13(a)), the right of the Company to seek specific
performance of Parent's obligation to pay the Estimated Cash Merger
Consideration and to consummate the Closing in accordance with Section 2.02
shall only be available if (and so long as): (i) all conditions in Section
7.01 and Section 7.02 (other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing, but each of which is capable of being, and is
reasonably expected to be satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied or
waived at the time when the Closing would have occurred in accordance with
Section 2.02 (after taking into account the Marketing Period), (ii) the Debt
Financing has been funded or will be funded at the Closing and (iii) the
Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing to Parent (and the Company shall
not have delivered written notice purporting to revoke such notice) that (1)
all conditions in Section 7.01 and Section 7.03 have been satisfied (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing,
but each of which is capable of being, and is reasonably expected to be
satisfied at the Closing) or the Company is willing to irrevocably waive such
open condition(s) and (2) if specific performance is granted and the Debt
Financing are funded, the Company stands ready, willing and able to consummate
the Closing pursuant to Section 2.02. For the avoidance of doubt, while the
Company may pursue either a grant of specific performance of the obligations
of Parent, R1 and Merger Sub to consummate the Closing in accordance with the
provisions set forth in this Section 10.11 and payment of either of the
Termination Fees in accordance with Section 8.03, in no event shall Parent be
obligated to both (x) specifically perform the obligation to consummate the
Closing and (y) pay the Reverse Termination Fee or the Ascension Termination
Fee.

10.14 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the application of
any such provision to any Person or circumstance shall be held invalid,
illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction,
such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other
provision hereof.

10.15 Securityholder Representative.

(a) Pursuant to the adoption of this Agreement by Company Stockholders
representing greater than 50% of the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock, each Company Stockholder will be deemed to have irrevocably designated,
appointed, authorized and empowered the Securityholder Representative to act
as a representative for the benefit of each Company Stockholder as the
exclusive agent and attorney‑in‑fact with the power and authority to act on
behalf of each Company Stockholder in connection with and to facilitate the
consummation of the Transactions (including the Merger), which shall include
the power and authority as is necessary to carry out the functions assigned to
the Securityholder Representative under this Agreement;



provided, however, that the Securityholder Representative shall have no
obligation to the Company Stockholders to act, except as expressly provided
herein, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Securityholder Representative shall have the power and authority:

(i) to execute and deliver such waivers and consents in connection with this
Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements and the consummation of the
Merger and other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby as the
Securityholder Representative, in its sole discretion, may deem necessary or
desirable, including any amendments or modifications to this Agreement or the
other Transaction Agreements;

(ii) to enforce and protect the rights and interests of the Company
Stockholders and to enforce and protect the rights and interests of the
Securityholder Representative arising out of or under or in any manner
relating to this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements and the other
agreements contemplated hereby and thereby or the Merger and other
transactions provided for herein or therein, and to take any and all actions
which the Securityholder Representative believes are necessary or appropriate
under this Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements for and on behalf of
the Company Stockholders. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the Securityholder Representative may (A) assert any claim or institute any
Action, (B) investigate, defend, contest or litigate any Action initiated by
Parent, R1 or any other Person, or by any Governmental Entity against the
Securityholder Representative or any of the Company Stockholders, (C) receive
process on behalf of any or all Company Stockholders in any such Action and
compromise or settle on such terms as it shall determine to be appropriate,
and give receipts, releases and discharges with respect to, any such Action,
(D) file any proofs of debt, claims and petitions as it may deem advisable or
necessary, and (E) file and prosecute appeals from any decision, judgment or
award rendered in any such Action (it being understood that the Securityholder
Representative shall not have any obligation to take any such actions, and
shall not have any liability for any failure to take any such actions);

(iii) to refrain from enforcing any right of the Company Stockholders, arising
out of or under or in any manner relating to this Agreement or the other
documents contemplated hereby; provided, however, that no such failure to act
on the part of the Securityholder Representative, except as otherwise provided
in this Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements, shall be deemed a
waiver of any such right or interest by the Securityholder Representative or
by the Company Stockholders unless such waiver is in writing signed by the
waiving party or by the Securityholder Representative;

(iv) to make, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such other agreements,
guarantees, orders, receipts, endorsements, notices, requests, instructions,
certificates, stock powers, letters and other writings (including, without
limitation, the EMS Stockholders Agreement and any joinders thereto), and, in
general, to do any and all things and to take any and all action that the
Securityholder Representative, in its sole and absolute discretion, may
consider necessary or proper or convenient in connection with or to carry out
the Merger and other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other
Transaction



Agreements, and all other agreements, documents or instruments referred to
herein or therein or executed in connection herewith and therewith;

(v) to terminate this Agreement if the Company is entitled to do so;

(vi) to give and receive all notices and communications to be given or
received under this Agreement and to receive service of process in connection
with any claims under this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements,
including service of process in connection with any arbitration;

(vii) to determine whether to deliver a Notice of Disagreement and to resolve
any disputes regarding the Closing Statement; and

(viii) to make or receive any payments or to pay any expenses under or in
connection with this Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements or on
behalf of the Company Stockholders, including by using the Securityholder
Representative Expense Amount (and any interest or earnings thereon) to
satisfy costs, expenses and/or liabilities of the Securityholder
Representative in connection with matters related to this Agreement or the
other Transaction Agreements, with any balance of the Securityholder
Representative Expense Amount not used for such purposes to be disbursed and
paid, at such time as the Securityholder Representative determines, in its
sole discretion, that no additional such costs, expenses or liabilities shall
become due and payable, to the Company Stockholders in accordance with Section
3.06(f), which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not be prior to the
determination of the Final Cash Merger Consideration.

(b) Parent and R1 may rely upon all actions taken or omitted to be taken by
the Securityholder Representative pursuant to this Agreement and the other
Transaction Agreements, all of which actions or omissions shall be legally
binding upon the Company Stockholders.

(c) The grant of authority provided for herein (i) is coupled with an interest
and shall be irrevocable and survive the death, incompetency, bankruptcy or
liquidation of any Company Stockholder and (ii) shall survive the consummation
of the Merger and other transactions contemplated hereby and by the other
Transaction Agreements.

(d) All actions taken by the Securityholder Representative under this
Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements shall be binding upon all
Company Stockholders and their respective successors and assigns as if
expressly confirmed and ratified in writing by each of them. Parent shall
serve notice to, and deal exclusively with, the Securityholder Representative
with respect to any and all matters concerning any of the Company Stockholders
arising out of or related to this Agreement or the other Transaction
Agreements and all other agreements or instruments contemplated hereby or
thereby or the Merger and other transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,
unless otherwise instructed by the Securityholder Representative, and shall be
entitled to rely conclusively (without further evidence of any kind
whatsoever) on any document purported by the Securityholder Representative to
have been executed by or on behalf of any of the Company Stockholders as fully
binding upon them. If the Securityholder Representative shall resign,
dissolve, cease to exist or otherwise be unable to fulfill its
responsibilities as representative of the Company



Stockholders, the Company Stockholders shall, within 10 days after the
occurrence of such event, appoint (by majority vote or written consent of the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock) a successor representative and,
promptly thereafter, shall notify the Company Stockholders and Parent of the
identity of such successor. Any such successor shall succeed to the rights and
obligations of the Securityholder Representative as representative of the
Company Stockholders hereunder. If for any reason there is no Securityholder
Representative at any time, all references herein or in any other agreement or
instrument contemplated hereby to the Securityholder Representative in which
the Securityholder Representative is authorized to act on behalf of the
Company Stockholders shall be deemed to refer to the Company Stockholders.
Each Company Stockholder upon the execution of a Letter of Transmittal, agrees
that any action taken by the Securityholder Representative on its behalf
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the other Transaction Agreements and
the other agreements and instruments contemplated hereby and thereby,
including all actions and inactions permitted by this Section 10.15, shall be
fully binding on them.

(e) By the execution of a Letter of Transmittal each Company Stockholder
irrevocably shall agree and acknowledge that the Securityholder Representative
shall have no liability to any Company Stockholder with respect to actions
taken or omitted to be taken in its capacity as the Securityholder
Representative and that the Securityholder Representative shall be under no
obligation to take any action in its capacity as the Securityholder
Representative, unless the Securityholder Representative has been provided
with funds, security or indemnities which, in the sole determination of
Securityholder Representative, are sufficient to protect the Securityholder
Representative against the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be
incurred by the Securityholder Representative in responding to such direction
or taking such action. By the execution of a Letter of Transmittal each
Company Stockholder irrevocably shall agree that the Securityholder
Representative shall be entitled to engage such counsel, experts and other
agents and consultants as it shall deem necessary in connection with
exercising its powers and performing its function hereunder and (in the
absence of bad faith on the part of the Securityholder Representative) shall
be entitled to conclusively rely on the opinions and advice of such persons.
By the execution of a Letter of Transmittal each Company Stockholder
irrevocably shall agree that the Securityholder Representative shall be
entitled to indemnification from the Company Stockholders against any loss,
liability or expenses arising out of actions taken or omitted to be taken in
its capacity as the Securityholder Representative (except for those arising
out of Securityholder Representative's gross negligence or willful
misconduct), including the costs and expenses of investigation and defense of
claims. The Company Stockholders will indemnify the Securityholder
Representative in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence on a pro
rata basis based on their respective equity interest in the Company as of
immediately prior to the Closing.

(f) The parties acknowledge that the Securityholder Representative's
obligations under this Section 10.15 are solely as a representative of the
Company Stockholders and that the Securityholder Representative shall have no
personal responsibility or liability for any expenses, costs or other
liabilities incurred by it in such capacity.

10.16 No Recourse.



(a) Except pursuant to the Letters of Transmittal, notwithstanding anything
that may be expressed or implied in this Agreement or any document or
instrument delivered in connection herewith, by its acceptance of the benefits
of this Agreement, each party covenants, agrees and acknowledges that no
Persons other than the parties hereto have any liabilities, obligations,
commitments (whether known or unknown or whether contingent or otherwise)
hereunder, and that, notwithstanding that the Company Stockholders of the
Company or their respective managing members or general partners may be
partnerships or limited liability companies, no party has any right of
recovery under this Agreement, or any claim based on such liabilities,
obligations, commitments against, and no personal liability shall attach to,
the former, current or future Company Stockholders, controlling persons,
directors, officers, employees, agents, Affiliates, members, managers or
general or limited partners of any of party or any former, current or future
stockholder, controlling person, director, officer, employee, general or
limited partner, member, manager, Affiliate or agent of any of the foregoing
(collectively, but not including the parties hereto, each a "Non-Recourse
Party"), through a party hereto or otherwise, whether by or through attempted
piercing of the corporate veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of a
party hereto against any Non-Recourse Party, by the enforcement of any
assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute,
regulation or Law, or otherwise.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no
Company Related Party shall have any rights or claims against any Financing
Source in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and no Financing Source shall
have any rights or claims against any Company Related Party, in connection
with this Agreement, the Debt Financing or the transaction contemplated hereby
or thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise;
provided that following consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the foregoing will not limit the rights of the parties to the Debt
Financing under any commitment letter related thereto. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no Financing Source
shall be subject to any special, consequential, punitive or indirect damages
or damages of a tortious nature.

10.17 Representation. Parent and R1 hereby agree, on their own behalf and on
behalf of its Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees,
agents, representatives, successors and permitted assigns (the "Waiving
Parties") that Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP may represent any or all of the
Company Stockholders in the event such Person so requests, in connection with
any dispute, litigation, claim, proceeding or obligation arising out of or
relating to Section 3.06 and otherwise provide advice with respect to the
interpretation of, and any negotiations in connection with, this Agreement and
the Transactions or in connection with any other matter relating to the
process for the sale of the Company by the Company Stockholders, and Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company hereby waive (individually and on behalf of any
Waiving Party claiming by, through or on behalf of any of them) any conflicts
that may arise in connection with such representation. Each of Parent, R1 and
the Company, for itself and the Waiving Parties, hereby irrevocably
acknowledges and agrees that all communications pertaining to the Company
Stockholders or any of their Affiliates, or any of their respective officers,
directors, employees, agents, representatives, successors and permitted
assigns (the "Seller Group") and their counsel, including Weil, Gotshal and
Manges LLP, made in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution
and delivery of this



Agreement or relating to the process for the sale of the Company by the
Company Stockholders, are privileged communications between the Seller Group
and such counsel and none of Parent, R1, the Company or any of the Waiving
Parties, nor any Person purporting to act on behalf of or through Parent, R1
or the Company or any of the Waiving Parties, will seek to obtain the same by
any process; provided, that applicable communications between the Company or
any Company Subsidiary and their respective legal counsel, in each case, that
were not made in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and
delivery of this Agreement or that does not relate to the process for the sale
of the Company by the Company Stockholders shall pass to the Company or such
Company Subsidiary. From and after the Closing, each of Parent and the
Company, on behalf of itself and the Waiving Parties, waives and will not
assert any attorney-client privilege with respect to any communication between
Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP and the Company or any Person in the Seller Group
occurring during the representation in connection with the negotiation,
preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other agreements
contemplated hereby and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby.
