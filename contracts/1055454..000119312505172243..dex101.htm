less than 60 days), entered into in the ordinary course of business;





 

12 (f) all contracts or agreements relating to the Companys indebtedness for
borrowed money; 



(g) any written employment contract currently in effect, other than any

Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.12_ of the Disclosure Schedule, Seller has
delivered or made available to Buyer, in all material respects, true and
correct copies of all such Material Contracts. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, _Schedule 3.12_ of the Disclosure Schedule shall
not be required to, and the term "Material Contracts" shall not, include (i)
any contracts or agreements relating to the acquisition of any of the
properties or assets of the Company if the obligations of the
Company thereunder have been fully performed (except for customary
assumptions of liabilities of sellers and indemnification obligations as to
post-closing operations of acquired businesses), (ii) contracts or agreements
granting rights to publish, license, distribute publications, programs or
other works that have been performed in full by the Company or do not require
future royalty payments or contain other material continuing obligations of

orders for products, materials, goods or services in the ordinary course of

be terminated effective as of or prior to the Closing, including, without
limitation, in the case of the Employment Agreements, dated as of August 8,
2001, between the Company and Gary Facente (the "Employment Agreement"), those
obligations of Gary Facente pursuant to Section 9 of the Employment
Agreement, which would otherwise have survived the termination of his
employment with the Company. Unless otherwise noted on _Schedule 3.12_ of the
Disclosure Schedule, to the knowledge of Seller, the Material Contracts are
in full force and effect (except as the same may terminate or expire or may
have terminated or expired in accordance with the terms thereof), and the
Company is not in default of, nor has there occurred an event or condition
which, with the passage of time or giving of notice (or both) would constitute
a Company default of, any Material Contract, which default, and the cost of
curing the same, would individually or in the aggregate have a Material
Adverse Effect.



 

13 3.13 _Compliance with Laws_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.13_ of the
Disclosure Schedule, there is no violation by the Company of any applicable
federal, state or local statute, law or regulation (including, without

Schedule, there is not pending, nor, to the knowledge of Seller, threatened,

the Disclosure Schedule, the Company has all governmental authorizations,
licenses, franchises and permits necessary to the operations of the Business,

matter relating to any of the Real Properties from a governmental authority
that alleges that it is not in such compliance.

employees of the Company or the employees of Buyer engaged in the Business, or
any other person whose assistance, testimony or presence is necessary to
assist Seller or any of Seller Indemnitees to evaluate any of such claims or

ordinary course of business or as permitted elsewhere in this Agreement).



5.5 _Buyer s Qualifications_. Buyer will not knowingly take any action or
omit to take any action, or cause to be taken or to occur any action or

consents and approvals of, any governmental agency or any third party required

furnish to the other party hereto such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as such other party may reasonably request in connection with its
preparation of such necessary notices to or filings with or authorizations,
consents and approvals of any such governmental agency or third party.



5.7 _Certain Employee Matters_. Until December 31, 2005, Buyer shall continue
substantially the same retirement and welfare plans applicable to the
Companys employees as are in effect immediately prior to the Closing; except
that Seller shall cause the Companys Fidelity Investments, 401K Plan to be
terminated at Closing. Nothing contained in this Section 5.7 shall be deemed
to grant any such employee any right to continued employment after
the Closing Date.



 

24 5.8 _Confidential Information_. Buyer agrees that from and after the date
hereof until and including the Closing Date:



(a) it shall preserve and maintain all confidential or proprietary
information and trade secrets of or relating to Seller, the Company or the
Business received or obtained in any form by Buyer or any of its Affiliates or
representatives from Seller, the Company or any of their
respective representatives, and shall not disclose any of same to any person
or entity or use any such confidential or proprietary information or trade
secret for personal advantage or to the detriment of the Company, Seller or
any of the members thereof, except that Buyer shall be free to use and
disclose such proprietary information and trade secrets which (A) were already
in Buyers possession at the time of disclosure to Buyer or any of its
Affiliates or representatives by Seller, the Company or any of their
respective representatives, (B) are a matter of public knowledge other than as
a result of actions taken or disclosures made by or on behalf of Buyer or any
of its Affiliates or representatives, or (C) are lawfully obtained by Buyer
from a third person not under any restriction or duty as to confidentiality.



(b) Nothing contained herein should be deemed to negate or limit Sellers
rights or any obligations of Buyer or any of its Affiliates under that certain
letter agreement dated July 21, 2004 with Seller (the "Confidentiality
Agreement"). The Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect.



(c) Because the remedy at law for any breach of the provisions of subsection
(a) immediately above would be inadequate, Buyer hereby consents to
the granting by any court of an injunction or other equitable relief, without
the necessity of actual damage or irreparable harm being proved or the posting
of any bond or other security, with respect to any breach or threatened breach
of any of such provisions.



(d) The provisions of this Section 5.8 shall survive any termination of this
Agreement. Without intending to limit the provisions of Section 5.8 hereof, if
this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 6.1 hereof, or
otherwise, Buyer shall (i) immediately deliver all documents, work papers and
other materials furnished to Buyer or any of its Affiliates or
representatives, whether obtained before or after the execution of this
Agreement, and (ii) destroy all documents, work papers and other materials
developed by or for Buyer or any of its accountants, agents or employees,
which embody proprietary or confidential information or trade secrets of
Seller, the Company or the Business or immediately deliver such documents,
work papers and other materials to Seller.

 



(e) In addition, it is the desire and intent of the parties hereto that the
provisions of this Section 5.8 shall be enforced to the fullest extent
permissible under the laws and public policies applied in each jurisdiction in
which enforcement may be sought. Accordingly, if any particular provision of
this Section 5.8 shall be adjudicated to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable
in any respect, such provision shall be deemed amended to delete therefrom the
portion thus adjudicated to be invalid, illegal



 

25 or unenforceable, such deletion to apply only with respect to the operation of
such provision in the particular jurisdiction in which such adjudication is
made, and the remaining provisions contained herein shall not in any way be
affected thereby. Further, if any one or more of the provisions contained in
this Section 5.8 shall for any reason be held to be excessively broad as to
duration, geographical scope, activity or subject, such provision(s) shall be
construed by limiting and reducing the same, so as to be enforceable to the
maximum extent under the applicable law as it shall then exist. 



5.9 _Transactional Taxes_. Buyer and Seller shall each be responsible for one
half of any and all sales, transfer or conveyance Taxes imposed (other than
income taxes imposed on Seller) by any and all Governmental Authorities with
respect to the transfer of the Membership Interests to Buyer pursuant to this
Agreement (collectively "Transaction Taxes").



5.10 _Books and Records_.



(a) On reasonable notice at any time and from time to time after the Closing
Date, Buyer shall permit Seller and its successors, and the representatives
thereof, at Sellers sole cost and expense, reasonable access, during normal
business hours, to all correspondence, contracts, agreements and other books
and records pertaining to the Company or the Business for purposes of
inspection and/or copying, provided however, that Seller or such successors or
representatives shall agree to keep such information confidential pursuant to
the terms of a commercially reasonable confidentiality agreement to be entered
into at the time of such disclosure, it being understood, however, that such
confidentiality agreement shall not prevent or limit disclosure or use in
connection with tax returns and reports and/or the preparation thereof, or the
investigation and/or defense of any claim(s) and/or any dispute(s) related to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby. Buyer shall
cause all such materials to be preserved for at least seven (7) years after
the Closing Date and shall not thereafter destroy or otherwise dispose of any
such materials unless it shall have notified Seller and its successors at
least six (6) months before such disposition and given Seller and its
successors the opportunity to remove and retain such materials.



(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing confidentiality requirement, Buyer agrees
that, for a period of seven (7) years after the Closing Date, it shall
assist and cooperate with Seller and its successors in collecting and
assembling information relating to the operations of the Company prior to the
Closing, which customarily has been provided or used, or which may be
requested by Seller, in connection with the preparation of any and all Tax
returns, information returns, financial statements, government filings, or
other reports required to be filed by or for Seller with any taxing authority
and shall make available to Seller and its successors the services of
personnel reasonably necessary to enable any of them or any affiliate or agent
of any of them to prepare and file any and all Tax returns, information
returns, financial statements, government filings or other reports required to
be filed with any taxing authority and/or to respond to and conduct any and
all Tax audits or other Tax determinations or proceedings.



 

26 5.11 _HSR Compliance_. Each of the parties hereto shall make all notification
and report form filings, and thereafter shall promptly make any other
submissions, with respect to this Agreement and the Transactions required
under the HSR Act, including without limitation all supplemental information
requested in connection therewith, and such filings shall specifically
request early termination of the waiting period prescribed by the HSR Act. All
filing fees under the HSR Act shall be borne and timely paid by Buyer. At
Closing, Buyer shall be entitled to deduct from the one-half of such HSR Fees
paid by Buyer in accordance with Section 1.2, above. In the event this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 6, below (other than pursuant to
Section 6.1(d)), the Company shall reimburse Buyer for one-half of such HSR
Fees paid by Buyer. The parties hereto shall cooperate and consult with each
other in connection with the making of such filings, including by providing
copies of all such documents to the non-filing party and its advisors a
reasonable period of time prior to filing or the giving of notice. No party
to this Agreement shall consent to any voluntary extension of any statutory
deadline or waiting period or to any voluntary delay of the consummation of
transactions contemplated in this Agreement at the behest of any Governmental
Authority without the consent and agreement of the other party to this
Agreement, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Each
party hereto shall promptly inform the other of any material communication to
it from the Federal Trade Commission or the Department of Justice regarding
any of the Transactions. If any party hereto or any of its Affiliates receives
a request for additional information or documentary material from any such
Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, then such party will endeavor in good faith to make, or cause to be
made, as soon as reasonably possible, and after consultation with the other
party hereto, an appropriate response in compliance with such request. Buyer
will advise Seller promptly in respect of any understanding, undertaking or
agreement (oral or written) which Buyer proposes to make or enter into with
the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice or any other
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Buyer
shall use its best efforts to promptly resolve such objections, if any,
as may be asserted with respect to any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement by any Governmental Authority and shall take such steps
necessary to avoid or eliminate each impediment asserted or argued by any
Governmental Authority so as to enable the parties to expeditiously close the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



5.12 _Certain Tax Matters_. The following provisions apply to certain tax
matters following the Closing Date:



(a) Seller shall be entitled to prepare or cause to be prepared all Tax
Returns for the Company for all periods ending on or prior to the Closing
Date which are filed after the Closing Date. Buyer shall timely file or shall
cause the Company to timely file such Tax Returns and pay all Taxes shown as
due thereon provided that Buyer shall not be responsible for, and Seller shall
pay, all income Taxes and state income or franchise Taxes of the Company, if
any, solely on the transfer of the Membership Interests to Buyer.



 

27 (b) Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed
any Tax Returns of the Company for Tax periods which begin before and end
after the Closing Date. Buyer shall permit Seller to review and comment on
such Tax Returns prior to filing and shall make such revisions to such Tax
Returns as are reasonably requested by Seller. For purposes of this
Agreement, in the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and
are payable for a Taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the
Closing Date, the portion of such Tax which relates to the portion of
such Taxable period ending on the Closing Date shall (x) in the case of any
Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to income or receipts, be deemed
to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Taxable period multiplied by a
fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the Taxable period
ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days
in the entire Taxable period, and (y) in the case of any Tax based upon or
related to income or receipts be deemed equal to the amount which would be
payable if the relevant Taxable period ended at the time of the Closing. Any
credits relating to a Taxable period that begins before and ends after the
Closing Date shall be taken into account as though the relevant Taxable
period ended on the Closing Date. All determinations necessary to give effect
to the foregoing allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with prior
practice of the Company, and in compliance with all applicable laws.



(c) [INTENTIONALLY DELETED]



(d) If, after the Closing, any party hereto receives notice of
any assessment, official inquiry, examination or proceeding that could result
in an official determination with respect to Taxes due or payable by the
Company for any Tax year or period of the Company ending on or before the
Closing Date, such party shall promptly notify the other in writing.



(e) With respect to the contest and/or settlement of any issue raised in any
assessment, official inquiry, examination or proceeding that could result in
an official determination with respect to Taxes due or payable for any Tax
year or period of the Company ending on or before the Closing Date, or any
Taxes for which Seller is responsible under Section 5.12(a) hereof, Seller
shall have the right, at its own expense, to conduct the contest and/or
settlement of such issue. Buyer shall have the right, at Buyers expense, to
participate with Seller in the negotiations with respect to any such issue
but, notwithstanding such participation, Seller shall control the proceedings
and have the final say with respect to such negotiations and any disposition
of such issue.



(f) After the Closing Date, Buyer shall be permitted to file an amended Tax
Return with respect to the Company for any Tax year or period without
obtaining the consent of Seller; provided, however, that the prior written
consent of Seller shall be required if any such amended Return could give
rise to a liability of Seller (or of any Person, directly or indirectly,
liable for Taxes by reason of the limited liability company status of the
Company and/or Seller) (i) to Buyer under this Agreement or (ii) to any
Governmental Authority.



 

28 (g) After the Closing Date, Seller shall not make any material Tax election or
materially change its method of Tax accounting with respect to the Company.



5.13  _Resignations_. At or prior to Closing, Seller shall instruct each of
those persons identified on _Schedule 5.13_ of the Disclosure Schedule who is
an officer, or a trustee, custodian or authorized signatory under any bank or
other depository accounts or employee benefit plan, as applicable, of the
Company to resign from such position or positions.



5.14 _Excluded Liabilities_. Seller shall be responsible for, and shall with
reasonable promptness pay all of the Excluded Liabilities not otherwise paid
by Buyer on Sellers behalf pursuant to Section 1.2 above, except for those
Excluded Liabilities that are being contested or subject to further
calculation in good faith by Seller.



5.15 _Possible HSR Delay Price Adjustment_. In the event that the waiting
period under the HSR Act applicable to the sale of the Membership Interests to
Buyer shall not have expired or been terminated on or prior to August 31, 2005
(the "Stated Date"), and such failure to expire or terminate is not due to a
breach by Buyer Section 4.5, Section 5.5 or Section 5.11 hereof, Seller agrees
that (a): if the Closing shall occur, the Purchase Price shall (without double
counting for any reduction contemplated by clause (ii) of the second sentence
of Section 1.2 hereof) be reduced by sum of (x) any payments of principal
made by the Company after the Stated Date and prior to the Closing in respect
of indebtedness under the Credit Agreement or any institutional indebtedness
for borrowed money (other than in respect of Capital Leases), and (y) any
payments made by the Company after the Stated Date and prior to the Closing of
interest or fees in respect of the foregoing (other than in respect of Capital
Leases) accrued on or prior to the Stated Date, it being understood and
agreed, however, that the Purchase Price shall not be reduced for any payments
in respect of the Credit Agreement and/or any institutional indebtedness for
borrowed money on or prior to the Stated Date or in respect of any payments
of any and all interest and fees, in respect of the Credit Agreement and/or
any institutional indebtedness for borrowed money, accruing after the Stated
Date; and (b) after the Stated Date, until the earlier of the Closing Date or
the date that this Agreement shall been terminated for any reason whatsoever,
the Company shall not make any distributions or dividends to Seller in respect
of the Membership Interests.



ARTICLE 6



Termination



6.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Closing:



(a) by mutual written consent of Seller and Buyer;



 

29 (b) by Seller, if the Closing does not occur on or before the 60th day after
the date of this Agreement (the "Termination Date");



(c) by Buyer, if Seller shall breach or default in performance of any of its
material representations, warranties or obligations under this Agreement
(except, in any case, such breaches and defaults which would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or to affect materially and
adversely the ability of Seller to effect the Closing), and either (i) such
breach or default in performance is not capable of being cured or shall not
have been cured or waived within fifteen (15) days after written notice
thereof from Buyer to Seller, or (ii) Seller shall not have provided
reasonable assurance that such breach or default in performance shall be cured
on or before the then scheduled Closing Date;



(d) by Seller, if Buyer shall breach or default in performance of any of
its material representations, warranties or obligations under this Agreement,
and such breach or default in performance is not capable of being cured or
shall not have been cured or waived within fifteen (15) days after notice
thereof from Seller to Buyer;



(e) by Buyer, if any of the material conditions set forth in Section 2.4 of
this Agreement shall not have been fulfilled by the Termination Date (unless
the nonfulfillment results from Buyers breach of any material representation
or warranty or Buyers failure to perform any material covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement); or



(f) by Seller, if any of the material conditions set forth in Section 2.5 of
this Agreement shall not have been fulfilled by the Termination Date (unless
the nonfulfillment results from Sellers breach of any material representation
or warranty or Sellers failure to perform any material covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement).



The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 6.1
shall give written notice of such termination to the other party or parties
hereto.



6.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement as
provided in Section 6.1 hereof, (a) this Agreement shall immediately become
void and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Buyer or
Seller or their respective officers, directors, stockholders, general or
limited partners, members or Affiliates, except as set forth in Section 6.3
hereof; _provided_ that the provisions of Sections 5.8, 6.3, 8.4, 8.5 and 8.13
of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and survive any
termination of this Agreement, and (b) such termination shall relieve each
party to this Agreement from all breaches or defaults under this Agreement
that occurred prior to such termination other than as provided in said Section
6.3.



6.3 _Remedies_. In the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 6.1 hereof, any party hereto shall have the right to recover



 

30 damages sustained by such party as a result of any breach by any other party
or parties hereto of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement; it being further agreed that no party hereto
shall be entitled to injunctive relief, specific performance or any other
equitable remedy in connection with this Agreement.



ARTICLE 7



Indemnification



7.1 _Obligation to Indemnify_.



(a) If the Closing shall occur, and subject to the terms and conditions of
this _Article 7_ , Buyer hereby agrees to save, indemnify and hold
harmless Seller, and the respective officers, directors, members, managers,
employees, agents, Affiliates and representatives of Seller, and the officers
and directors of such members and managers (collectively, with Seller "Seller
Indemnitees") from and against:



(i) any loss, liability or damage suffered or incurred by any Seller
Indemnitee(s) by reason of any breach by Buyer of any representation or
warranty of Buyer set forth in this Agreement;



(ii) any loss, liability or damage suffered or incurred by any Seller
Indemnitee(s) by reason of the nonfulfillment by Buyer of any covenant or
agreement to be performed or complied with by Buyer under or pursuant to this
Agreement or any of the Buyer Documents;



(iii) any loss, liability or damage suffered or incurred by any Seller
Indemnitee(s) arising out of or related to any of the operations, business
or activities of the Company or the Business after the Closing or any
liability or obligation of the Company other than Excluded Liabilities,
provided that such loss, liability or damage is not the result of a breach by
Seller of any representation or warranty of Seller set forth in this
Agreement; and



(iv) any actions, suits, proceedings, judgments, costs and expenses,
including reasonable attorneys fees, incident to any of the foregoing, or
incurred in enforcing any of the obligations under this Section 7.1(a).



(b) If the Closing shall occur, and subject to the terms and conditions
of this _Article 7_ , Seller hereby agrees to save, indemnify and hold
harmless Buyer, the Company and Buyers officers, directors and stockholders
(collectively, with Buyer and the Company, "Buyer Indemnitees") from and
against: 



(i) any loss, liability or damage suffered or incurred by any Buyer
Indemnitee(s) by reason of any breach by Seller of any representation or
warranty of Seller set forth in this Agreement;



 

31 (ii) any loss, liability or damage suffered or incurred by Buyer Indemnitee(s)
by reason of the nonfulfillment by Seller of any covenant or agreement to be
performed or complied with by Seller under or pursuant to this Agreement;



(iii) any liability suffered or incurred by any Buyer Indemnitee(s) arising
out of claims by third parties against any Buyer Indemnitee(s) for
any Excluded Liabilities; and



(iv) any actions, suits, proceedings, judgments, costs and expenses,
including reasonable attorneys fees, incident to any of the foregoing, or
incurred in enforcing any of the obligations under this Section 7.1(b).



7.2 _Procedure Relative to Indemnification_.



(a) In the event that any party hereto shall claim that it is entitled to
be indemnified pursuant to the terms of this Section 7.2, it (the "Claiming
Party") shall so notify the party against which the claim is made (the
"Indemnifying Party") in writing (the "Claims Notice") of such claim within a
reasonable period of time after the Claiming Party receives notice of any
demand, claim or circumstance which, is reasonably likely to give rise to a
claim or the commencement of any Proceeding (an "Asserted Liability") that
may reasonably be expected to result in a claim for indemnification by the
Claiming Party against the Indemnifying Party, or such earlier time as is
reasonable and appropriate to avoid prejudice to the Indemnifying Party;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that failure to give such notification shall not
affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the
Indemnifying Party shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such
failure. The Claims Notice shall describe the Asserted Liability in
reasonable detail, and shall indicate the amount (estimated, if necessary) of
the losses that have been or are expected to suffered by the Claiming Party;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Claiming Partys right to
recoup losses from the Indemnifying Party be limited to the amount set forth
or estimated in the Claims Notice if such notice is reasonable under the
circumstances. If such losses are liquidated in amount, the Claims Notice
shall so state and such amount shall be deemed the amount of the claim of the
Claiming Party. If the amount is not liquidated, the Claims Notice shall so
state and in such event a claim shall be deemed asserted against the
Indemnifying Party on behalf of the Claiming Party, but no payment shall be
made on account thereof until the amount of such claim is liquidated and the
claim is finally determined. Seller shall be entitled to apply amounts held
under the Escrow Agreement to pay and/or satisfy Losses and/or settlements in
respect of claims for which Seller is obligated to indemnify Buyer or any of
the Buyer Indemnitees, and Buyer shall cooperate in all reasonable respects
and in a timely manner to permit said uses, as requested by Seller from time
to time.



 

32 (b) The following provisions shall apply to claims of the Claiming Party which
are based upon any claim or Proceeding made, filed or instituted by any third
party or by any Governmental Body:



(i) Upon receipt of a Claims Notice involving an Asserted Liability against,
or sought to be collected by a third party from, the Claiming Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall have a reasonable period of time (but in any event
in such period of time as is reasonable and appropriate to avoid prejudice to
the Claiming Party) within which to notify the Claiming Party whether the
Indemnifying Party desires to defend against such Asserted Liability. If
the Indemnifying Party so notifies the Claiming Party that the Indemnifying
Party desires to defend against such Asserted Liability, then the Indemnifying
Party shall assume the defense of such Asserted Liability with counsel of the
Indemnifying Partys choice and, the Indemnifying Party will not, as long as
it diligently conducts such defense, be liable to the Claiming Party under
this Section 7.2 for any fees of other counsel or any other expenses with
respect to the defense of such Asserted Liability, in each case incurred by
the Claiming Party in connection with such Asserted Liability. The Claiming
Party shall cooperate, at the Indemnifying Partys expense, in the compromise
of, or defense against such Asserted Liability and may participate in, but
not control, such Asserted Liability at its own expense. If the Indemnifying
Party is controlling the defense of an Asserted Liability, no compromise or
settlement of such Asserted Liability may be effected without the Claiming
Partys consent (which consent shall not be withheld unreasonably) unless the
sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid or provided for in full
by the Indemnifying Party, in which event the Claiming Party shall promptly
consent thereto. If a Claims Notice is given to an Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnifying Party does not timely notify the Claiming Party that it does not
elects to assume the defense of such Asserted Liability, the Claiming Party
will have the right to conduct a defense of the Asserted Liability in a
reasonable and prudent manner and, subject to all of the limitations on
indemnification set forth in this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party will be
bound by any reasonable and prudent compromise or settlement made with
respect to such Asserted Liability effected by the Claiming Party.



(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Asserted Liability is likely to
adversely affect a Claiming Party or its Affiliates other than as a result
of monetary damages for which it would be entitled to indemnification under
this Agreement or the Indemnification Agreement, such Claiming Party may, by
notice to the Indemnifying Party, have the right to jointly defend, compromise
or settle such Asserted Liability, but the Indemnifying Party will not be
bound by any determination of an Asserted Liability so defended or any
compromise or settlement effected without its consent (which may not be
withheld unreasonably).



7.3 _Survival and Other Matters_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement:



(a) Each representation, warranty, indemnity, covenant and agreement of each
of the parties hereto shall survive the Closing for the respective applicable
period set forth below (each a "Survival Period"). No party shall be entitled
to assert any claim against the other for misrepresentation or breach of
warranty, indemnity, covenant or agreement under or pursuant to this Agreement
unless the person or entity asserting such claim shall notify the indemnifying
party in writing of such claim, in reasonable detail, during the period
ending on the expiration of the



 

33 applicable Survival Period, in which case the indemnified partys right to
indemnification will survive, but only with respect to the matters so
described in such notice. For the purposes hereof:



(i) the representations, warranties, indemnities, covenants and agreements of
Buyer shall survive for a period of eighteen (18) months from and after the
date of Closing, except that the covenants and agreements of Buyer pursuant
to Sections 5.3, 5.7, 5.9, 5.12 and 7.1(a)(iii) hereof, and under the
provisions of Section 7.1(a)(iv) to extent related thereto, shall survive the
Closing indefinitely;



(ii) the representations and warranties of Seller set forth in Sections 3.1(d)
and (e) shall survive for a period of thirty six (36) months from and after
the Closing Date indefinitely (the "Title and Enabling Representations");



(iii) any failure of Seller to satisfy an Excluded Liability or the breach of
Sections 3.6(d), 3.16(e), 5.2(g), and 5.12(g) shall survive for a period
of thirty six (36) months from and after the Closing Date.



(iv) all other representations, warranties, indemnities, covenants and
agreements of Seller shall survive for a period of eighteen (18) months from
and after the date of Closing.



Except for liability under Section 7.1(b)(iii) hereof, and under the
provisions of Section 7.1(b)(iv) hereof to the extent relating solely to said
Section 7.1(b)(iii) liability, Seller shall not have any liability under this
_Article 7_ or otherwise under or in connection with this Agreement or for any
reason or matter whatsoever, except to the extent that the aggregate amount
of Sellers liabilities under this _Article 7_ (but for this Section 7.3(b))
exceeds one million dollars ($1,000,000) (the "Basket Amount"). The maximum
aggregate liability that Seller shall have under or in connection with any
and all of this Agreement and the Seller Documents and/or any and all of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and/or the Seller Documents shall
in no event exceed the aggregate sum of fifteen million dollars ($15,000,000),
it being further agreed that, to the extent Seller shall be entitled to the
disbursement to it, in connection with the 18 month anniversary of the
Closing, of any amount held under the Escrow Agreement said $15,000,000 cap
shall be reduced by the amount to which Seller is so entitled (said
$15,000,000, as and when the same is so reduced from time to time, being the
"Cap"); it being further agreed that the reimbursement to Buyer pursuant to
the Escrow Agreement of amounts held in escrow thereunder shall be the sole
remedy and sole source of recovery of Buyer and the other Buyer Indemnitees
for any and all liabilities of Seller whatsoever, it being understood that
Buyer shall also have such rights and remedies as are set forth in
the Indemnification Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Basket
Amount shall not apply to claims based on the Title and Enabling
Representations, any claim based on Sellers failure to satisfy an Excluded
Liability, or Sellers breach of Sections 3.6(d), 3.16(e), 5.2(g) and
5.11(g).



(b) Neither Buyer nor any Buyer Indemnitee shall be entitled to assert any
claim or demand for any amount that in the aggregate, together with the



 

34 aggregate amount of all other claims and demands previously made by Buyer or
any Buyer Indemnitee and for which Seller is or was liable, exceeds the Cap
or would exceed the Cap but for this Section 7.3.



(c) In the event that a misrepresentation or breach of warranty, agreement or
covenant is discovered by Buyer after the Closing, or in the event of any
other claim relating to or arising under this Agreement or any of the Seller
Documents or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any of
the Seller Documents, the sole and exclusive rights and remedies of Buyer
shall be as set forth in, and only to the extent expressly provided for in,
this  _Article 7_ , and Buyer shall not be entitled to a rescission of this
Agreement.



(d) In the event that any misrepresentation or breach of warranty, agreement
or covenant is known to or discovered by Buyer prior to the Closing, the same
shall not affect any right of Buyer to elect not to close the Transactions,
as provided in Section 2.4 hereof, it being understood, however, that if,
despite such right to elect not to close, Buyer nevertheless elects to close,
Buyer shall be deemed to have waived such misrepresentation or breach and
shall have no claim whatsoever against Seller or any Back-up Indemnitor by
reason of such misrepresentation or breach.



(e) Without intending to limit any right under Section 7.1(a) hereof, no
Seller Indemnitee shall have any right to seek contribution from Buyer
with respect to all or part of Sellers indemnification obligations under
this _Article 7_. Without intending to limit any right under Section 7.1(b)
hereof, no Buyer Indemnitee shall have any right to seek contribution from
Seller with respect to all or part of Buyers indemnification obligations
under this _Article 7_.



(f) For purposes of computing any Loss under this _Article 7_ with respect to
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that is qualified as to
Material Adverse Effect, the amount of the applicable liability for such Loss
shall be the entire Loss arising by reason of the breach of such
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement and not merely the amount of
such Loss in excess of an amount that constitutes a Material Adverse Effect;
it being understood and agreed, however, that, notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Section 7.3(f), the Basket Amount, the Cap, and
all other limitations, conditions and requirements, as to liability, recovery
or otherwise, set forth in this _Article 7_ shall nevertheless be, and
continue to remain, applicable and in full force and effect.



(g) The effect of any misrepresentation, breach of warranty, covenant or
agreement of, or any Claim against, Seller under or in respect of this
Agreement or any of the Seller Documents, or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any of the Seller Documents, and any Losses
resulting therefrom, shall be determined based solely on and limited to actual

being understood that this paragraph is not intended to mean that if the
Company were liable to a third party (other than Buyer or any Buyer Indemnitee
or any Affiliate thereof) for such type of damages that such damages would not
constitute Losses for which Seller would be liable under Section 7(b) hereof
to the extent so provided in this Article 7.



(i) Buyer agrees that the sole liability and obligations of Seller and the
sole right, remedy and entitlement of Buyer Indemnitees for any claim with

the Escrow Agreement of funds held thereunder in respect of indemnification
by Seller under this _Article 7_ , and all Buyer Indemnitees hereby waive any
and all statutory and common law rights and remedies (including, without
limitation, of indemnification and contribution and/or under any
Environmental Requirements) which any of them has or may hereafter have. Under
no circumstances shall any direct or indirect member, manager, principal or
owner of Seller, or any officer, director, employee, agent, affiliate,
representative, member or manager of any of them, have any liability or
obligation under or in connection with this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any of the Seller Documents. 



(j) In the event that any dispute shall arise between Buyer and Seller or any
Seller Indemnitee(s) after the Closing in connection with this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated hereby, including without limitation, any
claim by any party for indemnification pursuant to _Article 7_ , the party
prevailing in such dispute shall be entitled to recover on demand (in addition
to any recovery awarded by any court) from the other party, an amount equal to
all reasonable attorneys fees incurred by the prevailing party in
connection with such dispute. The term "prevailing party" shall mean the
party whose position in connection with any such dispute as set forth before

adjustment to the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes.



7.4 _Subrogation_. Upon making an indemnity payment, including by way of
disbursement of funds under the Escrow Agreement, pursuant to this



 

36 Agreement, the Indemnifying Party will, to the extent of such payment, be
subrogated to all rights of the Claiming Party against any third party in
respect of the Losses to which the payment related. Without limiting the
generality of any other provision hereof, the Claiming Party and Indemnifying
Party will duly execute upon request all instruments reasonably necessary to
evidence and perfect such subrogation rights.
