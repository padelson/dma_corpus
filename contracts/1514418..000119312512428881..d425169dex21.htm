Taxes Schedule AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ ") is made as of October
19, 2012, by and among EMPEIRIA ACQUISITION CORPORATION, a Delaware
corporation (" _Parent_ "), IDE ACQUISITION CO., LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company and wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "),
INTEGRATED DRILLING EQUIPMENT COMPANY HOLDINGS, INC., a Delaware corporation
(the " _Company_ "), and STEPHEN COPE, in his capacity as representative of
the Holders pursuant to _Article 9_ hereof (" _Representative_ "). Capitalized
terms used and not otherwise defined herein have the meanings set forth in
_Article 10_ below.

WHEREAS, this Agreement contemplates a transaction in which Parent will
acquire the Company pursuant to a transaction in which the Company will merge
with and into Merger Sub, a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, with
Merger Sub surviving the merger, in accordance with the Delaware Limited
Liability Company Act (the " _LLCA_ ") and the Delaware General Corporation
Law (the " _DGCL_ "), and the holders of the Companys Common Stock (each such
Person, a " _Holder_ ") will receive cash and Parent Shares as consideration
in such Merger;

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company has, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein, (i) approved this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) recommended acceptance of the
Merger and approval of this Agreement by the Holders;

 

WHEREAS, the requisite number of Holders required to adopt this Agreement and
consent to and approve the transactions contemplated hereby under the DGCL
and the Companys certificate of incorporation, will, promptly following the
Companys, Parents and Merger Subs full execution and delivery of this
Agreement, execute written consents, dated as of the date hereof, adopting
this Agreement and approving the transactions contemplated hereby in
accordance with the DGCL, the Companys certificate of incorporation and the
Companys bylaws, in each case as in effect as of the date hereof
(such consents are collectively referred to herein as the " _Holder Approval_
");

WHEREAS, the board of directors of Parent and Parent, in its capacities as
managing member and sole member of Merger Sub, have each, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein, approved and consented to the
Merger, the execution by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with the
DGCL, LLCA and all other applicable Law;

WHEREAS, the Company and Parent intend that the Merger will qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations, and, by approving the resolutions authorizing this
Agreement, to adopt this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations;

 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, certain of the
Companys employees and the Company have entered into Executive Employment
Agreements, each of which shall become effective upon the Closing
(collectively, the " _Employment Agreements_ "); and WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, representations and
warranties and mutual covenants contained herein and of other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged and intending to be legally bound, the parties agree as
follows: 

ARTICLE 1

_THE MERGER_

1.01 _The Merger._

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, at the Effective
Time, the Company shall be merged with and into Merger Sub in accordance with
the DGCL and the LLCA (the " _Merger_ "), whereupon the separate existence of
the Company shall cease, and Merger Sub shall be the surviving company (the "
_Surviving Company_ ").

 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall possess all
the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to all of the
obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the Company and
Merger Sub, all as provided under the DGCL and the LLCA.

1.02 _Closing; Effective Time_. The closing of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at the offices of Jones
Day, located at 222 East 41st Street, New York, New York 10017, on the 2nd
business day following the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the
Closing set forth in _Article II_ below (other than conditions which are to be
satisfied on the Closing Date, which shall be satisfied on the Closing Date).
The date of the Closing is herein referred to as the " _Closing Date._ " At
the Closing, Merger Sub and the Company shall cause a certificate of merger
(the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed and filed with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the DGCL and the LLCA.
The Merger shall become effective as of the date and time of such filing or
such other time after such filing as Merger Sub and the Company shall agree in
the Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ ").

1.03 _Certificate of Formation; Limited Liability Company Agreement; Managers
and Officers_.

(a) The certificate of formation of Merger Sub in effect at the Effective Time
shall be the certificate of formation of the Surviving Company, except that
such certificate of formation shall be amended to reflect that the name of the
Surviving Company shall be "Integrated Drilling Equipment Company Holdings,
LLC."

 



2 (b) The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
become, from and after the Effective Time, the officers, respectively, of the
Surviving Company, until their respective successors are duly elected or
appointed or their earlier resignation or removal.

 

1.04 _Conversion of Common Stock As a Result of the Merger_.

 

(a) " _Aggregate Merger Consideration_ " means an amount equal to:

 

(i) $87,500,000,

(ii) _plus_ the amount of the Companys cash as of the Closing,

(iii) _minus_ the aggregate amount of the Companys Indebtedness as of the
Closing,

(iv) _minus_ the outstanding amount of Holder Transaction Expenses as of the
Closing,

(v) _plus_ the amount, if any, by which the Net Working Capital exceeds the
Net Working Capital Target, and

(vi) _minus_ the amount, if any, by which the Net Working Capital is less than
the Net Working Capital Target.

(b) At the Effective Time, except as otherwise provided in _Sections 1.04(c)_
and _1.07_ , each share of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive at the Closing
consideration with a value equal to the Per Share Price. Each Holders
aggregate consideration for the transactions contemplated hereunder shall be
paid in cash and Parent Shares, allocated as follows: (i) an amount in cash
equal to (A) (1) $20,000,000, _plus_ (2) the Contingent Closing Cash Amount,
if any, _multiplied_ by (B) such Holders Proportionate Share (such aggregate
number, the " _Cash Consideration_ "), and (ii) a number of shares of Parent
Shares (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to (A) (1) (y) the
Aggregate Merger Consideration, _minus_ the Cash Consideration,  _divided_ by
(z) $10, _minus_ (2) the Holdback Shares, _multiplied_ by (B) such Holders
Proportionate Share (such resulting amounts, the " _Closing Consideration_ ").
From and after the Effective Time, the holders of certificates evidencing
ownership of the shares of Common Stock (" _Common Stock Certificates_ ")
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such shares of Common Stock except as otherwise
provided for herein or under applicable law;

(c) At the Effective Time, each share of Common Stock owned by the Company as
treasury stock, and each share of Common Stock owned by any Subsidiary of the
Company, that, in either case, is issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be automatically cancelled and extinguished without
any exchange thereof and without any further action on the part of the
Company;

 



3 (d) The membership interests of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall remain the membership interests in the Surviving
Company, unaffected by the Merger, with the same rights, powers and privileges
as existed prior to the Merger.

(e) " _Per Share Price_ " means an amount equal to (i) the Aggregate Merger
Consideration, _divided_ by (ii) the aggregate number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding as of the Effective Time (other than shares held by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries).

(f) " _Contingent Closing Cash Amount_ " means (i) the Trust Account Excess,
_multiplied_ by (ii) 0.5; _provided, however_ , that the Contingent Closing
Cash Amount shall not be (y) more than $10,000,000, nor (z) less than $0.

 

1.05 _Surrender and Payment_.

(a) At least 2 business days prior to the Closing Date, the Company will
deliver to Parent its good faith estimate of (x) an unaudited, consolidated
balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Closing and (y)
the Aggregate Merger Consideration (the " _Estimated Aggregate Merger
Consideration_ "). The calculation of the Estimated Aggregate Merger
Consideration will be prepared in accordance with the Agreed Accounting
Principles. At the Closing, Parent shall issue shares of Parent Shares and
pay, or shall cause the Surviving Company to pay, in cash by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, the Estimated Aggregate Merger Consideration
and outstanding Holder Transaction Expenses as follows:

(i) all amounts necessary to fully discharge the then-outstanding balances of
Holder Transaction Expenses (except with respect to the contingent shares to
be paid to TerraNova Capital Partners, Inc., if any, described in _Section
1.12_) shall be paid by Parent to accounts owned by the Persons owed such
amounts;

(ii) all amounts necessary to fully discharge the then-outstanding
Indebtedness of the Company as set forth in the applicable payoff letters,
and Parent shall pay such amounts in accordance with such payoff letters;
_provided_ , _however_ , Parent shall not be required to satisfy the amounts
outstanding with respect to the Revolver as of the Closing if it elects,
prior to the Closing, that the Revolver shall not be discharged at Closing;

(iii) the Holdback Shares shall be issued in the name of Parent and held for
the benefit of the Holders pursuant to the terms of _Section 8.10_ (but
subject to the rights of the Parent Indemnified Parties set forth therein);
and

(iv) with respect to each Holder (other than with respect to Dissenting
Shares, unless other documentation is agreed to by Parent and any such Holder,
the Closing Consideration, as applicable, for such shares of Common Stock
represented by Common Stock Certificates shall be paid to such Holder upon
such Holders delivery of a Holder Letter of Transmittal and surrender of
applicable Common Stock Certificates to Parent, in each case in a form and
manner satisfactory to Parent.

 



4 (b) Until so surrendered, each Common Stock Certificate shall represent after
the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive payment as
provided in this Agreement. Representative shall provide Parent with a flow of
funds setting forth the amounts to be paid pursuant to _Section 1.05(a)_
(including with respect to each holder of shares of Common Stock) along with
wire instructions therefore at least 2 business days prior to the Closing Date
and Parent shall be entitled to rely on such flow of funds and will have no
liability to, and shall be indemnified by the Holders from any claim of, any
Person for distributing the amounts pursuant to this Agreement in accordance
with such flow of funds.

(c) As promptly as possible, but in any event within 60 days after the Closing
Date, Parent will deliver to Representative (i) an unaudited, consolidated
balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Closing, and (ii)
its calculation of the Aggregate Merger Consideration (together, the "
_Closing Statement_ "). The Closing Statement will be prepared in accordance
with the Agreed Accounting Principles. The Closing Statement will entirely
disregard any of the plans, transactions, or changes which Parent intends to
initiate or make or cause to be initiated or made after the Closing with
respect to the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries or their business or
assets, or any facts or circumstances that are unique or particular to Parent
or any of its assets or liabilities.

 

(d) Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Company to, (i) assist
Representative and its representatives in the review of the Closing Statement
and provide Representative and its representatives with reasonable access
during normal business hours to the books, records (including work papers,
schedules, memoranda and other documents), supporting data, facilities
and employees of the Surviving Company to the extent reasonably necessary for
their review of the Closing Statement, and (ii) cooperate with Representative
and its representatives in connection with such review, including providing on
a timely basis all other information reasonably requested by Representative
and its representatives that is to be used in connection with the review of
the Closing Statement. If Representative has any objections to the Closing
Statement, Representative will deliver to Parent a statement setting forth
its objections thereto (an " _Objections Statement_ "), which statement will
identify in reasonable detail those items and amounts to which Representative
objects (the " _Disputed Items_ "). If an Objections Statement is not
delivered to Parent within 30 days after delivery of the Closing Statement,
the Closing Statement as prepared by Parent will be final, binding and non-
appealable by the parties. Representative and Parent will negotiate in good
faith to resolve the Disputed Items and all such discussions will (unless
otherwise agreed by Parent and Representative) be governed by Rule 408 of the
Federal Rules of Evidence and any applicable similar state rule, but if they
do not reach a final resolution within 30 days after the delivery of the
Objections Statement to Parent, Representative and Parent will submit any
unresolved Disputed Items (and only such unresolved Disputed Items) to an
independent national accounting firm mutually selected by Parent and
Representative (the " _Accounting Firm_ "). In the event the parties submit
any unresolved Disputed Items to the Accounting Firm, each party will submit a
Closing Statement (which in the case of each party may be a Closing Statement
that, with respect to the unresolved Disputed Items (but not, for the
avoidance of doubt, with respect to any other items), is different than the
Closing Statement initially submitted to Representative, or the Objections
Statement delivered to Parent, as applicable) together with such supporting
documentation as it deems appropriate, to the Accounting Firm within 30 days
after the date on which such unresolved Disputed Items were submitted to the
Accounting Firm for resolution. Representative and Parent will use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting Firm to
resolve such dispute as soon as practicable, but in any event within 30 days
after the date on which the Accounting

 



5  Firm receives the Closing Statements prepared by Representative and Parent.
In resolving any such dispute, the Accounting Firm may not assign a value to
any unresolved Disputed Item greater than the highest amount Representative
or Parent assigns to such Disputed Item in their respective Closing Statements
or less than the lowest amount Representative or Parent assigns to such
Disputed Item in their respective Closing Statements. Representative and
Parent will use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Accounting Firm to notify them in writing of its resolution of such dispute as
soon as practicable. The Closing Statement that includes the
final determination of the unresolved Disputed Items by the Accounting Firm
will be final, binding and non-appealable by the parties. Each party will bear
its own costs and expenses in connection with the resolution of such dispute
by the Accounting Firm. All costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm, if
any, will be paid by Parent and Representative, respectively, in the
proportion that the aggregate dollar amount of the unresolved Disputed Items
submitted to the Accounting Firm by such party that are unsuccessfully
disputed by such party (as finally determined by the Accounting Firm) bears to
the aggregate dollar amount of all unresolved Disputed Items submitted by
Parent and Representative. For example, should the items in dispute total
in amount to $1,000 and the Accounting Firm awards $600 in favor of
Representatives position, 60% of the costs of the Accounting Firms review
would be borne by Parent and 40% of the costs would be borne by
Representative.

 

(e) If the Aggregate Merger Consideration as finally determined after taking
into account the final determination of the Closing Statement pursuant to
_Section 1.05(d)_ (the " _Final Aggregate Merger Consideration_ ") exceeds
the Estimated Aggregate Merger Consideration, then, within 5 business days
after the determination of the Final Aggregate Merger Consideration, Parent
shall issue to each Holder a number of Parent Shares (rounded down to the
nearest share) equal to (1) (A) the amount of such excess, _divided by_ (B)
$10, _multiplied by_ (2) such Holders Proportionate Share.

(f) If the Final Aggregate Merger Consideration is less than the Estimated
Aggregate Merger Consideration, then, within 5 business days after the
determination of the Final Aggregate Merger Consideration, Representative (on
behalf of the Holders) will pay to Parent an amount equal to such shortfall by
surrender of a number of Parent Shares (rounded down to the nearest share) to
Parent equal to (i) the amount of such excess, _divided by_ (ii) $10.

 

(g) All payments required pursuant to _Sections 1.05(e)_ and _1.05(f)_ will be
deemed to be adjustments for Tax purposes to the aggregate purchase price
paid by Parent pursuant to this Agreement, to the extent permitted by
applicable law.

1.06  _Adjustments_. If during the period between the date of this Agreement
and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of Common Stock
shall occur by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split
or combination, exchange or readjustment of Common Stock, or stock dividend
thereon with a record date during such period, or any similar event relating
to the Common Stock, the applicable Per Share Price, and any other amounts
payable pursuant to this Agreement, shall be appropriately adjusted.

1.07 _Treatment of Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Holders who have properly demanded appraisal of
their shares of Common Stock pursuant to, and who comply in all respects with,
the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL

 



6  (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not have such shares converted as provided
herein, but instead such Holders shall be entitled to such rights (and only
such rights) as are granted under Section 262 of the DGCL. At the Effective
Time, all Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and extinguished and shall cease to exist, and
except as otherwise provided by Law, each holder of Dissenting Shares shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto other than the rights granted
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any
Holder shall fail to validly perfect or shall otherwise waive, withdraw or
lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or if a court of
competent jurisdiction shall determine that such Holder is not entitled to the
relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, then the rights of such Holders
under Section 262 of the DGCL shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be
deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time as set forth in _Section
1.04(b)_. The Company shall give Parent prompt written notice of any demands
for appraisal with respect to Dissenting Shares, and Parent shall have the
opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands, and any settlements with respect thereto shall not be entered
into without the prior written consent of Representative and Parent (such
consents not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Any payments to be made
in respect of Dissenting Shares will be made by Parent and/or the Surviving
Company.

 

1.08 _No Further Ownership Rights in Capital Stock_. The consideration paid in
accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Common Stock (including any
rights to receive accrued but unpaid dividends on the Common Stock, if any),
and, from and after the Effective Time, the Holders shall cease to have
any rights with respect to the shares of Common Stock (including any rights
to receive any accrued but unpaid dividends, if any), except as otherwise
expressly provided for in this Agreement. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and thereafter there shall be
no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Company
of shares of Common Stock. If, after the Effective Time, Common Stock
Certificates are presented to Parent or the Surviving Company for any reason,
they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided and in accordance with this
_Section 1.08_.

1.09 _Lost Certificates_. If any Common Stock Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Common Stock Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed, and an indemnity, reasonably satisfactory to Parent, the Surviving
Company and their Affiliates, against any claim that may be made against any
of them with respect to such Common Stock Certificate, the Surviving Company
will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Common Stock
Certificate, the applicable portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration to
be paid in respect of the Common Stock represented by such Common Stock
Certificate as contemplated by this _Article 1_.

1.10 _Withholding_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Company and the
Representative (as applicable) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the amounts payable under this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be
deducted and withheld under the Code and any other applicable Tax Laws. Any
such withheld amount shall be paid over to the appropriate Governmental Body
and treated as though it had been paid to the Person in respect of which such
withholding was required.

 



7 1.11 _Interest; No Liability_. All payments made pursuant to this _Article 1_
, whether at the Closing or afterwards, shall be without interest. None of
Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Company shall be liable to any Person in
respect of any cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

1.12 _Contingent Consideration_.

 

(a) _Contingent Share Consideration_. In addition to the Closing
Consideration, Parent shall issue, on the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in _Sections 1.12(a)  (d)_, up to 5,250,000 shares of Parent Shares
as follows (the " _Contingent Share Consideration_ "):

 

(i) if, prior to the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date, (A) Parents
Trading Price exceeds $12.00 per share for any 20 Trading Days within any
period of 30 consecutive Trading Days exceeds $12.00 per share or (B) Change
of Control Transaction occurs that values each Parent Share at more than
$12.00 per share, then, within 5 business days after the satisfaction of the
condition set forth in (A) or immediately prior to the Change of Control
Transaction described in (B), as applicable, Parent shall issue to each
Holder, without further consideration from such Holder, a number of
Parent Shares equal to (y) 1,312,500, _multiplied_ by (z) such Holders
Proportionate Share; _plus_

(ii) if, prior to the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date, (A) Parents
Trading Price exceeds $13.50 per share for any 20 Trading Days within any
period of 30 consecutive Trading Days exceeds $13.50 per share or (B) Change
of Control Transaction occurs that values each Parent Share at more than
$13.50 per share, then, within 5 business days after the satisfaction of the
condition set forth in (A) or immediately prior to the Change of Control
Transaction described in (B), as applicable, Parent shall issue to each
Holder, without further consideration from such Holder, a number of Parent
Shares equal to (y) 1,312,500, _multiplied_ by (z) such
Holders Proportionate Share; _plus_

(iii) if, prior to the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date, (A) Parents
Trading Price exceeds $15.00 per share for any 20 Trading Days within any
period of 30 consecutive Trading Days exceeds $15.00 per share or (B) Change
of Control Transaction occurs that values each Parent Share at more than
$15.00 per share, then, within 5 business days after the satisfaction of the
condition set forth in (A) or immediately prior to the Change of Control
Transaction described in (B), as applicable, Parent shall issue to each
Holder, without further consideration from such Holder, a number of Parent
Shares equal to (y) 1,312,500, _multiplied_ by (z) such Holders Proportionate
Share; _plus_

 

(iv) if, prior to the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date, (A) Parents
Trading Price exceeds $17.00 per share for any 20 Trading Days within any
period of 30 consecutive Trading Days exceeds $17.00 per share or (B) Change
of Control Transaction occurs that values each Parent Share at more than
$17.00 per share, then, within 5 business days after the satisfaction of the
condition set forth in (A) or immediately prior to the Change of Control
Transaction described in (B), as applicable,

 



8  Parent shall issue to each Holder, without further consideration from such
Holder, a number of Parent Shares equal to (y) 1,312,500, _multiplied_ by (z)
such Holders Proportionate Share.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Contingent Share Consideration shall not be
paid, and the right to receive any amounts shall be waived and discharged,
with respect to any of the conditions set forth in _Sections 1.12(a)(i)_ ,
_1.12(a)(ii)_ , _1.12(a)(iii)_ and _1.12(a)(iv)_ that have not been satisfied
on or before the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date. The Contingent Share
Consideration shall be adjusted for any stock split or reverse stock split
occurring from and after the Closing until the date of issuance in accordance
with this _Section 1.12(a)_. Any amounts to be paid to any Person pursuant
to the Letter Agreement with TerraNova Capital Partners, Inc., dated February
28, 2012, shall be deducted from the Parent Shares to be issued pursuant to
this _Section 1.12_ and shall instead be issued directly to such Person.

(b) _Contingent Cash Consideration_.

 

(i) Within 30 days after Parent files its Annual Report on Form 10-K with the
SEC for fiscal year 2013, Parent shall provide the Representative its
calculation of the Earnout Amount, which such amount will be calculated in
accordance with the Agreed Accounting Principles, and reasonable support for
Parents calculation thereof (the " _Earnout Statement_ ").

(ii) On or before the 5th business day following the date on which the
calculation of the Earnout Amount becomes final (either by Representative
delivering written notice of acceptance to Parent or deemed acceptance or
final determination by the Accounting Firm under _Section 1.12(b)(v_)) Parent
shall, subject to Parents set-off rights, pay each Holder an amount (if
any), in immediately available funds, equal to (A) the Earnout Amount,
_multiplied_ by (B) such Holders Proportionate Share.

 

(iii) " _Earnout Amount_ " means an amount equal to (A) the amount by which
the 2013 EBITDA exceeds $30,000,000, _multiplied_ by (B) 0.5; _provided_ ,
that such amount shall not (y) exceed $10,000,000, nor (z) be less than zero.

(iv) " _2013 EBITDA_ " means the net income of the Surviving Company for
fiscal year 2013, excluding any extraordinary gains or losses, and increased
by the amount reflected in their financial statements as expenses incurred
for interest, income Taxes, depreciation, amortization of any intangible
assets and amortization of financing or related fees, but only to the extent
that such items were deducted in computing net income and calculated in
accordance with the Agreed Accounting Principles, including any add-backs,
deductions and allocations of overhead set forth therein; provided, however,
that "EBITDA" shall be adjusted to exclude for any relevant period
the appropriate financial items for any Person or business unit of a Person
that has been directly or indirectly acquired by Parent or its Affiliates
prior to the end of fiscal year 2013 (including, without limitation, by way of
merger or combination involving Parent or the Surviving Company).

 



9 (v) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company to,
provide Representative and its representatives with reasonable access during
normal business hours to the books, records (including work papers, schedules,
memoranda and other documents), supporting data and employees of the Surviving
Company to the extent reasonably necessary to verify the Earnout Amount. If
the Representative has any objections to the Earnout Statement, the
Representative shall deliver to Parent a statement setting forth, in
reasonable detail, its objections thereto (each, an " _Earnout Objection
Statement_ "). If an Earnout Objection Statement is not delivered to Parent
within 30 days after delivery of an Earnout Statement, such Earnout Statement
as prepared by Parent shall be deemed irrevocably accepted by the
Representative on behalf of the Holders and be final, binding and non-
appealable by the parties and the Holders. The Representative and Parent shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve the objections raised in any Earnout
Objection Statement, but if they do not reach a final resolution within 30
days after the delivery of an Earnout Objection Statement to Parent, any
unresolved disputes shall be submitted to an independent national accounting
firm mutually selected by Parent and the Representative (the " _Earnout
Accounting Firm_ "). In the event any such dispute is submitted to the Earnout
Accounting Firm, each party shall be permitted to submit a statement setting
forth its calculation of the applicable earnout amounts, together with such
supporting documentation as it deems appropriate, to the Accounting Firm. The
Representative and Parent shall use their respective commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Earnout Accounting Firm to resolve such dispute as soon
as practicable, but in any event within 30 days after the date on which the
Earnout Accounting Firm receives the applicable statements prepared by the
Representative and Parent. The calculation of the 2013 Earnout Amount as
finally determined by the Earnout Accounting Firm (which such determination
shall be made in a manner consistent with the terms of this Agreement and
shall not, for such earnout, be less than the amount set forth in the
applicable Earnout Statement nor exceed the amount set forth in the
applicable Earnout Objection Statement) shall be final, binding and non-
appealable among the parties. Each party shall bear its own costs and expenses
in connection with the resolution of such dispute by the Earnout Accounting
Firm. All costs and expenses of the Earnout Accounting Firm, if any, shall be
paid by the party whose calculation of the applicable earnout amount is
farthest from the final determination of the Earnout Accounting Firm. 

(vi) All payments required pursuant to _Section 1.12_ shall be deemed to be
adjustments for Tax purposes to the aggregate purchase price paid by Parent
pursuant to this Agreement, unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

Parent and the Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, refrain from taking any action that is predominately intended
to reduce the amount of the Earnout Amount.

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_

The Company represents and warrants, on the terms set forth below, to Parent
as follows:

3.01 _Organization and Corporate Power_. The Company is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State
of Delaware. The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority and
all authorizations, licenses and permits necessary to own, lease and operate
its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted and
as currently proposed to be conducted. The Company is duly qualified or
authorized to do business and is in good standing in every jurisdiction in
which its ownership of property or the conduct of business as now conducted
requires it to qualify. True and complete copies of the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Company and its Subsidiaries, as in effect as
of the date hereof, have been heretofore made available to Parent.

3.02 _Authorization; Valid and Binding Agreement_. The execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and each other agreement, document, or
instrument or certificate contemplated by this Agreement by the Company and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been
duly and validly authorized by all requisite action on the part of the
Company, and no other proceedings on the Companys part are necessary to
authorize the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement. The
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the
Common Stock (voting as a single class) in favor of the approval of the Merger
is the only vote of the holders of any of the Companys capital stock
necessary in connection with the consummation of the Merger, and no other
corporate proceeding is necessary to authorize the execution, delivery or
performance of this Agreement. Assuming that this Agreement is a valid and
binding obligation of Parent and

 



14  Merger Sub, this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the
Company, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability
may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
reorganization, or moratorium laws, other similar laws affecting creditors
rights and general principles of equity affecting the availability of specific
performance and other equitable remedies.

 

3.03 _Capital Stock_. The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of
20,000 shares of Common Stock. The _Capitalization Schedule_ sets forth a
true and complete summary of the outstanding Common Stock of the Company. All

validly issued and are fully paid, non-assessable and free of preemptive or
similar rights. Except as set forth on the _Capitalization Schedule_ , the
Company does not have any other equity securities or securities containing any
equity features authorized, issued or outstanding, and there are no
agreements, options, warrants or other rights or arrangements existing or
outstanding which provide for the sale or issuance of any of the foregoing by
the Company. Except as set forth on the _Capitalization Schedule_ , there are
no outstanding (a) shares of capital stock or other equity interests or
voting securities of the Company, (b) securities convertible or exchangeable
into capital stock of the Company, (c) options, warrants, purchase rights,

phantom stock, profit participation or similar rights with respect to the
Company, or (e) bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of the Company
having the right to vote on any matters on which stockholders of the Company
may vote.

each of the Companys Subsidiaries, and with respect to each Subsidiary, the
jurisdiction in which it is incorporated or organized, the jurisdictions, if
any, in which it is qualified to do business, the membership interests or
number of shares of its authorized capital stock, as applicable, the
membership interests or number and class of shares thereof duly issued and
outstanding, as applicable, the names of all stockholders or other equity
owners and the number of shares of stock owned by each stockholder or the
amount of equity owned by each equity holder. Except as set forth on the
attached _Subsidiary Schedule_ , neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries owns or holds the right to acquire any stock, partnership
interest, joint venture interest or other equity ownership interest in any
other Person. Each of the Companys Subsidiaries is duly organized and validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation or organization. Each of the Companys Subsidiaries has all
requisite power and authority and all authorizations, licenses and permits
necessary to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its
business as presently conducted, and is duly qualified or authorized to do
business in every jurisdiction in which its ownership of property or the
conduct of businesses as now conducted requires it to qualify. All of the
equity interests of each of the Companys Subsidiaries are wholly-owned by
the Company and there are no securities (including securities convertible or
exchangeable into capital stock of the Subsidiaries) issued to any Person
other than the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company. True and complete
copies of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or comparable
organizational documents) of each of the Companys Subsidiaries, as in effect
as of the date hereof, have been heretofore made available to Parent.

 



15 3.05 _No Breach_. Except as set forth on the attached _Authorization Schedule_

Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ ")), whether or
not subject to ERISA, (ii) "welfare plans" (as defined under Section 3(1) of

Affiliate has in the last six years contributed or has been obligated to
contribute to any "employee pension plans," as defined in Section 3(2) of

Plan_ "), nor has the Company or any Subsidiary or ERISA Affiliate incurred
any withdrawal liability with respect to any Multiemployer Plan or any
Liability in connection with the termination or reorganization of any
Multiemployer Plan. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has any Liability
under Title IV of ERISA.

 

(e) Except as set forth on the attached _Employee Benefits Schedule_ , there
are no pending material actions, claims or lawsuits which have been asserted
or instituted against the Plans, the assets of any of the trusts under such
Plans or the plan sponsor or the plan administrator, or against any fiduciary

routine benefit claims in the ordinary course of business), nor does the
Company have Knowledge of facts which would reasonably be expected to form the
basis for any such claim or lawsuit. There is no pending or threatened
governmental audit, examination or investigation relating to any Plan, nor,
to the Companys Knowledge, is there any basis for one.

its Subsidiaries) for non-performance, replacement or repair of any such
products or other damages or other costs in connection therewith, subject only

the Company and its Subsidiaries and their projected sales.

 

(b) The Company has no Liability and, to the Companys Knowledge, there is no
basis for any present or future Action against the Company that could give
rise to any Liability, arising out of any injury to Person or property as a

properties used in the conduct of such businesses and constitute all of the
assets and properties necessary for the continued conduct of such businesses
after the Closing in substantially the same manner as conducted prior to the
Closing. All of the material assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries are in

accordance with GAAP consistently applied.

of the filings with the SEC and mailings to Parents stockholders with respect
to the Tender Offer shall include disclosure regarding the Company and its
management, operations and financial condition. Accordingly, the Company
agrees to as promptly as reasonably practical provide Parent with such
information as shall be reasonably requested by Parent for inclusion in or

release announcing the execution of this Agreement (the " _Signing Press
Release_ "). Immediately after the issuance of the Signing Press Release,

information that may be required to be disclosed with respect to such results,
including the transactions contemplated hereby, if applicable, in any report
or form to be filed with the SEC (" _Closing Filing_ "), which the Company
shall review, comment upon and approve (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) prior to filing. As promptly as
practicable after the completion of the Tender Offer, Parent and the
Representative shall mutually agree on and issue a press release announcing
such tender offer results and, if applicable, the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (" _Closing Press Release_ "). Concurrently
with the Closing, Parent shall distribute the Closing Press Release and shall
file the Closing Filing with the SEC.

(g) _Trust Account Waiver_. Reference is made to the final prospectus of
Parent dated June 15, 2011 (File No. 333-172629) (the " _Prospectus_ "). The
Company and each Holder warrants and represents that it has read the
Prospectus and understands that Parent has established a trust account
containing the proceeds of its initial public offering (" _IPO_ ") and certain
additional proceeds (collectively with the initial principal and interest
accrued from time to time thereon, the " _Trust Account_ "), initially in an
amount of $61,200,000 for the benefit of holders of the securities issued in
Parents IPO (the " _Public Stockholders_ ") and certain parties (including
the underwriters of the IPO) and the monies in the Trust Account, including
any proceeds therefrom, may only be distributed as provided in the Prospectus.
For and in consideration of Parent agreeing to enter into this Agreement, the
Company and Holders hereby agree that, notwithstanding any provisions
contained in this Agreement (including the indemnification provisions herein),
the Company and Holders do not now have, and shall not at any time have, any
right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies in the Trust
Account (including any distributions therefrom), regardless of whether such
claim arises as a

 



42  result of, in connection with or relating in any way to, the business
relationship among the Company and Holders, on the one hand, and Parent, on
the other hand, this Agreement, or any other agreement or any other matter,
and regardless of whether such claim arises based on contract, tort, equity or
any other theory of legal liability (any and all such claims are collectively
referred to as the " _Trust Claims_ "). Notwithstanding any other provision
contained in the Agreement, the Company and Holders hereby irrevocably waive
any Trust Claims they may have, now or in the future, and will not seek
recourse against, the Trust Account for any reason whatsoever in respect
thereof. In the event that the Company or any Holder commences any action or
proceeding based upon, in connection with, relating to or arising out of any
matter relating to Parent, which proceeding seeks, in whole or in part, relief
against the Trust Account or the Public Stockholders, whether in the form of
money damages or injunctive relief, Parent shall be entitled to recover from
the Company and Holders the associated legal fees and costs in connection with
any such action, in the event Parent prevails in such action or proceeding.
The Company and Holders agree and acknowledge that such irrevocable waiver is
material to this Agreement and specifically relied upon by Parent to induce it
to enter in this Agreement, and the Company and Parent further intend and
understand such waiver to be valid, binding and enforceable under applicable
Law.

single "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations

"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations and will report it as such for all federal, state and
local income Tax purposes. None of the parties hereto will knowingly take any
action or fail to take any action, other than those contemplated by this
Agreement, which action or failure would cause the Merger to fail to qualify
as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations. For the avoidance of doubt, negotiation, settlement or
payment of appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall be
treated as an action taken pursuant to this Agreement. Each party hereto
agrees to cooperate with the other parties and to provide to the other parties
such information and documentation as may be necessary, proper or advisable,
to cause the Merger to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations

6.06 _UPO Agreements_. Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to enter
into agreements with the holders of the options to purchase 600,000 units of
the Parent (in the aggregate) originally issued to Cohen and Company Capital

pursuant to Section 8.02(a)(i) (other than with respect to indemnification
for Losses arising out of the breach of (w) any Company Fundamental
Representation, (x) any Company Employee Benefit Plan Representation, or (y)
any Company Tax Representations) or (B) with respect to any Losses arising
out of the breach of the Companys obligations set forth in the second
sentence of Section 6.04(c) shall be $7,500,000;

 



45 (iv) the aggregate indemnification of the Parent Indemnitees
hereunder pursuant to _Section 8.02(a)(i)_ arising out of a breach of any
Company Fundamental Representation, any Company Employee Benefit Plan
Representation, any Company Tax Representations shall be equal to the
Aggregate Merger Consideration; and 

(v) the aggregate indemnification of the Parent Indemnitees hereunder payable
by any single Holder shall be limited to that portion of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration that was received by such Holder in exchange for its Common
Stock.

 

(c) All payments under this _Section 8.02_ will be treated by the parties as
an adjustment to the proceeds received by Holders pursuant to _Article 1_ ,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

8.03 _Indemnification of Holders_. From and after the Closing (but subject to
the provisions of this _Article 8_ ), Parent will indemnify and hold each
Holder, each Holders Affiliates and each of their respective officers,
directors, managers, employees, stockholders, members, partners, agents,
representatives, successors and assigns (the " _Holder Indemnitees_ ")
harmless from and against, and pay to the applicable Holder Indemnitees the
amount of, any and all Losses based upon, attributable to or resulting from
(a) a breach of any representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub set
forth in _Article 4_ this Agreement, and (b) any breach of any covenant of
Parent or Merger Sub contained in this Agreement.

 

8.04 _Limits of Indemnification_.

(a) The ability of any Parent Indemnitee or Holder Indemnitee to receive
indemnification pursuant to _Sections 8.02_ or _8.03_ , respectively, will
terminate on the applicable survival termination date (as set forth in
_Section 8.01_), unless such Parent Indemnitee or Holder Indemnitee, as
applicable, has made a proper claim for indemnification pursuant to _Sections
8.02_ or _8.03_ , respectively, subject to the terms and conditions of this
_Article 8_ , prior to such termination date, as applicable. If a Parent
Indemnitee or a Holder Indemnitee has made a proper claim for indemnification
pursuant to _Sections 8.02_ or _8.03_ , respectively, prior to such
termination date, then such claim, if then unresolved, will not be
extinguished by the passage of the deadlines set forth in _Section 8.01_.

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub understands, acknowledges and agrees that
the indemnification provided to Parent Indemnitees pursuant to, and subject to
the terms and conditions of,  _Section 8.02_ will be the sole and exclusive
remedy of the Parent Indemnitees against any Holder or any other Person with
respect to the subject matter of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, and that the Parent Indemnitees will have no other
remedy or recourse with respect to any of the foregoing other than pursuant
to, and subject to the terms and conditions of, _Section 8.02_. Parent
acknowledges and agrees that the Parent Indemnitees may not avoid such
limitation on liability by (i) seeking damages for breach of contract, tort or
pursuant to any other theory of liability, all of which are hereby waived, or
(ii) asserting or threatening any claim against any Person (other than a
Holder in a claim pursuant to _Article 8_ ) that is not a party (or a
successor to a party) for breaches of the representations, warranties and
covenants contained in this Agreement.

 



46 (c) The right to indemnification, payment of damages or other remedy pursuant
to this  _Article 8_ will not be affected by the indemnified persons
investigation with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of having
been acquired) about, the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any
representation, warranty, agreement, covenant or obligation under this
Agreement. The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any
representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any
covenant, agreement or obligation, will not affect the right to
indemnification, payment of damages, or other remedy based on such
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation.

8.05 _Inter-Party Claims_. In order for a Parent Indemnitee or Holder
Indemnitee to be entitled to seek any indemnification provided for under this
Agreement (such party, the " _Claiming Party_ "), such Claiming Party must
notify the other party or parties from whom such indemnification is sought
(the " _Defending Party_ ") in writing promptly after the Claiming Party
becomes aware of the occurrence of the event giving rise to such Claiming
Partys claim for indemnification, specifying in reasonable detail the basis
of such claim; _provided_ , that failure to give such notification will not
affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the
Defending Party is materially prejudiced as a result of such failure or the
indemnification obligations are materially increased as a result of such
failure. If the Defending Party disputes its liability with respect to any
such claim, the Defending Party and the Claiming Party will proceed to
negotiate a resolution of such dispute and, if not resolved through
negotiations, such dispute will, subject to the terms of this Agreement, be
resolved by litigation in an appropriate court of competent jurisdiction. The
Claiming Party will have the burden of proof in establishing the amount of
Losses it has suffered.

8.06 _Third Party Claims_.

(a) In order for a Claiming Party to seek any indemnification provided for
under this Agreement in respect of a claim or demand made by any third party
Person against the Claiming Party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), such Claiming
Party must notify the Defending Party in writing, and in reasonable detail,
of the Third Party Claim promptly after receipt by such Claiming Party of
notice of the Third Party Claim; _provided_ that failure to give such
notification on a timely basis will not affect the indemnification
provided hereunder except to the extent the Defending Party is materially
prejudiced as a result of such failure.

(b) If a Third Party Claim is made against a Claiming Party, the Defending
Party will, at its expense, be entitled to participate in the defense thereof
and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by
the Defending Party and reasonably satisfactory to the Claiming Party (i) if
within five business days of the receipt of notice from the Claiming Party
informing the Defending Party of such Third Party Claim, the Defending Party
gives notice to the Claiming Party stating the Defending Partys intention to
do so and acknowledging that the Defending Party will indemnify the Claiming
Party from and against all Losses (to the extent required by, and subject to
any applicable limits provided in, this _Article 8_ ), that the Claiming
Party may suffer resulting from, arising out of, relating to, in the nature
of, or caused by, the Third Party Claim, or (ii) if the Defending Party does
not assume the defense of a 

 



47  Third Party Claim pursuant to clause (i) of this sentence, at any time that
the Defending Party reasonably believes that the Claiming Party has ceased to
actively and diligently prosecute the defense of such Third Party Claim.
Should a Defending Party so elect to assume the defense of a Third Party
Claim, the Defending Party will not be liable to the Claiming Party for legal
expenses subsequently incurred by the Claiming Party in connection with the
defense thereof; _provided_ , that in the case that (A) there exists or is
reasonably likely to exist a conflict of interest that would make it
inappropriate in the judgment of the Claiming Party, in its sole and absolute
discretion, for the same counsel to represent both the Claiming Party and the
Defending Party, (B) the Defending Party fails to actively and diligently
prosecute the defense of such Third Party Claim, (C) such Third Party
Claim relates to or otherwise arises in connection with any criminal or
regulatory enforcement action, (D) the settlement of, and adverse judgment
with respect to, or the Defending Partys conduct of the defense of such Third
Party Claim is, in the sole and absolute discretion of the Claiming Party,
likely to be adverse to the Claiming Partys reputation or continuing business
interests (including its relationships with current or potential customers,
suppliers or other parties material to the conduct of its business), or (E)
such Third Party Claim could result in an injunction or other equitable relief
against the Claiming Party or, in the reasonable discretion of the Claiming
Party, result in a Loss in excess of the dollar amount available for
indemnification pursuant to this _Article 8_ (the scenarios described in
clauses (A)  (E) are collectively referred to as " _Conflicts_ "), then the
Defending Party will continue to be liable to the Claiming Party for
reasonable legal expenses subsequently incurred by the Claiming Party in
connection with the defense thereof. If the Defending Party assumes such
defense, the Claiming Party will have the right to participate in the defense
thereof (including the rights to be present and accompanied by counsel and to
receive copies of all pleadings, notices and communications with respect to
such Third Party Claim) and to employ counsel, at its own expense or, in
accordance with the previous sentence, at the Defending Partys expense,
separate from the counsel employed by the Defending Party, it being
understood, however, that the Defending Party will control such defense so
long as the Third Party Claim does not involve a Conflict, in which case the
Claiming Party will control such defense. If the Defending Party chooses to
defend any Third Party Claim, then all the parties will cooperate in the
defense or prosecution of such Third Party Claim, including by retaining and,
upon the Defending Partys request and subject to _Section 6.01_, providing
to the Defending Party all records and information which are reasonably
relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees available on
a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation
of any material provided hereunder. If the Defending Party assumes the defense
of any Third Party Claim, the Defending Party, (y) subject to _Section
8.10_ hereof, may (if the Claiming Party is a Parent Indemnitee) draw upon
the Holdback Shares in order to pay any costs, fees and expenses (including
reasonable legal fees) incurred in connection with such defense, and (z) shall
obtain the prior written consent of the Claiming Party (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld) before entering into any settlement or consenting to
the entry of a judgment with respect to such claim unless such settlement or
judgment (1) involves no finding or admission of any violation of Law or the
rights of any Person and has no effect on any other claims that may be made
against the Claiming Party, (2) expressly and unconditionally provides a full
and general release of the Claiming Party from all liabilities and
obligations with respect to such claim, and (3) involves no finding or
admission of any violation of Law or the rights of any Person. In addition,
whether or not Representative will have assumed the defense of a Third
Party Claim, if Representative has acknowledged that the Holders will
indemnify the Claiming Party from and

 



48  against all Losses (to the extent required by, and subject to any applicable
limits provided in, this _Article 8_ ), that the Parent Indemnitees may suffer
resulting from, arising out of, relating to, in the nature of, or caused by,
the Third Party Claim, then neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates will
admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, any
Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of Representative.

8.07 _Determination of Loss Amount; No Circular Recovery_.

 

(a) In no event will Parent Indemnitees be entitled to recover or make a claim
for any amounts in respect of punitive damages (except to the extent required
to be paid to a Third Party pursuant to a Third Party Claim). No indemnifying
party will be liable hereunder in respect of any claim if such claim would not
have arisen but for a change in legislation or accounting policies or
a change in interpretation of applicable Law as determined by a court or
pursuant to an administration rule-making decision.

(b) For purposes of this _Article 8_ , any determination of (i) whether there
has been an inaccuracy in or breach of any representation, warranty or
covenant, and (ii) the amount of any Losses arising from clause (i) of this
sentence, shall be made without regard to any "material," "materiality,"
"Material Adverse Effect" or similar qualification contained in or otherwise
applicable to such representations, warranty or covenant.

 

(c) No Holder Indemnitee shall make any claim for indemnification against
Parent or any of its Affiliates by reason of the fact that such Holder
Indemnitee was a controlling person, director, manager, officer, employee or
representative of the Company or its Subsidiaries, or was serving as such for
another Person at the request of the Company or its Subsidiaries (whether such
claim is for a Loss of any kind or otherwise and whether such claim is
pursuant to any statute, organizational document, contract, agreement or
otherwise) with respect to any claim brought by a Parent Indemnitee relating
to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
With respect to any claim brought by a Parent Indemnitee against any Holder
related to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, each
Holder expressly waives any right of subrogation, contribution, advancement,
indemnification or other claim against Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Company, any of their Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates (other than
Holders) with respect to any amounts owed by such Holder pursuant to this
_Article 8_.

8.08 _Tax Matters_.

(a) _Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns_.

(i) The Company shall prepare or cause to be prepared and timely file or
cause to be timely filed all Tax Returns of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that are due on or before the Closing Date. With respect to Tax
Returns for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period that are filed after the Closing Date, the Parent shall prepare or
cause to be prepared and timely file or cause to be timely filed all such Tax
Returns. The Tax Returns prepared by the Company pursuant to this _Section
8.08(a)(i)_ are referred to as the " _Seller Prepared Tax Returns_ ," and the
Tax Returns prepared by the Parent pursuant to this _Section 8.08(a)(i)_ are
referred to as the 

 



49  " _Purchaser Prepared Tax Returns_." Such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a
manner consistent with the prior practice of the Company and any Subsidiary
unless otherwise required by applicable Tax Law. At least 30 days before the
date on which each such Tax Return is due (or such shorter period as the
circumstances require, but only in the case of a non-income Tax Return), if
such Tax Return is a Purchaser Prepared Tax Return, the Parent shall submit
such Tax Return to the Representative for its review and approval, and if such
Tax Return is a Seller Prepared Tax Return, the Company shall submit such Tax
Return to the Parent for its review and approval. Such approval by the
Representative or the Parent, as the case may be, shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. The reviewing party shall submit its written comments, if
any, to the other party no less than 15 days (or such shorter period as the
circumstances require, but only in the case of a non-income Tax Return) prior
to the due date of such Tax Return, and the non-reviewing party shall make any
change to any such Tax Return (or file any amendment to such Tax Return) as is
reasonably requested by the reviewing party, so long as there is a reasonable
basis in fact and Law for such change. The Parent and the Representative agree
to consult and timely resolve in good faith any issue arising as a result of
their respective review of any Tax Return prepared and filed pursuant to this
_Section 8.08(a)(i)_. The Representative shall timely pay (or cause to be
timely paid) all Taxes due with respect to any Seller Prepared Tax Return. The
Representative shall promptly pay, or cause to be promptly paid, to the
Parent the amount of such Tax for which the Holders are responsible pursuant
to this Agreement for any Purchaser Prepared Tax Return, to the extent not
paid or accrued at or before the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt,
the Representatives obligation to make payments pursuant to this _Section
8.08(a)(i_) shall not be satisfied from the Holdback Shares. The party
required to file any Tax Return pursuant to this _Section 8.01(a)(i)_ subject
to a dispute shall file such disputed Tax Return on the due date thereof
(taking into account any applicable timely filed extension) in the manner that
it sees fit, without prejudice to the resolution of such dispute.

 

(ii) Parent shall not (nor shall it cause any Affiliate to) make any election
under Section 338 of the Code (or any analogous or similar provision under
state, local or non-U.S. law) with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

(iii) Parent shall pay to the Representative any refunds of Taxes (or
reductions in Tax liability), including interest paid therewith, of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries that relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period,
other than any refunds that are attributable to any carryback of net operating
losses, capital losses or other Tax attributes relating to a Post-Closing Tax
Period. Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue any claims
for refund of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pending as of the Closing
Date. Parent shall make payment of any such refund described in this _Section
8.08(a)(iii)_, net of any reasonable costs incurred by or on behalf of Parent
in obtaining such refund, to the Representative within ten days of the actual
receipt of such refund.

 



50 (iv) Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall amend, refile, revoke
or otherwise modify any Tax Return or Tax election of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period without the prior
written consent of the Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(b) _Cooperation_. The parties will cooperate with each other to provide each
other with such information and assistance as may be reasonably requested by
them in connection with the preparation of any Tax Returns, including the
filing of any claim for any refund, any Tax protest, Tax audit or other
examination in connection with an administrative or judicial proceeding
involving a taxing authority relating to Taxes, compliance with any Tax-
related requirements of any Governmental Body and the enforcement of the
provisions of this _Section 8.08(b)_. Such cooperation will
include, including upon Representatives or Parents request, providing
records and information that are reasonably relevant to any such matters,
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information, and giving any powers of attorney.

(c) _Transfer Taxes_. Parent will pay any real property transfer, stamp, stock
transfer, recording, filing or other similar Tax payable as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, but excluding any Taxes based on
or attributable to income or gains (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ "), and
any penalties or interest with respect to the Transfer Taxes. Parent shall
file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to
Transfer Taxes (except to the extent such Tax Returns are required by Law to
be filed by a Holder), and Representative agrees to cooperate with Parent in
the filing of any such Tax Returns, including promptly supplying any
information in its possession that is reasonably necessary to complete such
returns. Parent and the Representative shall, upon request of the other
party, use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or
other document from any Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or
eliminate any Transfer Tax.

 

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, any Taxes with respect to any Straddle
Period shall be apportioned between the portion of such period up to and
including the Closing Date (such portion, a " _Pre-Closing Straddle Period_ ")
and the portion of such period that begins the day after the Closing Date
(such portion, a " _Post-Closing Straddle Period_ ") based, (i) in the case
of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to income or receipts, on
a per diem basis and, (ii) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to
income or receipts be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if
the relevant taxable period ended as of the close of business on the Closing
Date. For purposes of this _Section 8.08(d)_, any exemption, deduction,
credit or other item that is calculated on an annual basis shall be
allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period in the same manner as that
set forth in clause (i) of this _Section 8.08(d)_.

8.09 _Further Assurances_. From time to time, as and when requested by any
party and at such requesting partys expense, any other party will execute and
deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all such documents and
instruments and will take, or cause to be taken, all such further or other
actions as the requesting party may reasonably deem necessary or desirable to
evidence and effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

8.10 _Holdback Shares_.

 



51 (a) From and after the Closing, until all of the Holdback Shares have been
cancelled or released pursuant to this _Section 8.10_, Parent will be
entitled to reimbursement (on behalf of the Parent Indemnitees) out of the
Holdback Shares for any and all Losses incurred by the Parent Indemnitees
which are subject to indemnification by the Holders pursuant to this _Article
8_.

(b) Parent, on behalf of a Parent Indemnitee suffering a Loss, shall provide
written notice that takes into account the limitations set forth in this
_Article 8_ (a " _Claims Notice_ ") to the Representative specifying (i) in
reasonable detail (including specific reference to the provision(s) of this
Agreement giving rise to the Losses) the nature and dollar amount of any claim
(a " _Claim_ ") it may have, (ii) the aggregate dollar amount of Losses
sustained or estimated to be sustained by the Parent Indemnified Parties as a
result of such Claim and (iii) the number of Holdback Shares to be released to
Parent, on behalf of such Parent Indemnitees with respect to such Losses
(which such number of shares shall equal the amount of such Losses, divided
by the closing price of the Parent Shares on the date of the date of such
Claims Notice). In the case of any estimated Losses contained in a Claims
Notice, Parent shall provide a subsequent Claims Notice once such Losses have
been finally determined.

(c) If the Representative gives written notice to Parent disputing any Claim
(a " _Counter Notice_ ") within 15 calendar days following receipt by the
Representative of the Claims Notice regarding such Claim, such Claim (each, a
" _Disputed Claim_ ") shall be resolved as provided in this _Section 8.10_.
If no Counter Notice is received by Parent within such 15 calendar day
period, then the amount of the Loss and the number of Holdback Shares as set
forth in its Claims Notice will be deemed established for purposes of this
Agreement and Parent shall instruct the Transfer Agent to release to Parent,
on behalf of the Parent Indemnitees suffering the applicable Loss, the number
of Parent Shares set forth in the Claims Notice from the Holdback Shares.

 

(d) If the Representative delivers a Counter Notice, such Counter Notice (and
the dispute described therein) must be settled either: (i) by mutual
agreement of the Representative and Parent or (ii) final, non-appealable order
of a court or a final, non-appealable arbitration decision. Parent and the
Representative shall deliver written instructions to the Transfer
Agent directing the release of Holdback Shares in accordance with any such
mutual agreement or order or decision within two business days of such
agreement or entry of such order or decisions.

 

(e) On the date that is eighteen months after the Closing Date, Parent and the
Representative will deliver a joint written instruction to the Transfer
Agent, directing the Transfer Agent to reflect that each Holder shall have
been conveyed a number of Holdback Shares (rounded down to the nearest share)
equal to (i) (A) the number of Holdback Shares then remaining, minus (B) the
aggregate number of all Pending Claim Shares, _multiplied by_ (ii) such
Holders Proportionate Share. " _Pending Claim Shares_ " means, for each
Disputed Claim and for each Claim delivered in a Claims Notice before the
date that is eighteen months after the Closing Date for which the
Representative has not provided a Dispute Notice and for which Parent has not
received payment, (y) the amount of such claim, divided by (z) the closing
price of the Parent Shares on the date the Claims Notice with respect to such
Claim was given.

 



52 (f) From and after the date that is eighteen months after the Closing Date, at
any time the Holdback Shares exceed the Pending Claim Shares, Parent and
Representative will deliver a joint written instruction to the Transfer Agent,
directing the Transfer Agent to reflect that each Holder shall have been
conveyed a number of Holdback Shares (rounded down to the nearest share)
equal to (i) the amount of such excess, _multiplied by_ (ii) such Holders
Proportionate Share.

ARTICLE 9

_REPRESENTATIVE_

 

9.01 _Representative_.

(a) Effective upon and by virtue of the Holder Approval and/or delivery of the
Holder Letters of Transmittal, and without any further act of any of the
Holders, the Representative shall be hereby appointed as the representative
of the Holders and as the attorney-in-fact and agent for and on behalf of each
Holder for purposes of this Agreement and will take such actions to be taken
by the Representative under this Agreement and such other actions on behalf
of such Holders as it may deem necessary or appropriate in connection with or
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including (i)
executing and delivering this Agreement and any other ancillary documents and
negotiating and executing such amendments, modifications, waivers or changes
thereto as to which the Representative, in its sole discretion, shall have
consented ( _provided_ that any waiver or amendment that shall adversely
and disproportionately affect the rights or obligations of any Holder as
compared to other Holders shall require the prior written consent of such
Holder), (ii) taking all actions and making all filings on behalf of such
Holders with any Governmental Body or other Person necessary to effect the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii)
agreeing to, negotiating, entering into settlements and compromises of,
complying with orders of courts with respect to, and otherwise administering
and handling any claims under this Agreement on behalf of such Holders, (iv)
satisfying from the Holdback Shares costs, expenses and/or liabilities
incurred by Representative in its capacity as the Representative and
otherwise in accordance with this Agreement, and (v) taking all other actions
that are either necessary or appropriate in the judgment of Representative for
the accomplishment of the foregoing or contemplated by the terms of this
Agreement. Representative hereby accepts such appointment. Representative
shall use commercially reasonable efforts based on contact information
available to the Representative to keep the Holders reasonably informed with
respect to actions of Representative pursuant to the authority granted
Representative under this Agreement which actions have a material impact on
the amounts payable to the Holders. Each Holder shall promptly provide written
notice to the Representative of any change of address of such Holder.

(b) A decision, act, consent or instruction of Representative hereunder shall
constitute a decision, act, consent or instruction of all Holders and shall
be final, binding and conclusive upon each such Holder, and Parent and the
Surviving Company may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction
of Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of each
and every such Holder. Parent and the Surviving Company shall be relieved from
any liability to any Person for any acts done by them in accordance with such
decision, act, consent or instruction of Representative. 

 



53 (c) Representative will incur no liability with respect to any action taken or
suffered by any Holder in reliance upon any notice, direction, instruction,
consent, statement or other document believed by such Representative to be
genuine and to have been signed by such Holder (and shall have no
responsibility to determine the authenticity thereof), nor for any other
action or inaction, except the gross negligence, bad faith or willful
misconduct of Representative. In all questions arising under this Agreement,
the Representative may rely on the advice of outside counsel, and
the Representative will not be liable to any Holder for anything done,
omitted or suffered in good faith by Representative based on such advice.

(d) The Holders shall severally (each based on its Proportionate Share) but
not jointly indemnify Representative and hold Representative harmless against
any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross negligence, bad faith
or willful misconduct on the part of Representative and arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of Representatives duties
hereunder, including the reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel or
other advisors reasonably retained by Representative.

(e) At any time Holders representing at least seventy percent (70%) in
interest of the Holders may, by written consent, appoint another Person as
Representative. Notice together with a copy of the written consent appointing
such Person and bearing the signatures of Holders of at least seventy percent
(70%) in interest of the Holders must be delivered to Parent not less than 10
days prior to such appointment. Such appointment will be effective upon the
later of the date indicated in the consent or the date 10 days after such
consent is received by Parent. For the purposes of this _Section 9.01_,
"seventy percent (70%) in interest of the Holders" shall mean Holders
representing in the aggregate at least 70% of the percentage interests in the
Aggregate Merger Consideration.

(f) In the event that Representative becomes unable or unwilling to continue
in his or its capacity as Representative, or if Representative resigns as a
Representative, Holders representing at least seventy percent (70%) in
interest of the Holders may, by written consent, appoint a new representative
as Representative. Notice and a copy of the written consent appointing such
new representative and bearing the signatures of the Holders of at least
seventy percent (70%) in interest of the Holders must be delivered to Parent.
Such appointment will be effective upon the later of the date indicated in
the consent or the date 10 days after such consent is received by Parent.

(g) The grant of authority provided for herein (i) is coupled with an
interest and shall be irrevocable and survive the death, incompetency,
bankruptcy or liquidation of any Holder, and (ii) shall survive the
consummation of the Merger.

11.06 _Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof will be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns, except that neither this Agreement nor any
of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder may be assigned or delegated
by any party without the prior written consent of the other parties.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may assign this Agreement to
any Subsidiary of Parent or to any lender of Parent or any Subsidiary or
Affiliate thereof as security for obligations to such lender in respect of the
financing arrangements entered into in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and any refinancings, offerings, extensions, refundings
or renewals thereof,

 



67   _provided_ that no assignment to any such Subsidiary or lender will in any
way affect Parents obligations or liabilities under this Agreement and (ii)
after the Closing, any Holder may assign this Agreement to any of its
beneficial owners or successors by operation of law.

11.07  _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement
will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable Law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be
prohibited by or invalid under applicable Law, such provision will be
ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without
invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of
this Agreement, and the parties will amend or otherwise modify this Agreement
to replace any prohibited or invalid provision with an effective and valid
provision that gives effect to the intent of the parties to the maximum extent
permitted by applicable Law.

 

11.08 _No Strict Construction; Disclosure Schedules_. The language used in
this Agreement will be deemed to be the language chosen by the parties to
express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction will be
applied against any Person. The disclosure schedules attached to this
Agreement have been arranged for purposes of convenience in separately titled
sections corresponding to sections of this Agreement. Capitalized terms used
in the disclosure schedules and not otherwise defined therein have the
meanings given to them in this Agreement. The information contained in this
Agreement and in the disclosure schedules and Exhibits is disclosed solely
for purposes of this Agreement, and no information contained herein or therein
will be deemed to be an admission by any party to any third party of any
matter whatsoever (including, without limitation, any violation of law or
breach of contract).

11.09 _Amendment and Waiver_. Any provision of this Agreement or the
disclosure schedules or Exhibits may be amended or waived only in a writing
signed by Parent and Representative. No waiver of any provision hereunder or
any breach or default thereof will extend to or affect in any way any other
provision or prior or subsequent breach or default.

11.10 _Complete Agreement_. This Agreement and the documents referred to
herein (including the Confidentiality Agreement) contain the complete
agreement between the parties and supersede any prior understandings,
agreements or representations by or between the parties, written or oral,
which may have related to the subject matter hereof in any way.

11.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts
(including by means of telecopied signature pages or electronic transmission
in portable document format (pdf)), any one of which need not contain the
signatures of more than one party, but all such counterparts taken together
will constitute one and the same instrument. 

11.12 _Obligations of Parent and Merger Sub_. The obligations of Parent and
Merger Sub hereunder are jointly and severally guaranteed by each other.

11.13 _Non-Recourse_. Except as provided in _Article 8_ , all claims or
causes of action (whether in contract or tort, in law or in equity) that may
be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation,
execution or performance of this Agreement (including any representation or
warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to
enter into this Agreement), may be made only against the entities that are
expressly identified as

 



68  parties hereto. Except as provided in _Article 8_ , no Person that is not a
named party to this Agreement, including any past, present or future director,
officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, equityholder, Affiliate,
agent, attorney or representative of any named party to this Agreement ("
_Non-Party Affiliates_ "), shall have any liability (whether in contract or in
tort, in law or in equity, or based upon any theory that seeks to impose
liability of an entity party against its owners or affiliates) for any
obligations or liabilities arising under, in connection with or related to
this Agreement or any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of this
Agreement or its negotiation or execution, and, except as provided in _Article
8_ , each party hereto waives and releases all such liabilities, claims and
obligations against any such Non-Party Affiliates.

 

11.14 _Governing Law_. All matters (including any and all claims) arising out
of or relating to the interpretation, construction, validity or enforcement
of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (other than the
Tender Offer, which will be governed by and construed in accordance with the
domestic laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or
conflict of law provision or rule) will be governed by and construed in
accordance with the domestic laws of the State of New York without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the
State of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York, except to the
extent the DGCL shall be held to govern the Merger.

 

11.15 _Consent to Jurisdiction and Service of Process_. Subject to _Section
1.02_ (which will govern any dispute arising thereunder), the parties to this
Agreement submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts located in
the Borough of Manhattan, New York, New York or the courts of the United
States located in the Borough of Manhattan, New York, New York in respect of
the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and any
related agreement, certificate or other document delivered in connection
herewith (including the Tender Offer) and by this Agreement waive, and agree
not to assert, any defense in any action for the interpretation or
enforcement of this Agreement and any related agreement, certificate or other
document delivered in connection herewith, that they are not subject thereto
or that such action may not be brought or is not maintainable in such courts
or that this Agreement may not be enforced in or by such courts or that their
property is exempt or immune from execution, that the action is brought in an
inconvenient forum, or that the venue of the action is improper. Service of
process with respect thereto may be made upon any party by mailing a copy
thereof by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to such party at its
address as provided in _Section 11.05_. Each of the parties hereto agrees
that a judgment in any dispute may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit
on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.

11.16 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each party hereby acknowledges and agrees that
any controversy which may arise under this Agreement is likely to involve
complicated and difficult issues, and therefore each such party hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right such party may have to a
trial by jury in respect of any litigation directly or indirectly arising out
of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including the Tender Offer). Each party certifies and
acknowledges that (i) no representative, agent or attorney of any other party
has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in
the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver, (ii) each such
party understands and has considered the implications of this waiver, (iii)
each such party makes this waiver voluntarily, and (iv) each such party has
been induced to enter into this agreement by, among other things, the mutual
waivers and certifications in this _Section 11.16_.

 



69 11.17 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. No Person other than the parties hereto
will have any rights, remedies, obligations or benefits under any provision
of this Agreement, other than _Sections 8.02_ and _8.03_ (to the extent
provided therein), except for (i) the directors and officers of the Company
and its Subsidiaries solely with respect to _Section 6.02_.

11.18 _Deliveries to Parent or Merger Sub; Disclaimer_. Parent and Merger Sub
agree and acknowledge that all documents or other items included in the
electronic dataroom or otherwise delivered to Parent, Merger Sub or their
respective representatives (including, without limitation, Parents
accountants and any of Parents legal counsel) will be deemed to be delivered
to Parent and Merger Sub for all purposes hereunder. Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledge and agree that, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement,
none of the Company, Representative or any Holder has made any representation
or warranty, express or implied, as to the Company or as to the accuracy or
completeness of any information regarding the Company furnished or made
available to Parent, Merger Sub or their respective representatives, and,
except as set forth in this Agreement, none of the Company, Representative or
any Holder will have or be subject to any liability to Parent, Merger Sub or
any other Person resulting from the distribution to Parent or Merger Sub or
Parents or Merger Subs use of or reliance on, any such information or any
information, documents or material made available to Parent or Merger Sub. In
connection with Parents and Merger Subs investigation of the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub have received from or on behalf of the Company certain
projections, including projected statements of operating revenues and income
from operations of the Company and certain business plan information of
the Company. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that there are uncertainties
inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections and other forecasts
and plans, that each of Parent and Merger Sub is familiar with such
uncertainties, that each of Parent and Merger Sub is taking full
responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of
all estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans so furnished to it
(including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates,
projections and forecasts), and that Parent and Merger Sub will have no claim
against any Holder, Representative or any other Person with respect thereto.
Accordingly, each Holder, Representative and the Company make
no representations or warranties whatsoever with respect to such estimates,
projections and other forecasts and plans (including the reasonableness of the
assumptions underlying such estimates, projections and forecasts), and each of
Parent and Merger Sub agrees that it has not relied thereon.

11.19 _Conflict Between Transaction Documents_. The parties agree
and acknowledge that to the extent any terms and provisions of this Agreement
are in any way inconsistent with or in conflict with any term, condition or
provision of any other agreement, document or instrument contemplated hereby,
this Agreement will govern and control.

11.20 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached
by a party hereto. It is accordingly agreed that the Company, on the one hand,
and Parent, on the other hand, will be entitled to seek specific enforcement
of the terms hereof, including an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of

 



70  this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof
in any court having jurisdiction pursuant to _Section 11.14_, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which the Company or Parent are entitled at
law or in equity, without posting any bond or other undertaking.

11.21  _Interpretation_. In the event that representations and warranties set
forth in one Section (e.g., _Section 3.09_, relating to Taxes) may generally
apply to a matter which is more specifically addressed elsewhere in
the representations and warranties (e.g., _Section 3.13_, relating to
Employee Benefit Plans), it is the intent of the parties that the provisions
of the more specific Section shall be considered to be the sole
representations and warranties on such subject, except to the extent a
specific matter is expressly referenced in one Section as applying to matters
which are specifically covered by another Section.

11.22 _Electronic Delivery_. This Agreement and any signed agreement or
instrument entered into in connection with this Agreement, and any amendments
hereto or thereto, to the extent delivered by means of a facsimile machine or
electronic mail (any such delivery, an " _Electronic Delivery_ "), will be
treated in all manner and respects as an original agreement or instrument and
will be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the
original signed version thereof delivered in person. At the request of any
party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument, each other party hereto
or thereto will re execute original forms thereof and deliver them to all
other parties. No party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument will
raise the use of Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature or the fact that
any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated
through the use of Electronic Delivery as a defense to the formation of a
contract, and each such party forever waives any such defense, except to the
extent such defense related to lack of authenticity.

 _Tender Offer Conditions_

Reference is made to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 19,
2012 (the " _Agreement_ "), among Empeiria Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware
corporation (" _Parent_ "), IDE Acquisition Co., LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "),
Integrated Drilling Holdings Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "
_Company_ "), and Stephen Cope, as representative (the " _Representatives_ ").
Capitalized terms that are used but not otherwise defined in this Annex A
shall have the respective meanings ascribed thereto in the Agreement.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Tender Offer, and in addition to
(and not in limitation of) the rights and obligations of Parent to extend,
terminate and/or modify the Tender Offer (subject to the terms and conditions
of the Agreement), Parent (i) shall not be required to accept for payment or,
subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC (including Rule
14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act (relating to the obligation of Parent to pay
for or return tendered shares of Parent Stock promptly after termination or
withdrawal of either of the Tender Offer)), pay for, or may delay the
acceptance for payment of or, subject to the restriction referred to above,
the payment for, any tendered shares of Parent Stock and (ii) may terminate
or amend the Tender Offer as to shares of Parent Stock not then paid for in
the event that, at the then-scheduled Expiration Date (as it may be extended
pursuant to _Section 6.04_ of the Agreement) or immediately prior to such
payment, (A) any waiting period (and extensions thereof) applicable to the
transactions contemplated by the Agreement (including the Tender Offer and the
Merger) under the HSR Act shall not have expired or been terminated, or any
other approval under any antitrust or competition laws of other jurisdictions,
or any consent, waiver or approval from a third Person that is required in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the Agreement which in the
reasonable judgment of Parent is required or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the Agreement, including the Tender Offer and the
Merger, shall not have been obtained or made or shall not remain in full
force and effect (or any statutory waiting period in respect thereof shall not
have expired), (B) the Maximum Tender Condition shall not have been satisfied,
(C) the Merger, in our reasonable judgment, to be determined as
of immediately prior to the Expiration Date, is not capable of being
consummated contemporaneously with the Offer on or before 5:00 p.m. on
December 15, 2012, (D) to the extent more than 3,629,000 shares of Parent
Stock are tendered in the Tender Offer, the receipt by Parent of proceeds
from a new financing in an amount sufficient to pay for any shares of Parent
Stock in excess of 3,629,000 but less than 5,520,000 or (E) any of the
following shall have occurred:

 

(a) a general suspension of trading in, or limitation on prices for,
securities on any U.S. national securities exchange or in the over-the-
counter markets in the United States or a declaration of a banking moratorium
or any suspension of payments in respect of banks in the United States,
whether or not mandatory, shall have occurred;

 

(b) any action, suit or proceeding by any government or governmental,
regulatory or administrative agency, authority or tribunal or by any other
person, domestic, foreign or supranational, before any court, authority,
agency or other tribunal that directly or indirectly, challenges or seeks to
make illegal, or to delay or otherwise directly or indirectly to restrain or   prohibit the making of the Offer or the acquisition of some or all of the
shares of Parent Stock pursuant to the Offer shall have been instituted or
been pending, at any time after the commencement of the Offer and before the
Initial Expiration Date.

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and, subject to
the terms and conditions of the Agreement, may be waived by Parent, in whole
or in part at any time and from time to time in the sole discretion of Parent.
The failure or delay by Parent at any time to exercise any of the
foregoing rights shall not operate as a waiver of any such right, and each
such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time
and from time to time.
