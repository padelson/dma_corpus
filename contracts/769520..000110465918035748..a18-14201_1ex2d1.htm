accountants and other representatives to, reasonably cooperate with and assist
the other parties and their Affiliates and representatives in connection with
such review, including by providing access to such books, records and work
papers and making available personnel to the extent requested, in each case,
upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours; _provided_ , that
such accountants shall not be obliged to make any work papers available to a
party except in accordance with such accountants normal disclosure procedures
and then only after such party has signed a customary agreement relating to
such access to work papers.

 



 

(c) Purchaser agrees that, following the Closing through the date that the
Final Closing Statement becomes final and binding, it will not take or permit
to be taken any actions with respect to any accounting books, records,
policies or procedures on which the Business Financial Statements or the
Initial Closing Statement are based, or on which the Final Closing Statement
is to be based, that would impede or delay the determination of the amount of
Working Capital, Net Indebtedness or Transaction Costs as of the opening of
business on the Closing Date or the preparation of any Notice of Disagreement
or the Final Closing Statement in the manner and utilizing the methods
provided by this Agreement (including the Accounting Principles).

 



 

2.6 _Reconciliation of Post-Closing Statements_.

 



 

(a) Parent shall notify Purchaser in writing no later than forty-five (45)
days after Parents receipt of the Initial Closing Statement if Parent
disagrees with any portion of the Initial Closing Statement, which notice
shall identify the portion(s) of the Initial Closing Statement that Parent
does not agree with and describe the basis for such disagreement (the "
_Notice of Disagreement_ "). If no Notice of Disagreement is delivered to
Purchaser within this forty-five (45) day period then the Initial Closing
Statement shall become final and binding upon the parties in accordance with
_Section 2.6(c)_. If a Notice of Disagreement is delivered to Purchaser
within this forty-five (45) day period then only such portions of the Initial
Closing Statement that Parent does not identify or disagree with in the Notice
of Disagreement shall become final and binding upon the parties in accordance
with _Section 2.6(c)_.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) During the thirty (30) days immediately following the delivery of a Notice
of Disagreement (the " _Resolution Period_ "), Parent and Purchaser shall seek
in good faith to resolve any differences that they may have with respect to
the matters identified in the Notice of Disagreement.

 



 

(c) If at the end of the Resolution Period, Parent and Purchaser have been
unable to resolve any differences that they may have with respect to the
matters identified in the Notice of Disagreement, Parent and Purchaser shall
submit all matters that remain in dispute with respect to the Notice of
Disagreement to Deloitte and Touche LLP or, if such firm is unwilling or unable
to fulfill such role, (i) another independent certified public accounting firm
in the United States of national reputation mutually acceptable to Parent and
Purchaser or (ii) if Parent and Purchaser are unable to agree upon another
such firm within ten (10) Business Days after the end of the Resolution
Period, then within an additional ten (10) Business Days, Parent and Purchaser
shall each select one such firm and those two firms shall, within ten (10)
Business Days after their selection, select a third (3rd) such firm (Deloitte
and Touche LLP, the firm selected in accordance with clause (i) or the third
firm selected in accordance with clause (ii), as applicable, the "
_Independent Accounting Firm_ "). The parties shall instruct the Independent
Accounting Firm that, within thirty (30) days after the Independent Accounting
Firms selection, the Independent Accounting Firm shall make a final
determination in accordance with the Accounting Principles and based solely on
the written submissions of the parties, binding on the parties to this
Agreement, of the appropriate amount of each of the matters that remain in
dispute as indicated in the Notice of Disagreement that Parent and Purchaser
have submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm. The parties shall instruct
the Independent Accounting Firm that, with respect to each disputed matter,
such determination, if not in accordance with the position of either Parent or
Purchaser, shall not be in excess of the higher, or less than the lower, of
the amounts advocated by Parent in the Notice of Disagreement or by Purchaser
in the Initial Closing Statement with respect to such disputed matter. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Independent Accounting Firm shall not review or make
any determination with respect to any matter other than the matters that
remain in dispute as indicated in the Notice of Disagreement. The statements
of (i) Working Capital, (ii) Net Indebtedness and (iii) Transaction Costs that
are final and binding on the parties, as determined either through agreement
of the parties pursuant to _Section 2.6(a)_ or _Section 2.6(b)_ or through
the action of the Independent Accounting Firm pursuant to this _Section
2.6(c)_, are referred to collectively as the " _Final Closing Statement_."

 



 

(d) All fees and expenses relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the
Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne equally by the Sellers on the one
hand, and Purchaser on the other hand. During the review by the Independent
Accounting Firm, each of Purchaser and the Sellers shall, and shall cause its
respective Affiliates (including, in the case of Purchaser, the Transferred
Companies) and its and their respective employees, accountants and other
representatives to, each make available to the Independent Accounting Firm,
upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours, interviews with such
personnel, and such information, books and records and work papers, as may be
reasonably requested by the Independent Accounting Firm to fulfill its
obligations under _Section 2.6(c)_; _provided_ , that the accountants of the
Sellers or Purchaser shall not be obliged to make any work papers available to
the Independent Accounting Firm except in accordance with such accountants
normal disclosure procedures and then only after such Independent Accounting
Firm has signed a customary

 



      
 

 



 

agreement relating to such access to work papers. In acting under this
Agreement, the Independent Accounting Firm shall be entitled to the privileges
and immunities of an arbitrator.

 



 

(e) Except for the Sellers indemnification and payment obligations set forth
in _Section 5.22_, _Section 7.2_, _Section 7.6_, _Section 10.2(a)(iv)_ and
_Section 10.2(a)(v)_ and Purchasers indemnification and payment obligations
set forth in _Section 7.3_ and _Section 7.6_ (which shall in each case be
subject to the applicable survival periods set forth in _Section 10.1_), the
process set forth in _Section 2.5_ and this _Section 2.6_ shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy of any of the parties and their respective Affiliates for
any disputes related to the Closing Working Capital, Net Indebtedness and
Transaction Costs Adjustments, the Post-Closing Adjustment, and the
calculations and amounts on which they are based or set forth in the related
statements and notices delivered in connection therewith.

 



 

2.7 _Post-Closing Adjustment_. The " _Post-Closing Adjustment_ " may be either
a positive or negative amount, and shall be equal to (a) (i) the amount of
Working Capital set forth in the Final Closing Statement less (ii) the amount
of Working Capital set forth in the Estimated Closing Statement, plus (b) (x)
the amount of Net Indebtedness set forth in the Estimated Closing Statement
less (y) the amount of Net Indebtedness set forth in the Final Closing
Statement, plus (c) (1) the amount of Transaction Costs set forth in the
Estimated Closing Statement less (2) the amount of Transaction Costs set forth
in the Final Closing Statement. If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a positive
amount, then Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid in cash to Parent (or one
or more Affiliates designated by Parent) the amount of the Post-Closing
Adjustment. If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a negative amount, then Parent
(or an Affiliate designated by Parent) shall pay in cash to Purchaser the
absolute value of the amount of the Post-Closing Adjustment. Any such payment
pursuant to this _Section 2.7_ shall be made by wire transfer of immediately
available funds within five (5) Business Days after the determination of the
Final Closing Statement to an account designated in writing by the party
entitled to the payment within three (3) Business Days after the determination
of the Final Closing Statement.

 



 

2.8 _Foreign Acquisition Agreements_.

 



 

(a) The transfer of the Shares of each of TI and TFET shall be effected at the
Closing pursuant to the Foreign Acquisition Agreement for TI and the Foreign
Acquisition Agreement for TFET, respectively; _provided_ , in each case, that
the Foreign Acquisition Agreements shall serve purely to effect the legal
transfer of the Shares of TI and TFET, as applicable, and shall not have any
effect on the terms and conditions of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the allocation of assets and Liabilities as between them or the
parties, all of which shall be determined by this Agreement, or in any way
modify, amend or constitute a waiver of, any provision of this Agreement or
any Ancillary Agreement.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the parties
acknowledge and agree that (i) the Sellers shall cause SCT, and the Purchaser
shall cause Middleby Induction China, to enter into and perform its
obligations under the Chinese Asset Purchase Agreement and the assignment to
and assumption by Middleby Induction China of the SCT Business Assets and the
SCT Business Liabilities, respectively, shall be effected pursuant to the
Chinese Asset Purchase Agreement as soon as practicable following the Closing
subject to the terms and conditions thereof, and not pursuant to this
Agreement; and (ii) except as otherwise

 



      
 

 



 

expressly set forth herein, the SCT Business Assets and SCT Business
Liabilities shall be deemed to constitute part of the Business for purposes of
this Agreement, including the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements contained herein; _provided_ , that each of the Sellers and
Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the transfer by SCT to Middleby

the amounts to be paid at the Closing pursuant to _Sections 2.2_ and _2.3_ )
and shall be subject to the terms of the Chinese Asset Purchase Agreement,
and, except to the extent expressly provided otherwise herein or in any other

Purchase Agreement, notwithstanding that such transfer will occur following
the Closing. From and after the Closing, if the transfer of the SCT Business
Assets and SCT Business Liabilities pursuant to the Chinese Asset Purchase
Agreement has not yet been completed, until such transfer has been completed,
each of Purchaser and the Sellers shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates (including, in the case of Purchaser, the Transferred Companies,
and in the case of the Sellers, SCT) to cooperate and use commercially
reasonable efforts to continue the operations of the SCT Business Assets in
the ordinary course and to facilitate the completion of such transfer as
promptly as practicable after the Closing Date (including by (x) providing or
continuing any supply, service and distribution arrangements or services
necessary to complete the steps set forth on Schedule III to the Chinese Asset
Purchase Agreement on the terms and conditions set forth therein and (y) to
the extent not addressed by the foregoing clause (x), providing or continuing
any supply, service and distribution arrangements or services on substantially
the same terms as in effect prior to the Closing between any of the
Transferred Companies and SCT related to the SCT Business Assets to enable SCT
to operate the SCT Business Assets in the ordinary course until the completion
of such transfer).

 



 

2.9 _Withholding_. Purchaser and the Purchaser Designees shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any payment of the Purchase Price and any payment
made by Purchaser or the Purchaser Designees pursuant to _Section 2.7_, such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payments under the Code or any provisions of applicable Tax Law, as
reasonably determined by Purchaser or the applicable Purchaser Designee,
subject to clause (ii) of this _Section 2.9_; _provided_ , that (i) no later
than twenty (20) days prior to making any deduction or withholding, Purchaser
shall provide written notice to Parent of the amounts Purchaser or the
Purchaser Designees intend to deduct or withhold (and the basis for such

Company Benefit Plan, in full compliance with applicable Law, immediately
after the Closing Date without a Transferred Company (or Purchaser following
the Closing Date) or any of their Affiliates being required to make additional
contributions to such International Transferred Company Benefit Plan (or

control payments or (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or
increase the amount of, compensation due to any such Business Employee or
consultant, in each case, for which a Transferred Company (or the Purchaser
following the Closing Date) would have any Liability. No Seller Benefit Plan
or Transferred Company Benefit Plan provides for the gross-up of any Taxes
payable by any current or former Business Employee, for which a Transferred
Company (or the Purchaser following the Closing Date) would have any
Liability.

nor its Affiliates has received written notice of any, and to the Knowledge of
Sellers, there is no, default by any of the Transferred Companies under any
restrictive covenants affecting the Business Owned Real Property, and there
has not occurred any event that with the lapse of time or the giving of notice
or both would constitute such a default by any of the Transferred Companies,

existing buildings and improvements located on the Business Owned Real
Property are located entirely within the boundary lines of such Business Owned
Real Property or on permanent easements on adjoining land benefiting such
Business Owned Real Property and may lawfully be used under applicable zoning
and land use laws for their current use.

 



 

(b) _Section 3.12(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_ sets forth a list as
of the date hereof of (i) the address of all of the real property leased,

(the " _Business Leased Real Property_ " and together with the " _Business
Owned Real Property_ ", the " _Business Real Property_ ") and (ii) the name of
the lessee of such Business Leased Real Property. Except as would not

Sellers or any of their respective Subsidiaries has received any written
notice of any, and there is no default by any of the Transferred Companies, or
to the Knowledge of the Sellers, by any other party, under any Lease and no
event has occurred, which, after the giving of notice, with lapse of time, or
otherwise, would constitute a default by any Transferred Company, or, to the
Knowledge of Sellers, any other party under such Lease, in each case except as
would not reasonably be expected to be material to the Transferred Companies
and the Business, taken as a whole.

 



 

(c) There are no material leases, subleases, licenses or similar use or
occupancy agreements pursuant to which any Transferred Company grants to any
third party the right to use or possession of the Business Real Property.

(a) As of the date hereof and at all times prior to the Closing, Purchaser has
all funds necessary to and/or access to borrowing facilities, including the
Purchaser Credit Facility, sufficient to, and, on the Closing Date and as of
the Closing, shall have all funds necessary to, (i) consummate the Sale and
the other transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) pay (A) the Purchase Price
and (B) all other cash amounts required to be paid at or in connection with

When so required to pay or otherwise perform, as applicable, Purchaser will be
able to pay or otherwise perform the obligations of Purchaser and any of its
Affiliates under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

 



 

(b) As of the date hereof, the Purchaser Credit Facility is in full force and
effect and is a legal, valid and binding obligation of each party thereto,
enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to the Enforceability
Exceptions. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred which, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would (i) constitute a default or
breach on the part of any Loan Party (as defined in the Purchaser Credit
Facility) under any term or condition of the Purchaser Credit Facility, (ii)
constitute or result in a failure to satisfy a condition precedent or other
contingency to borrowing set forth in the Purchaser Credit Facility or (iii)

the " _Available Credit_ ") under the Purchaser Credit Facility plus cash on
hand is equal to at least the Specified Amount.

 



 

(c) As of the Closing, after giving effect to any indebtedness being incurred
on or prior to such date in connection herewith, and assuming satisfaction of
the conditions set forth in _Section 8.2(a)_, the Purchaser, Middleby, their
respective Subsidiaries and the Transferred Companies, all on a consolidated
basis, will not (i) be insolvent (either because their financial condition is
such that the sum of their debts (including a reasonable estimate of the
amount of all contingent liabilities of the consolidated group) is greater
than the fair value of their assets, or because the present fair salable value
of their assets will be less than the amount required to pay their probable
liability on their debts as they become absolute and matured), (ii) have
unreasonably small capital with which to engage in their business or (iii)
have incurred debts beyond their ability to pay as they become absolute and
matured.

thereof, or with any present intention of distributing or selling such Shares.

contrary in this Agreement, neither the Sellers nor any Transferred Company
nor any of their respective Affiliates shall be required to provide access to
or disclose information (i) in connection with any litigation or similar

contracts or obligation of confidentiality.

 



 

(c) After the date hereof, Sellers and the Parent Group shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to separate the Business Materials that relate to the

respect to such information, (ii) that is in the public domain or enters into
the public domain through no fault of Parent or any of its Affiliates, (iii)

the Closing, independently derived by Parent or any of its Affiliates without
use of such Sensitive Business Information or (v) subject to the immediately
following sentence, that Parent or any of its Affiliates is required by Law or

information, Parent shall reasonably promptly notify Purchaser in writing
unless not permitted by Law or such legal or regulatory process to so notify,
which notification shall include the nature of such legal or regulatory
requirement or request, as applicable, and the extent of the required or
requested disclosure, and will use commercially reasonable efforts to

Entity necessary to be obtained at or prior to the Closing.

recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance from the source of
the materials (Purchaser or the Sellers, as the case may be) or its legal
counsel; it being understood that materials provided pursuant to this
Agreement may be redacted, at the direction of outside legal counsel, (i) to
remove references concerning the valuation of the Business, (ii) as necessary
to comply with contractual arrangements and (iii) as necessary to address
reasonable privilege concerns.

consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and/or (ii)
take such action as necessary to overturn any regulatory Action by any
Governmental Entity to block consummation of the transactions contemplated by

claims to be entitled to payment, reimbursement or indemnity with respect to
any Substituted Guarantees, and shall reimburse the Sellers for any expenses
incurred in connection with any of the foregoing.

 



 

(b) Without limiting _Section 5.10(a)_ in any respect, Purchaser shall use
its reasonable best efforts, at its sole expense, to cause itself, its
Affiliates or the Transferred Companies to be substituted in all respects for
the Sellers and any of their respective Affiliates, and for the Sellers and
their respective Affiliates to be released, effective as of the Closing, in
respect of, or otherwise terminate (and cause the Sellers and their respective
Affiliates to be released in respect of), all obligations of the Sellers and
any of their respective Affiliates under each of the guarantees, indemnities,
letters of credit, letters of comfort, commitments, understandings, agreements
and other obligations of such Persons to the extent related to the Business
that are set forth on _Section 5.10(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_
(collectively, the " _Substituted Guarantees_ "). For any of the Substituted
Guarantees for which Purchaser, its Affiliate or any Transferred Company, as
applicable, is not substituted in all respects for the Sellers and their
respective Affiliates (or for which the Sellers and their respective
Affiliates are not released) effective as of the Closing and that cannot
otherwise be terminated effective as of the Closing (with the Sellers and
their respective Affiliates to be released in respect thereof),

 



      
 

 



 

Purchaser shall continue to use its reasonable best efforts and shall cause
the Transferred Companies to use their reasonable best efforts to effect such
substitution or termination and release after the Closing. Without limiting
the foregoing, neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall extend or
renew any Contract containing or underlying a Substituted Guarantee unless,
prior to or concurrently with such extension or renewal, Purchaser or the
Transferred Companies are substituted in all respects for the Sellers and any
of their respective Affiliates, and the Sellers and their respective
Affiliates are released, in respect of all obligations of the Sellers and any
of their respective Affiliates under such Substituted Guarantee.

 



 

5.11 _Insurance_.

 



 

(a) Subject to _Section 5.11(b)_, from and after the Closing, the Transferred
Companies shall cease to be insured by the Sellers or their respective
Affiliates current and historical insurance policies or programs or by any of
their current and historical self-insured programs, and neither Purchaser nor
its Affiliates shall have any access, right, title or interest to or in any
such insurance policies, programs or self-insured programs (including to all
claims and rights to make claims and all rights to proceeds) to cover any
assets of the Transferred Companies or any Loss arising from the operation of
the Business, in each case including with respect to all known and incurred
but not reported claims. The Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates
may, to be effective at the Closing, amend any insurance policies and
ancillary arrangements in the manner they deem appropriate to give effect to
this _Section 5.11(a)_. From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall be
responsible for securing all insurance it considers appropriate for its
operation of the Transferred Companies and the Business. Subject to _Section
5.11(b)_, Purchaser further covenants and agrees not to seek to assert or to
exercise any rights or claims of any Transferred Company or the Business under
or in respect of any past or current insurance policy, program or self-
insurance program under which any Transferred Company or Affiliate thereof or
the Business is a named insured.

 



 

(b) Parent and its Affiliates will keep each of the workers compensation
insurance policies set forth on _Section 5.11(b) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule_ (" _Workers Compensation Policies_ "), or suitable replacements
therefor, in full force and effect through the Closing. Notwithstanding the
last sentence of _Section 5.11(a)_, with respect to claims relating to acts,
omissions, events or circumstances relating to Business Employees that
occurred or existed prior to the Closing that are covered by Workers
Compensation Policies (" _Pre-Closing WC Claims_ "), Parent hereby authorizes
Purchaser to report Pre-Closing WC Claims directly to the provider of such
Workers Compensation Policies (the " _WC Insurer_ ") and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to assist Purchasers efforts to obtain the
benefit of such insurance coverage; _provided_ , that Purchaser shall keep
Parent reasonably informed and shall exclusively bear and shall promptly repay
or reimburse Parent and its Affiliates for the amount of each claim including
any deductibles or self-insured retentions associated with any claims under
the Workers Compensation Policies and shall be liable for and indemnify Parent
and its Affiliates against all uninsured, uncovered, unavailable or
uncollectible amounts of such claims; _provided_ , _further_ , that
Purchasers total liability pursuant to this _Section 5.11(b)_ shall not
exceed $2,900,000. Parent shall, on a quarterly basis, submit an invoice to
Purchaser for any amounts payable to the WC Insurer in respect of such claims,
which Purchaser shall promptly (and in any event within ten (10) calendar
days) reimburse to Parent.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) At or prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall purchase a tail insurance
policy covering the Transferred Companies with respect to claims against the
Transferred Companies arising from facts or events which occurred at or before
the Closing. Each of Parent and Purchaser shall be responsible for and shall
pay an amount equal to 50% of the cost of such tail policy; _provided_ , that
Parent shall not be required to expend more than $200,000 in the aggregate for
such tail policy, and Purchaser shall pay for any excess cost.

 



 

5.12 _Post-Closing Litigation Support_.

 



 

(a) In the event and for so long as any party is prosecuting, contesting or
defending any legal proceeding, Action, investigation, charge, claim, or
demand by or against a third party (including any Governmental Entity) in
connection with (A) any transactions contemplated under this Agreement, and
(B) any fact, situation, circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice,
plan, occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to act, or transaction
relating to, in connection with or arising from the Business or the
Transferred Companies, at the reasonable written request of such party, each
other party shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Affiliates (and its
and their officers and employees) to, reasonably cooperate with such party and
its counsel in such prosecution, contest or defense, including making
available its personnel, participating in meetings, and providing such
testimony and access to its non-privileged books and records as shall be
reasonably necessary in connection with such prosecution, contest or defense,
at the sole cost and expense of the prosecuting, contesting or defending
party.

 



 

(b) The cooperation and information sharing obligations of a party under this
_Section 5.12_ shall be limited to the extent any such cooperation or
disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege or other applicable
privilege of such party or contravene any Laws or obligation of
confidentiality to a third party; _provided_ , that each party shall use its
reasonable best efforts to communicate the applicable information in a way
that would not jeopardize such privilege or protection or contravene such Laws
or obligations; and _provided_ , _further_ , that nothing in this Agreement
shall limit any partys rights of discovery.

 



 

(c) In the event of any conflict between this _Section 5.12_ and _Section
7.7_ or _Section 10.4_, _Section 7.7_ or _Section 10.4_, as applicable,
shall govern.

 



 

5.13 _Payments_.

 



 

(a) The Sellers shall promptly pay or deliver to Purchaser any funds that have
been sent to a member of the Parent Group after the Closing that, consistent
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, are the property of Purchaser
or its Affiliates (including the Transferred Companies and the Purchaser
Designees).

 



 

(b) Purchaser shall promptly pay or deliver to Parent any funds that have been
sent after the Closing Date to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including
the Transferred Companies and the Purchaser Designees) that, consistent with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, are the property of the Parent
Group.

 



      
 

 



 

5.14 _Use of Marks_.

 



 

(a) Except as expressly provided in this _Section 5.14_, neither Purchaser
nor any of its Affiliates shall use, or have or acquire the right to use or
any other rights in any marks of Parent or any of its Affiliates, including
"United Technologies," "UTC" or "UTX," or the UTC gear icon logo or "Carrier,"
"Climate Controls and Security," "CCS," "Transicold," "Building and Industrial
Systems," or "BIS," or any variations or derivatives thereof, or any name,
trademark, service mark or logo that is confusingly similar to any of the
foregoing (the " _UTC Names_ "). Within twenty (20) Business Days of Closing,
Purchaser shall cause each of the Transferred Companies having a name,
trademark, service mark or logo that includes the UTC Names to change its name
to a name that does not include any UTC Name, including making any legal
filings necessary to effect such change. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing
in this _Section 5.14(a)_ shall limit the rights of Purchaser and its
Affiliates with respect to the marks of the Business set forth on _Section
5.14(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_; _provided_ , that the Sellers and
TFEM shall be permitted to continue to maintain and use TFEMs existing name
in the ordinary course pending the completion of the formal dissolution of
TFEM and until such time as TFEM has been dissolved under applicable Law and
shall no longer require the use of its name, which dissolution the Sellers
will use their commercially reasonable efforts to effectuate as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the Closing.

 



 

(b) The Transferred Companies may continue temporarily to use the UTC Names
following the Closing so long as Purchaser shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates, including the Transferred Companies, to (i) immediately after the
Closing, cease to hold itself out as having any affiliation with Parent or any
of its Affiliates and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize and
eliminate use of the UTC Names by its Affiliates, including the Transferred
Companies. In any event, as soon as practicable after the Closing Date (and in
any event within ninety (90) days thereafter) Purchaser shall and shall cause
each of its Affiliates (including the Transferred Companies) to (i) cease and
discontinue use of all UTC Names and (ii) complete the removal of the UTC
Names from all products, signage, vehicles, properties, technical information,
stationery and promotional or other marketing materials and other assets.

 



 

5.15 _Non-Solicitation; Non-Compete_.

 



 

(a) For a period of eighteen (18) months from the Closing Date, none of Parent
or its Affiliates, on the one hand, or Purchaser and its Affiliates (including
the Transferred Companies), on the other hand, shall directly or indirectly
solicit for employment (whether as an employee, consultant or otherwise) (A)
in the case of the restrictions applicable to Parent and its Affiliates, the
Managing Director of the Business as of the Closing Date, any Business
Employee who is his direct report as of the Closing Date and any Business
Employee who is a direct report of any of the foregoing as of the Closing
Date, and (B) in the case of the restrictions applicable to Purchaser and its
Affiliates, any employee of Parent or its Affiliates who is classified by
Parent or its Affiliates as an E5, E4 or E3 executive as of the Closing Date;
_provided_ , that no party shall be precluded from soliciting, or taking any
other action with respect to any such Person (a) in the case of the
restrictions applicable to Parent and its Affiliates, who experiences a
Qualifying Termination (as defined in _Section 6.3 of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule_) after the Closing, (b) whose employment is terminated due to such
Persons voluntary resignation (other than, in the case of the restrictions
applicable to Parent and its Affiliates, a voluntary resignation that
constitutes a Qualifying Termination) more than three (3) months prior to the
commencement of solicitation or other employment discussions between such
Person and Parent and its Affiliates

 



      
 

 



 

or Purchaser and its Affiliates, as applicable, (c) who responds to general or
public solicitation not specifically targeted at employees of the other party
by or at the direction of Parent and its Affiliates or Purchaser and its
Affiliates as applicable (including by a bona fide search firm that is not
directed to solicit employees of the other party), or (d) who initiates
discussions regarding such employment without any solicitation by such party
in violation of this _Section 5.15_.

 



 

(b) For a period of two (2) years from the Closing Date, without the prior
written consent of Purchaser, Parent and its Affiliates agree not to, anywhere
in the world, directly or indirectly, either for themselves or any other
Person, engage in, own, operate, manage, control or invest in the business of
designing, manufacturing and selling the following equipment: two sided
cooking grills, continuous dispensing batch freezers for shakes, soft serve
and frozen yogurt, specialty blenders, frozen beverage dispensers, and
smoothie mixers and related parts and services (such business, a " _Competing
Business_ "); _provided_ , that nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit
Parent or its Affiliates at any time from:

 



 

(i) owning fifteen percent (15%) or less of the outstanding stock or other
securities of any Person;

 



 

(ii) acquiring and, after such acquisition, owning an interest in any Person
(or its successor) that is engaged in a Competing Business and operating such
Competing Business if such Competing Business generated less than twenty
percent (20%) of such Persons consolidated annual revenues in the last
completed fiscal year of such Person;

 



 

(iii) acquiring and, after such acquisition, owning an interest in any Person
(or its successor) that is engaged in a Competing Business and operating such
Competing Business if (A) such Competing Business generated twenty percent
(20%) or more of such Persons consolidated annual revenues in the last
completed fiscal year of such Person and (B) Parent or its applicable
Affiliate, within twelve (12) months after the consummation of such
acquisition, enters into a definitive agreement to cause the divestiture of a
sufficient portion of the Competing Business of such Person such that the
restrictions set forth in this _Section 5.15(b)_ would not have operated to
restrict such ownership assuming the completion of such divestiture had
occurred prior to such acquisition, and thereafter uses commercially
reasonable efforts to complete such divestiture as soon as reasonably
practicable;

 



 

(iv) exercising its rights or complying with its obligations under this
Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements; or

 



 

(v) providing or engaging in businesses, activities, services, products or
systems of a nature provided by the Sellers (or any of their Affiliates) apart
from the Business as of the date of this Agreement or the Closing Date and
reasonable extensions thereof.

 



      
 

 



 

The parties understand and acknowledge that immaterial, occasional, non-
recurring, de minimis or inadvertent violations of this _Section 5.15(b)_ by
Parent shall not be deemed a breach of this _Section 5.15(b)_. For the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section 5.15_ shall prohibit any
activities, actions or conduct of any Person that is not directly or
indirectly controlled by Parent or any of Parents Affiliates, including any
joint ventures, partnerships or co-investment vehicles that neither Parent nor
any of its Affiliates controls.

 



 

(c) The parties recognize that the territorial, time and scope limitations set
forth in this _Section 5.15_ are reasonable and are properly required for the
protection of the parties legitimate interests in client and employee
relationships, goodwill and trade secrets, and in the event that any such
territorial, time or scope limitation is deemed to be unreasonable by a court
of competent jurisdiction, the Purchaser and each Seller agree to submit to
the reduction of any or all of such territorial, time or scope limitations to
such an area, period or scope as such court shall deem reasonable under the
circumstances, and, in its reduced form, such provision shall then be
enforceable and shall be enforced.

 



 

5.16 _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, and cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably
necessary or advisable so that on the Closing Date Purchaser and the Purchaser
Designees will have cash in an amount equal to the Specified Amount and are
able to fund the full payment thereof on the Closing Date.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Purchaser
expressly acknowledges and agrees that the availability of the Purchaser
Credit Facility or any alternate financing is not a condition to the
obligations of Purchaser to consummate the Sale or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and Purchaser reaffirms its obligation to
consummate the Sale and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
subject only to the express conditions set forth in _Article VIII_,
irrespective and independent of the availability or terms of the financing or
any alternate financing, Purchasers use of efforts in accordance with this
_Section 5.16_, or otherwise.

 



 

5.17 _Pre-Closing Restructuring_. Prior to the Closing, Sellers will cause the
Transferred Companies to complete the transactions described on _Section 5.17
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_ (the " _Pre-Closing Restructuring_ ").

 



 

5.18 _Additional Business Financial Statements_.

 



 

(a) Promptly following the date hereof, the Sellers and the Purchaser shall
take any actions reasonably necessary to engage PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP in
connection with the preparation of (i) audited combined financial statements
of the Business, consisting of the combined balance sheet as of December 31,
2017, and the related combined statement of operations, comprehensive income,
cash flows and changes in net investment for the twelve-month period then
ended, accompanied by a written audit report from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
on such financial statements and (ii) an unaudited interim balance sheet as of

Statements_ "). Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
request that, to the extent required, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP issue a
consent to enable Purchaser to include the Additional Financial Statements
described in clause (i) above in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed by
Purchaser with respect to this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. Any and all of the fees and out-of-pocket
expenses of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP that are incurred by Sellers or any of
their Affiliates in connection with the engagement of PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP as described in this _Section 5.18(a)_, shall be reimbursed by Purchaser
promptly (and in any event within ten (10) business days) in immediately
available funds after receipt from Sellers of one or more invoices with
respect thereto delivered from time to time after the date hereof. For the
avoidance of doubt, the delivery of Additional Financial Statements on or
prior to the Closing Date shall not be taken into account with respect to
whether any condition to the Closing set forth in _Article VIII_ shall have
been satisfied.

 



 

(b) From and after the Closing Date and continuing through the first (1st)
anniversary of the Closing Date, upon reasonable request from Purchaser,
Sellers shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to provide Purchaser
with access to all financial and other information pertaining to the Business
relating to the period of Parents and Sellers ownership and operation of the
Business and the Transferred Companies, which information is necessary to
enable Purchaser to comply with its reporting obligations under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Securities Act, and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder; _provided_ , that all reasonable out-of-
pocket costs and expenses incurred by Sellers or their Affiliates or
representatives in connection therewith shall be promptly reimbursed by
Purchaser; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Sellers shall not be required
to provide any information pursuant to this _Section 5.18(b)_ (i) in
connection with any litigation or similar dispute between the parties hereto
or (ii) where, upon the advice of counsel, such access or disclosure would
jeopardize the attorney-client or other applicable legal privilege or
protection of such party or contravene any Laws, contracts or obligation of
confidentiality owed to a third party.

 



 

5.19 _Further Assurances_. From and after the Closing, Purchaser and Sellers
shall, and shall cause their Affiliates, as applicable, to, provide all
cooperation reasonably requested by the other parties in order to effectuate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements
and to establish, perfect, defend, or enforce its rights in or to the
Transferred Companies by executing further consistent assignments, transfers
and releases, and causing its representatives to provide good faith testimony
by affidavit, declaration, and in person. Purchaser and Sellers will reimburse
each other for any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such Person
in causing such Persons representatives to provide the cooperation described
in the prior sentence.

 



 

5.20 _Purchaser Obligations_. Middleby shall cause Purchaser and each of its
applicable Affiliates party to any Ancillary Agreements to perform (and shall
ensure the performance of) all of its and their covenants, agreements and
obligations under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and shall be
jointly liable for the same.

Ancillary Agreements and shall be jointly liable for the same.

 



 

5.22 _Bulk Sales Laws_. The parties hereto waive compliance with the provision
of any bulk sales law applicable to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and any Ancillary Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the Sellers shall jointly and severally indemnify

ARTICLE VI

 



 

EMPLOYEE MATTERS COVENANTS

 



 

6.1 _Treatment of Business Employees_.

 



 

(a) Effective as of immediately prior to the Closing, Sellers shall (or shall
cause its applicable Affiliates, including any Sellers, to) transfer the
employment of each (i) Business Employee, as determined by Parent in good
faith, who is employed by a member of the Parent Group from such member to a
Transferred Company designated by Parent and (ii) employee who is not
primarily engaged in rendering services in respect of the Business, as
determined by Parent in good faith, and who is employed by a Transferred
Company from such Transferred Company to a member of the Parent Group
designated by Parent; _provided_ , that to the extent that Parent determines
in good faith and in consultation with Purchaser that the employment of a
Business Employee described in clause (i) cannot be transferred to a
Transferred Company prior to the Closing because of restrictions imposed by
applicable Law or, with respect to each of the Business Employees associated
with the SCT Business Assets who are identified on _Section 6.1(a) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule_ (the " _SCT Business Employees_ "), in the event
that the transfer of the SCT Business Assets and the SCT Business Liabilities
pursuant to the Chinese Asset Purchase Agreement does not become effective at
the Closing, then, subject to any applicable terms and conditions as are
specified in any Ancillary Agreement, (A) prior to the Closing (or prior to
such later date as provided below) Purchaser or one of its Affiliates shall
make a written offer of employment to such Business Employee on terms
consistent with those applicable to Business Employees generally under this
_Article VI_, which offer shall be effective at the Closing or such later
date as is agreed between Parent and Purchaser and specified therein (and,
with respect to each of the SCT Business Employees, the effective date of such
offer shall be the date that the transfer of the SCT Business Assets and the
SCT Business Liabilities pursuant to the Chinese Asset Purchase Agreement
becomes effective), and (B) Sellers and Purchaser shall use their reasonable
best efforts, and shall otherwise cooperate, to cause such Business Employee
to accept such offers of employment from and become employed by Purchaser or
its applicable Affiliate at the Closing or such later date as is specified
under the terms of the applicable employment offer pursuant to clause (A).

 



 

(b) For the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the first
anniversary of the Closing Date (such period, the " _Continuation Period_ "),
Purchaser shall, or

 



       
 

 



 

shall cause its Affiliates (including the Transferred Companies) to provide
the Business Employees who continue to be employed with the Purchaser or its
Affiliates after the Closing Date (each, a " _Transferred Employee_ ") with
(i) not less than the same base salary or wage rate as was in effect for the
Transferred Employee immediately prior to the Closing as disclosed to
Purchaser and (ii) employee benefits, equity and non-equity incentive
compensation and fringe benefits that are of substantially comparable value,
in the aggregate, as those in effect with respect to the Business Employees
immediately prior to the Closing. As of the date hereof, Business Employees
who are participants in Parent Groups Employee Scholar Program shall be
eligible to complete their then current semester and one additional semester
pursuant to such program, and Parent shall otherwise cause the Employee
Scholar Program to be closed for new participation by Business Employees.
Parent shall be fully responsible for administering the Employee Scholar
Program and retain the Liability for tuition and other costs of the program in
respect of such Business Employees; _provided_ that Purchaser will reimburse
Parent for fifty percent (50%) of the tuition and other costs relating to the
Business Employees under the Employee Scholar Program, but in no event to
exceed $150,000, pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement. Nothing
contained herein shall be construed to prohibit Purchaser from terminating the
employment of any Business Employee following the Closing Date, subject to
Purchasers obligations under _Section 6.3_.

 



 

(c) As of and after the Closing, Purchaser shall, or shall cause the
applicable Transferred Company to give each Transferred Employee full credit
for (i) all purposes under any Transferred Company Benefit Plans, and (ii)
purposes of eligibility and vesting (and, with respect to vacation and paid
time off policies and severance benefits, benefit accrual) under each other
employee benefit plan, policy or arrangement, and any other service-based or
seniority-based entitlement, in each case maintained or made available for the
benefit of Transferred Employees as of and after the Closing by Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates (the " _Purchaser Plans_ "), for such Transferred
Employees service prior to the Closing with a Seller and its applicable
Affiliates (including the Transferred Companies) and their respective
predecessors, to the same extent such service is recognized by a Seller and
its applicable Affiliates (including the Transferred Companies) immediately
prior to the Closing; _provided_ , that Purchaser shall also provide prior
service credit to the Transferred Employees under applicable Purchaser Plans
for benefit accrual purposes to the same extent that similarly situated
employees of Purchaser are credited with prior service under such Purchaser
Plans; and _provided further_ that such credit shall not be given (i) to the
extent that it would result in a duplication of benefits for the same period
of service, (ii) with respect to any final average pay defined benefit
retirement plan or retiree welfare benefit plan, or (iii) with respect to any
plan (A) under which similarly situated employees of Purchaser and its
Subsidiaries do not receive credit for prior service or (B) that is
grandfathered or frozen, either with respect to level of benefits or
participation.

 



 

6.2 _Health Coverages_. Purchaser shall cause each Transferred Employee (and
his or her eligible dependents) to be covered by a group health plan or plans
that do not limit or exclude coverage on the basis of any pre-existing
condition of such Transferred Employee or dependent (other than any limitation
already in effect under the corresponding group health Seller Benefit Plan or
Transferred Company Benefit Plan) or on the basis of any other exclusion or
waiting period not in effect under the applicable group health Seller Benefit
Plan or Transferred Company Benefit Plan, and to the extent that such plans
are Purchaser group health plans in which such Transferred Employee becomes
eligible to participate for the first time following the

 



      
 

 



 

Closing, provide such Transferred Employee full credit, for the first year of
eligibility, for any deductible, co-payment or out-of-pocket expenses already
incurred by the Transferred Employee under the applicable group health Seller
Benefit Plan or Transferred Company Benefit Plan during such year for purposes
of any deductible, co-payment or maximum out-of-pocket expense provisions, as
applicable, of such Purchaser group health plans.

 



 

6.3 _Severance_. With respect to each Transferred Employee who, during the
Continuation Period, experiences a Qualifying Termination (as defined in
_Section 6.3 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_), Purchaser shall provide
severance pay and benefits that are no less favorable than the severance pay
and benefits described in _Section 6.3 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_,
taking into account the Transferred Employees period of employment with
Parent and its Affiliates (including any Transferred Company) and their
predecessors prior to the Closing and with Purchaser and its Affiliates on and
after the Closing.

 



 

6.4 _WARN and Corresponding State Laws_. Seller shall be solely responsible
for and agrees to indemnify, hold harmless and, at the option of the
Purchaser, to defend Purchaser from and against any Liabilities under WARN or
any similar state Law, with respect to any U.S. Business Employee who is found
to have suffered an "employment loss" under WARN before the Closing Date as a
result of Sellers actions, and any and all other Liabilities arising out of
or resulting from Sellers actions or Sellers failure to serve sufficient
notice pursuant to WARN or any similar state Law. Purchaser shall be solely
responsible for and agrees to indemnify, hold harmless and, at the option of
the Sellers, to defend the Parent Group from and against any Liabilities under
WARN or any similar state Law, with respect to any U.S. Business Employee who
is found to have suffered an "employment loss" under WARN on or after the
Closing Date as a result of Purchasers actions, and any and all other
Liabilities arising out of or resulting from Purchasers actions or
Purchasers failure to serve sufficient notice pursuant to WARN or any similar
state Law; _provided_ , that no later than 15 days prior to the Closing Date,
Sellers have provided Purchaser with a true and accurate schedule indicating
the name and site of employment of any former Business Employees who have had
their employment terminated or have been notified of an "employment loss"
under WARN during the preceding 90-day period at each facility, site of
employment and operating unit of the Sellers, which schedule has been updated
by Sellers as of the Closing Date.

 



 

6.5 _Accrued Vacation, Sick Leave and Personal Time_. Purchaser will recognize
and assume the Liability with respect to accrued but unused vacation time for
all Business Employees in which such recognition is permitted by applicable
Law. In each jurisdiction where payment of the value of accrued but unused
vacation time to Business Employees in connection with the Closing is required
by applicable Law, Parent will pay, or cause to be paid, all accrued but
unused vacation time to Business Employees as soon as reasonably practicable
after the Closing Date.

 



 

6.6 _LTD Employees_. Each LTD Employee shall remain an employee of, or have
his or her employment transferred prior to the Closing to, a member of the
Parent Group, and shall continue to participate in Parent Groups long-term
disability plan following the Closing Date in accordance with the terms of
that plan, as in effect from time to time. Subject to Parent notifying
Purchaser of an LTD Employees return to active employment within ten (10)
Business Days of such return, Purchaser or one of its Affiliates shall make an
offer of employment to such LTD

 



      
 

 



 

Employee on terms consistent with those applicable to Business Employees
generally under this _Article VI_, _provided_ that the LTD Employee returned
to active employment with the Parent Group on or prior to the expiration date
of such LTD Employees eligibility for disability benefits or approved leave
period and within one (1) year following the Closing Date (or such longer
period required by applicable Law). From and after such LTD Employees
commencement of employment with Purchaser or one of its Affiliates, such LTD
Employee shall be considered a "Business Employee" for all purposes under this
Agreement.

 



 

6.7 _Cash Incentive Compensation_. Parent shall retain all Liability for any
sales commissions payable under any Seller Benefit Plan in respect of the
portion of the calendar year in which the Closing occurs ending on the date
prior to the Closing Date to Business Employees in connection with their
services to the Business. Prior to the Closing, Parent shall pay, or cause to
be paid, to each annual bonus-eligible Business Employee a cash payment equal
to the product of (a) his or her target annual cash incentive award under the
applicable Seller Benefit Plan, multiplied by (b) a fraction, the numerator of
which is the total number of days between January 1 of the calendar year in
which the Closing occurs and the Closing Date and the denominator of which is
365. Purchaser shall not have any Liability for cash incentive compensation
payable to the Business Employees in respect of the portion of the calendar
year in which the Closing occurs ending on the day prior to the Closing Date.
Purchaser shall provide the bonus eligible Transferred Employees with the
opportunity to earn cash incentive compensation for the portion of the
calendar year in which the Closing occurs commencing on the Closing Date,
which cash incentives shall be governed by plans, programs or arrangements
maintained by Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the Transferred
Companies) in their discretion, subject to Purchasers obligations under
_Section 6.1(a)_.

 



 

6.8 _Retention Bonuses_. Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, all amounts
(the " _Parent Bonus Payments_ ") due under the retention agreements listed
under the heading "U.S. Seller Benefit Plans" in _Section 3.10(a)(i) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule_ in accordance with the terms of such agreements.

 



 

6.9 _Seller Benefit Plans; Transferred Company Benefit Plans_. Except as
otherwise expressly provided in this _Article VI_, Purchaser shall not assume
any obligations under or Liabilities with respect to, or receive any right or
interest in any trusts relating to, any assets of or any insurance,
administration or other contracts, or related obligations pertaining to, any
Seller Benefit Plan. For the avoidance of doubt, as of the Closing, the
Purchaser and its Affiliates shall assume, or shall cause the Transferred
Companies and their respective Subsidiaries to continue, as the case may be,
sponsorship of, and all Liabilities and other obligations with respect to, the
Transferred Company Benefit Plans. Parent and Sellers shall take all actions
necessary to cause any employee who is not a Business Employee to cease to
participate in the Transferred Company Benefit Plans immediately prior to the
Closing Date. As of the Closing Date, all Transferred Company Benefit Plans
shall solely cover U.S. or International Business Employees.

 



 

6.10 _Treatment of International Business Employees._ The following terms and
conditions shall, in addition to the other applicable terms and conditions of
this _Article VI_, apply to International Business Employees:

 



 

(a) _Terms and Conditions of Employment_. In the case of International

 



      
 

 



 

Business Employees, Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the Transferred
Companies) shall, in addition to meeting the applicable requirements of this
_Article VI_, comply with any additional obligations or standards arising
under applicable Laws governing the terms and conditions of their employment
or severance of employment in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or otherwise.

 



 

(b) _Severance Indemnity_. Parent and Purchaser shall cooperate in good faith
to effect the transfer of employment of each International Business Employee
to Purchaser or an Affiliate thereof in a manner that avoids or minimizes the
incurrence of any severance obligations. However, in the event that either (i)
an International Business Employee does not, for any reason, continue
employment with Purchaser or one of its Affiliates (including a Transferred
Company) at or after the Closing or (ii) the Sale or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or any action taken in order to effectuate the
Sale or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, results in an
International Business Employee being deemed to have incurred a termination of
employment despite such International Business Employees continued employment
with Purchaser or one of its Affiliates (including a Transferred Company) at
or after the Closing, which, in either case, results in any obligation,
contingent or otherwise, of Parent, Purchaser or any of their respective
Affiliates to pay any severance or other benefits (including such benefits
required under applicable Law) to any International Business Employee or any
additional Liability incurred by Parent, Purchaser or any of their respective
Affiliates in connection therewith, Parent and Purchaser shall each bear fifty
percent (50%) of the costs of such obligation or additional Liability and the
parties shall reimburse each other as necessary in order to effect such
allocation of cost; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Purchaser
incur severance costs in excess of $250,000 in the aggregate in connection
with the International Business Employees.

 



 

6.11 _No Amendments; No Employments Rights, Third Party Beneficiaries_.
Without limiting the generality of _Section 11.5_, nothing in this Agreement
is intended to or shall (a) be treated as an amendment to, or be construed as
amending, any Seller Benefit Plan, Transferred Company Benefit Plan or other
benefit plan, program or agreement sponsored, maintained or contributed to by
any Seller, any Transferred Company, the Purchaser or any of their respective
Affiliates, (b) prevent Purchaser or its Affiliates from terminating any
Transferred Company Benefit Plan or any other benefit plan in accordance with
its terms, (c) prevent Purchaser or its Affiliates, after the Closing Date,
from terminating the employment of any Business Employee or (d) confer any
rights or remedies (including third-party beneficiary rights) on any current
or former director, employee, consultant or independent contractor of any
Seller, any Transferred Company, Purchaser or any of their respective
Affiliates or any beneficiary or dependent thereof or any other Person.

(a) Parent and Purchaser shall (or shall cause their relevant Affiliates to)
jointly make a timely and irrevocable election under Section 338(h)(10) of the
Code (and any

 



      
 

 



 

corresponding elections under any applicable state or local Tax Law) with
respect to the acquisition of the Section 338(h)(10) Subsidiaries pursuant to
this Agreement (collectively, the " _Section 338(h)(10) Elections_").

 



 

(b) Parent and Purchaser shall (and shall cause their relevant Affiliates to)
cooperate in the preparation of all forms, attachments and schedules necessary

8883 and any similar forms under applicable state and local income Tax Laws
(collectively, the " _Section 338(h)(10) Forms_") in a manner consistent with
the Purchase Price Allocation. Parent and Purchaser shall (or shall cause
their relevant Affiliates to) timely file such Section 338(h)(10) Forms with
the applicable taxing authorities. Parent and Purchaser agree that none of
them shall, or shall permit any of their Affiliates to, revoke the Section
338(h)(10) Elections following the filing of the Section 338(h)(10) Forms
without the prior written consent of Parent or Purchaser, as the case may be.

 



 

(c) At Closing, Parent and Purchaser shall each deliver to the other party one
or more duly executed IRS Forms 8023 that reflect the Section 338(h)(10)
Elections (and any analogous forms required to effectuate the Section
338(h)(10) Elections for state or local Tax purposes), each in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to such other party.

 



 

(d) Purchaser shall make (and shall cause its relevant Affiliates to make) an

allocate the Purchase Price (as finally determined hereunder) and any other
amounts treated as consideration for such tax purposes, among the assets and
shares sold in accordance with _Schedule IV_ hereto (the " _Purchase Price
Allocation_ "). The Purchase Price Allocation shall be adjusted, as necessary,
to reflect any subsequent adjustments to the Purchase Price pursuant to
_Section 7.10_. Any such adjustment shall be allocated to the asset, assets,
share or shares (if any) to which such adjustment is attributable; _provided_
, that to the extent there are no such assets or shares, such adjustment shall
be allocated _pro rata_ among the assets and shares sold.

 



 

(f) Parent and Purchaser shall (and shall cause their Affiliates to) (i)
prepare and file all federal, state, local and foreign Tax Returns (including
the Section 338(h)(10) Forms and IRS Form 8594), in a manner consistent with
the Section 338(h)(10) Elections, Section 338(g) Elections, and the Purchase
Price Allocation and (ii) not take any position inconsistent therewith on any
Tax Return, in connection with any Tax Proceeding or otherwise, in each case,
except to the extent otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within
the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code (or any similar provision of
applicable state, local or foreign Law) or applicable non-U.S. Law.

 



 

7.2 _Tax Indemnification by the Sellers_. Effective as of and after the
Closing Date, the Sellers shall pay or cause to be paid, and shall, jointly
and severally, indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Parties and hold each
Purchaser Indemnified Party harmless from and against, without duplication (a)
any Taxes imposed on the Transferred Companies or with respect to any

 



      
 

 



 

SCT Business Assets for any Pre-Closing Period; (b) any Taxes of any other
Person (other than a Transferred Company) for which a Transferred Company is
liable under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or under any similar
provision of state, local or foreign Law) as a result of such Transferred
Company having been a member of an affiliated, consolidated, unitary or
combined group prior to the Closing; (c) any Taxes of any other Person (other
than a Transferred Company) for which a Transferred Company is liable as a
transferee or successor as a result of a transaction that occurred prior to
Closing; (d) any Taxes arising out of any breach of any representation or
warranty contained in _Section 3.13(g)_, _(k)_ , _(l)_ , _(m)_ or _(p)_
(disregarding for these purposes any qualification or exception for, or
reference to, materiality set forth therein); (e) any Taxes arising out of or
relating to any breach of any covenant or agreement of Parent or the Sellers
contained in this Agreement; (f) any withholding Taxes imposed on any payment

2.7_; (g) any Transfer Taxes for which the Sellers are responsible under
_Section 7.12_ of this Agreement; (h) any Taxes that are Excluded
Liabilities; (i) any Taxes imposed in connection with the Pre-Closing
Restructuring; (j) any Taxes imposed on any gain recognized by a Transferred
Company as a result of the Section 338(h)(10) Elections or the Section 338(g)

accounting fees and expenses attributable to any item described in the
foregoing clauses (a) through (j); provided, that the Sellers shall not be
required to pay or cause to be paid, or to indemnify or hold harmless the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties from and against (x) any Taxes to the extent
such Taxes were reflected as a reserve or liability in Working Capital or Net
Indebtedness on the Final Closing Statement or (y) any Taxes for which
Purchaser is responsible pursuant to _Section 7.3(b)_ or _(c)_.

 



 

7.3 _Tax Indemnification by Purchaser_. Effective as of and after the Closing
Date, Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid, and shall indemnify the Seller
Indemnified Parties and hold each Seller Indemnified Party harmless from and
against, without duplication (a) any Taxes imposed on the Transferred
Companies or with respect to any SCT Business Asset for any Post-Closing
Period, except to the extent such Taxes are subject to indemnification by the
Sellers pursuant to _Section 7.2(d)_ or ( _e)_ ; (b) any Taxes arising from
any action or transaction taken or entered into by Purchaser, any of its
Affiliates or the Transferred Companies outside of the ordinary course of
business on the Closing Date after the Closing (for the avoidance of doubt,
except for Taxes, if any, imposed on the Transferred Companies for any Pre-
Closing Period as a result of the Section 338(h)(10) Elections or the Section
338(g) Elections, which are covered by _Section 7.2_ above); (c) any Taxes
arising out of or relating to any breach of any covenant or agreement of
Purchaser contained in this Agreement; (d) any Transfer Taxes for which the
Purchaser is responsible under _Section 7.12_ of this Agreement; and (e) any
costs and expenses, including reasonable legal and accounting fees and
expenses attributable to any item described in the foregoing clauses (a)
through (d).

 



 

7.4 _Straddle Periods_. To the extent permitted or required by applicable Law,
the taxable year of each of the Transferred Companies that includes the
Closing Date shall be treated as closing on (and including) the Closing Date.
To the extent not permitted or required by applicable Law, for purposes of
this Agreement, in the case of any Straddle Period, (a) Property Taxes of the
Transferred Companies or imposed on the SCT Business Assets allocable to the
Pre-Closing Period shall be equal to the amount of such Property Taxes for the
entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of calendar days during the Straddle Period that are in the Pre-Closing
Period and the denominator of which is the number of

 



      
 

 



 

calendar days in the entire Straddle Period, and (b) Taxes (other than
Property Taxes) of the Transferred Companies allocable to the Pre-Closing
Period shall be computed as if such taxable period ended as of the end of the
day on the Closing Date and in a manner consistent with past practices of the
Transferred Companies (or of Parent with respect to the Transferred
Companies); _provided_ , that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are
calculated on an annual basis (including depreciation and amortization
deductions) shall be allocated between the period ending on the Closing Date
and the period beginning after the Closing Date in proportion to the number of
days in each period.

 



 

7.5 _Tax Returns_.

 



 

(a) Parent shall prepare or shall cause to be prepared (i) any combined,
consolidated or unitary Tax Return that includes any member of the Parent
Group, on the one hand, and any of the Transferred Companies, on the other
hand (a " _Combined Tax Return_ "), and (ii) any Tax Return (other than any
Combined Tax Return) that is required to be filed by or with respect to any of
the Transferred Companies for any taxable period that ends on or before the
Closing Date (a " _Pre-Closing Separate Tax Return_ "). Parent shall prepare,
or cause to be prepared, all Pre-Closing Separate Tax Returns in a manner
consistent with past practices of the Transferred Companies (or of the Parent
Group with respect to the Transferred Companies), except (i) as otherwise
required by Law or (ii) as otherwise requested by Purchaser if, with respect
to clause (ii), Parent, in its sole discretion, determines that such request
is not reasonably likely to have an adverse impact on any member of the Parent
Group. Parent shall timely file or cause to be timely filed any Combined Tax
Return and any Pre-Closing Separate Tax Return that is required to be filed on
or before the Closing Date (taking into account any extensions). Parent shall
deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Purchaser for its review and comment a
draft copy of all Pre-Closing Separate Tax Returns that are required to be
filed after the Closing Date at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date
thereof (taking into account any extensions). Purchaser shall provide
comments, if any, to Parent on any such Pre-Closing Separate Tax Return within
ten (10) days after receipt of such draft Pre-Closing Separate Tax Return and
Parent shall consider any such comments in good faith. Parent shall revise
such Pre-Closing Separate Tax Returns to reflect any reasonable comments
received from Purchaser with which Parent agrees and shall deliver, if
applicable, a revised Pre-Closing Separate Tax Return to Purchaser not later
than ten (10) days before the due date therefor (taking into account any
extensions), and Purchaser shall timely file or cause to be timely filed such
Tax Returns; _provided_ , that Purchaser shall not be required to file or
cause to be filed any such Tax Return that reflects a material position for
which the confidence level is less than "more likely than not" (or an
equivalent standard under an applicable foreign Law). Parent shall pay, or
cause to be paid, to the Purchaser an amount equal to the amount of any Taxes
shown to be due on any Pre-Closing Separate Tax Return required to be filed
after the Closing Date (taking into account extensions) for which Sellers are
responsible pursuant to this Agreement within ten (10) days after Purchaser
makes, or causes to be made, written demand therefor, but in all cases at
least five (5) days prior to the date on which the relevant Taxes are required
to be paid to the applicable taxing authority. Such payment shall be made in
immediately available funds by wire transfer to an account designated in
writing by Purchaser to Parent. Except to the extent otherwise required
pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the
Code (or any similar provision of state, local, or foreign Law), Purchaser
shall not amend or revoke any Combined Tax Return or any Pre-Closing Separate
Tax Returns (or any notification or election relating thereto) without

 



      
 

 



 

the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). At Parents reasonable request, Purchaser
shall file, or cause to be filed, amended Pre-Closing Separate Tax Returns;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser shall have the same rights to review
and comment on such amended Pre-Closing Separate Tax Returns as described in
this paragraph for the original Pre-Closing Separate Tax Returns and shall not
be required to file or cause to be filed any such amended Pre-Closing Separate
Tax Return that reflects a material position for which the confidence level is
less than "more likely than not" (or an equivalent standard under an
applicable foreign Law), and _provided_ , _further_ , that Parent shall pay,
or cause to be paid, to the Purchaser an amount equal to the amount of any
Taxes shown to be due on any such amended Pre-Closing Separate Tax Return for
which Sellers are responsible pursuant to this Agreement within ten (10) days
after Purchaser makes, or causes to be made, written demand therefor, but in
all cases at least five (5) days prior to the date on which the relevant Taxes
are required to be paid to the applicable taxing authority. Such payment shall
be made in immediately available funds by wire transfer to an account
designated in writing by Purchaser to Parent. Purchaser shall promptly provide
(or cause to be provided) to Parent any information reasonably requested by
Parent to facilitate the preparation and filing of any Tax Returns described
in this _Section 7.5(a)_ and Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to prepare (or cause to be prepared) such information in a manner and
on a timeline requested by Parent, which information and timeline shall be
consistent with the past practice of the Transferred Companies, as applicable.

 



 

(b) Except for any Tax Return required to be prepared by Parent pursuant to
_Section 7.5(a)_, Purchaser shall prepare and timely file or cause to be
prepared and timely filed all Tax Returns with respect to the Transferred
Companies. In the case of any such Tax Return for a Straddle Period (a "
_Straddle Period Separate Tax Return_ "), Purchaser shall prepare or cause to
be prepared such Tax Return in a manner consistent with past practices of the
Transferred Companies (or of Parent with respect to the Transferred
Companies), except to the extent that (i) Purchaser notifies Parent in writing
that it desires to prepare such Tax Return in a different manner and Parent,
in its sole discretion, determines that such request is not reasonably likely
to have an adverse impact on any member of the Parent Group and so notifies
Purchaser in writing, or (ii) such Tax Return would reflect a material
position for which the confidence level is less than "more likely than not"
(or an equivalent standard under an applicable foreign Law). Purchaser shall
deliver to Parent for its review and comment a draft copy of such Straddle
Period Separate Tax Returns at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date
therefor (taking into account any extensions). Parent shall provide comments,
if any, to Purchaser on any such Straddle Period Separate Tax Return within
fifteen (15) days after receipt of such draft Straddle Period Separate Tax
Return. In the event Purchaser disagrees with any comments received from
Parent, Purchaser shall promptly notify Parent of such disagreement and Parent
and Purchaser shall cooperate in good faith to resolve any such disagreement
prior to the due date for such Straddle Period Separate Tax Return (taking
into account extensions). If Parent and Purchaser are unable to reach
resolution, they shall promptly cause the Independent Accounting Firm to
resolve any remaining disputes. Any determination of the Independent
Accounting Firm shall be consistent with the terms of this Agreement and shall
be final and binding on all parties. All fees and expenses relating to the
work, if any, to be performed by the Independent Accounting Firm in connection
with this _Section 7.5(b)_ shall be borne equally by the Sellers on the one
hand, and Purchaser on the other hand. Purchaser shall revise each Straddle
Period Separate Tax Return to reflect any comments received from Parent with
which Purchaser agrees, any agreement reached

 



      
 

 



 

between Parent and Purchaser and the resolution of the Independent Accounting
Firm, shall deliver such revised Straddle Period Separate Tax Return to Parent
prior to the due date therefor (taking into account extensions) and shall
timely file or cause to be filed such Tax Return; _provided_ , that in the
event any disagreement with respect to a Straddle Period Separate Tax Return
is not resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm prior to the due date for
such Tax Return (taking into account extensions), Purchaser shall timely file
or cause to be filed such Straddle Period Separate Tax Return as originally
prepared by Purchaser and as revised to reflect any comments received from
Parent with which Purchaser agrees and any agreement reached between Parent
and Purchaser, and shall subsequently amend or cause to be amended such
Straddle Period Separate Tax Return to reflect the resolution of the
Independent Accounting Firm. Except to the extent otherwise required pursuant
to a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code (or any
similar provision of state, local, or foreign Law) or as required pursuant to
the proviso in the immediately preceding sentence, Purchaser shall not amend
or revoke any such Straddle Period Separate Tax Returns (or any notification
or election relating thereto) without the prior written consent of Parent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). At
Parents reasonable request, Purchaser shall file, or cause to be filed,
amended Straddle Period Separate Tax Returns; _provided_ , _however_ , that
any such amended Straddle Period Separate Tax Returns shall be prepared in a
manner consistent with this _Section 7.5(b)_. Parent shall pay, or cause to
be paid, to the Purchaser an amount equal to the amount of any Taxes shown to
be due on a Straddle Period Separate Tax Return (or an amended version) for
which Sellers are responsible pursuant to this Agreement, within ten (10) days
after Purchaser makes, or causes to be made, written demand therefor, but in
all cases at least five (5) days prior to the date on which the relevant Taxes
are required to be paid to the applicable taxing authority.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither Parent
nor the Sellers shall be required to provide any Person with any Tax Return or
copy of any Tax Return (in each case, other than Section 338(h)(10) Forms) of
(i) Parent or, except as set forth in the following proviso, a member of the
Parent Group or (ii) a consolidated, combined, affiliated or unitary group
that includes any member of the Parent Group (including any Combined Tax
Return); provided, however, that Purchaser shall be entitled to receive, upon
reasonable request, any Tax Return and any related Tax workpapers (other than
a Combined Tax Return and any related workpapers) of any Transferred Company.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Purchaser shall
not be required to provide any Person with any Tax Return or copy of any Tax
Return of a consolidated, combined or unitary group that includes the
Purchaser.

 



 

7.6 _Certain Tax Benefits, Refunds, Credits and Carrybacks_.

 



 

(a) The amount of any Loss, Tax or expense for which indemnification is
provided under this _Article VII_ or _Article X_ shall be net of any Tax
Benefit actually realized by the relevant Indemnified Party or any of its
Affiliates in the taxable year in which such Loss, Tax or expense is paid or
accrued, or in the two succeeding tax years. In the event that any such Tax
Benefit is realized after the relevant indemnification payment is made (such
that such indemnification payment was not reduced by the amount of such Tax
Benefit), the Indemnified Party shall pay to the Indemnifying Party the amount
of such Tax Benefit no later than fifteen (15) days after such Tax Benefit is
actually realized. For the avoidance of doubt, the realization

 



      
 

 



 

of any such Tax Benefit by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates
shall in no way limit, diminish or waive any remedy of any Indemnified Party
under this Agreement, subject to the Indemnifying Partys right to receive the
amount of such Tax Benefit pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence if,
when, and to the extent such Tax Benefit is actually realized in accordance
with this _Section 7.6(a)_. In addition, in the event that Parent reasonably
determines that any deduction in respect of any amounts for which Parent is
responsible pursuant to _Section 6.7_ or _Section 6.8_ may not, under
applicable Law, be claimed on a Tax Return for which Parent has filing
responsibility under _Section 7.5(a)_ or on any Tax Return of a member of the
Parent Group, but that such deduction may, under applicable Law, be claimed on
a Tax Return for which Purchaser has filing responsibility under _Section
7.5(b)_ or on any other Tax Return of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates,
Parent shall notify Purchaser of such determination and Purchaser shall claim
(or shall cause such deduction to be claimed) on the relevant Tax Return and
shall pay to Parent the amount of any Tax Benefit actually realized by
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates as a result of such deduction in the tax
year in which the relevant amounts are paid or accrued, or in the two
succeeding tax years. " _Tax Benefit_ " means, for any tax year, the amount by
which the cash Tax Liability of the relevant Person for such tax year is
actually reduced as a result of the relevant Loss, Tax, expense or amount,
calculated by comparing (1) the Taxes payable by such Person in respect of
such tax year without giving effect to any deductions for the payment or
accrual of the Loss, Tax or expense giving rise to the relevant indemnity
payment or the relevant amount for which Parent is responsible pursuant to
_Section 6.7_ or _Section 6.8_, and (2) the Taxes payable by such Person in
respect of such tax year giving effect to such deduction allowed as a result
of such payment or accrual of such Loss, Tax, expense or amount, and net of
any Taxes and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such Indemnified
Party in connection with obtaining, receiving or accruing such reduction in
Tax Liability or the related indemnification payment. For the avoidance of
doubt, net operating losses shall not constitute Tax Benefits actually
realized for purposes of this _Section 7.6(a)_, except to the extent such net
operating losses are attributable to a Loss subject to this _Section 7.6(a)_
and are carried forward and utilized in either of the two tax years
immediately following the tax year in which the relevant Loss, Tax, expense or
amount is paid or accrued, as contemplated by this _Section 7.6(a)_.

 



 

(b) Parent shall be entitled to any refunds or credits of or against any Taxes
for which the Sellers are responsible under _Section 7.2_; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent shall not be entitled to any refunds to the extent
such refunds were reflected as an asset in Working Capital or Net Indebtedness
on the Final Closing Statement. Purchaser or a Purchaser Designee shall be
entitled to any refunds or credits of the Transferred Companies of or against
any Taxes other than refunds or credits to which Parent is entitled pursuant
to the foregoing sentence. Any refunds or credits of Taxes of the Transferred
Companies for any Straddle Period shall be equitably apportioned between
Parent and Purchaser in accordance with the principles set forth in _Section
7.4_ and the first sentence of this _Section 7.6(b)_. Each party shall pay,
or cause its Affiliates to pay, to the party entitled to a refund or credit of
Taxes under this _Section 7.6(b)_, the amount of such refund or credit
(including any interest paid thereon and net of any reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses (including any Taxes) to the party receiving such refund or credit in
respect of the receipt or accrual of such refund or credit) in readily
available funds within fifteen (15) days of the actual receipt of the refund
or credit or the application of such refund or credit against amounts
otherwise payable.

 



       
 

 



 

7.7 _Tax Contests_.

 



 

(a) If any taxing authority asserts a Tax Claim, then the party to this
Agreement first receiving notice of such Tax Claim promptly shall provide
written notice thereof to the other party or parties to this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the failure of such party to give such prompt
notice shall not relieve the other party of any of its obligations under this
_Article VII_, except to the extent that the other party is prejudiced by
such failure (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction). Such notice
shall specify in reasonable detail the basis for such Tax Claim and shall
include a copy of the relevant portion of any correspondence received from the
taxing authority.

 



 

(b) In the case of a Tax Proceeding of or with respect to any of the
Transferred Companies or SCT Business Assets for any taxable period ending on
or before the Closing Date (other than a Tax Proceeding described in _Section
7.7(d)_), Parent shall have the exclusive right to control such Tax
Proceeding; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not settle, compromise
or abandon any such Tax Proceeding without obtaining the prior written consent
of Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed, if such settlement, compromise, or abandonment could have a material
adverse impact on Purchaser or any of its Affiliates for any Post-Closing
Period. If Parent elects not to control the conduct and resolution of any Tax
Proceeding that Parent has the right to control pursuant to this _Section
7.7(b)_, Parent shall notify Purchaser in writing, and Purchaser shall have
the right to control the conduct and resolution of such Tax Proceeding, or
portion thereof, that is not controlled by Parent; _provided_ , that, (x) the
costs and expenses, including reasonable legal and accounting fees, incurred
by Purchaser in controlling such Tax Proceeding, or such portion thereof,
shall be borne by Parent and (y) Purchaser shall not settle, compromise or
abandon any such Tax Proceeding without the prior written consent of Parent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, if
such settlement, compromise, or abandonment could have a material adverse

contained in _Article IV_; (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of
Purchaser contained in this Agreement; (iii) any Liability to the extent
arising out of or relating to the Transferred Companies, the Business
(including the ownership and operation thereof), or the ownership, occupation
or use by the Transferred Companies of the Business Real Property, whether any
such Liability arises before or after Closing, is known or unknown, contingent
or accrued, in

 



       
 

 



 

each case other than to the extent of any Liabilities for which the Sellers
are required to indemnify Purchaser or the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)_; (iv) without duplication of any Liability
described in the foregoing clause (iii), the failure to pay any amounts when
due of any Liability to the extent reflected in or taken into account in the
determination of Working Capital, Net Indebtedness or Transaction Costs on the
Final Closing Statement and (v) any Environmental Liability to the extent
arising out of or relating to any Purchaser Environmental Condition.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary:

 



 

(i) Purchaser shall not be required to indemnify or hold harmless any Seller
Indemnified Party against, or reimburse any Seller Indemnified Party for, any
Losses pursuant to _Section 10.3(a)(i)_, (A) for any claim unless such claim
or series of related claims involve Losses in excess of the De Minimis Amount
and if such Losses do not exceed the De Minimis Amount, such Losses shall not
be applied to or considered for purposes of calculating the aggregate amount
of the Seller Indemnified Parties Losses under _Section 10.3(b)(i)(B)_; or
(B) pursuant to _Section 10.3(a)(i)_, until the aggregate amount of the
Seller Indemnified Parties Losses under _Section 10.3(a)(i)_ exceeds the
Deductible, after which Purchaser shall be obligated only for the Seller
Indemnified Parties Losses under _Section 10.3(a)(i)_ in excess of the
Deductible, subject to _Section 10.3(b)(i)(A)_, _Section 10.3(b)(ii)_ and
_Section 10.3(b)(iii)_; _provided_ , that any claim for indemnification under
_Section 10.3(a)(i)_ resulting from a breach of a Purchaser Fundamental
Representation shall not be subject to the De Minimis Amount or the
Deductible;

 



 

(ii) the cumulative indemnification obligations of Purchaser under _Section
10.3(a)(i)_ shall in no event exceed, in aggregate, the Cap; _provided_ , that
any claim for indemnification under _Section 10.3(a)(i)_ resulting from a
breach of a Purchaser Fundamental Representation shall not be subject to the
Cap; and

 



 

(iii) the cumulative indemnification obligations of Purchaser under _Section
10.3(a)(i)_ and _Section 10.3(a)(ii)_ shall in no event exceed, in aggregate,
the Overall Cap.

 



 

10.4 _Indemnification Procedures_.

 



 

(a) The procedures described in this _Section 10.4_ do not apply to claims
for indemnification made pursuant to _Article VII_, which claims shall be
governed by the procedures set forth in such _Article VII_.

 



 

(b) A Person that may be entitled to be indemnified under this Agreement (the
" _Indemnified Party_ ") shall promptly notify the party or parties liable for
such indemnification

 



      
 

 



 

(the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing of any pending or threatened claim
that has given or could reasonably be expected to give rise to a right of
indemnification under this Agreement (including a pending or threatened claim
asserted by a third party against the Indemnified Party, such claim being a "
_Third Party Claim_ "); _provided_ , that the failure to provide such notice
shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under
this _Article X_ except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually
prejudiced by such failure, it being agreed that any such notice must describe
in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances with respect to the subject
matter of such claim, demand, matter or circumstance, the provisions of this
Agreement pursuant to which indemnification is being or may be sought and an
estimate of the Indemnified Partys Losses, if then known or reasonably
estimable, and must be delivered prior to the expiration of any applicable
survival period specified in _Section 10.1_ for such representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement, as applicable.

 



 

(c) Upon receipt of a notice of a Third Party Claim from an Indemnified Party
pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)_ or _Section 10.3(a)_, the Indemnifying Party
will be entitled, by notice to the Indemnified Party delivered within thirty
(30) days of the receipt of notice of such Third Party Claim (which notice
shall include an acknowledgment by the Indemnifying Party that (based on the
information available to the Indemnifying Party to date), subject to the
limitations set forth in this _Article X_, including _Section 10.2(b)_ or
_Section 10.3(b)_, as applicable) such Third Party Claim is indemnifiable
hereunder), to assume the defense and control of such Third Party Claim,
subject to the terms hereof. If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the
defense and control of any Third Party Claim pursuant to this _Section
10.4(c)_, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to assume and control such
defense, and any costs and expenses associated with such defense (including
reasonable attorneys and accountants fees) shall be indemnifiable Losses
hereunder, but the Indemnifying Party may nonetheless participate in, but not
control, the defense of such Third Party Claim with its own counsel and at its
own expense. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense and control of a
Third Party Claim, it shall be at the Indemnifying Partys sole cost and
expense, and the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to select counsel,
contractors and consultants; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the Indemnified
Party shall be entitled, at the Indemnifying Partys expense, to retain one
firm of separate counsel of its choosing (along with any required local
counsel) if (1) the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party so mutually
agree, (2) the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded, based on the
advice of counsel, that there are legal defenses available to it that are
different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Party or
(3) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties)
include both the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party and representation
of both sets of parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to
actual or potential conflicts of interest between them, and (ii) the
Indemnified Party may otherwise participate in any such proceeding with
counsel of its choice and at its own expense and the Indemnifying Party shall
not be liable for the fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified
Party. The parties shall, and shall cause each of their Affiliates and
representatives to, reasonably cooperate with each other in the defense of any
Third Party Claim, including by furnishing books and records, personnel and
witnesses, as appropriate for any defense of such Third Party Claim, and the
party that is in control of the defense of such claim pursuant to the terms
hereof shall keep the other parties reasonably informed of the progress and
material developments of such defense. If the Indemnifying Party has assumed
the defense and control of a Third Party Claim, it shall be authorized to
consent to a settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any
Third Party Claim, in its sole

 



      
 

 



 

discretion and without the consent of any Indemnified Party; _provided_ , that
such settlement or judgment does not involve any equitable relief or finding
or admission of any violation of Law or admission of any wrongdoing by any
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall pay or cause to be paid all
amounts in such settlement or judgment (other than solely with respect to the
Deductible, the Pre-Closing Environmental Deductible or the amount set forth
in _Section 10.2(b)(i)(D)_, to the extent such liabilities would constitute
Losses to which such limitations would be applicable in accordance with the
applicable provisions of _Section 10.2(b)_ or _Section 10.3(b)_, as
applicable). No Indemnified Party will consent to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any settlement or compromise with respect to a Third Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party.

 



 

(d) If the Indemnified Party receives any payment from an Indemnifying Party
in respect of any Losses pursuant to _Section 10.2_ or _10.3_ and the
Indemnified Party has a basis to seek recovery of all or a part of such Losses
from a third party (a " _Potential Contributor_ ") based on facts, events and
circumstances giving rise to the right of indemnification, the Indemnifying
Party shall be subrogated to the rights of the Indemnified Party against the
Potential Contributor as necessary to permit the Indemnifying Party to recover
from the Potential Contributor the amount of such payment.

 



 

10.5 _Legacy Environmental Liabilities and Certain Pre-Closing Environmental
Liabilities_. The Sellers indemnification obligations pursuant to _Section
10.2(a)(iii)_ in respect of (i) Legacy Environmental Liabilities, or (ii) any
Pre-Closing Environmental Liabilities that arise out of or relate to (A) any
Off-Site Location or (B) any matters not otherwise governed by _Section 10.6_
of this Agreement shall be governed by the provisions set forth in _Sections
10.2_ and _10.4_ of this Agreement and the provisions set forth in this
_Section 10.5_. The Sellers shall have the right to exercise and perform, on
behalf of any Transferred Company, any rights, obligations or actions that
such Transferred Company may have under any Divestiture Agreements, including
any rights of access to any Off-Site Locations for the purpose of performing
Remedial Actions. To the extent required under any Divestiture Agreements, the
Sellers shall be deemed a contractor or representative of the applicable
Transferred Company for the purposes of performing any Remedial Actions or
other obligations with respect to Legacy Environmental Liabilities.

 



 

10.6 _Remedial Actions to Address Business Real Property Pre-Closing
Environmental Liabilities_. The Sellers indemnification obligations under
_Section 10.2(a)(iii)_ with respect to Remedial Actions necessary to address
Pre-Closing Environmental Liabilities relating to any Business Real Property
shall be subject to _Section 10.2_, _Section 10.4_ and the following
provisions of this _Section 10.6_.

 



 

(a) Sellers obligation for indemnity or defense under _Section 10.2(a)_ with
respect to any Losses arising out of or relating to Remedial Actions necessary
to address any Pre-Closing Environmental Liabilities shall be reduced to the
extent any such Losses result from (i) the willful misconduct or negligence of
any Purchaser Group Member; (ii) any change in the use of the Business Real
Property by any Purchaser Group Member or any subsequent owner, tenant or
occupant of the Business Real Property to a use other than a commercial or
industrial use; (iii) any failure by a Purchaser Group Member or subsequent
owner, tenant or occupant of the Business Real Property to comply in any
material respect with Environmental Covenants

 



      
 

 



 

applicable to any Business Real Property imposed under _Section 10.6(d)_; or
(iv) exposure to a Regulated Substance in building materials (including
building improvements, appurtenances, coatings, decorations, fixtures and
equipment) where such exposure results from contact with or a Release of such
Regulated Substance that first occurs after the Closing, unless and to the
extent that such exposure resulted from the failure of such building materials
to be managed, operated and maintained in compliance with applicable
Environmental Laws prior to the Closing.

 



 

(b) With respect to any Remedial Action for which the Sellers are responsible
as a Pre-Closing Environmental Liability, the Sellers shall only be obligated
to perform or provide indemnification for those Remedial Actions that are
required by any Governmental Entity with jurisdiction over such Remedial
Action or required by any applicable Environmental Law. Any Remedial Actions
conducted at the Business Real Property by any Lead Party shall be conducted
in a cost-effective manner using commercially reasonable methods for
investigations, corrective action, remediation and containment to achieve (1)
the least stringent available Applicable Remediation Standards, or (2) such
other Applicable Remediation Standards as agreed to by the parties. Such
Applicable Remediation Standards shall include any (i) cleanup standards for
industrial or commercial areas promulgated pursuant to applicable
Environmental Laws or published by the Governmental Entity having jurisdiction
over such Remedial Action and/or (ii) Governmental Entity-approved site-
specific risk-based cleanup standards, in each case that are consistent with
(A) use of the affected property for industrial and commercial use, and (B)
the use of those institutional and engineering controls as provided under
_Section 10.6(d)_ that will not materially interfere with the continued
operation of the Business and the future use of the Business Real Property for
commercial and industrial uses that are consistent with such uses as of the
Closing.

 



 

(c) The Sellers indemnity shall include the obligation to undertake all
reasonable measures to secure, where available, a no further action letter or
similar document (the " _Closure Document_ ") from any Governmental Entity
with jurisdiction over the Remedial Action confirming that no further Remedial
Action is required, provided that no institutional or engineering controls
shall be included as part of such Closure Document unless such institutional
or engineering controls are consistent with the provisions of _Section
10.6(d)_. If a Closure Document is not available or achievable from any
Governmental Entity for any such Remedial Action, then the Sellers indemnity
obligation shall include securing a certification from a reputable third party
consultant, for reliance by Purchaser and subject to Purchasers reasonable
approval, that all required Remedial Actions have attained Applicable
Remediation Standards consistent with the provisions of _Section 10.6(b)_.

 



 

(d) If such measures would reduce Losses otherwise subject to this _Section
10.6_ the Sellers shall have the right to propose and utilize, and where
Purchaser is the Lead party, Purchaser shall utilize, those institutional
controls (including deed restrictions) and engineering controls that otherwise
meet the requirements of _Section 10.6(b)_ approved by or acceptable to the
applicable Governmental Entities, unless a reasonable business person would
determine that such measures would unreasonably interfere with the continued
operation of the Business or the future use of the Business Real Property for
commercial and industrial uses. Purchaser shall cooperate in executing and
recording any documents that are necessary to establish and implement such
institutional and engineering controls (" _Environmental Covenants_ ").

 



      
 

 



 

(e) If (1) Sellers reasonably believe that the action of a Governmental Entity
in imposing Applicable Remediation Standards or in requiring a particular
Remedial Action is contrary to Law, (2) Sellers determine in their reasonable
business judgment that the most effective approach to fulfill their
indemnification obligations under this _Section 10.6_ is to challenge such
action through appropriate regulatory and/or judicial processes, and (3) such
challenge is not anticipated to, either during its pendency or following its
conclusion, unreasonably impact any of the Transferred Companies or the
Business, or any of their operations, then, subject to the provisos herein,
(i) the Sellers may undertake such challenge, (ii) Sellers shall have the
right to control such legal or regulatory challenge, and shall keep Purchaser
informed of all actions and proceedings related to such matter, and (iii)
Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate with the Sellers with respect to such
challenge; _provided_ that: (x) Sellers obligation to indemnify Purchaser
shall extend to and include any Losses incurred by Purchaser arising from
Sellers decision to exercise such challenge; and (y) Sellers shall confer and
reasonably cooperate with Purchaser during such proceedings to minimize the
potential impact of such challenge upon the relationship between the
applicable Governmental Entity and the Transferred Companies or Business.

 



 

(f) Sellers shall have no obligation to indemnify any Purchaser Group Member
with respect to Remedial Actions arising from Pre-Closing Environmental
Liabilities to the extent such are discovered as the result of any post-
closing sampling or testing by or for a Purchaser Group Member, unless such
sampling or testing is (i) required pursuant to any Environmental Law or by
any Governmental Entity; (ii) undertaken to investigate or address any threat
to human health or the Environment; (iii) consistent with the actions of an
owner or operator of the Business exercising the degree of diligence, prudence
and foresight that would reasonably and ordinarily be expected from a
reasonable and experienced operator engaged in the same type of business (but
acting without the benefit of any contractual indemnifications with respect to
any environmental matters); (iv) conducted as part of due diligence for any
proposed transaction or financing; or (v) conducted in connection with any
construction, renovation or other capital projects undertaken for a bona fide
business purpose.

 



 

(g) If it is determined that an Environmental Liability that requires Remedial
Action is partially the result of Preexisting Environmental Conditions in
combination with Purchaser Environmental Conditions, Sellers indemnification
obligations shall be limited to those Losses attributable to such Preexisting
Environmental Conditions and Purchaser shall be responsible for any Purchaser
Environmental Conditions in accordance with _Section 10.3_.

 



 

(h) If Purchaser undertakes any construction, expansion, demolition or
renovation activities on any of the Business Real Property that are not
required by any applicable Environmental Law or by any Governmental Entity,
Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the
disturbance and the costs associated with management of any Preexisting
Environmental Condition consistent with the actions of an owner or operator of
the Business exercising the degree of diligence, prudence and foresight that
would reasonably and ordinarily be expected from a reasonable and experienced
operator engaged in the same type of business (but acting without the benefit
of any contractual indemnifications with respect to any such environmental
matters).

 



      
 

 



 

(i) The party that has the right to assume control of the Remedial Action to
address a Pre-Closing Environmental Liability as provided in this _Section
10.6(i)_ shall be designated as the " _Lead Party_ " for purposes of such Pre-
Closing Environmental Liability. Sellers, at their option, shall be the Lead
Party for any Remedial Action subject to indemnification for Pre-Closing
Environmental Liabilities, and shall have the right to assume control of,
direct and implement any Remedial Action, defense or other response relating
to any Pre-Closing Environmental Liability (including the resolution or
settlement thereof and all other actions taken in response thereto), subject
to the conditions herein. Within thirty (30) days after receiving notice of a
claim pursuant to _Section 10.4_, Sellers, as appropriate, shall notify
Purchaser of their intent to act as Lead Party, and, if Sellers decline to act
as Lead Party, then Purchaser shall proceed as Lead Party and Sellers shall be
obligated to indemnify for all Remedial Actions for such matter as set forth
in this _Section 10.6_; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in the case of
imminent endangerment to human health or the Environment, Purchaser may
undertake all reasonable and necessary Remedial Actions required by any
Governmental Entity, under Environmental Law or otherwise to respond to the
imminent endangerment pending Sellers notification to Purchaser of their
intention to act as Lead Party. Purchaser shall be the Lead Party and have the
right to assume control of, direct and implement any Remedial Action, defense
or other response relating to an Environmental Condition that is solely a
Purchaser Environmental Condition. If it is determined that an Environmental
Condition is the result of a Purchaser Environmental Condition in combination
with an Environmental Condition qualifying as a Pre-Closing Environmental
Liability, Sellers shall have the right to assume the role of Lead Party or,
if Sellers do not exercise that right, the party with the greater
proportionate responsibility shall be the Lead Party and assume control of,
direct and implement any Remedial Action, defense or other response relating
to such Environmental Condition; provided that if Sellers decline to act as
Lead Party in such circumstances, the Purchaser shall be the Lead Party. The
Lead Party shall promptly commence the Remedial Actions and shall diligently
pursue such Remedial Actions in accordance with this _Section 10.6_.

 



 

(i) The Lead Party shall provide the non-Lead Party for review and comment
drafts of any proposed work plans, reports or other submissions that the Lead
Party intends to deliver or submit to a Governmental Entity prior to said
submission. The non-Lead Party shall have thirty (30) days or such shorter
time as is reasonable under the circumstances to provide comments to the Lead
Party regarding any such draft submissions. Such review shall be at the sole
expense of the non-Lead Party. The Lead Party shall provide good faith
consideration to the non-Lead Partys comments and shall incorporate all such
comments that the Lead Party determines in good faith are reasonable.

 



 

(ii) The Lead Party shall promptly provide copies to the non-Lead Party of all
written notices, final submissions, final work plans and final reports, and
any other documents or communications to or from any Governmental Entity
concerning the Remedial Action.

 



 

(iii) The non-Lead Party may hire its own consultants, attorneys or other
professionals to monitor the Remedial Action, including any

 



      
 

 



 

field work, and the Lead Party shall provide the non-Lead Party with the
results of all such field work. During the performance of the field work, the
Lead Party shall afford the non-Lead Party the opportunity to collect split
samples of any samples collected by the Lead Party or its representatives.

 



 

(iv) The Lead Party shall provide the non-Lead Party with notice of any
meetings with any Governmental Entity concerning the Remedial Action, and, to
the extent permitted under applicable Law, the non-Lead Party shall have the
right to have its representatives or consultants attend such meeting, which
costs related to such attendance at the sole cost of the non-Lead Party.

 



 

(v) If the non-Lead Party is in possession of the site where Remedial Actions
are being implemented, the Lead Party shall, where practicable, provide
reasonable advance notice to and reasonably consult with the non-Lead Party
concerning the scheduling and methods for implementing any Remedial Action,
and shall not unreasonably interfere with the non-Lead Partys business
operations at the site in question.

 



 

(vi) Neither party shall engage in any _ex parte_ communications with any
involved Governmental Entity or other Person regarding any Remedial Action
subject to this _Section 10.7_ being undertaken or any Pre-Closing
Environmental Liability giving rise to such Remedial Action, without notice to
and the opportunity by the other party to participate in such communication;
_provided_ that a party may engage in a communication with an involved
Governmental Entity without notice to the other party if:

 



 

(A) the party is required by Law to make a notification to such Governmental
Entity within a time period that does not practicably allow an opportunity to
first notify the other party; _provided_ that such party shall notify the
other party as soon as practicable following the provision of such notice to
such Governmental Entity; or

 



 

(B) a Governmental Entity conducts an inspection or otherwise initiates a
communication with the party; _provided_ that such party shall notify the
other party as soon as practicable following such communication.

 



 

(j) In communications with any Governmental Entity or other Person regarding
any Remedial Action undertaken pursuant to the parties obligations under this
_Section 10.6_ or underlying Pre-Closing Environmental Liability, no party or
its representatives shall advocate or take any position that would hinder or
render more difficult or costly the Remedial

 



      
 

 



 

Action to be undertaken by the other party or that is inconsistent with
obtaining closure for the Remedial Action from the Governmental Entity
consistent with the terms of this _Section 10.6_.

 



 

(k) The Purchaser Group Members shall cooperate with all reasonable requests
of Seller, including providing reasonable access to applicable facilities,
employees, business and personnel books and records, data and information,
including access for Sellers and Sellers contractors and other
representatives to any of the Business Real Property to conduct any
investigation of Environmental Conditions or as necessary to perform a
Remedial Action under this _Section 10.6_; _provided_ that any such
investigation shall be conducted so as to not unreasonably interfere with the
continued operation of the Business in any material respect.

 



 

10.7 _Exclusive Remedy_.

 



 

(a) Except (i) with respect to the matters covered by _Sections 2.5_ through
_2.7_ , (ii) with respect to any matter relating to Taxes (which shall be
governed exclusively by _Article VII_ (except as described therein)), (iii)
for the parties right to seek and obtain any equitable relief pursuant to
_Section 11.11_, (iv) as provided in _Section 5.22_ and _Section 6.4_, and
(v) for the fraud of any party hereto or its Affiliates with respect to the
representations, warranties and covenants made in this Agreement, as
applicable, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to a
final and nonappealable judgment, Purchaser and the Sellers acknowledge and
agree that, following the Closing, the indemnification provisions of _Sections
10.2_ and _10.3_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Sellers and
Purchaser for any Liabilities or Losses (including any Liabilities or Losses
from claims for breach of contract, warranty, tortious conduct (including
negligence) or otherwise and whether predicated on common law, statute, strict
liability, or otherwise) that each party may at any time suffer or incur, or
become subject to, as a result of, or in connection with the Sale or the other
transactions contemplated hereby, including any breach of any representation
or warranty in this Agreement by any party, or any failure by any party to
perform or comply with any covenant or agreement that, by its terms, was to
have been performed, or complied with, under this Agreement, the Foreign
Acquisition Agreements and (subject to _Section 2.8(b)_ and following the
completion of the transfer by SCT to Middleby Induction China of the SCT
Business Assets and the assumption by Middleby Induction China of the SCT
Business Liabilities pursuant to the Chinese Asset Purchase Agreement) the
Chinese Asset Purchase Agreement (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt,
the other Ancillary Agreements). Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Purchaser hereby irrevocably waives any right of rescission it may
otherwise have or to which it may become entitled.

 



 

10.8 _Additional Indemnification Provisions_.

 



 

(a) (i) A breach of a representation or warranty shall be deemed to exist
either if such representation or warranty is actually inaccurate or breached
or would have been inaccurate or breached if such representation or warranty
had not contained any limitation or qualification as to materiality, Business
Material Adverse Effect, or Purchaser Material Adverse Effect, and (ii) the
amount of Losses in respect of any breach of a representation or warranty,
including any deemed breach resulting from the application of clause (i),
shall be determined as if such representation and warranty had not contained
any limitation or qualification as to materiality, Business Material Adverse
Effect, or Purchaser Material Adverse Effect set forth in

 



      
 

 



 

such representation or warranty; _provided_ , that the foregoing clauses (i)
and (ii) shall not apply for purposes of the representation and warranty
contained in _Section 3.6(b)_ or to any representation or warranty where such
limitation qualifies an affirmative requirement to list specified items on a
section of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (including for purposes of the
definition of Business Material Contract), or to provide or deliver (or make
available or give access to) specified information or documents.

 



 

(b) With respect to each indemnification obligation contained in this
Agreement, all Losses shall be net of any third-party insurance and indemnity
proceeds that have been actually recovered by the Indemnified Party in respect
of such Losses (it being agreed that if third-party insurance or
indemnification proceeds in respect of such Losses are recovered by the
Indemnified Party subsequent to the Indemnifying Partys making of an
indemnification payment in satisfaction of its applicable indemnification
obligation, such proceeds shall be promptly remitted to the Indemnifying Party
to the extent of the indemnification payment made). Upon making any payment to
the Indemnified Party for any indemnification claim pursuant to this _Article
X_, the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment,
to any rights which the Indemnified Party may have against any third parties
with respect to the subject matter underlying such indemnification claim.

 



 

10.9 _Limitation of Liability_. In no event shall any Indemnifying Party have
liability to any Indemnified Party for, and Losses shall not be deemed to
include, any consequential, special, incidental, exemplary, indirect, punitive
or similar damages, or for any loss of future revenue, profits or income, or
for any diminution in value damages measured as a multiple of earnings,
revenue or any other performance metric, in each case except for any such
damages to the extent such damages are actually awarded and paid to a third
party. Neither the Purchaser Indemnified Parties, on the one hand, nor the
Seller Indemnified Parties, on the other hand, shall be entitled to recover
more than one dollar in respect of each dollar of Loss.

 



 

ARTICLE XI 
GENERAL PROVISIONS

(a) It is understood and agreed that the specification of any dollar amount in
the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or the

Disclosure Schedule is not intended to imply that such amounts or higher or
lower amounts, or the items so included or other items, are or are not
material or would reasonably be expected to have a Business Material Adverse
Effect or Purchaser Material Adverse Effect, and no party shall use the fact
of the setting of such amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any such item
in the Seller Disclosure Schedule or Purchaser Disclosure Schedule in any
dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation, item
or matter not described in this Agreement or included in the Seller Disclosure
Schedule or Purchaser Disclosure Schedule is or is not material or would
reasonably be expected to have a Business Material Adverse Effect or Purchaser
Material Adverse Effect for purposes of this Agreement.

subtraction of the absolute value of such negative number and the subtraction
of a negative number shall mean the addition of the absolute value of such
negative number. If the Closing shall occur, notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, any payment obligation of Purchaser hereunder shall
be a joint and several obligation of Purchaser and the Transferred Companies.
Any right under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement that may be
exercised by any individual Seller or that applies to "Seller" in the singular
shall be a right of, and may be exercised by, any Seller hereunder. Unless the
context otherwise requires, any reference in this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement to the "opening of business" on a specified date shall mean 9 a.m.
Eastern Time on such date. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency
between the terms of this Agreement and any Ancillary Agreement, this
Agreement will control.

 



 

(c) Any disclosure with respect to a Section or schedule of this Agreement,
including any Section of the Seller Disclosure Schedule or the Purchaser
Disclosure Schedule, shall be deemed to be disclosed for other Sections and
schedules of this Agreement, including any Section of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule or Purchaser Disclosure Schedule, to the extent that the relevance of
such disclosure is reasonably apparent.

 



       
 

 



 

11.2 _Headings; Definitions_. The Section and Article headings contained in
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements are inserted for convenience of
reference only and will not affect the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements.

 



 

11.3 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction and Forum; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in
accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to any
choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware
or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. In addition, each of the
parties hereto irrevocably (i) submits to the personal jurisdiction of the
Delaware Court of Chancery in and for New Castle County, or in the event (but
only in the event) that such Delaware Court of Chancery does not have subject
matter jurisdiction over such dispute, the United States District Court for
the District of Delaware, or in the event (but only in the event) that such
United States District Court also does not have jurisdiction over such
dispute, any Delaware State court sitting in New Castle County, in the event
any dispute (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) arises out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) agrees that it will
not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court, (iii) waives any objection to the
laying of venue of any Action relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby in such court, (iv) waives and agrees not to plead or
claim in any such court that any Action relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby brought in any such court has been brought in
an inconvenient forum, and (v) agrees that it will not bring any Action
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in any
court other than the Delaware Court of Chancery in and for New Castle County,
or in the event (but only in the event) that such Delaware Court of Chancery
does not have subject matter jurisdiction over such Action, the United States
District Court for the District of Delaware, or in the event (but only in the
event) that such United States District Court also does not have jurisdiction
over such Action, any Delaware State court sitting in New Castle County. Each
party agrees that service of process upon such party in any such Action shall
be effective if notice is given in accordance with _Section 11.7_.

 



 

(b) EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT WAIVES TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM BROUGHT BY ANY OF THEM AGAINST THE OTHER ARISING
OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THIS AGREEMENT, THE ANCILLARY AGREEMENTS
OR ANY OTHER AGREEMENTS EXECUTED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THEREWITH OR THE
ADMINISTRATION THEREOF OR THE SALE OR ANY OF THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREIN OR THEREIN. NO PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL SEEK A JURY
TRIAL IN ANY LAWSUIT, PROCEEDING, COUNTERCLAIM OR ANY OTHER LITIGATION
PROCEDURE BASED UPON, OR ARISING OUT OF, THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY ANCILLARY
AGREEMENTS OR RELATED INSTRUMENTS. NO PARTY WILL SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE ANY SUCH
ACTION IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL HAS BEEN WAIVED WITH ANY OTHER ACTION IN WHICH A
JURY TRIAL CANNOT BE OR HAS NOT BEEN WAIVED. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT
CERTIFIES THAT IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND

 



      
 

 



 

CERTIFICATIONS SET FORTH ABOVE IN THIS _SECTION 11.3_. NO PARTY HAS IN ANY
WAY AGREED WITH OR REPRESENTED TO ANY OTHER PARTY THAT THE PROVISIONS OF THIS
_SECTION 11.3_ WILL NOT BE FULLY ENFORCED IN ALL INSTANCES.

 



 

11.4 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the Ancillary
Agreements and the Exhibits and Schedules hereto and thereto, and the
Confidentiality Agreement, constitute the entire agreement between the parties
with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersede any prior
discussion, correspondence, negotiation, proposed term sheet, letter of
intent, agreement, understanding or arrangement, and there are no agreements,
understandings, representations or warranties between the parties other than
those set forth or referred to in this Agreement.

 



 

11.5 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except for the parties respective
reimbursement and/or indemnification obligations set forth herein that,
expressly by their terms, extend to beneficiaries other than the parties
hereto, including _Section 5.10_, _5.22_ , _7.2_ , _7.3_ , _7.6_ , _10.2_ and
_10.3_ , in each case which are intended to benefit, and to be enforceable by,
the Persons specified therein, this Agreement, together with the Ancillary
Agreements and the Exhibits and Schedules hereto, are not intended to confer
in or on behalf of any Person not a party to this Agreement (and their
successors and assigns) any rights, benefits, causes of action or remedies
with respect to the subject matter or any provision hereof.

 



 

11.6 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, whether the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated or not, all legal

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such costs and expenses unless expressly otherwise contemplated in
this Agreement.

 



 

11.7 _Notices_. All notices and other communications to be given to any party

11.8 _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the parties to this Agreement and their respective
successors and assigns; _provided_ , that no party to this Agreement may
directly or indirectly assign any or all of its rights or delegate any or all
of its obligations under this Agreement without the express prior written
consent of each other party to this Agreement, except that upon written notice
to Purchaser, any Seller may transfer or assign, in whole or from time to time
in part, its rights under this Agreement to any Affiliate of Parent, but any
such transfer or assignment will not relieve such Seller, as applicable, of
any of its obligations hereunder.

 



 

11.9 _Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement may not be modified or amended
except by an instrument or instruments in writing signed by the party against
whom enforcement of any such modification or amendment is sought. Any party to
this Agreement may, only by an instrument in writing, waive compliance by the
other parties to this Agreement with any term or provision of this Agreement
on the part of such other parties to this Agreement to be performed or
complied with. The waiver by any party to this Agreement of a breach of any
term or provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any
subsequent breach. No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right,
power or privilege hereunder shall operate

 



      
 

 



 

as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude
any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right,
power or privilege.

 



 

11.10 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this
Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to
be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions,
covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party hereto. Upon such a
determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

 



 

11.11 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage, for which monetary damages (even if available) would not be an
adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not
perform any provision of this Agreement in accordance with its specified terms
or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the parties acknowledge and
agree that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
in Law or in equity. Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on
the basis that any other party has an adequate remedy at Law or that any award
of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or
in equity. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with such order or injunction. The parties acknowledge and agree
that the limitations on remedies of the parties following termination of this
Agreement set forth in _Section 9.3_ shall not limit the right of the Sellers
to obtain specific performance pursuant to this _Section 11.11_.

 



 

11.12 _Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representation; Nonassertion of Attorney-
Client Privilege_.

 



 

(a) Purchaser waives and will not assert, and agrees to cause its Affiliates,
including the Transferred Companies, to waive and not to assert, any conflict
of interest arising out of or relating to the representation, after the
Closing (the " _Post-Closing Representation_ "), of Parent, any of its
Affiliates or any shareholder, officer, employee or director of Parent or any
of its Affiliates (any such Person, a " _Designated Person_ ") in any matter
involving this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or any other agreements or
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, by any legal counsel currently
representing Parent or any of its Affiliates in connection with this
Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or any other agreements or transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, including Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz (any
such legal counsel, the " _Legal Counsel_ ," and any such representation, the
" _Current Representation_ ").

 



 

(b) Purchaser waives and will not assert, and agrees to cause its Affiliates,
including the Transferred Companies, to waive and not to assert, any attorney-
client or other applicable legal privilege or protection with respect to any
communication between any Legal

 



      
 

 



 

Counsel and any Designated Person occurring during the Current Representation
(" _Privileged Communication_ ") in connection with any Post-Closing
Representation, including in connection with a dispute with Purchaser or its
Affiliates, and following the Closing, with any Transferred Company (including
in respect of any claim for indemnification by Purchaser), it being the
intention of the parties hereto that all such rights to such attorney-client
and other applicable legal privilege or protection and to control such
attorney-client and other applicable legal privilege or protection shall be
retained by Parent and that Parent, and not Purchaser, its Affiliates or the
Transferred Companies, shall have the sole right to decide whether or not to
waive any attorney-client or other applicable legal privilege or protection.
Accordingly, from and after Closing, none of Purchaser, its Affiliates or the
Transferred Companies shall have any access to any such communications or to
the files of the Current Representation, all of which shall be and remain the
property of Parent and not of Purchaser, its Affiliates or the Transferred
Companies, or to internal counsel relating to such engagement, and none of
Purchaser, its Affiliates, the Transferred Companies or any Person acting or
purporting to act on their behalf shall seek to obtain the same by any process
on the grounds that the privilege and protection attaching to such
communications and files belongs to Purchaser, its Affiliates or the
Transferred Companies or does not belong to Parent. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between Purchaser, its
Affiliates or the Transferred Companies, on the one hand, and a third party
other than Parent or its Affiliates, on the other hand, Purchaser, its
Affiliates or the Transferred Companies may seek to prevent the disclosure of
the Privileged Communications to such third party and request that Parent not
permit such disclosure, and Parent shall consider such request in good faith.

 



 

11.13 _No Admission_. Nothing herein shall be deemed an admission by
Purchaser, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates, in any Action or
proceeding by or on behalf of a third party, that Purchaser, Parent or any of
their respective Affiliates, or that such third party or any of its respective
Affiliates, is or is not in breach or violation of, or in default in, the
performance or observance of any term or provisions of any contract.

 



 

11.14 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different parties in separate counterparts, each of
which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile or other
electronic method shall be as effective as delivery of a manually executed
counterpart of this Agreement.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement has been signed by or on behalf of each of
the parties as of the day first above written.
