# **ARTICLE III**

  

# ** **

  

# **CONVERSION OF SHARES**

  

# ** **

  

3.1 _ Conversion of Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any capital stock
described below:

  



  

### (a) All shares of Common Stock of Target, par value $0.0001 per share ("
** _Target Common Shares_** "), that are held by Target as treasury shares
shall be canceled and cease to be outstanding and no cash, Parent capital
stock or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

  

### 

  

### (b) Subject to _Sections 3.2(b)_ and  _3.3(f)_ , each issued and
outstanding Target Common Share (other than Target Common Shares treated in
accordance with _Section 3.1(a)_ ) shall be converted into the right to
receive 2.100 (the " ** _Exchange Ratio_** ") **** validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Parent (the " ** _Parent Common Shares_** ") (the" **_Common Conversion
Consideration_** "). All such Target Common Shares, when so converted, shall
be retired, shall cease to be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled, and each holder of any such Target Common Share shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive, without
interest, upon the surrender of such Target Common Shares in accordance with
_Section 3.3_ : (x) certificates representing whole Parent Common Shares or
whole Parent Common Shares represented by book-entry in accordance with
_Section 3.3(a)_ , (y) any unpaid dividends and other distributions

  



        
   

  



  

### under _Section 3.3(f)_ , and (z) cash in lieu of fractional Parent Common
Shares under _Section 3.4_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if between
the date hereof and the Effective Time, the Parent Common Shares or Target
Common Shares are changed into a different number of shares or a different
class, because of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares, the Exchange
Ratio above shall be correspondingly adjusted to reflect such stock dividend,
subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or
exchange of shares.

  

### 

  

### (c) The Merger shall not affect any Parent Common Shares issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

### 

  

### (d) Subject to _Section 3.3(f)_ , each issued and outstanding share of
Targets Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, no par value per share (the "
** _Series D Stock_** "), shall be converted into the right to receive one
(1) validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable Parent Series A Share (the "
** _Preferred_** ** __** Conversion Consideration", and collectively with the
Common Conversion Consideration, the " ** _Merger Consideration_** ").  All
such shares of Series D Stock, when so converted, shall be retired, shall
cease to be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled, and each holder
of any such shares of Series D Stock shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive, without interest, upon
the surrender of such shares of Series D Stock in accordance with _Section
3.3_ : (x) certificates representing whole Parent Series A Shares or whole
Parent Series A Shares represented by book-entry in accordance with _Section
3.3(a)_ and (y) any unpaid dividends and other distributions under _Section
3.3(f)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if between the date hereof and the
Effective Time, the shares of the Series D Stock are changed into a different
number of shares or a different class, because of any stock dividend (other
than a payment-in-kind distribution in accordance with the Series D
Certificate), subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split,
combination or exchange of shares, the exchange ratio related to
the Preferred Conversion Consideration above shall be correspondingly
adjusted to reflect such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares.

  

### 

  

### (e) All Parent Common Shares issued upon the surrender of Target Common
Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been
issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Target Common
Shares, and from and after the Effective Time there shall be no further
registration of transfers effected on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of Target Common Shares which were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.  If, after the
Effective Time, Target Common Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided
in this _Article III_.

  

### 

  

### (f) All Parent Series A Shares issued upon the surrender of shares of
Series D Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have
been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of
Series D Stock, and from and after the Effective Time there shall be no
further registration of transfers effected on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of shares of Series D Stock which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, shares
of Series D Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason,
they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article III_.

  



        
   

  



  

## _3.2 _Stock Options; Restricted Stock.

  



  

### (a) Each option to purchase Target Common Shares (each, a " **
_Target Option_** ") granted under the employee and director stock plans
and agreements of Target (the " ** _Target Stock Plans_** "), whether vested
or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, as of the Effective Time and in accordance with its terms,
automatically and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, be
converted into a vested Parent Option, on the same terms and conditions
(except as provided in this _Section 3.2_ ) as were applicable under such
Target Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, to purchase that
number of Parent Common Shares equal to the product of (i) the total number
of Target Common Shares subject to such Target Option and (ii) the Exchange
Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of Parent Common Shares;
provided that, in the event of rounding down of any fractional Parent Common
Shares, Parent shall pay an amount in cash (without interest) in accordance
with _Section 3.2(a)_.  The per-share exercise price for the Parent Common
Shares issuable upon exercise of such Parent Options will be equal to the
quotient determined by dividing (A) the exercise price per share of the
Target Common Shares at which the Target Options were exercisable immediately
prior to the Effective Time by (B) the Exchange Ratio, and rounding to the
resulting per-share exercise price up to the nearest whole cent.
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) in no event shall the per-share exercise
price be less than the par value of Parent Common Shares, and (y) in any
event the exercise price, the number of Parent Common Shares
purchasable pursuant to such Target Option and the terms and conditions of
exercise of such Target Option shall be determined in accordance with the
requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code and in a manner that does not
cause any Target Option to be deferred compensation subject to Section 409A
of the Code. Prior to Closing, (1) Parent will take all corporate actions
necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of Parent Common Shares
for delivery upon exercise of Target Options assumed by Parent under this
_Section 3.2(a)_ and (2) Target shall pass such resolutions as necessary to
approve the terms of this _Section 3.2(a)_.

  



  

### (b) Each award of restricted Target Common Shares granted under a Target
Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "
** _Target Restricted Shares_** ") shall, as of the Effective Time and
in accordance with its terms, automatically and without any action on the
part of the holders thereof, vest and be converted, on the same terms and
conditions (except as provided in this _Section 3.2(b)_ ) as were applicable
under such Target Restricted Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time,
into a number of Parent Common Shares equal to the product of (i) the total
number of Target Common Shares subject to such grant of Target Restricted
Shares and (ii) the Exchange Ratio; provided that, in lieu of any fractional
Parent Common Shares, Parent shall pay an amount in cash (without interest)
in accordance with _Section 3.4_. Prior to the Closing Date, Target shall
take all action necessary to ensure that each holder of Target Restricted
Shares that will be converted into the right to receive Parent Common Shares
executes an Orderly Marketing Deed, substantially in the form attached hereto
as _Exhibit 3.2(b)_.

  

### 

  

### (c) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent will file
with the Securities and Exchange Commission a registration statement on Form
S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate forms) with respect to the Parent
Common Shares subject to stock options and the restricted Parent Common
Shares and will use its reasonable efforts to maintain the

  



        
   

  



  

### effectiveness of such registration statement (and maintain the current
status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for as long as
such options remain outstanding.

  

### 

  

### (d) Prior to the Closing Date, Parents Board of Directors shall take all
action necessary to declare that the Transactions shall not constitute a
"change in control" with respect to (i) the options to purchase Parent Common
Shares (the " ** _Parent Options_** ") and (ii) the outstanding awards
of restricted stock issued by Parent pursuant to Parents stock incentive or
other equity award plans (the " ** _Parent Restricted Shares_** ").
In connection with the Transactions, Parents Board of Directors shall
not exercise any suspension or other remedial measures that may be available
to it under Section 8 of the Bylaws of Parent.

  

### 

  

## _3.3 _Surrender and Payment.

  

## _ _

  

### (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall authorize one (1) or more
transfer agent(s) reasonably acceptable to Target to act as Exchange Agent
hereunder (the " ** _Exchange Agent_** ") with respect to the Merger. At or
prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent in
trust for the benefit of the holders of Target Shares, for exchange in
accordance with this _Section 3.3_ through the Exchange Agent, (i)
certificates representing the Parent Common Shares and Parent Series A Shares
issuable pursuant to _Section 3.1_ in exchange for outstanding Target Common
Shares and shares of Series D Stock, respectively; (ii) cash, Parent Common
Shares and Parent Series A Shares sufficient to pay any unpaid dividends and
other distributions due under _Section 3.3(f)_ ; and (iii) cash funds
sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional Parent Common Shares
in accordance with _Section 3.4_ (such Parent Common Shares, Parent Series
A Shares, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto
and such cash in lieu of fractional Parent Common Shares, being hereinafter
referred to as the " ** _Exchange Fund_** "). The Exchange Agent shall,
pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the appropriate Merger
Consideration in exchange for surrendered certificates that immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented Target Common Shares and shares of Series D
Stock (the " ** _Stock Certificates_** ") or Target Common Shares and shares
of Series D Stock represented by book-entry (" ** _Book-Entry Shares_** ")
pursuant to _Section 3.1_ out of the Exchange Fund.  Except as contemplated
by _Section 3.3(d)_ , the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other
purpose.

  

### 

  

### (b) Promptly but in any event within five (5) Business Days after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to send to each holder
of record of Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Shares a letter of transmittal
for use in such exchange (which shall specify that the delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title with respect to the Stock Certificates
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Stock Certificates to the
Exchange Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the
procedures set forth therein, and which shall be in a form reasonably
acceptable to Target), and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
Stock Certificates or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the surrender of

Price. The " ** _Average Closing Price_** " shall mean the average (rounded

not reported thereby, any other authoritative source selected by Parent)
ending at the close of trading on the trading day prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

3.5 _ Target Dissenting Shares. _Target Dissenting Shares shall not be
converted into or represent the right to receive any Merger Consideration,
but instead shall represent only the right to receive the amount determined
pursuant to the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL. At the Effective Time,
any Target Dissenting Stockholder shall not thereafter be entitled to vote or
exercise any other rights of a stockholder except the right to receive
payment for such Target Dissenting Stockholders Target Dissenting Shares in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. If a Target Dissenting Stockholder
has so failed to perfect or lost his right to receive, or has effectively
withdrawn his demand for, the amount determined under Section 262 of the
DGCL, the Target Common Shares and/or shares of Series D Stock held by such
holder shall cease to be Target Dissenting Shares and shall entitle
such holder to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of such shares
as provided in _Section 3.1(b)_ , and promptly following the occurrence
of such event and upon the surrender of the Stock Certificate(s) representing
such shares or as proper for Book Entry Shares, the Exchange Agent and the
Surviving Corporation (as applicable) shall deliver to such holder the
Merger Consideration in respect of such shares.  Target shall comply with
those provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL which are required to be
performed by Target prior to the Effective Time to the reasonable
satisfaction of Parent.  Target shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any
written demands to exercise dissenters rights and (ii) an opportunity to
participate at its own expense in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to demands for fair value under the DGCL. Target shall not, except
with the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), voluntarily make any payment with respect to demands
for fair value under the DGCL or offer to settle or settle any such claims.
For purposes of this Agreement, (i) " ** _Target Dissenting Shares_** " means
any Target Common Shares and shares of Series D Stock held by a Target
Dissenting Stockholder as of the Effective Time and (ii) " **
_Target Dissenting Stockholders_** " means any holder of Target

shares pursuant to, and otherwise complies in all respects with, the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL.

contemplated by this Agreement (the " ** _Transactions_** ") shall

_Intellectual Property_** ") currently used in the conduct of the business
of Target and its Subsidiaries, except where the failure to so own or

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Confidentiality Agreement, dated March 13,

Agreement_** ") shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement.

  



  

7.2 _ Target Acquisition Proposals_.

  



  

(a) From the date hereof until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, Target and its
Subsidiaries shall not, and shall cause their respective officers, directors,

could reasonably be expected to lead to a Target Acquisition Proposal,

  



  

(ii) approve or recommend entry into any agreement with respect to a Target
Acquisition Proposal, or

  



  

(iii) engage or participate in discussions or negotiations with, or disclose
any nonpublic information relating to Target or its Subsidiaries,
respectively, or furnish to any Person any information with respect to, or
otherwise take any action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any
proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a
Target Acquisition Proposal, or cooperate in any way with a Target
Acquisition Proposal.

  



  

Nothing contained in this _Section 7.2_ shall prohibit Target and its Board
of Directors from (x) taking and disclosing a position with respect to a
tender offer by a third party pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) under the
Exchange Act, (y) waiving, or agreeing to waive, any provision of any stand-
still or similar agreement in effect on the date hereof to allow a Person to
make a Target Acquisition Proposal, so long as simultaneously with such
waiver, such parties become subject to stand-still provisions at least as
restrictive as those in the Confidentiality Agreement, or (z) prior to
obtaining the Target Stockholders Approval, furnishing information,
including nonpublic information to, or entering into negotiations with, any
Person that has submitted an unsolicited bona fide written Target
Acquisition Proposal made not in violation of this Agreement or any
standstill agreement if, and only to the extent that (with respect to this
_Section 7.2_ only):

  



  

(i) such unsolicited bona fide written Target Acquisition Proposal is made by
a third party that Targets Board of Directors determines in good faith

  



        
   

  



  

has the good faith intent to proceed with negotiations to consider, and the
financial and legal capability to consummate, such Target Acquisition
Proposal;

  



  

(ii) Targets Board of Directors, after duly consulting with Targets outside
legal counsel, determines in good faith that such action is necessary for
Targets Board of Directors to comply with its fiduciary duties imposed by
applicable law;

  



  

(iii) contemporaneously with furnishing such information to, or entering into
discussions with, such Person, Target enters into a confidentiality agreement
with such Person on terms no less restrictive than those in the
Confidentiality Agreement (and containing additional provisions that
expressly permit Target to comply with the provisions of this _Section
7.2_); and

  



  

(iv) Targets Board of Directors determines in good faith after consultation
with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel that such Target
Acquisition Proposal is reasonably likely to result in a Target Superior
Proposal.

  



  

(b) For purposes of this Agreement:

  



  

(i) The term " ** _Target Acquisition Proposal_** " means any inquiry, offer
or proposal for, or any indication of interest from any Person relating to,
or that is reasonably likely to lead to, any direct or indirect acquisition,
in one (1) transaction or a series of transactions, including any merger,
consolidation, tender offer, exchange offer, stock acquisition, asset
acquisition, binding share exchange, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution, joint venture or similar transaction, of (A) assets
or businesses that constitute or represent ten percent (10%) or more of the
total revenue, operating income, EBITDA or assets of Target and the Target
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (B) ten percent (10%) or more of the
outstanding shares of Target Common Shares or capital stock of, or other
equity or voting interests in, any of the Target Subsidiaries directly or
indirectly holding, individually or taken together, the assets or business
referred to in clause (A) above, in each case other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Other than as provided in this _Section
7.2_, Target shall not waive any provisions of a confidentiality agreement
entered into with a Person who has indicated a willingness to make an
unsolicited bona fide Target Acquisition Proposal without Parents prior
written consent.

  



  

(ii) The term " ** _Target Superior Proposal_** " means a bona fide written
Target Acquisition Proposal made by a third party that if consummated would
result in such third party (or in the case of a direct merger between such
third party and Target, the stockholders of such third party) acquiring,
directly or indirectly, more than fifty percent (50%) of the voting power of
Target Common Shares or all or substantially all the assets of Target and the
Target Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (by merger or otherwise) for
consideration consisting of cash, securities and/or other property that
Targets Board of Directors in good faith determines, after consultation with
its financial advisors and its outside legal

  



        
   

  



  

counsel, is reasonably likely to be consummated taking into account
the Person making such Target Acquisition Proposal and all legal,
financial, regulatory and other relevant aspects of such Target Acquisition
Proposal, and Targets Board of Directors in good faith determines, after
consultation with its financial advisors and its outside legal counsel, that
such Target Acquisition Proposal would, if consummated, result in a
transaction that is more favorable from a financial point of view to the
holders of Target Common Shares than the Transactions.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to
obtaining the Target Stockholders Approval, nothing in this Agreement shall
prevent Target or the Target Board of Directors from, subject to compliance
by Target with this _Section 7.2_:

  



  

(i) withdrawing, amending or modifying in a manner adverse to Parent, or
publicly proposing to withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to
Parent, the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the
Target Board of Directors or any committee thereof (as the case may be) of
this Agreement, the Merger or the Transactions (the actions referred to in
this clause (i) collectively referred to herein as a " ** _Target
Adverse Recommendation Change_** "),

  



  

(ii) recommending, adopting or approving, or proposing publicly to recommend,
adopt or approve, any Target Acquisition Proposal (the actions referred to in
this clause (ii) being collectively referred to herein as a " ** _Target
Acquisition Proposal Recommendation_** "), or

  



  

(iii) entering into any agreement, including any agreement in principle,
letter of intent or understanding, acquisition or merger agreement, option
agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or similar
agreement, arrangement or understanding which constitutes, relates to, is
intended to lead to or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Target
Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement contemplated by
_Section 7.2(a)(iii)_) (each, a " ** _Target Acquisition Agreement_** ");

  



  

provided, however, that

  



  

(iv) in the case of a Target Adverse Recommendation Change not involving a
Target Acquisition Proposal, the Target Board of Directors, acting in good
faith, has previously determined, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that the failure to take such action is reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to the stockholders of Target
under applicable law;

  



  

(v) in the case of a Target Adverse Recommendation Change involving a
Target Acquisition Proposal, a Target Acquisition Proposal Recommendation or
any entry into a Target Acquisition Agreement, the Target Board of Directors,
acting in good faith, has previously determined, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisors and based on

  



        
   

  



  

such other matters as it deems relevant, that such Target
Acquisition Proposal or Target Acquisition Agreement constitutes a Target
Superior Proposal; and

  



  

(vi) in the case of entry into a Target Acquisition Agreement, Target
concurrently terminates this Agreement pursuant to and after complying with
the provisions of _Article X_ and _Section 7.2_.

  



  

For the avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge and agree that a Target
Adverse Recommendation Change may or may not involve a Target Acquisition
Proposal.

  



  

(d) If Target or any officer, director, employee, attorney, investment banker
or other agent of Target or any Target Subsidiary receives a request for
information from a Person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written
Target Acquisition Proposal, and Target is permitted to provide such Person
with information pursuant to this _Section 7.2_, Target will provide written
notice to Parent to the effect that it is furnishing information to, or
entering into discussions or negotiations with, such Person, and Target will
use commercially reasonable efforts to keep Parent informed in all material
respects of the status and terms of any such negotiations or discussions
(including the identity of the Person with whom such negotiations or
discussions are being held) and provide Parent copies of such written
proposals and any amendments or revisions thereto or correspondence related
thereto; provided, that Parent agrees to execute a confidentiality agreement,
in form reasonably acceptable to it, with respect to any such information
delivered to Parent pursuant to this clause (d), which confidentiality
agreement shall be subject to Parents disclosure obligations arising under
applicable law or securities exchange regulations.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Target Board of
Directors shall not (1) make a Target Acquisition Recommendation Change, (2)
make a Target Acquisition Proposal Recommendation or (3) enter into any
Target Acquisition Agreement relating to a Target Acquisition Proposal,
unless:

  



  

(i) Target complies with _Section 7.2(c)_ and _Section 7.2(d)_; and

  



  

(ii) in the case of a Target Acquisition Proposal, promptly upon a
determination by the Target Board of Directors that a Target Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Target Superior Proposal, Target immediately notifies,
in writing, Parent of such determination and describes in reasonable detail
the material terms and conditions of such Target Superior Proposal and the
identity of the Person making such Target Superior Proposal.  Parent shall
have five (5) Business Days after delivery of such written notice to submit
an offer to engage in an alternative transaction or to modify the terms and
conditions of this Agreement such that Target may proceed with this Agreement
(a " ** _Parent Revised Offer_** "). During such five (5) Business
Day period, Target and its financial and legal advisors shall negotiate in
good faith with Parent to enable Parent to submit a Parent Revised Proposal
and may not terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Article X_. Any
amendment to the price or any other material term of a Target Superior
Proposal shall require a new written notice from Target to Parent and an

  



        
   

  



  

additional three (3) Business Day period within which Parent may negotiate a
Parent Revised Offer.

  



  

(f) All notices to be given by the Parties under this _Section 7.2_ shall be
given by facsimile in accordance with _Section 11.1_ (which notice shall be
considered delivered effective as of the day of transmission if transmitted
on or before 5:00 p.m. U.S. Central Standard Time on the date of
transmission, otherwise the next day after transmission).

  



  

(g) Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in this _Section 7.2_ by any officer, director,
employee, attorney, investment banker or other agent of Target or any Target
Subsidiary, whether or not such person is purporting to act on behalf of
Target or any Target Subsidiary or otherwise, shall be a breach of this
_Section 7.2_ by Target.

  



  

7.3 _ Parent Acquisition Proposals. _From the date hereof until the Effective
Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms, Parent and its Subsidiaries shall not, and shall cause their
respective officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys or
other agents not to, directly or indirectly,

Proposal or any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes or
could reasonably be expected to lead to a Parent Acquisition Proposal,

  



  

(ii) approve or recommend entry into any agreement with respect to a Parent
Acquisition Proposal, or

otherwise take any action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any

Parent Acquisition Proposal, or cooperate in any way with a Parent
Acquisition Proposal.

of Directors from (x) taking and disclosing a position with respect to a
tender offer by a third party pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) under the
Exchange Act, (y) waiving, or agreeing to waive, any provision of any stand-

Acquisition Proposal;

Parents Board of Directors in good faith determines, after consultation with
its financial advisors and its outside legal

  



        
   

  



  

counsel, is reasonably likely to be consummated taking into account
the Person making such Parent Acquisition Proposal and all legal,
financial, regulatory and other relevant aspects of such Parent Acquisition
Proposal, and Parents Board of Directors in good faith determines, after
consultation with its financial advisors and its outside legal counsel, that
such Parent Acquisition Proposal would, if consummated, result in a
transaction that is more favorable from a financial point of view to the
holders of Parent Common Shares than the Transactions.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to
obtaining the Parent Stockholders Approval, nothing in this Agreement shall
prevent Parent or the Parent Board of Directors from, subject to compliance
by Parent with this _Section 7.3_:

  



  

(i) withdrawing, amending or modifying in a manner adverse to Target, or
publicly proposing to withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to
Target, the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the
Parent Board or any committee thereof (as the case may be) of this Agreement,
the Merger or the transactions contemplated thereby (the actions referred to
in this clause (i) collectively referred to herein as a " ** _Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change_** "),

  



  

(ii) recommending, adopting or approving, or proposing publicly to recommend,
adopt or approve, any Parent Acquisition Proposal (the actions referred to in
this clause (ii) being collectively referred to herein as a " ** _Parent
Acquisition Proposal Recommendation_** "), or

  



  

(iii) entering into any agreement, including any agreement in principle,
letter of intent or understanding, acquisition or merger agreement, option
agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or similar
agreement, arrangement or understanding which constitutes, relates to, is
intended to lead to or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Parent
Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement contemplated by
_Section 7.3(a)(iii)_) (each, a " ** _Parent Acquisition Agreement_** ");

  



  

provided, however, that

  



  

(iv) in the case of a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change not involving a
Parent Acquisition Proposal, the Parent Board, acting in good faith, has
previously determined, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that the failure to take such action is reasonably likely to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary obligations to the stockholders of Parent under applicable
law;

  



  

(v) in the case of a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change involving a Parent
Acquisition Proposal, a Parent Acquisition Proposal Recommendation or any
entry into a Parent Acquisition Agreement, the Parent Board, acting in good
faith, has previously determined, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisors and based on such other matters as it

  



        
   

  



  

deems relevant, that such Parent Acquisition Proposal or Parent Acquisition
Agreement constitutes a Parent Superior Proposal; and

  



  

(vi) in the case of entry into a Parent Acquisition Agreement, Parent
concurrently terminates this Agreement pursuant to and after complying with
the provisions of _Article X_ and _Section 7.3_.

  



  

For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties acknowledge and agree that a Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change may or may not involve a Parent Acquisition
Proposal.

  



  

(d) If Parent or any officer, director, employee, attorney, investment banker
or other agent of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary receives a request for
information from a Person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written
Parent Acquisition Proposal, and Parent is permitted to provide such Person
with information pursuant to this _Section 7.3_, Parent will provide written
notice to Target to the effect that it is furnishing information to, or
entering into discussions or negotiations with, such Person, and Parent will
use commercially reasonable efforts to keep Target informed in all material
respects of the status and terms of any such negotiations or discussions
(including the identity of the Person with whom such negotiations or
discussions are being held) and provide Target copies of such
written proposals and any amendments or revisions thereto or correspondence
related thereto; provided, that Target agrees to execute a confidentiality
agreement, in form reasonably acceptable to it, with respect to any such
information delivered to Target pursuant to this clause (d), which
confidentiality agreement shall be subject to Targets disclosure obligations
arising under applicable law or securities exchange regulations.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Parent Board of
Directors shall not (1) make a Parent Acquisition Recommendation Change, (2)
make a Parent Acquisition Proposal Recommendation or (3) enter into any
Parent Acquisition Agreement relating to a Parent Acquisition Proposal,
unless:

  



  

(i) Parent complies with _Section 7.3(c)_ and _Section 7.3(d)_; and

  



  

(ii) in the case of a Parent Acquisition Proposal, promptly upon a
determination by the Parent Board that a Parent Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Parent Superior Proposal, Parent immediately notifies, in
writing, Target of such determination and describes in reasonable detail the
material terms and conditions of such Parent Superior Proposal and the
identity of the Person making such Parent Superior Proposal. Target shall
have five (5) Business Days after delivery of such written notice to submit
an offer to engage in an alternative transaction or to modify the terms
and conditions of this Agreement such that Parent may proceed with this
Agreement (a " ** _Target Revised Offer_** "). During such five (5) Business
Day period, Parent and its financial and legal advisors shall negotiate in
good faith with Target to enable Target to submit a Target Revised Proposal
and may not terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Article X_. Any
amendment to the price or any other material term of a Parent Superior
Proposal shall require a new written notice from Parent to Target and an
additional three (3) Business Day period within which Target may negotiate a
Target Revised Offer.

  



         
 

  



  

(f) All notices to be given by the Parties under this _Section 7.3_  shall
be given by facsimile in accordance with _Section 11.1_ (which notice shall
be considered delivered effective as of the day of transmission
if transmitted on or before 5:00 p.m. U.S. Central Standard Time on the date
of transmission, otherwise the next day after transmission).

  



  

(g) Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in this _Section 7.3_ by any officer, director,
employee, attorney, investment banker or other agent of Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary, whether or not such person is purporting to act on behalf of
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or otherwise, shall be a breach of this
_Section 7.3_ by Parent.

at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective
Time, an officer or director of Target or, any Subsidiary (each a " **
_Target ** _Indemnified Party_**_** "), who was or is made or is threatened
to be made a party or is otherwise involved in any action, suit or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, or investigative (a " ** _proceeding_**
") against all losses, damages, liabilities, fees and expenses
(including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel and experts and
judgments, fines, losses, claims, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement
(provided that any such settlement is effected with the prior written consent

If a Target Indemnified Party makes or asserts any claim for Target
Indemnified Liabilities, any determination required to be made with respect
to whether a Target Indemnified Partys conduct complies with the standards
set forth under the DGCL shall be made by independent counsel mutually
acceptable to the Surviving Corporation and the Target Indemnified Party; and
provided, further, that nothing herein shall impair any rights or obligations
of any Target Indemnified Party. If any claim or claims are brought against
any Target Indemnified Party (whether arising before or after the Effective

(ii) The Surviving Corporation shall promptly advance all reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses of each Target Indemnified Party in connection with any such

Corporation of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Target Indemnified
Party to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such
Target Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified by the Surviving
Corporation.

  



  

(iii) The Surviving Corporation shall maintain Targets existing traditional
and Side A officers and directors liability insurance policies (" ** _D andO

coverage for a period of at least six (6) years after the Effective Time for
the purpose of providing coverage for claims made during the six (6) year
period for wrongful acts (as defined by the existing DandO Insurance policies)
committed prior to the Effective Time; provided, that, if possible, the
Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of substantially
similar coverage and amounts containing terms no less advantageous to the
insureds under the existing DandO Insurance policies so long as any such
substitution does not result in gaps or lapses in coverage; provided further,
that the aggregate amount of premiums to be paid with respect to the
maintenance of such tail coverage for six (6) years shall not exceed
$2,000,000, and in the event that the cost of such coverage exceeds that
amount, the Surviving Corporation shall purchase only as much tail coverage
for six (6) years as possible for the amount of $2,000,000.

  



  

(iv) In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or

be the continuing or surviving company or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall
assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.4(a)_.

  



  

(v) The obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this _Section 7.4(a)_
shall survive the consummation of this Merger and shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Target Indemnified Party
to whom this _Section 7.4(a)_  applies for a period of six (6) years from the
Effective Time without the consent of each affected Target Indemnified Party

defend and hold harmless each person who is now, or has been at any time
prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, an

_Indemnified Party_**_** "), who was or is made or is threatened to be made a
party or is otherwise involved in any proceeding against all losses, damages,
liabilities, fees and expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements
of counsel and experts and judgments, fines, losses, claims, liabilities and
amounts paid in settlement (provided that any such

not be unreasonably withheld)) actually and reasonably incurred by the
Parent Indemnified Party because the Parent Indemnified Party is or was a
director or officer of Parent pertaining to any act or omission existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time including any act or omission
relating to this Agreement or the Transactions (the " ** _Parent **
_Indemnified Liabilities_**_** ") to the full extent permitted under Texas
law or Parents Certificate of Formation and Bylaws. If a Parent Indemnified
Party makes or asserts any claim for Parent Indemnified Liabilities,
any determination required to be made with respect to whether a Parent
Indemnified Partys conduct complies with the standards set forth under the
Texas Business Organizations Code (the " ** _TBOC_** ") shall be made by
independent counsel mutually acceptable to Parent and the Parent Indemnified
Party; and provided, further, that nothing herein shall impair any rights or
obligations of any Parent Indemnified Party. If any claim or claims are
brought against any Parent Indemnified Party (whether arising before or after
the Effective Time), such Parent Indemnified Party may select counsel for the
defense of such claim, which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to
Parent.

  



  

(ii) Parent shall promptly advance all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of
each Parent Indemnified Party in connection with any such action or
proceeding described above, as such expenses are incurred, to the fullest
extent permitted by the TBOC, subject to the receipt by Parent of an
undertaking by or on behalf of such Parent Indemnified Party to repay such
amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such Parent Indemnified
Party is not entitled to be indemnified by Parent.

  



  

(iii) Parent shall maintain its existing traditional and Side A DandO Insurance
policies, including existing excess layers, with the purchase of tail
coverage for a period of at least six (6) years after the Effective Time for
the purpose of providing coverage for claims made during the six (6) year
period for wrongful acts (as defined by the existing DandO Insurance policies)
committed prior to the Effective Time; provided, that , if possible, Parent
may substitute therefor policies of substantially similar coverage and
amounts containing terms no less advantageous to the insureds under the
existing DandO Insurance policies so long as any such substitution does not
result in gaps or lapses in coverage; provided further, that the aggregate
amount of premiums to be paid with respect to the maintenance of such tail
coverage for six (6) years shall not exceed $2,000,000, and in the event that
the cost of such coverage exceeds that amount, Parent shall purchase only as
much tail coverage for six (6) years as possible for the amount of
$2,000,000.

  



  

(iv) In the event Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving company or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers
all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then,
and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors
and assigns of Parent shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section
7.4(b)_.

  



        
   

  



  

(v) The obligations of Parent under this _Section 7.4(b)_ shall survive the
consummation of this Merger and shall not be terminated or modified in such a
manner as to adversely affect any Parent Indemnified Party to whom this

Time without the consent of each affected Parent Indemnified Party (it being
expressly agreed that the Parent Indemnified Parties to whom this _Section
7.4(b)_ applies shall be third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 7.4(b)_.

  



  

7.5 _ __Further Assurances._ Each party shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain all consents and approvals and to do all other things
necessary for the consummation of the Transactions. The parties shall take
such further action to deliver or cause to be delivered to each other at the
Closing and at such other times thereafter as shall be reasonably agreed by
such parties such additional agreements or instruments as any of them may
reasonably request for the purpose of carrying out this Agreement and the
Transactions. The parties shall afford each other access to all information,
documents, records and personnel who may be necessary for any party to comply
with laws or regulations (including the filing and payment of taxes and

to indemnification hereunder or to defend itself against suits or claims
of others. Parent and Target shall duly preserve all files, records or any

any Ancillary Agreement to which Merger Sub is a party.

  



  

7.10 _ __Filings_.  Each party shall make all filings such party is required

7.12 _ __Certain Parent Board Approvals_.  Prior to the Closing Date, Parent
and Target, and their respective Boards of Directors, shall adopt resolutions
consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC and take any other
actions as may be required to cause any dispositions of Target Shares

Board of Directors in its sole discretion (collectively, " ** _Director
Nominees_** "); and (ii) Richard Kelly Plato of Parents Board of Directors

Time, Targets Board of Directors or nominating committee shall nominate
another individual who is a member of Targets Board of Directors and is
reasonably acceptable to Parent to serve in such individuals place. Parent
shall take such action, including amending its Certificate of Formation
and/or Bylaws, as required to cause the number of directors constituting

increased as necessary to reflect the addition of the Director Nominees.

  



  

(b) The composition of the committees of Parents Board of Directors

7.15 _ __Preparation of the Proxy/Prospectus and Registration Statement_.

  



  

(a) Parent and Target shall promptly (i) prepare and file with the SEC a
preliminary version of the Proxy/Prospectus and will use commercially
reasonable efforts to respond to the comments of the SEC in connection
therewith and to furnish all information required to prepare the definitive
Proxy/Prospectus and (ii) prepare and publish an admission document in
relation to Parent and Target (the " ** _Readmission Document_** ") which
shall be

  



        
   

  



  

compiled in accordance with the AIM Rules and Parent and Target shall furnish
all relevant information required to publish the Readmission
Document, procure the acceptance of responsibility of any director or
proposed director of Parent in connection with the Readmission Document, the
engagement of any competent person in accordance with the AIM Rules and the
engagement of any other adviser that may be required so that Parent may be
approved and re-admitted to the AIM. At any time from (and including) the
initial filing with the SEC of the Proxy/Prospectus, Parent shall file with
the SEC the Registration Statement containing the Proxy/Prospectus so long as
Parent shall have provided to Target a copy of the Registration Statement
containing the Proxy/Prospectus at least ten (10) days prior to any filing
thereof and any supplement or amendment at least two (2) days prior to any
filing thereof. Subject to the foregoing sentence, Parent and Target shall
jointly determine the date that the Registration Statement is filed with the
SEC and the date that Parent shall be re-admitted to listing on AIM.
Parent and Target shall use commercially reasonable efforts (i) to have
the Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as practicable after such filing and (ii) use commercially
reasonable efforts to achieve the intended date for re-admission to listing
on AIM including instructing Parents nominated adviser to file such
necessary notices with AIM as may be required to effect Parents listing on
AIM. Parent shall also take any action (other than qualifying to do business
in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified or filing a general
consent to service of process in any jurisdiction) required to be taken under
any applicable state securities laws or AIM Rules in connection with the
issuance of Parent Common Shares in the Merger and Target shall furnish all
information concerning Target and the holders of shares of Target capital
stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action.
 Promptly after the effectiveness of the Registration Statement and
the completion of the Readmission Document, Parent and Target shall cause
the Proxy/Prospectus and the Readmission Document to be mailed to their
respective stockholders, and if necessary, after the definitive
Proxy/Prospectus and Readmission Document have been mailed, promptly
circulate amended, supplemented or supplemental proxy materials and, if
required in connection therewith, re-solicit proxies or written consents, as
applicable. If at any time prior to the Effective Time, the officers and
directors of Parent or Target discover any statement which, in light of the
circumstances to which it is made, is false or misleading with respect to a
material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make
the statement made in the Proxy/Prospectus or the Readmission Document
not misleading, then such party shall immediately notify the other party of
such misstatements or omissions. Parent shall advise Target and Target shall
advise Parent, as applicable, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of
the time when the Registration Statement becomes effective or any supplement
or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension
of the qualification of the Parent Common Shares for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy/Prospectus
or the Registration Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or
requests by the SEC for additional information.

delivered to Target a letter of Hein, dated a date within two (2) Business
Days before the effective date of the Registration Statement and the date of
the publication of the Readmission Document, and addressed to Target, in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to Target and customary in scope and

date of the publication of the Readmission Document, and addressed to Parent,
in form and substance satisfactory to Parent and customary in scope and
substance for "cold comfort" and "working capital" and other required
letters delivered by independent public accountants in connection with
registration statements and proxy statements similar to the Proxy/Prospectus
and the Readmission Document.

efforts to cause the Parent Common Shares to be issued in the Merger and to
be issued upon the exercise of options to purchase Parent Common Shares to be
approved and admitted for listing on the NYSE Amex and the AIM.

accrued but unused vacation, sick, or other paid leave and the rate at which
paid leave is accrued, (iv) the location where such employee generally
performs services, (v) the date such employee was employed by Parent or a
Subsidiary of Parent, (vi) status as exempt/non-exempt, (vii) initial date of
hire, seniority or service credit date if different from initial date of
hire, (viii) status (whether active or on leave of absence and, if on a
leave, the type of leave), and (ix) bonuses for the current fiscal year and
the most recently completed fiscal year (the " ** _Parent Employees_** ").
The Target Employees and the Parent Employees are referred to herein
collectively as the " ** _Business Employees_**."

  



  

(c) After the Effective Time, Parent shall (or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to) (i) continue in effect the Target Benefit Plans (except as
provided in this _Section_

  



        
   

  



  

 _7.17_ ) and the Administaff Plans as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and the Administaff Agreement (or a substantially similar
agreement with Administaff Companies II, L.P. or its affiliate) or
(ii) provide or cause to be provided substantially similar benefit plans
and arrangements to those benefit plans and arrangements provided to the
Business Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time either through an
agreement with a professional employer organization other than Administaff
Companies II, L.P. or through benefit plans and arrangements sponsored and
maintained by Parent or a Subsidiary (the plans described in (i) and (ii) are

(d) For all purposes (including for purposes of vesting, eligibility, accrual
of benefits and level of benefits) under the Post-Closing Plans providing
benefits to any Target Employees after the Effective Time, each Target
Employee shall be credited for his or her years of service with Target and
its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective Time,
to the same extent as such Target Employee was entitled, before the Effective
Time, to credit for such service under any similar Target Benefit Plan or
Administaff Plan; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply with
respect to benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan. In
addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall
take commercially reasonable efforts to provide that (x) each Target Employee
shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in
any and all Post-Closing Plans to the extent coverage under such Post-Closing
Plan is comparable to a Target Benefit Plan or Administaff Plan in which such
Target Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such
plans, collectively, the " ** _Pre-Closing Plans_** ") and (y) for purposes
of each Post-Closing Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or
vision benefits to any Target Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing
condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such Post-Closing
Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents, unless
such conditions would not have been waived under comparable plans of Target
or its Subsidiaries or the Administaff Plan in which such
employee participated immediately prior to the Effective time, and Parent
shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Pre-Closing Plans
ending on the date of such employees participation in the corresponding
Post-Closing Plan begins to be taken into account under such Post-Closing
Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-
of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such Post-Closing Plan.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 7.17(e)_ , the
parties expressly acknowledge and agree that (i) the Business Employees are
not intended beneficiaries of this Agreement and this Agreement is not
intended to create a contract between Parent (or any of its subsidiaries),
the Surviving Corporation, Target, or any Target Subsidiary, on the one hand,
and any Business Employee, on the other hand, and no Business Employee may
rely on this Agreement as a basis for any breach of contract claim against
Parent (or any of its subsidiaries), the Surviving Corporation, Target, or
any of the Target Subsidiaries; (ii) nothing in this Agreement shall be
deemed or construed to require Parent (or any of its subsidiaries), the
Surviving Corporation, Target, or any of the Target Subsidiaries to continue
to employ any particular Business Employee for any period after Closing;
(iii) nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed or construed to limit
Parents (or any of its subsidiarys), or the Surviving Corporations right
to terminate the employment of any Business Employee during any period

  



        
   

  



  

after Closing; (iv) nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed or construed to
limit Parents (or any of its subsidiarys), or the Surviving Corporations
right to terminate or amend any benefit plan or arrangement covering any
Business Employee on or after the Closing Date or to provide any benefit
other than through agreement with a professional employer organization; and
(v) nothing in this Agreement shall modify or amend any Target Benefit Plan,
Administaff Plan, Parent Benefit Plan or other agreement, plan, program, or
document unless this Agreement explicitly states that the provision
"amends" such plan or other agreement, plan, program, or document.

  



  

(f) Parent shall (or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) recognize
accrued but unused paid vacation, earned time off, and sick leave accrued by
a Business Employee as of the Closing Date. Prior to the Closing Date,
Target shall confirm in writing to Parent and Parent shall confirm in writing
to Target and Parent and Target shall confirm to their respective
Business Employees the amount of accrued and unpaid days of vacation, earned
time off, and sick leave applicable to such Business Employees.

be.

Parent at least thirty (30) days prior to the Closing all environmental
documents, reports, assessments and Target Permits regarding the properties
owned, used or leased by Target and its Subsidiaries. Subject to compliance
with applicable law, from the date hereof until the Effective Time, each
party may undertake (at that partys sole cost and expense) a reasonable
environmental and

  



        
   

  



  

operational assessment or assessments (an " ** _Assessment_** ") of the other

include any soil borings, groundwater or any other "Phase II" testing without
the consent of the party whose operations, business or property is the
subject of such Assessment (the " ** _Inspected Party_** ") (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Before conducting an
Assessment, the party intending to conduct such Assessment (the " **
_Inspecting Party_** ") shall confer with the Inspected Party regarding
the nature, scope and scheduling of such Assessment, and shall comply with
such conditions as the Inspected Party may reasonably impose to (i)
avoid interference with the Inspected Partys operations or business; (ii)
require Inspecting Partys representatives responsible for performing the
Assessment to maintain insurance coverage as required by the Inspected Party;
(iii) keep the Inspected Partys property free and clear of any liens arising
out of any entry onto or inspection of the subject property; and (iv) provide
indemnification by the Inspecting Party in favor of the Inspected Party to
indemnify the Inspected Party from the Inspecting Partys negligence in
conducting such Assessment. The Inspected Party shall cooperate in good
faith with the Inspecting Partys effort to conduct an Assessment.

  



  

7.20 _ __Tax Treatment_.  Each party shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Merger to qualify, and shall not take, and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to prevent any subsidiary of such party from

a Target Adverse Recommendation Change, Target Acquisition
Proposal Recommendation, failure to reject a tender or exchange offer or

Approval is not obtained after Target makes a Target Adverse Recommendation
Change or Target Acquisition Proposal Recommendation); or (y)
Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1(k)_ (i.e.,

Breach), and in each case, within six (6) months after such termination of
this Agreement:

  



        
   

  



  

(A) a transaction is consummated, which transaction, if offered or proposed,
would constitute a Parent Takeover; or

  



  

(B) a definitive agreement (the execution and delivery of which has been

(ii) If (x) Target terminates this Agreement under _Section 10.1(i)_ (i.e.,
a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change, Parent Acquisition
Proposal Recommendation, failure to reject a tender or exchange offer or
breach of _Section 7.3_) and, as of the date of termination, Parent does not
have the right to terminate this Agreement under _Section 10.1(b)_, _(d)_ ,
_(e)_ or  _(f)_ (provided Parent shall not be considered to have the right
to terminate the Agreement under _Section 10.1(b)(f)_ if

(c) The parties acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in this
_Section 10.3_ are an integral part of the Transactions, and that, without
these agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement. Each of
the parties hereto further acknowledges that neither the payment of the
amounts by Parent specified in _Section 10.3_ nor the payment of the amounts
by Target specified in _Section 10.3_ is a penalty, but in each case is
liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Target or
Parent, as the case may be, in the circumstances in which such fees are
payable and that do not involve a willful and material breach as described in
_Section 10.2_ for the efforts and resources expended and the opportunities
foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement
and on the expectation of the consummation of the Transactions, which amount
would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the parties agree that the
monetary remedies set forth in this _Section 10.3_ and the specific
performance remedies set forth in _Section 11.14_ shall be the sole and
exclusive remedies of (A) Target and its Subsidiaries against Parent and
Merger Sub and any of their respective former, current or future general or
limited partners, stockholders, managers, employees, representatives,
members, directors, officers, Affiliates or agents for any loss suffered as a
result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated except, with respect to
Parent and Merger Sub only, in the case of a willful and material breach as
described in _Section 10.2_, and upon payment of such amount, none of Parent
or Merger Sub or any of their respective former, current or future general or
limited partners, stockholders, managers, employees, representatives,
members, directors, officers, Affiliates or agents shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
Transactions except, with respect to Parent and Merger Sub only, in the case
of a willful and material breach as described in _Section 10.2;_ and (B)
Parent and Merger Sub against Target and its Subsidiaries and any of their
respective former, current or future general or limited
partners, stockholders, managers, employees, representatives, members,
directors, officers, Affiliates or agents for any loss suffered as a result
of the failure of the Merger to be consummated except, with respect to Target
and its Subsidiaries only, in the case of a willful and material breach as
described in  _Section 10.2_, and upon payment of such amount, none of
Target and its Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current or
future general or limited partners, stockholders, managers, employees,
representatives, members, directors, officers, Affiliates or agents shall
have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the Transactions except, with respect to Target and its
Subsidiaries only, a willful and material breach as described in _Section
10.2_.

(3) years prior to voting, unless such instrument provides for a longer
period, and filed with the Secretary of the corporation before, or at the
time of, the meeting. If such instrument shall designate two (2) or more
persons to act as proxies, unless such instrument shall provide the contrary,
a majority of such persons present at any meeting at which their powers
thereunder are to be exercised shall have and may exercise all the powers of
voting or giving consents thereby conferred, or if only one (1) be present,
then such powers may be exercised by that one (1); or, if an even number
attend and a majority do not agree on any particular issue, each proxy so
attending shall be entitled to exercise such powers in respect of the same
portion of the shares as he is of the proxies representing such shares.

## SECTION 2.08. _Consent of Stockholders_. Whenever the vote of stockholders
at a meeting thereof is required or permitted to be taken for or in
connection with any corporate action by any provision of the statutes, the
meeting and vote of stockholders may be dispensed with if all the
stockholders who would have been entitled to vote upon the action if such
meeting were held shall consent in writing to such corporate action being
taken; or on the written consent of the holders of shares of the
corporations capital stock having not less than the minimum percentage of
the vote required by the DGCL for the proposed corporate action, and provided
that prompt notice must be given to all stockholders of the taking of
corporate action without a meeting and by less than unanimous written
consent.

## SECTION 2.09. _Voting of Stock of Certain Holders_. Shares of the
corporations capital stock standing in the name of another corporation,
domestic or foreign, may be voted by such officer, agent, or proxy as the
bylaws of such corporation may prescribe, or in the absence of such
provision, as the Board

  



        
   

  



  

## of Directors of such corporation may determine. Shares standing in the
name of a deceased person may be voted by the executor or administrator of
such deceased person, either in person or by proxy.  Shares standing in the
name of a guardian, conservator, or trustee may be voted by such fiduciary,
either in person or by proxy, but no such fiduciary shall be entitled to vote
shares held in such fiduciary capacity without a transfer of such shares into
the name of such fiduciary. Shares standing in the name of a receiver may be
voted by such receiver. A stockholder whose shares are pledged shall be
entitled to vote such shares, unless in the transfer by the pledgor on the
books of the corporation, he has expressly empowered the pledgee to vote
thereon, in which case only the pledgee, or his proxy, may represent the
stock and vote thereon.

  

## 

  

## SECTION 2.10. _Treasury Stock_. The corporation shall not vote, directly

than sixty (60) days preceding the date for payment of any dividend or
distribution, or the date for the allotment of rights, or the date when any
change, or conversion or exchange of capital stock shall go into effect, or a
date in connection with obtaining a consent, as a record date for the
determination of the stockholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, any
such meeting and any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of
any such dividend or distribution, or to receive any such allotment of
rights, or to exercise the rights in respect of any such change, conversion
or exchange of capital stock, or to give such consent, and in such case such
stockholders and only such stockholders as shall be stockholders of record on
the date so fixed, shall be entitled to such notice of, and to vote at, any
such meeting and any adjournment thereof, or to receive payment of such
dividend or distribution, or to receive such allotment of rights, or to
exercise such rights, or to give such consent, as the case may be,
notwithstanding any transfer of any stock on the books of the
corporation after any such record date fixed as aforesaid.

of the Board of Directors, or of any committee thereof, may participate in

employee, or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of

corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, against
expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines, and amounts paid in

action, suit, or proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he
reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no

is or was a director, officer, employee, or agent of the corporation, or is
or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer,
employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust,
or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and
reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of
such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably
believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and
except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue,
or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to
the corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or
the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon
application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all
the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled
to indemnity for such expenses as the Court of Chancery or such other court
shall deem proper.

  

## 

  

## SECTION 10.03. _Mandatory Indemnification_. To the extent that a

determined according to the following formula (the " **Conversion Rate** "):

  



  

 _Conversion Amount_

  

Conversion Price

  



  

No fractional shares of Common Stock are to be issued upon the conversion of
any Preferred Share, but rather the number of shares of Common Stock to be
issued shall be rounded to the nearest whole number.

  



  

## (d) _Mechanics of Conversion_. The conversion of Preferred Shares shall
be conducted in the following manner:

  

### 

  

### (i) _Holder s Delivery Requirements_. To convert Preferred Shares into
shares of Common Stock on any date (a " **Conversion Date** "), the Holder
shall (A) transmit by facsimile (or otherwise deliver), for receipt on or
prior to 11:59 p.m., New York City Time, on such date, a copy of a properly
completed notice of conversion executed by the registered Holder of the
Preferred Shares subject to such conversion in the

  



        
   

  



  

### form attached hereto as _Exhibit I_ (the " **Conversion Notice** ") to
the Company and the Companys designated transfer agent (the " **Transfer
Agent** ") and (B) if required by Section 2(d)(viii), surrender to a common
carrier for delivery to the Company as soon as practicable following such
date the original certificates representing the Preferred Shares being
converted (or compliance with the procedures set forth in Section 13) (the "
**Preferred Stock Certificates** ").

  

### 

  

### (ii) _Company s Response_. Upon receipt by the Company of copy of
a Conversion Notice, the Company shall (I) as soon as practicable, but
in any event within two (2) Trading Days, send, via facsimile, a
confirmation of receipt of such Conversion Notice to such Holder and the
Transfer Agent, which confirmation shall constitute an instruction to the
Transfer Agent to process such Conversion Notice in accordance with the terms
herein and (II) on or before the third (3rd) Trading Day following the date
of receipt by the Company of such Conversion Notice (the " **Share Delivery
Date** "), (A) provided the Transfer Agent is participating in the DTC Fast
Automated Securities Transfer Program, credit such aggregate number of shares
of Common Stock to which the Holder shall be entitled to the Holders or its
designees balance account with DTC through its Deposit Withdrawal Agent
Commission system, or (B) if the Transfer Agent is not participating in the
DTC Fast Automated Securities Transfer Program, issue and deliver to the
address as specified in the Conversion Notice, a certificate, registered in
the name of the Holder or its designee, for the number of shares of Common
Stock to which the Holder shall be entitled. If the number of
Preferred Shares represented by the Preferred Stock Certificate(s) submitted
for conversion, as may be required pursuant to Section 2(d)(viii), is
greater than the number of Preferred Shares being converted, then the Company
shall, as soon as practicable and in no event later than three (3) Business
Days after receipt of the Preferred Stock Certificate(s) (the " **Preferred
Stock Delivery Date** ") and at its own expense, issue and deliver to the
Holder a new Preferred Stock Certificate representing the number of Preferred
Shares not converted. The Person or Persons entitled to receive the shares of
Common Stock issuable upon a conversion of Preferred Shares shall be treated
for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common
Stock on the Conversion Date.

  

### 

  

### (iii) _Dispute Resolution_. In the case of a dispute as to
the determination of the Closing Sale Price or the arithmetic calculation of
the Conversion Rate, the Company shall instruct the Transfer Agent to issue
to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock that is not disputed and
shall transmit an explanation of the disputed determinations or
arithmetic calculations to the Holder via facsimile within two (2) Business
Days of receipt of such Holders Conversion Notice or other date of
determination. If such Holder and the Company are unable to agree upon the
determination of the Closing Sale Price or arithmetic calculation of the

  



        
   

  



  

### Conversion Rate within two (2) Business Days of such disputed
determination or arithmetic calculation being transmitted to the Holder, then
the Company shall within two (2) Business Days submit via facsimile (A) the
disputed determination of the Closing Sale Price to an independent, reputable
investment bank selected by the Company and approved by the Required Holders
or (B) the disputed arithmetic calculation of the Conversion Rate to the
Companys independent, outside accountant. The Company shall cause, at the
Companys expense, the investment bank or the accountant, as the case may be,
to perform the determinations or calculations and notify the Company and the
Holders of the results no later than two (2) Business Days from the time it
receives the disputed determinations or calculations.  Such investment
banks or accountants determination or calculation, as the case may be,
shall be binding upon all parties absent error.

  

### 

  

### (iv) _Record Holder_. The Person or Persons entitled to receive
the shares of Common Stock issuable upon a conversion of Preferred Shares
shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such
shares of Common Stock on the Conversion Date.

  

### 

  

### (v) _Company s Failure to Timely Convert_.

  

#### 

  

#### (A) _Cash Damages_. If (x) (I) within three (3) Trading Days after the
Companys receipt of the facsimile copy of a Conversion Notice or (II) on any
Company Delivery Date, the Company shall fail to credit a Holders balance
account with DTC or issue and deliver a certificate to such Holder for the
number of shares of Common Stock to which such Holder is entitled upon such
Holders conversion or the Companys conversion, as applicable, of Preferred
Shares or (y) within three (3) Trading Days of the Companys receipt of a
Preferred Stock Certificate the Company shall fail to issue and deliver a new
Preferred Stock Certificate representing the number of Preferred Shares to
which such Holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2(d)(ii), then due to the
uncertainty and difficulty of estimating a Holders damages for such delay
and as a reasonable estimate of such Holders actual loss due to the delay
and not as a penalty, the Company shall pay additional damages to such Holder
for each day after the Share Delivery Date or the Company Delivery Date, as
applicable, that such conversion is not timely effected and/or each day after
the Preferred Stock Delivery Date that such Preferred Stock Certificate is
not delivered in an amount equal to one and one half percent (1.5%) of
the product of (I) the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock not
issued to the Holder on or prior to the Share Delivery Date or Company
Delivery Date, as applicable, and to which such Holder is entitled as set
forth in the applicable Conversion Notice or in any Company Conversion Notice
and, in the event the Company has

  



        
   

  



  

#### failed to deliver a Preferred Stock Certificate to the Holder on or
prior to the Preferred Stock Delivery Date, the number of shares of Common
Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Shares represented by such
Preferred Stock Certificate as of the Preferred Stock Delivery Date and (II)
the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Share Delivery Date or
Company Delivery Date, as applicable, in the case of the failure to deliver
Common Stock, or the Preferred Stock Delivery Date, in the case of failure to
deliver a Preferred Stock Certificate. If the Company fails to pay the
additional damages set forth in this Section 2(d)(v)(A) within five (5)
Trading Days of the date incurred, then the Holder entitled to such payments
shall have the right at any time, so long as the Company continues to fail to
make such payments, to require the Company, upon written notice, to
immediately issue, in lieu of such cash damages, the number of shares of
Common Stock equal to the quotient of (X) the aggregate amount of the damages
payments described herein divided by (Y) the Conversion Price in effect on
such Conversion Date as specified by the Holder in the Conversion Notice or
in effect on the Company Delivery Date. In addition to the foregoing, if (i)
on the Share Delivery Date or (ii) on any Company Delivery Date, the Company
shall fail to issue and deliver a certificate to a Holder or credit such
Holders balance account with DTC for the number of shares of Common Stock to
which such Holder is entitled upon such Holders conversion or the Companys
Conversion, as applicable, of Preferred Shares, and if on or after such
Trading Day the Holder purchases (in an open market transaction or otherwise)
shares of Common Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by the Holder of
the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion that the Holder
anticipated receiving from the Company (a **"Buy-In"** ), then the Company
shall, within three (3) Trading Days after the Holders request and in the
Holders discretion, either (i) pay cash to the Holder in an amount equal to
the Holders total purchase price (including brokerage commissions and out-
of-pocket expenses, if any) for the shares of Common Stock so purchased (the
**"Buy-In Price"** ), at which point the Companys obligation to deliver such
certificate (and to issue such Common Stock) shall terminate, or (ii)
promptly honor its obligation to deliver to the Holder a certificate or
certificates representing such Common Stock and pay cash to the Holder in an
amount equal to the excess (if any) of the Buy-In Price over the product of
(A) such number of shares of Common Stock, times (B) the Closing Sale Price
on the Conversion Date or the Company Delivery Date, as applicable.

  

#### 

  

#### (B) _Void Conversion Notice; Adjustment of Conversion Price_. If for any
reason a Holder has not received all of the shares of Common Stock to which
such Holder is entitled prior to the 

  



        
   

  



  

#### sixth (6th) Trading Day after the Share Delivery Date or Company
Delivery Date, as applicable, with respect to a conversion of
Preferred Shares, then the Holder, upon written notice to the Company, with a
copy to the Transfer Agent, may void its Conversion Notice or any applicable
Company Conversion Notice, with respect to, and retain or have returned, as
the case may be, any Preferred Shares that have not been converted pursuant
to such Holders Conversion Notice or Company Conversion Notice; provided
that the voiding of a Holders Conversion Notice or Company Conversion
Notice, as applicable, shall not effect the Companys obligations to make any
payments which have accrued prior to the date of such notice pursuant to
Section 2(d)(v)(A) or otherwise. Thereafter, the Conversion Price of any
Preferred Shares returned or retained by the Holder for failure to timely
convert shall be adjusted to the lesser of (I) the Conversion Price relating
to the voided Conversion Notice or voided Company Conversion Notice, as
applicable, and (II) the lowest Weighted Average Price of the Common Stock
during the period beginning on the Conversion Date or Company Delivery Date,
as applicable, and ending on the date such Holder voided the
Conversion Notice or Company Conversion Notice, as applicable, subject to
further adjustment as provided in this Certificate of Designations.

  

#### 

  

#### (C) _Conversion Failure_. If for any reason a Holder has not
received all of the shares of Common Stock to which such Holder is entitled
prior to the tenth (10th) Trading Day after the Share Delivery Date or the
Company Delivery Date, as applicable, with respect to a conversion of
Preferred Shares (a " **Conversion Failure** "), then the Holder, upon written
notice to the Company, may require that the Company redeem all Preferred
Shares held by such Holder, including the Preferred Shares previously
submitted for conversion and with respect to which the Company has not
delivered shares of Common Stock, in accordance with Section 3.
 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Certificate
of Designations, a Holders exclusive remedies for the Companys failure
to deliver shares of Common Stock on any Share Delivery Date or any
Company Delivery Date shall be as set forth in Section 2(d)(v) and Section 3.

  

### 

  

### (vi) _Pro Rata Conversion_ _; Disputes_. Subject to Section 10, in the
event the Company receives a Conversion Notice from more than one Holder for
the same Conversion Date and the Company can convert some, but not all, of
such Preferred Shares, the Company shall convert from each Holder electing to
have Preferred Shares converted at such time a pro rata amount of such
Holders Preferred Shares submitted for conversion based on the number of
Preferred Shares submitted for conversion on such date by such Holder
relative to the number of Preferred Shares submitted for

  



        
   

  



  

### conversion on such date. In the event of a dispute as to the number of
shares of Common Stock issuable to a Holder in connection with a conversion
of Preferred Shares, the Company shall issue to such Holder the number of
shares of Common Stock not in dispute and resolve such dispute in accordance
with Section 2(d)(iii).

  

### 

  

### (vii) _Mandatory Redemption at Maturity_.

  

#### 

  

#### (A) If any Preferred Share remains outstanding on the Maturity Date, the
Company shall redeem such Preferred Share for an amount in cash per Preferred
Share (the " **Maturity Date Redemption Price** ") equal to the Conversion
Amount by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated in writing by such Holder.

  

#### 

  

#### (B) If the Company fails to redeem all of the Preferred Shares
outstanding on the Maturity Date by payment of the Maturity Date Redemption
Price for each such Preferred Share, then in addition to any remedy such
Holder may have under any Transaction Document, (1) the applicable Maturity
Date Redemption Price payable in respect of such unredeemed Preferred Shares
shall bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month, prorated for partial
months, until paid in full, and (2) any Holder shall have the option to
require the Company to convert any or all of such Holders Preferred Shares
and for which the Maturity Date Redemption Price has not been paid into (on a
per Preferred Share basis) shares of Common Stock equal to the number which
results from dividing the Maturity Date Redemption Price by the
Default Conversion Price. If the Company has failed to pay the Maturity Date
Redemption Price in a timely manner as described above, then the Maturity
Date shall be automatically extended for any Preferred Shares until the date
the Holders receive such shares of Common Stock or Maturity Date Redemption
Price and shall be further extended for any Preferred Shares for as long as
(x) the conversion of such Preferred Shares would violate the provisions of
Section 7 or (y) a Triggering Event or an event that with the passage of time
or giving of notice would constitute a Triggering Event shall have occurred
and be continuing.

  

#### 

  

#### (C) Other than as specifically permitted by this Certificate of
Designations, the Company may not redeem any of the outstanding Preferred
Shares and any unpaid Dividends thereon.

  

### 

  

### (viii) _Book-Entry_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein, upon conversion of Preferred Shares in accordance with the
terms hereof, the Holder thereof shall not be required to physically
surrender the certificate representing the Preferred Shares to the Company

  



        
   

  



  

### unless (A) the full or remaining number of Preferred Shares represented
by the certificate are being converted or (B) a Holder has provided the
Company with prior written notice (which notice may be included in a
Conversion Notice) requesting reissuance of Preferred Shares upon physical
surrender of any Preferred Shares.  The Holder and the Company shall maintain
records showing the number of Preferred Shares so converted and the dates of
such conversions or shall use such other method, reasonably satisfactory to
the Holder and the Company, so as not to require physical surrender of the
certificate representing the Preferred Shares upon each such conversion. In
the event of any dispute or discrepancy, such records of the Company
establishing the number of Preferred Shares to which the record holder is
entitled shall be controlling and determinative in the absence of manifest
error. In connection with any transfer of all or any portion of Preferred
Shares held by any Holder, such Holder may physically surrender the
certificate representing the Preferred Shares to the Company, whereupon the
Company will forthwith issue and deliver upon the order of such Holder a new
certificate or certificates of like tenor, registered as such Holder
may request, representing in the aggregate the remaining number of Preferred
Shares represented by such certificate. A Holder and any assignee, by
acceptance of a certificate, acknowledge and agree that, by reason of the
provisions of this paragraph, following conversion of any Preferred Shares,
the number of Preferred Shares represented by such certificate may be less
than the number of Preferred Shares stated on the face thereof. Each
certificate for Preferred Shares shall bear the following legend:

  



  

ANY TRANSFEREE OF THIS CERTIFICATE SHOULD CAREFULLY REVIEW THE TERMS OF THE
COMPANYS CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATIONS RELATING TO THE PREFERRED SHARES
REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE, INCLUDING SECTION 2(d)(viii) THEREOF. THE
NUMBER OF PREFERRED SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE MAY BE LESS THAN
THE NUMBER OF PREFERRED SHARES STATED ON THE FACE HEREOF PURSUANT TO SECTION
2(d)(viii) OF THE CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATIONS RELATING TO THE PREFERRED
SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE.

  

### 

  

### (ix) _Conversion at the Company s Election_. On any date (the "
**Conversion Election Date** "), so long as (A) the Equity Conditions shall
have been satisfied or waived in writing by the applicable Holder from and
including the date of the Company Conversion Election Notice (as defined
below) through and including the Company Election Conversion Date (as

  



        
   

  



  

### defined below) and (B) on any twenty (20) out of thirty (30) consecutive
Trading Days immediately preceding the date of the Company Conversion
Election Notice, the Weighted Average Price of the Common Stock exceeds 175%
of the Conversion Price (as adjusted for any stock dividend, stock split,
stock combination or other similar transaction during such period), the
Company shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to require that some or
all of the outstanding Preferred Shares be converted (the " **Company
Conversion Election** ") at the applicable Conversion Rate; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company may not consummate more than one (1) Company
Conversion in any thirty (30) Trading Day period. The Company shall exercise
its right to Company Conversion Election by providing each Holder written
notice (" **Company Conversion Notice** ") by facsimile and overnight courier
on the Conversion Election Date. The date on which each of such
Holders actually receives the Company Conversion Election Notice is referred
to herein as the " **Company Conversion Election Notice Date**." If the
Company elects to require conversion of some, but not all, of such Preferred
Shares then outstanding, the Company shall require conversion of an amount
from each Holder equal to the product of (I) the total number of Preferred
Shares which the Company has elected to convert multiplied by (II) such
Holders Allocation Percentage (such amount with respect to each Holder of
such Preferred Shares being referred to herein as its " **Pro
Rata Conversion Amount** "). In the event that any initial Holder of the
Preferred Shares shall sell or otherwise transfer any of such Holders
Preferred Shares, the transferee shall be allocated a pro rata portion of
such Holders Allocation Percentage. The Company Conversion Election Notice
shall indicate (x) the aggregate number of such Preferred Shares the Company
has selected for conversion, (y) the date selected by the Company
for conversion (the " **Company Delivery Date** "), which date shall be not
less than twenty (20) Trading Days or more than sixty (60) Trading Days after
the Company Conversion Election Notice Date, and (z) each Holders Pro Rata
Conversion Amount.  Subject to the satisfaction of all the conditions of this
Section 2(d)(ix), on the Company Election Conversion Date each Holder of
Preferred Shares selected for conversion will be deemed to have submitted a
Conversion Notice in accordance with Section 2(d)(i) for a number of
Preferred Shares equal to such Holders Pro Rata Conversion Amount.
Notwithstanding the above, any Holder may convert such shares (including
Preferred Shares selected for conversion hereunder which shall reduce such
Holders Pro Rata Conversion Amount) into Common Stock pursuant to Section
2(b) on or prior to the date immediately preceding the Company Election
Conversion Date. If the Company fails to convert any Conversion Amount on the
applicable Company Election Conversion Date, then each Holder shall be
entitled to the remedies set forth in Section 2(d)(v).

  

## 

        
   

  



  

## (e) _Taxes_.

  



  

### (i) Any and all payments made by the Company hereunder, including any
amounts received on a conversion or redemption of the Preferred Shares and
any amounts on account of dividends or deemed dividends, must be made by it
without any Tax Deduction, unless a Tax Deduction is required by law. If the
Company is aware that it must make a Tax Deduction (or that there is a change
in the rate or the basis of a Tax Deduction), it must notify the affected
Holders promptly.

  

### 

  

### (ii) If a Tax Deduction is required by law to be made by the Company,
subject to Section 2(e)(i) above, the amount of the payment due from the
Company will be increased to an amount which (after making the Tax Deduction
including a Tax Deduction applicable to additional sums payable pursuant to
this Section 2(e)) leaves an amount equal to the payment which would have
been due if no Tax Deduction had been required. If the Company is required to
make a Tax Deduction, it must make the minimum Tax Deduction allowed by law
and must make any payment required in connection with that Tax Deduction
within the time allowed by law.

  



  

As soon as practicable after making a Tax Deduction or a payment required in
connection with a Tax Deduction, the Company must deliver to the Holder any
official receipt or form, if any, provided by or required by the taxing
authority to whom the Tax Deduction was paid.

  



  

### (iii) In addition, the Company agrees to pay in accordance with
applicable law any present or future stamp or documentary taxes or any other
excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies that arise from any
payment made hereunder or in connection with the execution, delivery,
registration or performance of, or otherwise with respect to, the Preferred
Shares (" **Other Taxes** "). As soon as practicable after making a
payment of Other Taxes, the Company must deliver to such Holder any official
receipt or form, if any, provided by or required by the taxing authority to
whom the Tax Deduction was paid.

  

### 

  

### (iv) The obligations of the Company under this Section 2(e) shall survive
the Maturity Date of the Preferred Shares and the payment for the Preferred
Shares and all other amounts payable hereunder.

  

## 

  

## (f) _Adjustments to Conversion Price_. The Conversion Price will
be subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in this Section 2(f).

  

### 

  

### (i) _Adjustment of Conversion Price upon Issuance of Common Stock_.
Subject to the immediately following sentence which relates to issuances
occurring within the first nine months following the Initial Issuance Date,
if and whenever after the Initial Issuance Date, the Company issues or sells,
or in accordance with this Section 2(f)(i) is deemed to have issued or sold,
any shares of Common Stock (including

  



        
   

  



  

### the issuance or sale of shares of Common Stock owned or held by or for
the account of the Company, but excluding shares of Common Stock deemed to
have been issued or sold by the Company in connection with any Excluded
Security) for a consideration per share less than a price (" **Applicable
Price** ") **** equal to the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to
such issue or sale (the foregoing a " **Dilutive Issuance** "), then
immediately after such Dilutive Issuance, the Conversion Price then in effect
shall be reduced to an amount equal to the Adjusted Price. After the Initial
Issuance Date and prior to the nine (9) month anniversary of the Initial
Issuance Date, the "Applicable Price" with respect to any issuance or sale by
the Company of Common Stock (including the issuance or sale of shares of
Common Stock owned or held by or for the account of the Company, but
excluding shares of Common Stock deemed to have been issued or sold by the
Company in connection with any Excluded Security) shall be the Market Price;
provided that, without the prior written consent of the Required Holders,
during such nine (9) month period, the Company shall not issue Common Stock
for which it receives proceeds (net of offering expenses, discounts and fees)
of more than Thirty Million Dollars ($30,000,000) at a gross per share price
below the Market Price. For purposes of determining the adjusted Conversion
Price under this Section 2(f)(i), the following shall be applicable:

  

#### 

  

#### (A) _Issuance of Options_. If the Company in any manner grants or
sells any Options and the lowest price per share for which one share of
Common Stock is issuable upon the exercise of any such Option or upon
conversion or exchange or exercise of any Convertible Securities issuable
upon exercise of such Option is less than the Applicable Price, then each
such share of Common Stock underlying such Option shall be deemed to be
outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the Company at the time of
the granting or sale of such Option for such price per share. For purposes
of this Section 2(f)(i)(A), the "lowest price per share for which one share
of Common Stock is issuable upon the exercise of any such Option or upon
conversion or exchange or exercise of any Convertible Securities
issuable upon exercise of such Option" shall be equal to the sum of the
lowest amounts of consideration (if any) received or receivable by the
Company with respect to any one share of Common Stock upon granting or sale
of the Option, upon exercise of the Option and upon conversion or exchange or
exercise of any Convertible Security issuable upon exercise of such Option.
No further adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made upon the actual
issuance of such share of Common Stock or of such Convertible Securities upon
the exercise of such Options or upon the actual issuance of such Common Stock
upon conversion or exchange or exercise of such Convertible Securities.

  



         
 

  



  

#### (B) _Issuance of Convertible Securities_. If the Company in any manner
issues or sells any Convertible Securities and the lowest price per share for
which one share of Common Stock is issuable upon such conversion or exchange
or exercise thereof is less than the Applicable Price, then each such share
of Common Stock underlying such Convertible Securities shall be deemed to be
outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the Company at the time of
the issuance or sale of such Convertible Securities for such price per share.
For the purposes of this Section 2(f)(i)(B), the "lowest price per share for
which one share of Common Stock is issuable upon such conversion or exchange
or exercise" shall be equal to the sum of the lowest amounts of consideration
(if any) received or receivable by the Company with respect to any one share
of Common Stock upon the issuance or sale of the Convertible Security and
upon the conversion or exchange or exercise of such Convertible Security. No
further adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made upon the actual
issuance of such share of Common Stock upon conversion or exchange or
exercise of such Convertible Securities, and if any such issue or sale of
such Convertible Securities is made upon exercise of any Options for which
adjustment of the Conversion Price had been or are to be made pursuant to
other provisions of this Section 2(f)(i), no further adjustment of the
Conversion Price shall be made by reason of such issue or sale.

  

#### 

  

#### (C) _Change in Option Price or Rate of Conversion_. If the purchase price
provided for in any Options, the additional consideration, if any, payable
upon the issue, conversion, exchange or exercise of any Convertible
Securities, or the rate at which any Convertible Securities are convertible
into or exchangeable or exercisable for Common Stock changes at any time, the
Conversion Price in effect at the time of such change shall be adjusted to
the Conversion Price which would have been in effect at such time had such
Options or Convertible Securities provided for such changed purchase price,
additional consideration or changed conversion rate, as the case may be, at
the time initially granted, issued or sold.  For purposes of this Section
2(f)(i)(C), if the terms of any Option or Convertible Security that was
outstanding as of the Subscription Date are changed in the manner described
in the immediately preceding sentence, then such Option or Convertible
Security and the Common Stock deemed issuable upon exercise, conversion or
exchange thereof shall be deemed to have been issued as of the date of such
change. No adjustment shall be made if such adjustment would result in an
increase of the Conversion Price then in effect.

  



        
   

  



  

#### (D) _Calculation of Consideration Received_. In case any Option is issued
in connection with the issue or sale of other securities of the Company,
together comprising one integrated transaction in which no specific
consideration is allocated to such Options by the parties thereto, the
Options will be deemed to have been issued for a consideration of $0.01.
If any Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities are issued or sold
or deemed to have been issued or sold for cash, the consideration
received therefor will be deemed to be the net amount received by the
Company therefor. If any Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities are
issued or sold for a consideration other than cash, the amount of the
consideration other than cash received by the Company will be the fair value
of such consideration, except where such consideration consists of publicly
traded securities, in which case the amount of consideration received by the
Company will be the Closing Sale Price of such securities on the date of
receipt of such securities. If any Common Stock, Options or
Convertible Securities are issued to the owners of the non-surviving entity
in connection with any merger in which the Company is the surviving entity,
the amount of consideration therefor will be deemed to be the fair value of
such portion of the net assets and business of the non-surviving entity as is
attributable to such Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities, as the
case may be. The fair value of any consideration other than cash or publicly
traded securities will be determined jointly by the Company and the Required
Holders. If such parties are unable to reach agreement within ten (10) days
after the occurrence of an event requiring valuation (the " **Valuation
Event** "), the fair value of such consideration will be determined within
ten (10) Business Days after the tenth (10th) day following the Valuation
Event by an independent, reputable appraiser jointly selected by the Company
and the Required Holders.  The determination of such appraiser shall be
deemed binding upon all parties absent manifest error and the fees and
expenses of such appraiser shall be borne by the Company.

  

#### 

  

#### (E) _Record Date_.  If the Company takes a record of the holders of
Common Stock for the purpose of entitling them (I) to receive a dividend or
other distribution payable in Common Stock, Options or in Convertible
Securities or (II) to subscribe for or purchase Common Stock, Options or
Convertible Securities, then such record date will be deemed to be the date
of the issue or sale of the shares of Common Stock deemed to have been issued
or sold upon the declaration of such dividend or the making of such other
distribution or the date of the granting of such right of subscription or
purchase, as the case may be.

  



        
   

  



  

### (ii) _Adjustment of Conversion Price upon Subdivision or Combination of
Common Stock_. If the Company at any time after the Subscription Date
subdivides (by any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or
otherwise) its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of
shares, the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such subdivision
will be proportionately reduced. If the Company at any time after
the Subscription Date combines (by combination, reverse stock split or
otherwise) its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of
shares and the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such
combination will be proportionately increased.

  

### 

  

### (iii) _Other Events_. If any event occurs of the type contemplated by
the provisions of this Section 2(f) but not expressly provided for by such
provisions (including, without limitation, the granting of stock appreciation
rights, phantom stock rights or other rights with equity features), then the
Companys Board of Directors will make an appropriate adjustment in the
Conversion Price so as to protect the rights of the Holders; provided that no
such adjustment will increase the Conversion Price as otherwise determined
pursuant to this Section 2(f).

  

## 

  

## (g) _Notices_.

  

### 

  

### (i) Immediately upon any adjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to
Section 2(f), the Company will give written notice thereof to each Holder,
setting forth in reasonable detail, and certifying, the calculation of such
adjustment. In the case of a dispute as to the determination of such
adjustment, then such dispute shall be resolved in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Section 2(d)(iii).

  

### 

  

### (ii) The Company will give written notice to each Holder at least ten
(10) Business Days prior to the date on which the Company closes its books or
takes a record (I) with respect to any dividend or distribution upon the
Common Stock, (II) with respect to any pro rata subscription offer to holders
of Common Stock or (III) for determining rights to vote with respect to any
Fundamental Transaction or Liquidation Event, provided that such information
shall be made known to the public prior to or in conjunction with such notice
being provided to such Holder.

  

### 

  

### (iii) The Company will also give written notice to each Holder at least
ten (10) Business Days prior to the date on which any Fundamental Transaction
or Liquidation Event will take place, provided that such information shall be
made known to the public prior to or in conjunction with such notice being
provided to such Holder.

  

## 

  

## (h) _Additional Preferred Shares; Variable Securities; Dilutive
Issuances_. For so long as any Preferred Shares are outstanding, the Company
will not, without the prior written consent of the Required Holders, issue
any Preferred

  



        
   

  



  

## Shares and the Company shall not issue any other securities that would
cause a breach or default under this Certificate of Designations. For so long
as any Preferred Shares remain outstanding, the Company shall not, in any
manner, issue or sell any rights, warrants or options to subscribe for or
purchase Common Stock or directly or indirectly convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for Common Stock at a conversion, exchange or
exercise price which varies or may vary after issuance with the market price
of the Common Stock, including by way of one or more reset(s) to any fixed
price unless the conversion, exchange or exercise price of any such security
cannot be less than the then applicable Conversion Price with respect to the
Common Stock into which any Preferred Shares are convertible.

  

# 

  

# (3) _Redemption at Option of Holders_.

  

## 

  

## (a) _Triggering Event_.  A " **Triggering Event** " shall be deemed to
have occurred at such time as any of the following events:

  

### 

  

### (i) the suspension from trading or failure of the Common Stock to be
listed on a Principal Market for a period of ten (10) consecutive Trading
Days or for more than an aggregate of twenty (20) Trading Days in any 365-day
period;

  

### 

  

### (ii) the Companys (A) failure to cure a Conversion Failure by delivery
of the required number of shares of Common Stock within ten (10) Business
Days after the applicable Conversion Date or (B) notice, written or oral, to
any Holder, including by way of public announcement, or through any of its
agents, at any time, of its intention not to comply, as required, with a
request for conversion of any Preferred Shares into shares of Common Stock
that is tendered in accordance with the provisions of this Certificate of
Designations;

  

### 

  

### (iii) the Companys failure to pay to the Holder any amounts when and as
due pursuant to this Certificate of Designations, only if such failure
continues for a period of at least five (5) Business Days;

  

### 

  

### (iv) the entry by a court having jurisdiction in the premises of (i) a
decree or order for relief in respect of the Company or any Subsidiary of a
voluntary case or proceeding under any applicable Federal or State
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or (ii) a decree
or order adjudging the Company or any Subsidiary as bankrupt or insolvent, or
approving as properly filed a petition seeking reorganization, arrangement,
adjustment or composition of or in respect of the Company or any Subsidiary
under any applicable Federal or State law or (iii) appointing a custodian,
receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator or other similar
official of the Company or any Subsidiary or of any substantial part of its
property, or ordering the winding up or liquidation of its affairs, and the
continuance of any such decree or order for relief or any

  



        
   

  



  

### such other decree or order unstayed and in effect for a period of 60
consecutive days;

  

### 

  

### (v) the commencement by the Company or any Subsidiary of a voluntary case
or proceeding under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization or other similar law or of any other case or proceeding to be
adjudicated a bankrupt or insolvent, or the consent by it to the entry of a
decree or order for relief in respect of the Company or any Subsidiary in an
involuntary case or proceeding under any applicable Federal or State
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or to the
commencement of any bankruptcy or insolvency case or proceeding against it,
or the filing by it of a petition or answer or consent seeking reorganization
or relief under any applicable Federal or State law, or the consent by it to
the filing of such petition or to the appointment of or taking possession by
a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator or other
similar official of the Company or any Subsidiary or of any substantial part
of its property, or the making by it of an assignment for the benefit of
creditors, or the admission by it in writing of its inability to pay its
debts generally as they become due, or the taking of corporate action by the
Company or any Subsidiary in furtherance of any such action; or

  

### 

  

### (vi) any event of default occurs with respect to any Indebtedness, and
any applicable grace periods in such Indebtedness with respect to such event
of default shall have expired; provided that if such event of default is
waived by the holders of such Indebtedness prior to any Holder taking any
action pursuant to this Certificate of Designations, no Triggering Event
under this clause (vi) shall be deemed to have occurred.

  

## 

  

## (b) _Redemption Option Upon Triggering Event_. In addition to all other
rights of the Holders contained herein, after a Triggering Event, each Holder
shall have the right, at such Holders option, to require the Company to
redeem all or a portion of such Holders Preferred Shares at a price per
Preferred Share equal to the greater of (i) 125% of the Conversion Amount and
(ii) the product of (A) the Conversion Rate in effect at such time as such
Holder delivers a Notice of Redemption at Option of Holder (as defined below)
and (B) the greater of the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock on the
Trading Day immediately preceding such Triggering Event, the Closing Sale
Price of the Common Stock on the day immediately following such Triggering
Event and the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock on the date the Holder
delivers the Notice of Redemption at Option of Holder (the " **Redemption
Price** ").

  

## 

  

## (c) _Mechanics of Redemption at Option of Holder_. Within one (1) Business
Day after the occurrence of a qualifying Triggering Event, the Company shall
deliver written notice thereof via facsimile and overnight courier ("
**Notice of Triggering Event** ") to each Holder. At any time after the
earlier of a Holders receipt of a Notice of Triggering Event and such Holder
becoming aware of a

  



        
   

  



  

## Triggering Event, any Holder of Preferred Shares then outstanding may
require the Company to redeem up to all of such Holders Preferred Shares by
delivering written notice thereof via facsimile and overnight courier ("
**Notice of Redemption at Option of Holder** ") to the Company, which Notice
of Redemption at Option of Holder shall indicate the number of Preferred
Shares that such Holder is electing to redeem.

  

## 

  

## (d) _Payment of Redemption Price_. Upon the Companys receipt of a
Notice(s) of Redemption at Option of Holder from any Holder, the Company
shall within one (1) Business Day of such receipt notify each other Holder by
facsimile of the Companys receipt of such notice(s). The Company shall
deliver on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the Companys receipt of the
first Notice of Redemption at Option of Holder the applicable Redemption
Price (the " **Triggering Event Redemption Date** ") to all Holders
that deliver a Notice of Redemption at Option of Holder prior to the fifth
(5th) Business Day after the Companys receipt of the first Notice of
Redemption at Option of Holder. To the extent redemptions required by this
Section 3 are deemed or determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
prepayments of the Preferred Shares by the Company, such redemptions shall be
deemed to be voluntary prepayments. If the Company is unable to redeem all of
the Preferred Shares submitted for redemption, the Company shall (i) redeem a
pro rata amount from each Holder based on the number of Preferred
Shares submitted for redemption by such Holder relative to the total number
of Preferred Shares submitted for redemption by all Holders and (ii)
in addition to any remedy such Holder may have under this Certificate
of Designations, pay to each Holder interest at the rate of one and one-
half percent (1.5%) per month (prorated for partial months) in respect of
each unredeemed Preferred Share until paid in full.  The Holders and Company
agree that in the event of the Companys redemption of any Preferred Shares
under this Section 3, the Holders damages would be uncertain and difficult
to estimate because of the parties inability to predict future interest
rates and the uncertainty of the availability of a suitable substitute
investment opportunity for the Holders. Accordingly, any redemption premium
due under this Section 3 is intended by the parties to be, and shall be
deemed, a reasonable estimate of the Holders actual loss of its investment
opportunity and not as a penalty.

  

## 

  

## (e) _Void Redemption_.  In the event that the Company does not pay the
Redemption Price within the time period set forth in Section 3(d), at any
time thereafter and until the Company pays such unpaid applicable Redemption
Price in full, a Holder shall have the option to, in lieu of redemption,
require the Company to promptly return to such Holder any or all of the
Preferred Shares that were submitted for redemption by such Holder under this
Section 3 and for which the applicable Redemption Price has not been paid, by
sending written notice thereof to the Company via facsimile (the "
**Void Optional Redemption Notice** ").  Upon the Companys receipt of such
Void Optional Redemption Notice, (i) the Notice of Redemption at Option of
Holder shall be null and void with respect to those Preferred Shares subject
to the Void Optional Redemption Notice, (ii) the Company shall immediately
return any Preferred Shares subject to the Void

  



        
   

  



  

## Optional Redemption Notice, and (iii) the Conversion Price of such
returned Preferred Shares shall be adjusted to the lesser of (A) the
Conversion Price as in effect on the date on which the Void Optional
Redemption Notice is delivered to the Company and (B) the lowest Weighted
Average Price of the Common Stock during the period beginning on the date on
which the Notice of Redemption at Option of Holder is delivered to the
Company and ending on the date on which the Void Optional Redemption Notice
is delivered to the Company.

  

## 

  

## (f) _Disputes; Miscellaneous_. In the event of a dispute as to
the determination of the arithmetic calculation of the Redemption Price,
such dispute shall be resolved pursuant to Section 2(d)(iii) above with the
term "Redemption Price" being substituted for the term "Conversion Rate". A
Holders delivery of a Void Optional Redemption Notice and exercise of its
rights following such notice shall not effect the Companys obligations to
make any payments which have accrued prior to the date of such notice. In the
event of a redemption pursuant to this Section 3 of less than all of
the Preferred Shares represented by a particular Preferred Stock Certificate,
the Company shall promptly cause to be issued and delivered to the Holder of
such Preferred Shares a Preferred Stock Certificate representing the
remaining Preferred Shares which have not been redeemed, if necessary.

  

# 

  

# (4) _Other Rights of Holders_.

  

## 

  

## (a) _Assumption_. The Company shall not enter into or be party to a
Fundamental Transaction unless (i) the Successor Entity assumes in writing
(with the purchase of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of the
Companys Common Stock automatically constituting an assumption in writing)
all of the obligations of the Company under this Certificate of Designations
and the other Transaction Documents in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 4(a) pursuant to written agreements in form and substance
satisfactory to the Required Holders and approved by the Required Holders
prior to such Fundamental Transaction, including agreements to deliver to
each Holder of Preferred Shares in exchange for such Preferred Shares a
security of the Successor Entity evidenced by a written instrument
substantially similar in form and substance to this Certificate of
Designations including, without limitation, having a stated value and
dividend rate equal to the stated value and dividend rate of the Preferred
Shares held by such Holder and having similar ranking to the Preferred
Shares, and satisfactory to the Required Holders and (ii) the Successor
Entity (including its Parent Entity) is a publicly traded corporation whose
common stock is quoted on or listed for trading on the Principal Market or an
Eligible Market. Upon the occurrence of any Fundamental Transaction, the
Successor Entity shall succeed to, and be substituted for (so that from and
after the date of such Fundamental Transaction, the provisions of this
Certificate of Designations referring to the "Company" shall refer instead to
the Successor Entity), and may exercise every right and power of the Company
and shall assume all of the obligations of the Company under this Certificate
of Designations with the same effect as if such Successor Entity had been
named as the Company herein. Upon consummation

  



        
   

  



  

## of the Fundamental Transaction, the Successor Entity shall deliver to the
Holder confirmation that there shall be issued upon conversion of the
Preferred Shares at any time after the consummation of the Fundamental
Transaction, in lieu of the shares of Common Stock (or other securities,
cash, assets or other property) issuable upon the conversion of the Preferred
Shares prior to such Fundamental Transaction, such shares of publicly traded
common stock (or their equivalent) of the Successor Entity, as adjusted in
accordance with the provisions of this Certificate of Designations.
The provisions of this Section shall apply similarly and equally to
successive Fundamental Transactions and shall be applied without regard to
any limitations on the conversion of the Preferred Shares.

  

## 

  

## (b) _Purchase Rights_.  If at any time the Company grants, issues or sells
any Options, Convertible Securities or rights to purchase stock, warrants,
securities or other property pro rata to the record holders of any class of
Common Stock (the " **Purchase Rights** "), then the Holders will be
entitled to acquire, upon the terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the
aggregate Purchase Rights which such Holder could have acquired if such
Holder had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete
conversion of the Preferred Shares (without taking into account
any limitations or restrictions on the convertibility of the Preferred
Shares) immediately before the date on which a record is taken for the grant,
issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights, or, if no such record is taken, the
date as of which the record holders of Common Stock are to be determined for
the grant, issue or sale of such Purchase Rights.

  

## 

  

## (c) _Asset Sales_.

  

### 

  

### (i) Promptly after the occurrence of an Asset Sale, the Company shall
deliver written notice thereof via facsimile and overnight courier (an "
**Asset Sale Notice** ") to each of the Holders. At any time after the
receipt of the Asset Sale Notice, a Holder may require the Company to redeem,
with the Available Asset Sale Proceeds all or any portion of the Preferred
Shares held by such Holder by delivering written notice thereof (the "
**Asset** **Sale Redemption Notice** ") to the Company, which Asset Sale
Redemption Notice shall indicate the number of such Preferred Shares such
Holder is electing to redeem; provided that if the aggregate number amount of
Preferred Shares to be redeemed from such Holder and the other Holders with
the cash proceeds of an Asset Sale exceed the Available Asset Sale Proceeds
for such Asset Sale, the Company shall redeem the Preferred Shares presented
for redemption on a pro rata basis with such proceeds. Each Preferred Share
subject to redemption by the Company pursuant to this Section 8(e) shall be
redeemed by the Company at a price equal to at a price per Preferred Share
equal to the greater of (i) the Conversion Amount and (ii) the product of (A)
the Conversion Rate in effect at such time as such Holder delivers an Asset
Sale Redemption Notice and (B) the greater of the Closing Sale Price of
the Common Stock on the Trading Day following such Asset Sale and the Closing
Sale Price of the Common Stock on the date the Holder delivers the Asset Sale

  



        
   

  



  

### Redemption Notice (the " **Asset Sale Redemption Price** "). The Company
shall deliver on the fifth (5th) Business Day (the " **Asset Sale Redemption
Date** ") after the Companys receipt of the first Asset Sale Redemption
Notice the applicable Asset Sale Redemption Price to all Holders that deliver
a Asset Sale Redemption Notice prior to such fifth (5th) Business Day after
the Companys receipt of the first Asset Sale Redemption Notice.

  

### 

  

### (ii) For so long as any Preferred Shares are outstanding, the Company
shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, directly or
indirectly, consummate any Asset Sale unless the Company (or the applicable
Subsidiary, as the case may be) receives consideration at the time of the
Asset Sale at least equal to the fair market value of the assets or Equity
Interests issued or sold or otherwise disposed of.

  

# 

  

# (5) _Reservation of Shares_.

  

## 

  

## (a) The Company shall have sufficient authorized and unissued shares of
Common Stock for each of the Preferred Shares equal to 130% of the number of
shares of Common Stock necessary to effect the conversion at the Conversion
Rate with respect to the Conversion Amount of each such Preferred Share as of
the date hereof. The Company shall, so long as any of the Preferred Shares
are outstanding, take all action necessary to reserve and keep available out
of its authorized and unissued Common Stock, solely for the purpose of
effecting the conversions of the Preferred Shares, such number of shares of
Common Stock as shall from time to time be necessary to effect the conversion
of all of the Preferred Shares then outstanding; provided that at no time
shall the number of shares of Common Stock so reserved shall at no time be
less than 130% of the number of shares of Common Stock for which
the Preferred Shares are at any time convertible (without regard to any
limitations on conversions); provided that at no time shall the number of
shares of Common Stock so reserved be less than the number of shares required
to be reserved by reason of the previous sentence (without regard to any
limitations on conversions) (the " **Required Reserve Amount** ").  The
initial number of shares of Common Stock reserved for conversions of the
Preferred Shares and each increase in the number of shares so reserved shall
be allocated pro rata among the Holders based on the number of
Preferred Shares held by each Holder at the time of issuance of the Preferred
Shares or increase in the number of reserved shares, as the case may be (the
" **Authorized Share Allocation** "). In the event a Holder shall sell or
otherwise transfer any of such Holders Preferred Shares, each transferee
shall be allocated a pro rata portion of the number of reserved shares of
Common Stock reserved for such transferor. Any shares of Common Stock
reserved and allocated to any Person which ceases to hold any Preferred
Shares (other than pursuant to a transfer of Preferred Shares in accordance
with the immediately preceding sentence) shall be allocated to the remaining
Holders of Preferred Shares, pro rata based on the number of Preferred Shares
then held by such Holders.

  

## 

  

## (b) _Insufficient Authorized Shares_. If at any time while any of the
Preferred Shares remain outstanding the Company does not have a sufficient
number of

  



        
   

  



  

## authorized and unreserved shares of Common Stock to satisfy its obligation
to reserve for issuance upon conversion of the Preferred Shares at least a
number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Required Reserve Amount (an "
**Authorized Share Failure** "), then the Company shall immediately take all
action necessary to increase the Companys authorized shares of Common Stock
to an amount sufficient to allow the Company to reserve the Required Reserve
Amount for the Preferred Shares then outstanding. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing sentence, as soon as practicable after the
date of the occurrence of an Authorized Share Failure, but in no event later
than ninety (90) days after the occurrence of such Authorized Share Failure,
the Company shall hold a meeting of its stockholders for the approval of
an increase in the number of authorized shares of Common Stock. In connection
with such meeting, the Company shall provide each stockholder with a proxy
statement and shall use its best efforts to solicit its stockholders
approval of such increase in authorized shares of Common Stock and to cause
its board of directors to recommend to the stockholders that they approve
such proposal.

  

# 

  

# (6) _Voting Rights_. Subject to Sections 7 and 10, each Holder shall be
entitled to the whole number of votes equal to the lesser of (i) the number
of shares of Common Stock into which such Holders Preferred Shares would be
convertible based on the Conversion Price on the record date for the vote or
consent of stockholders, and shall otherwise have voting rights and powers
equal to the voting rights and powers of the Common Stock and (ii) the number
of shares of Common Stock into which such Holders Preferred Shares would be
convertible if the Conversion Price on the record date for the vote
or consent of stockholders is deemed to be the Market Price. Each Holder
shall be entitled to receive the same prior notice of any stockholders
meeting as is provided to the holders of Common Stock in accordance with the
bylaws of the Company, as well as prior notice of all stockholder actions to
be taken by legally available means in lieu of a meeting, and shall vote as a
class with the holders of Common Stock as if they were a single class of
securities upon any matter submitted to a vote of stockholders, except those
matters required by law or by the terms hereof to be submitted to a class
vote of the Holders of Preferred Shares, in which case the Holders of
Preferred Shares only shall vote as a separate class.

  

# 

  

# (7) _[Limitation on Beneficial Ownership_. The Company shall not effect
any conversion of Preferred Shares, and no Holder shall have the right to
convert any Preferred Shares, to the extent that after giving effect to such
conversion, the beneficial owner of such shares (together with such Persons
affiliates) would have acquired, through conversion of Preferred Shares or
otherwise, beneficial ownership of a number of shares of Common Stock that
exceeds the percentage set forth opposite each Holders name in column (8)
of the Schedule of Buyers to the Securities Purchase Agreement (" **Maximum
Percentage** ") of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately after giving effect to such conversion. The Company shall not
give effect to any voting rights of the Preferred Shares, and any Holder
shall not have the right to exercise voting rights with respect to any
Preferred Shares pursuant hereto, to the extent that giving effect to such
voting rights would result in such Holder (together with its affiliates)
being deemed to beneficially own in excess of the Maximum Percentage of the
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect
to such exercise, assuming such exercise as being equivalent to conversion.
For purposes of the foregoing, the number of shares of Common Stock
beneficially owned by a Person and its affiliates shall include the number of
shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Shares

  



         
 

  



  

# with respect to which the determination of such sentence is being made, but
shall exclude the number of shares of Common Stock which would be issuable
upon (A) conversion of the remaining, nonconverted Preferred Shares
beneficially owned by such Person or any of its affiliates and (B) exercise
or conversion of the unexercised or unconverted portion of any other
securities of the Company (including, without limitation, any notes or
warrants) subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the
limitation contained in this Section beneficially owned by such Person or any
of its affiliates.  Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, for
purposes of this Section 7, beneficial ownership shall be calculated in
accordance with Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended. For purposes of this Section 7, in determining the number of
outstanding shares of Common Stock, a Holder may rely on the number of
outstanding shares of Common Stock as reflected in (1) the Companys most
recent Form 10-K, Form 10-KSB, Form 10-Q, Form 10-QSB or Form 8-K, as the
case may be, (2) a more recent public announcement by the Company, or (3) any
other notice by the Company or the Transfer Agent setting forth the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding. For any reason at any time, upon the
written request of any Holder, the Company shall within one (1) Business
Day following the receipt of such notice, confirm orally and in writing to
any such Holder the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding. In any
case, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be determined
after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the
Company, including the Preferred Shares, by such Holder and its affiliates
since the date as of which such number of outstanding shares of Common Stock
was reported. By written notice to the Company, the Holder may from time to
time increase or decrease the Maximum Percentage to any other percentage not
in excess of 9.99% specified in such notice; provided that (i) any such
increase will not be effective until the sixty-first (61st) day after such
notice is delivered to the Company, and (ii) any such increase or decrease
will apply only to the Holder providing such written notice and not to any
other Holder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Holder has elected "no
limit" in column (8) of the Schedule of Buyers to the Securities Purchase
Agreement, the limitations set forth in this Section 7 shall not be
applicable to such Holder.]

# (8) _Change of Control Redemption Right; Liquidation, Dissolution, Winding-
Up_.

  

## 

  

## (a) _Change of Control_. No sooner than fifteen (15) days nor later than
ten (10) days prior to the consummation of a Change of Control, but not prior
to the public announcement of such Change of Control, the Company shall
deliver written notice thereof via facsimile and overnight courier to the
Holders (a " **Change of Control** **Notice** "). At any time during the
period (the " **Change of Control Period** ") beginning after a Holders
receipt of a Change of Control Notice and ending on the date that is twenty
(20) Trading Days after the consummation of such Change of Control,
such Eligible Holder may require the Company to redeem all or any portion of
such Holders Preferred Shares by delivering written notice thereof ("
**Change of Control Redemption Notice** ") to the Company, which Change of
Control Redemption Notice shall indicate the Conversion Amount the Holder is
electing to redeem. Any Preferred Shares subject to redemption pursuant to
this Section 8 shall be redeemed by the Company in cash at a price equal to
the greater of (i) the product of (A) the Change of Control Redemption
Premium and (B) the Conversion Amount being redeemed and (ii) (1) the product
of (A) the Conversion Amount being redeemed

  



        
   

  



  

## multiplied by (B) the quotient determined by dividing (I) the aggregate
cash consideration and the aggregate cash value of any non-cash consideration
per share of Common Stock to be paid to the holders of the share of Common
Stock upon consummation of the Change of Control (any such non-cash
consideration consisting of marketable securities to be valued at the higher
of (x) the Closing Sale Price of such securities as of the Trading Day
immediately prior to the consummation of such Change of Control, (y) the
Closing Sale Price as of the Trading Day immediately following the public
announcement of such proposed Change of Control and (z) the Closing Sale
Price as of the Trading Day immediately prior to the public announcement of
such proposed Change of Control) by (II) the Conversion Price (the " **Change
of Control Redemption Price** "). The Company shall make payment of the
Change of Control Redemption Price concurrently with the consummation of such
Change of Control if such a Change of Control Redemption Notice is received
prior to the consummation of such Change of Control and within five (5)
Trading Days after the Companys receipt of such notice otherwise (the "
**Change of Control Redemption Date** "). To the extent redemptions required
by this Section 8(a) are deemed or determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be prepayments of the Preferred Shares by the Company, such
redemptions shall be deemed to be voluntary prepayments.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 8(a), until the
Change of Control Redemption Price is paid in full, the Conversion Amount
submitted for redemption under this Section 8 may be converted, in whole or
in part, by the Holder into shares of Common Stock, or in the event the
Conversion Date is after the consummation of the Change of Control, shares or
equity interests of the Successor Entity substantially equivalent to the
Companys Common Stock pursuant to Section 2(c)(i). The parties hereto agree
that in the event of the Companys redemption of any portion of the Preferred
Shares under this Section 8(a), the Holders damages would be uncertain and
difficult to estimate because of the parties inability to predict future
interest rates and the uncertainty of the availability of a suitable
substitute investment opportunity for the Holder. Accordingly, any
redemption premium due under this Section 8(a) is intended by the parties to
be, and shall be deemed, a reasonable estimate of the Holders actual loss of
its investment opportunity and not as a penalty. In the event that the
Company does not pay the Change of Control Redemption Price on the Change of
Control Redemption Date, then the Holder shall have the option to, in lieu of
redemption, require the Company to promptly return to such Holder any or all
of the Preferred Shares that were submitted for redemption by such Holder
under this Section 8(a) and for which the applicable Change of Control
Redemption Price (together with any interest thereon) has not been paid, by
sending written notice thereof to the Company via facsimile (the " **Void
Change of Control Redemption Notice** "). Upon the Companys receipt of such
Void Change of Control Redemption Notice, (i) the Change of Control
Redemption Notice shall be null and void with respect to those Preferred
Shares subject to the Void Change of Control Redemption Notice, (ii) the
Company shall immediately return any Preferred Shares subject to the Void
Change of Control Redemption Notice, and (iii) the Conversion Price of such
returned Preferred Shares shall be

  



        
   

  



  

## adjusted to the lesser of (A) the Conversion Price as in effect on the
date on which the Void Change of Control Redemption Notice is delivered to
the Company and (B) the lowest Weighted Average Price of the Common Stock
during the period beginning on the date on which the Change of Control
Redemption Notice is delivered to the Company and ending on the date on which
the Void Change of Control Redemption Notice is delivered to the Company.

  

## 

  

## (b) _Liquidation_. In the event of a Liquidation Event, the Holders shall
be entitled to receive in cash out of the assets of the Company, whether from
capital or from earnings available for distribution to its stockholders (the
" **Liquidation Funds** "), before any amount shall be paid to the holders of
any of the Capital Stock of the Company of any class junior in rank to the
Preferred Shares in respect of the preferences as to distributions and
payments on the liquidation, dissolution and winding up of the Company, an
amount per Preferred Share equal to the Conversion Amount; provided that, if
the Liquidation Funds are insufficient to pay the full amount due to the
Holders and holders of shares of other classes or series of preferred stock
of the Company that are of equal rank with the Preferred Shares as to
payments of Liquidation Funds (the " **Pari Passu Shares** "), if any, then
each Holder and each holder of any such Pari Passu Shares shall receive a
percentage of the Liquidation Funds equal to the full amount of Liquidation
Funds payable to such Holder as a liquidation preference, in accordance with
their respective Certificate of Designations, Preferences and Rights, as a
percentage of the full amount of Liquidation Funds payable to all holders of
Preferred Shares and Pari Passu Shares. To the extent necessary, the Company
shall cause such actions to be taken by any of its Subsidiaries so as to
enable, to the maximum extent permitted by law, the proceeds of a Liquidation
Event to be distributed to the Holders in accordance with this Section. All
the preferential amounts to be paid to the Holders under this Section shall
be paid or set apart for payment before the payment or setting apart for
payment of any amount for, or the distribution of any Liquidation Funds of
the Company to the holders of shares of other classes or series of preferred
stock of the Company junior in rank to the Preferred Shares in connection
with a Liquidation Event as to which this Section applies. The purchase or
redemption by the Company of stock of any class, in any manner permitted by
law, shall not, for the purposes hereof, be regarded as a Liquidation Event.
 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 8, but subject to
Section 7, until the Liquidation Funds are distributed to the Holders, the
Preferred Shares may be converted, in whole or in part, by any Holder into
Common Stock pursuant to Section 2(b).

  

# 

  

# (9) _Ranking; Issuances of Other Securities._

  

## 

  

## (a) _Preferred Rank_. All shares of Common Stock shall be of junior rank
to all Preferred Shares with respect to the preferences as to
dividends, distributions and payments upon the liquidation, dissolution and
winding up of the Company. The rights of the shares of Common Stock shall be
subject to the preferences and relative rights of the Preferred Shares.
Without the prior express written consent of the Required Holders, the
Company shall not hereafter

  



        
   

  



  

## authorize or issue additional or other Capital Stock that is of senior or
pari-passu rank to the Preferred Shares in respect of the preferences as to
distributions and payments upon a Liquidation Event. The Company shall be
permitted to issue preferred stock that is junior in rank to the Preferred
Shares in respect of the preferences as to dividends and other distributions,
amortization and redemption payments and payments upon the liquidation,
dissolution and winding up of the Company, provided that the maturity date
(or any other date requiring redemption or repayment (whether through a
scheduled amortization, redemption or otherwise) of such preferred stock) of
any such junior preferred stock is not on or before the ninety-first (91st)
day following the Maturity Date. In the event of the merger or
consolidation of the Company with or into another corporation, the Preferred
Shares shall maintain their relative powers, designations and preferences
provided for herein (except that the Preferred Shares may not be _pari passu_
 with, or junior to, any Capital Stock of the successor entity) and no
merger shall result inconsistent therewith.

  

## 

  

## (b) _Issuances of Equity-Linked Securities_. For so long as any Preferred
Shares are outstanding, the Company will not, directly or indirectly, offer,
sell, grant any option to purchase, or otherwise dispose of (or announce any
offer, sale, grant or any option to purchase or other disposition of) any
Indebtedness of it or its Subsidiaries that is, at any time during its life
and under any circumstances, convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable
for shares of Common Stock, Options, Convertible Securities or other Capital
Stock of the Company.

  

# 

  

# (10) _[Limitation on Number of Conversion Shares_.  Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company shall not issue any
shares of Common Stock upon conversion of the Preferred Shares if the
issuance of such shares of Common Stock would exceed that number of shares of
Common Stock which the Company may issue upon conversion of the Preferred
Shares without breaching the Companys obligations under the rules
or regulations of the Principal Market, or the market or exchange where the
Common Stock is then traded (the " **Exchange Cap** "), except that such
limitation shall not apply in the event that the Company (a)
obtains stockholder approval as required by the applicable rules of the
Principal Market (and any successor rule or regulation) for issuances of
Common Stock in excess of such amount, or (b) obtains a written opinion
from outside counsel to the Company that such approval is not required,
which opinion shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Required Holders. Until
such approval or written opinion is obtained, no purchaser of Preferred
Shares pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement (the " **Purchasers** ")
shall be issued, in the aggregate, upon conversion of Preferred Shares,
shares of Common Stock in an amount greater than the product of (i) the
Exchange Cap amount multiplied by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of Preferred Shares issued to such Purchaser pursuant to the
Securities Purchase Agreement on the Initial Issuance Date and the
denominator of which is the aggregate amount of all of the Preferred Shares
issued to the Purchasers on the Initial Issuance Date pursuant to the
Securities Purchase Agreement (the " **Exchange Cap Allocation** "). In the
event that any Purchaser shall sell or otherwise transfer any of such
Purchasers Preferred Shares, the transferee shall be allocated a pro rata
portion of such Purchasers Exchange Cap Allocation. In the event that any
Holder shall convert all of such Holders Preferred Shares into a number of
shares of Common Stock which, in the aggregate, is less than such Holders
Exchange Cap Allocation,

  



        
   

  



  

# then the difference between such Holders Exchange Cap Allocation and the
number of shares of Common Stock actually issued to such Holder shall be
allocated to the respective Exchange Cap Allocations of the remaining Holders
on a pro rata basis in proportion to the number of Preferred Shares then held
by each such Holder.]

  

# 

  

# (11) _Participation_. Subject to the rights of the holders, if any, of the
Pari Passu Shares, the Holders shall, as holders of Preferred Stock,
be entitled to such dividends paid and distributions made to the holders of
Common Stock to the same extent as if such Holders had converted the
Preferred Shares into Common Stock (without regard to any limitations on
conversion herein or elsewhere) and had held such shares of Common Stock on
the record date for such dividends and distributions. Payments under the
preceding sentence shall be made concurrently with the dividend
or distribution to the holders of Common Stock.  Following the occurrence of
a Liquidation Event and the payment in full to a Holder of its applicable
liquidation preference, such Holder shall cease to have any rights hereunder
to participate in any future dividends or distributions made to the holders
of Common Stock.

  

# 

  

# (12) _Vote to Change the Terms of or Issue Preferred Shares_ _._ Except
where the vote or written consent of the holders of a greater number of
shares is required by law or by another provision of the Certificate of
Incorporation, the affirmative vote at a meeting duly called for such purpose
or the written consent without a meeting of the Required Holders, voting
together as a single class, shall be required before the Company may: (a)
amend or repeal any provision of, or add any provision to, the Certificate of
Incorporation or bylaws, or file any articles of amendment, certificate of
designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights of any series of
preferred stock, if such action would adversely alter or change the
preferences, rights, privileges or powers of, or restrictions provided for
the benefit of the Preferred Shares, regardless of whether any such action
shall be by means of amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation or by
merger, consolidation or otherwise; (b) increase or decrease (other than by
conversion) the authorized number of shares of Preferred Shares; (c) create
or authorize (by reclassification or otherwise) any new class or series of
shares that has a preference over or is on a parity with the Preferred Shares
with respect to dividends or the distribution of assets on the liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Company; (d) purchase, repurchase or redeem
any shares of Common Stock (other than pursuant to equity incentive
agreements with employees giving the Company the right to repurchase shares
upon the termination of services at cost); (e) pay dividends or make any
other distribution on the Common Stock; or (f) whether or not prohibited by
the terms of the Preferred Shares, circumvent a right of the Preferred
Shares.

  

# 

  

# (13) _Lost or Stolen Certificates_. Upon receipt by the Company of
evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company of the loss, theft,
destruction or mutilation of any Preferred Stock Certificates representing
the Preferred Shares, and, in the case of loss, theft or destruction, of an
indemnification undertaking by the Holder to the Company in customary form
and, in the case of mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation of the
Preferred Stock Certificate(s), the Company shall execute and deliver new
preferred stock certificate(s) of like tenor and date; _provided_ , _however_
, the Company shall not be obligated to re-issue preferred stock certificates
if the Holder contemporaneously requests the Company to convert such
Preferred Shares into Common Stock.

  



        
   

  



  

# (14) _Remedies, Characterizations, Other Obligations, Breaches and
Injunctive Relief_. Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, the
remedies provided in this Certificate of Designations shall be cumulative and
in addition to all other remedies available under this Certificate of
Designations, at law or in equity (including a decree of specific performance
and/or other injunctive relief). Except as otherwise specifically set
forth herein, no remedy contained herein shall be deemed a waiver of
compliance with the provisions giving rise to such remedy.  Except as
otherwise specifically set forth herein, nothing herein shall limit a
Holders right to pursue actual damages for any failure by the Company to
comply with the terms of this Certificate of Designations. The Company
covenants to each Holder that there shall be no characterization concerning
this instrument other than as expressly provided herein. Amounts set forth
or provided for herein with respect to payments, conversion and the like (and
the computation thereof) shall be the amounts to be received by the
Holder thereof and shall not, except as expressly provided herein, be subject
to any other obligation of the Company (or the performance thereof). The
Company acknowledges that a breach by it of its obligations hereunder will
cause irreparable harm to the Holders and that the remedy at law for any such
breach may be inadequate. The Company therefore agrees that, in the event of
any such breach or threatened breach, except as otherwise specifically set
forth herein, the Holders shall be entitled, in addition to all
other available remedies, to an injunction restraining any breach, without
the necessity of showing economic loss and without any bond or other security
being required. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
no Holder shall be entitled to consequential, indirect or incidental damages
hereunder.  However, the foregoing shall not in any way limit a Holder from
being reimbursed for its costs, fees or expenses, including, without
limitation, reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements in connection with
any of its rights and remedies hereunder.

  

# 

  

# (15) _Construction_. This Certificate of Designations shall be deemed to be
jointly drafted by the Company and all Holders and shall not be construed
against any person as the drafter hereof.

  

# 

  

# (16) _Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver_. No failure or delay on the part
of a Holder in the exercise of any power, right or privilege hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any
such power, right or privilege preclude other or further exercise thereof or
of any other right, power or privilege.

  

# 

  

# (17) _Notice_. [To come].

  

# 

  

# (18) _Transfer of Preferred Shares_. A Holder may assign some or all of
the Preferred Shares and the accompanying rights hereunder held by such
Holder without the consent of the Company; _provided_ that such assignment is
in compliance with applicable securities laws.

  

# 

  

# (19) _Preferred Share Register_. The Company shall maintain at its
principal executive offices (or such other office or agency of the Company as
it may designate by notice to the Holders), a register for the Preferred
Shares, in which the Company shall record the name and address of the persons
in whose name the Preferred Shares have been issued, as well as the name and
address of each transferee. The Company may treat the person in whose name
any Preferred Share is registered on the register as the owner and holder
thereof for all purposes,

  



        
   

  



  

# notwithstanding any notice to the contrary, but in all events recognizing
any properly made transfers.

  

# 

  

# (20) _Stockholder Matters_. Any stockholder action, approval or
consent required, desired or otherwise sought by the Company pursuant to the
rules and regulations of the Principal Market, the TBOC, this Certificate of
Designations or otherwise with respect to the issuance of the Preferred
Shares or the Common Stock issuable upon conversion thereof may be effected
by written consent of the Companys stockholders or at a duly called meeting
of the Companys stockholders, all in accordance with the applicable rules
and regulations of the Principal Market and the TBOC.  This provision is
intended to comply with the applicable sections of the TBOC permitting
stockholder action, approval and consent affected by written consent in lieu
of a meeting.

  

# 

  

# (21) _Disclosure_. Upon receipt or delivery by the Company of any notice in
accordance with the terms of this Certificate of Designations, unless the
Company has in good faith determined that the matters relating to such notice
do not constitute material, nonpublic information relating to the Company or
its Subsidiaries, the Company shall within one (1) Business Day after any
such receipt or delivery publicly disclose such material, nonpublic
information on a Current Report on Form 8-K or otherwise. In the event that
the Company believes that a notice contains material, nonpublic
information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries, the Company so shall
indicate to the Holders contemporaneously with delivery of such notice, and
in the absence of any such indication, the Holders shall be allowed to
presume that all matters relating to such notice do not constitute material,
nonpublic information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries.

  

# 

  

# (22) **SUBORDINATION**.

  

# 

  

# (a) NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED IN THIS CERTIFICATE
OF DESIGNATION OR ANY OTHER AGREEMENT, DOCUMENT, CERTIFICATE, OR INSTRUMENT
GIVEN IN CONNECTION WITH, RELATED TO OR AFFECTING THE PREFERRED SHARES, the
Companys obligation to make, and the Holders right to receive, any dividend
or distribution (whether in cash, securities or other property) or any direct
or indirect payment of any kind or character (whether in cash, securities or
other property) in consideration for or otherwise in connection the Preferred
Shares, including, without limitation, any amortization, retirement,
purchase, redemption or other acquisition of any Preferred Share, or any
options, warrants or rights to purchase or acquire any Preferred Shares or
Common Stock of the Company (collectively, the " **Restricted Payments** ")
are strictly junior and fully subordinated to the right of payment held by
the holders of the Senior Debt (the " **Senior Debt Holders** "). If a
default (however defined) under any document, instrument, or other agreement
in any way related to the Senior Debt, whether such document, instrument, or
other agreement exists on the Initial Issuance Date or is entered into after
the Initial Issuance Date, exists at the time a Restricted Payment is to be
made or would exist as a result of such Restricted Payment being made, (i)
the Company shall not make, and no Holder is entitled to receive, any
Restricted Payment unless and until the "Payment in Full of the Senior Debt"
(as defined below); and (ii) no Holder shall be entitled to ask, demand, sue
for, take or receive from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, directly or
indirectly, in cash or other property, or by set-off or in any

  



        
   

  



  

# other manner (including without limitation from or by way of collateral)
payment of any Restricted Payment unless and until the Payment in Full of the
Senior Debt.

  

# 

  

# (b) The subordination of the rights of the Holders to the Senior Debt
Holders shall be effective both before and after the commencement of any
Insolvency Proceeding (as defined below). All references in this clause
22 to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall include such entity as
a debtor-in-possession and any receiver or trustee for such entity in
any Insolvency Proceeding.

  

# 

  

# (c) As between the Holders and the Senior Debt Holders and without
releasing or affecting any of its senior rights as to the Holders, any Senior
Debt Holder may, one or more times, in its sole discretion, without notice to
or the consent of any Holder, take any action with respect to the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries or any of the Senior Debt, including, without
limitation, one or more of the following actions: (i) extend credit to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in such amounts as such Senior Debt Holder
may determine or withhold credit from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;
(ii) release, renew or modify the obligations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any other person or entity obligated on any of the Senior
Debt; (c) release, exchange, modify, or surrender in whole or in part such
Senior Debt Holders rights with respect to any security for any of the
Senior Debt; (d) modify or alter the term, interest rate or due date of any
payment of any of the Senior Debt; (e) grant any postponements, compromises,
indulgences, waivers, surrenders or discharges or modify the terms of its
agreements with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (f) change its manner
of doing business with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any other
person or entity; (g) obtain additional security for the Senior Debt; or (h)
impute payments or proceeds of any security furnished for any of the Senior
Debt, in whole or in part, to any of the Senior Debt, or retain the payments
or proceeds as security for the Senior Debt without applying same toward
payment of the Senior Debt. **Each Holder waives and releases all claims and
defenses arising from any such actions by any holder of Senior Debt,
including, without limitation, claims and defenses relating to the inability
to collect any Restricted Payment**. No Senior Debt Holder will be liable for
any action or failure to act under or in connection with any of the documents
or instruments evidencing or securing the Senior Debt, it being understood
that the decision of whether and when to act and the manner of proceeding
under such instruments and documents are within the sole discretion of such
Senior Debt Holders, and shall not be affected in any manner by the existence
of the Companys obligations hereunder.

  

# 

  

# (d) For purposes hereof, " **Payment in Full of the Senior Debt** " means
the satisfaction of all of the following: (i) the passage of 90 days after
the indefeasible and final payment in full in cash of the Senior Debt, (ii)
the termination of all hedging transactions with any Senior Debt Holder,
(iii) the termination or expiration of all commitments of each Senior Debt
Holder to advance funds or issue letters of credit, and (iv) the termination
or expiration and return of all letters of credit issued by any Senior
Debt Holder. For purposes hereof, " **Insolvency Proceeding** " means any
distribution of all or any of the assets of any entity to creditors of such
entity upon the dissolution, winding up, liquidation, arrangement,
reorganization, adjustment, protection, relief, or composition of such entity
or its debts, whether in any bankruptcy, insolvency, arrangement,
reorganization, receivership, relief or similar proceedings or upon an
assignment for the benefit of creditors or any other marshalling of the
assets and liabilities of such entity or otherwise.

 ** _CANO PETROLEUM, INC._**

  



  

 ** _OFFICER S CERTIFICATE_**

  



  

The undersigned officer of Cano Petroleum, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" **
_Target_** "), in connection with the opinion as to certain tax matters to be
delivered by Thompson and Knight LLP pursuant to Section 8.3 of the Agreement
and Plan of Merger (the " ** _Merger Agreement_** ") dated as of September
29, 2009, by and among Resaca Exploitation, Inc., a Texas corporation (" **
_Parent_** "), Resaca Acquisition Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" ** _Merger Sub_** "), and Target, and
recognizing that said counsel will rely on this Officers Certificate in
delivering such opinion, hereby certifies and represents that the facts that
relate to the Merger and the Transactions, as described in the Merger
Agreement, the Registration Statement filed with the SEC in connection with
the Merger, including the Proxy/Prospectus contained therein, and the
Readmission Document published on the AIM in connection with the Merger, each
as amended or supplemented through the date hereof, are true, correct and
complete in all material respects and will be true, correct and complete in
all material respects at the Effective Time, and the undersigned further
certifies and represents that, to the extent the facts related to Target (and
to the extent otherwise without reason to believe to the contrary), the
following statements and representations stated herein are true, correct and
complete:

  



  

1. The Merger will be consummated in compliance with the material terms of the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement, the Registration Statement, the Readmission Document and the other documents described in the Registration Statement and the Readmission Document represent the entire understanding of Parent with respect to the Merger. Target has bona fide business reasons for engaging in the Merger, in particular, to combine the business operations of Parent and Target.

  



  

2. The fair market value of the Parent Common Shares received by each holder of Target Common Shares and the cash received by each holder of Target Common Shares in lieu of a fractional share thereof, if any, or the consideration received by each holder of Target Common Shares as determined under Section 262 of the DGCL in exchange for Target Dissenting Shares, if any, all in connection with the Merger, will be approximately equal to the fair market value of the shares of Target Common Shares surrendered in the exchange. The fair market value of the Parent Series A Preferred Shares received by each holder of Series D Stock and the cash received by each holder of Series D Stock in lieu of a fractional share thereof, if any, or the consideration received by each holder of Series D Stock as determined under Section 262 of the DGCL in exchange for Target Dissenting Shares, if any, all in connection with the Merger, will be approximately equal to the fair market value of the shares of Series D Stock surrendered in the exchange.

        
   

  



  

3. To the knowledge of Target, the aggregate fair market value, determined at the Effective Time, of the Parent Common Shares and the Parent Series A Preferred Shares to be received in the Merger will not be less than forty percent (40%) of the value, determined at the Effective Time, of the Target Common Shares and Series D Stock outstanding immediately before the Effective Time. For this purpose, we assume that the fair market value of the outstanding Target Common Shares and Series D Stock will equal the fair market value of the aggregate Merger Consideration.

  



  

4. Pursuant to the Merger, no holder of Target Common Shares will receive in exchange for Target Common Shares, directly or indirectly, any consideration other than the Common Conversion Consideration and cash in lieu of a fractional share thereof, if any, or the consideration determined under Section 262 of the DGCL in exchange for Target Dissenting Shares, if any.  Pursuant to the Merger, no holder of Series D Stock will receive in exchange for Series D Stock, directly or indirectly, any consideration other than the Preferred Conversion Consideration and cash in lieu of a fractional share thereof, if any, or the consideration determined under Section 262 of the DGCL in exchange for Target Dissenting Shares, if any. Target will not pay any consideration prior to the Merger, either in a redemption of Target Common Shares or Series D Stock, or in a distribution with respect to Target Common Shares or Series D Stock, that is treated as other property or money received in the Merger for purposes of Section 356 of the Code, or would be so treated if the Target shareholder also had received Parent Common Shares in exchange for Target Common Shares or Series D Stock. Target has not caused, and in connection with the Merger, will not cause, an extraordinary distribution (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(e)(1)) with respect to its shares to occur. Neither Target nor a person related to Target as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(e)(4) (a " ** _Target Related Person_** ") has participated, nor will participate, in a purchase, redemption or other acquisition of, Target Common Shares or Series D Stock, in connection with or in contemplation of the Merger, or otherwise as part of a plan of which the Merger is a part. Neither Target, any Target Related Person nor any affiliate of Target, has paid or will pay, in connection with the Merger or otherwise as part of a plan of which the Merger is a part, any amount to, or on behalf of, any Target shareholder in connection with any sale, redemption or other disposition of any Target Common Shares, Series D Stock or Parent Common Shares. Any reference to Parent or Target in this paragraph includes a reference to any successor or predecessor of such corporation, except that Target is not treated as a predecessor of Parent and Parent is not treated as a successor of Target. Each partner of a partnership will be treated as owning or acquiring any stock owned or acquired, as the case may be, by the partnership (and as having paid any consideration paid by the partnership to acquire such stock) in accordance with that partners interest in the partnership. For purposes of this Officers Certificate, an acquisition of Parent Common Shares, Target Common Shares or Series D Stock by a person pursuant to any transaction, agreement, arrangement or other understanding with Parent, Target, a person related to Parent 

  



        
   

  



  

as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(e)(4) (a " ** _Parent
Related Person_** ") or a Target Related Person will be treated as made by
Parent, Target, the Parent Related Person or the Target Related Person,
respectively.

  



  

5. Following the Merger, Target will hold at least ninety percent (90%) of the fair market value of its net assets and at least seventy percent (70%) of the fair market value of its gross assets held immediately prior to the Merger.  For purposes of this representation, amounts paid by Target or Merger Sub to shareholders who receive cash or other property, amounts used by Target or Merger Sub to pay reorganization expenses, all redemptions and distributions (except for regular, normal dividends) made by Target or Merger Sub in connection with the Merger, and any cash or other property used by Target or any of its subsidiaries to make payments to creditors in connection with the Merger will be included as assets of Target or Merger Sub, respectively, held immediately prior to the Merger.

  



  

6. Target has no plan or intention to issue additional shares of its stock that would result in Parent losing control of Target within the meaning of Section 368(c) of the Code.

  



  

7. Except as otherwise provided in Section 7.6 of the Merger Agreement, Parent, Merger Sub, Target and the shareholders of Target will each pay their respective expenses, if any, incurred in connection with the Merger.

  



  

8. There is no intercorporate indebtedness existing between Parent (or any of its subsidiaries, including Merger Sub), on the one hand, and Target (or any of its subsidiaries), on the other hand, that was issued, acquired or settled prior to the Effective Time at a discount or, to the knowledge of Target, will be settled after the Effective Time at a discount.

  



  

9. In the Merger, shares of Target representing control of Target, as defined in Section 368(c) of the Code, will be exchanged solely for voting stock of Parent (except to the extent that cash is paid for fractional shares or cash or other consideration is paid for Target Dissenting Shares).  Furthermore, no expenses or liabilities of any Target stockholder will be assumed by Parent or Merger Sub, nor will any Target Common Shares or Series D Stock be acquired subject to any expenses or liabilities. For purposes of this representation, if any stock of Target is exchanged for cash or other property originating with Parent, such stock will be treated as outstanding stock of Target on the date of the Merger.

  



  

10. At the time of the Merger, Target will not have outstanding any warrants, options, convertible securities or any other type of right (which was outstanding immediately prior to the Merger) pursuant to which, following the Merger, any person could acquire stock of Target.

  



  

11. Target conducts a "historic business" for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(d) and no assets of Target have been acquired or sold, transferred or 

  



        
   

  



  

otherwise disposed of that would prevent Parent from continuing such
"historic business" or from using a "significant portion" of Targets
"historic business assets" in a business following the Merger (as such terms
are used in Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(d)).

  



  

12. Target is not an "investment company," as defined in Sections 368(a)(2)(F)(iii) and (iv) of the Code.

  



  

13. On the date of the Merger, the fair market value of the assets of Target will exceed the sum of its liabilities, plus the amount of liabilities, if any, to which the assets are subject.

  



  

14. Target is not under the jurisdiction of a court in a "title 11 or similar case" within the meaning of Section 368(a)(3)(A) of the Code.

  



  

15. Target has no (and, at the time of the Merger, will not have any) issued and outstanding capital stock (or any other interest treated as stock for federal income tax purposes) other than Target Common Shares and Series D Stock.

  



  

16. The payment of cash, if any, in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Shares represents a mere mechanical rounding off solely for the purpose of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Parent of issuing fractional shares and does not represent separately bargained-for consideration.  The total cash consideration that will be paid in the Merger to Target shareholders instead of issuing fractional shares of Parent Common Shares will not exceed one percent of the total consideration that will be issued in the Merger to Target shareholders in exchange for their shares of Target Common Shares. The fractional share interests of each Target shareholder will be aggregated, and no Target shareholder, with the possible exception of shareholders whose holdings are in multiple accounts or with multiple brokers will receive cash in an amount equal to or greater than the value of one full share of Parent Common Shares.

  



  

17. None of the compensation received (or to be received) by any stockholder-employees of Target will be separate consideration for, or allocable to, any Target Common Shares or Series D Stock held by such shareholder-employees; none of the shares of Parent Common Shares or Parent Series A Preferred Shares issued to any stockholder-employees pursuant to the Merger Agreement are (or will be) separate consideration for, or allocable to, any employment agreement; and the compensation paid (or to be paid) to any shareholder-employees was (or will be) for services actually rendered or to be rendered and was (or will be) commensurate with amounts paid to third parties bargaining at arms-length for similar services.

  



  

18. No debt of Target is guaranteed by any Target stockholder.

  



  

19. Target owns no stock of Parent.

  



        
   

  



  

20. Target will not take, and Target has no knowledge of any plan or intention of any of the Target stockholders to take, any position on any federal, state or local income or franchise tax return, or take any other tax reporting position, that is inconsistent with the treatment of the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, unless otherwise required by a "determination" (as defined in Section 1313(a)(1) of the Code).

  



  

21. Except for in accordance with the terms of the Separation Agreements, no stock or securities of Target, or, to the knowledge of Target, no stock or securities of Parent, will be issued to any Target stockholder for services rendered to or for the benefit of Parent or Target in connection with the Merger.

  



  

22. No stock or securities of Target will be issued to any Target stockholder for any indebtedness owed to any Target stockholder in connection with the Merger.

  



  

23. No assets were transferred to Target, nor did Target assume any liabilities, in anticipation of the Merger.

  



  

24. The liabilities of Target assumed by Parent and the liabilities to which the transferred assets of Target are subject were incurred by Target in the ordinary course of business.

  



  

25. The undersigned is authorized to make all of the representations set forth herein on behalf of Target.

  



  

Terms used herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in, and shall
be interpreted in accordance with, the applicable federal income tax law
and regulations. Except as otherwise provided, capitalized terms used but
not defined herein have the meaning ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement
and the phrase " ** _to the knowledge of Parent_** " and other similar
phrases, shall have the meaning ascribed to such phrases in the Merger
Agreement. As used herein, the term " ** _Separation Agreements_** " means (i)
that certain Separation Agreement and Release, dated September 29, 2009, by
and between Target and S. Jeffrey Johnson; and (ii) that certain
Separation Agreement and Release, dated September 29, 2009, by and between
Target and Ben Daitch. Except as otherwise indicated, all "Section"
references contained herein refer to sections of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended.

  



  

Target understands that Thompson and Knight LLP, as counsel to Target,
will rely, without further inquiry, on this certificate in rendering its
opinion concerning certain of the United States federal income tax
consequences of the Merger and hereby commits to inform them if, for any
reason, any of the foregoing representations or statements ceases to be true,
correct or complete prior to the Effective Time.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have, on behalf of Target, caused this Officers
Certificate to be executed on this [ ] day of

 **NOW, THEREFORE** , in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants

the Parties agree as follows:

  



  

 **1.** ** ****Termination of Executive s Employment** **.** Executives

agreement, including without limitation the Employment Agreement, bylaw,
article of incorporation, statute, or law prior to the date of this
Agreement, or accruing thereafter under the terms of such agreement, bylaw,
article of incorporation, statute, or law.

  



  

 **3.** ** ****Certain Payments and Benefits.**

  



  

(a) __Accrued Obligations__. On or within six (6) days following the
Closing, the Company shall pay Executive for all (i) unpaid salary through
the Separation Date, and (ii) any accrued but unused vacation through the
Separation Date.  In the next regular payroll date of the Company immediately
following the Separation Date, the Company shall reimburse Executive for
reasonable and necessary business expenses incurred by Executive in
accordance with his duties and responsibilities through the Separation Date,
if any, provided Executive provides substantiating documentation for such
expenses and such expenses are reimbursable in accordance with the Companys
policies and procedures. Except as stated in this Agreement or as required by
law, all other compensation and benefits that relate to
Executives employment with the Company, including any benefits set forth in
any policy or program, will cease as of the Separation Date.

  



  

(b) __Separation Payment__. **  **Subject to Executives consent to and
fulfillment of Executives obligations in this Agreement, and provided that
Executive does not revoke this Agreement under Section 24, the Company shall
pay, or cause to be paid, Executive severance pay equal to: [ ** _JEFF_** :
(i) $1,290,288 in cash if the Separation Date occurs on or before December
31, 2009 or $1,366,308 in cash if the Separation

  



        
   

  



  

Date occurs on or after January 1, 2010] **** [ ** _BEN_** : (i) $500,000 in
cash if the Separation Date occurs on or before December 31, 2009 or $578,666
in cash if the Separation Date occurs on or after January 1, 2010]; and (ii)
the number of whole shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Resaca (" ** _Resaca Common Stock_** ") with a Fair Market Value on the
Separation Date equal to [ ** _JEFF_** : $645,144 if the Separation Date
occurs on or before December 31, 2009 or $683,304 if the Separation Date
occurs on or after January 1, 2010] [ ** _BEN_** : **** $249,999 if the
Separation Date occurs on or before December 31, 2009 or $289,332 if
the Separation Date occurs on or after January 1, 2010] ****
(collectively, subsections (i), and (ii), the " ** _Separation Payment_** ").
The Separation Payment shall be made in one lump sum on the first Business
Day immediately following the date that is six (6) months and one (1) day
following the Separation Date. The Separation Payment shall not be treated as
compensation under the Companys 401(k) Plan or any other retirement plan.
Executive recognizes and agrees that he is not otherwise entitled to the
Separation Payment, that the Separation Payment is in addition to anything
Executive is otherwise entitled to based on his employment relationship with
the Company, and that he will receive the Separation Payment only as a
condition of signing this Agreement and executing the additional waiver in
accordance with Sections 5 and 6. For purposes of this Section 3(b), " **
_Fair Market Value_** " means, as of a particular date, the closing
sales price per share of Resaca Common Stock on the AIM Market of the London
Stock Exchange, or, if there was no such sale reported on that date, on the
last preceding date on which such a sale was reported. In addition,
Executives options to purchase the Companys common stock and restricted
shares of the Companys common stock shall vest and become nonforfeitable on
the Separation Date in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
applicable award agreement for the same.

  



  

(c) __Indemnification Coverage__. To the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, Executive shall be entitled to indemnification following the
Separation Date on the same terms as indemnification is provided by the
Company to other employees, officers, and directors through the Companys
Directors and Officers insurance coverage and/or bylaws. Such
indemnification shall remain effective after the Separation Date with respect
to the actions or omissions of Executive on or before the Separation Date.

  



  

(d) __Waiver of Additional Compensation or Benefits__. Executives
participation in and eligibility for any compensation, bonus, or benefits
plans or practices of the Company shall terminate on the Separation Date.
 Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, nothing in
this Agreement shall affect (i) Executives vested right, if any, under the
terms of such plans or any other employee benefit plans maintained by the
Company or Administaff Companies II, L.P. or its affiliates (together " **
_Administaff_** ") for the benefit of the Companys employees; or (ii)
Executives right to continue or convert coverage under such employee benefit
plans, in accordance with the terms of those plans and applicable law,
including without limitation, Executives right to elect continued insurance
coverage in accordance with the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act (" ** _COBRA_** "). Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
Executive shall not be entitled to any additional compensation, nor shall
Executive be entitled to any benefits, payments or grants under any benefit
plan, severance plan or bonus or incentive program the Company or any of its
affiliates has established.  Executive agrees that the release in Section 5
covers any claims that

  



        
   

  



  

arise before the date he signs this Agreement regarding his compensation,
bonuses, stock options or grants and any other benefits Executive may or may
not have received during the course of his employment relationship with the
Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates.

  



  

(e) **[ _BEN ONLY_** :  _ _280G Limitation__. If, at the Closing Date, all or
any portion of the Separation Payment would constitute a "parachute payment"
as defined in Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the " ** _Code_** "), then the Separation Payment shall be reduced so that
it is one dollar ($1.00) less than the amount which Executive could receive
without being considered to have received a parachute payment.
The determination of the amount of any reduction shall be made by an
independent accounting firm selected by the Company, and such determination
shall be conclusive and binding on the Parties. **]**

  



  

(f) ** **__Medical Insurance Premiums__ _. _In the event Executive timely
exercises his right to elect medical benefit continuation under COBRA, the
Company shall reimburse Executive for the difference between the cost of the
COBRA premiums paid by Executive during the first 12 months following the
Separation Date and the cost of premium payments that the Executive otherwise
would have been required to pay during the 12-month period in the event his
employment had not terminated. The Companys reimbursement of the
COBRA premiums for the first six months of COBRA coverage shall be paid on a
monthly basis unless such monthly reimbursement may not be made without
adverse tax consequences to Executive under Section 409A, in which case such
reimbursement shall be made in a lump sum __ on the first Business
Day immediately following the date that is six (6) months and one (1) day
following the Separation Date. Thereafter, the Company shall reimburse
Executive on a monthly basis for the remaining six months during which
Executive maintains coverage under COBRA.

  



  

 **4.** ** ****[ _JEFF_ : Orderly Marketing Deed. **Executive agrees to
execute an Orderly Marketing Deed to be effective for the six (6)
month period immediately following the Separation Date with respect to all
shares of common stock of the Company, all shares of preferred stock of the
Company, all shares of Resaca Common Stock, all shares of any preferred stock
of Resaca, and any other shares of stock of the Company or Resaca owned by
Executive as of the Closing Date in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_.
**]** [ ** _BEN_** : **Intentionally Omitted.** ]

  



  

 **5.** ** ****General Release and Waiver by Executive.** In consideration for
the Companys payments in Section 3 and other valuable consideration
specified in this Agreement, Executive, on behalf of himself, his heirs,
executors, successors and assigns, and all persons or entities acting by,
through, under or in concert with any of them, irrevocably and
unconditionally releases, waives, and forever discharges the Company, Resaca,
and the Surviving Corporation and all of their parents, divisions,
partnerships, joint ventures, subsidiaries, affiliates, and related
companies, and their present and former agents, employees, officers,
directors, partners, members, attorneys, stockholders, plan fiduciaries,
employee benefit committees, successors and assigns (collectively, " **
_Company_** _**Released Parties**_ "), from any and all claims, demands,

 **9.** ** ****Non-Disclosure and Confidentiality.** Executive agrees to abide

could have economic value to others if improperly disclosed. Confidential
Information also means any information the Company Group discloses to

processes, plans (including, without limitation, market plans and
strategies), specifications, designs, techniques, technology formulas,
software, improvements, forecasts, and research.

  



  

Confidential Information shall not include any information (a) in the public
domain, through no disclosure or wrongful act of Executive, to such an extent
as to be readily available to competitors; or (b) required to be disclosed by
Executive pursuant to applicable law or valid legal process (in which case,
Executive agrees to provide notice to the Company of such required
disclosure, if possible, before such disclosure, or if notice before such
disclosure is not possible, immediately following such disclosure).

  



  

Executive agrees that he will not at any time disclose to anyone, including,
without limitation, any person, firm, corporation, or other entity, or
publish, or use for any purpose, any Confidential Information, except as the
Company directs and authorizes. Executive agrees that he shall take all
reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure and
unauthorized use of the Confidential Information and agrees to immediately
notify the Company in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure of the
Confidential Information.  Additionally, if Executive is required to disclose
any Confidential Information by a court order, subpoena, or government
directive, Executive shall immediately notify the Company no later than two
(2) days after Executive receives notice of the court order, subpoena or
government directive to allow the Company to seek a protective order.

  



        
   

  



  

 **10.** ** ****Non-Disparagement.**

  



  

(a) Executive agrees that he will not, and he will use reasonable efforts to
cause his family members not to, directly or indirectly, disclose,
communicate, or publish any disparaging or defamatory information, written
communications, oral communications, electronic or magnetic communications,
writings, oral or written statements, comments, opinions, facts, or remarks,
of any kind or nature whatsoever (collectively, " ** _Disparaging
Information_** "), concerning or regarding the Company Group, Resaca or any
subsidiary of Resaca (or any of their respective current or former officers,
directors, or employees). Executive understands and acknowledges that this
non-disparagement clause prevents him from disclosing, communicating, or
publishing, directly or indirectly, any Disparaging Information concerning or
related to the Company Group, Resaca or any subsidiary of Resaca (or any of
their respective current or former officers, directors, or employees),
including, without limitation, information regarding businesses, customers or
clients, proprietary or technical information, documents, operations,
inventions, trade secrets, product ideas, technical information, know how,
processes, plans (including, without limitation, marketing plans and
strategies), specifications, designs, methods of operation, techniques,
technology, formulas, software, improvements, internal or external audits,
internal controls, or any financial, marketing or accounting information of
any nature whatsoever.  Further, Executive acknowledges that in executing
this Agreement, he has knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waived any
free speech, free association, free press or First Amendment to the United
States Constitution (including, without limitation, any counterpart or
similar provision or right under the Texas Constitution) rights to disclose,
communicate, or publish Disparaging Information concerning or related to the
Company Group, Resaca or any subsidiary of Resaca (or any of their respective
current or former officers, directors, or employees). Executive
also understands and agrees that he has had a reasonable period of time to
consider this non-disparagement clause, to review the non-disparagement
clause with his attorney, and to consent to this clause and its terms
knowingly and voluntarily. Executives obligations under this section shall
not (i) apply to private statements by Executive to his immediate family
members or tax, financial, or legal advisors or (ii) prohibit truthful
statements by Executive that are required by law or valid legal process (in
which case, Executive agrees to provide notice to the Company of such law or
legal process, if possible, before making such statements, or if notice
before making such statements is not possible, promptly following such
statements).

  



  

(b) The Company and Resaca agree that they will not, directly or indirectly,
disclose, communicate, or publish any Disparaging Information concerning or
regarding Executive. The Company and Resaca understand and acknowledge that
this non-disparagement clause prevents them from disclosing, communicating,
or publishing, directly or indirectly, any Disparaging Information concerning
or related to the Executive. The Parties agree that for purposes of
this Section, the Companys and Resacas obligation shall be limited to
their respective members of the Board of Directors and officers of the
Company. The Companys obligations under this Section shall not (i) apply to
statements to Company officers, directors, employees, tax advisors, financial
advisors, or legal advisors or (ii) prohibit truthful statements required by
law or valid legal process.

  



  

(c) Statements that "the Company and I mutually agreed to separate in
connection with the merger transaction" or similar words to that effect shall
not violate this Section.

  



  

 **11.** ** ****Non-Recruitment.** Executive agrees that for a period of one
(1) year following the Separation Date, he will not, without the Companys
or Resacas prior written consent, directly or indirectly, either as a
principal, manager, agent, employee, consultant, officer, director,
stockholder, partner, investor or lender, or in any other capacity, and
whether personally or through other persons: solicit, call on, induce or
attempt to solicit

  



        
   

  



  

or induce, on behalf of himself or any other person or entity, any employee
of the Company Group, Resaca or any subsidiary of Resaca to terminate his or
her employment relationship with any such company.

  



  

 **12.** ** ****Announcements.** Executive agrees that he will not discuss,
and he will use all reasonable efforts to cause his family members not to
discuss, the terms of this Agreement, the Merger Agreement or the
circumstances of Executive s termination of employment with the Company with
any third party, including, without limitation, the press or the employees of
the Company, except to the extent (i) as agreed to, in writing, by the
Company and Resaca, or (ii) as required by law (in which case, Executive
agrees to provide notice to the Company of such required discussion, if
possible, before the such discussion, or if notice before the discussion
is not possible, immediately following such discussion). Executives
obligations under this Section shall not (a) apply to private statements by
Executive to his family members or tax, financial or legal advisors or (b)
prohibit truthful statements by Executive that are required by law or valid
legal process.  Furthermore, statements by Executive to third parties that
"the Company and I mutually agreed to separate in connection with a merger
transaction" or similar words to that effect shall not violate this Section.

  



  

 **13.** ** ****Cooperation. **As a further material inducement to the
Company to make the Separation Payment described in this Agreement and for
Executive to accept same, Executive agrees to (a) provide his full
cooperation, at the Companys request and at reasonable times and without
unreasonable interference with his personal or business activities, with any
of the Company Released Parties in any and all investigations or other legal,
equitable or business matters or proceedings which involve any matters for
which Executive worked on or had responsibility during his employment
with the Company; and (b) to be reasonably available to the Company, Resaca,
or their representatives to provide general advice or assistance as requested
by the Company or Resaca. This includes, without limitation, to testifying
(and preparing to testify) as a witness in any proceeding or otherwise
providing information or reasonable assistance to the Company and Resaca in
connection with any investigation, claim or suit, and cooperating with the
Company and Resaca regarding any investigation, litigation, claims or other
disputed matters involving the Company or Resaca or their subsidiaries and
affiliates that relate to matters within the knowledge or responsibility of
Executive.  Specifically, Executive agrees (i) to meet with the Companys
and Resacas representatives, their counsel or other designees at reasonable
times and places with respect to any items within the scope of this
provision; (ii) to provide truthful testimony regarding same to any court,
agency or other adjudicatory body; (iii) to provide the Company with
immediate notice of contact or subpoena by any non-governmental adverse
party, and (iv) not to voluntarily assist any non-governmental adverse party
or non-governmental adverse partys representatives.  Executive acknowledges
and understands that his cooperation obligations under this Section 13 are
not limited in time and may include, but shall not be limited to, the need
for or availability for testimony. In addition to the consideration
identified in Section 3, Executive shall receive compensation for his time
spent assisting the Company or Resaca under this Section 13 at the rate of
$250 per hour plus reasonable and necessary expenses incurred by Executive;
provided, however, that the Company shall reimburse Executive, upon
submission of substantiating documentation, for necessary and reasonable
expenses incurred by him as a result of such assistance, and the Company
shall not be obligated to reimburse Executive for any time spent actually
testifying, as opposed to preparing to testify, in any judicial or
administrative proceeding. Such hourly rate and expenses will be paid on a
monthly basis within 15 days following receipt of an invoice from Executive.
Executive shall invoice the Company or Resaca on a monthly basis.
 Executives cooperation under this Section shall be limited by the Company
so that such cooperation shall not result in him failing to incur
a separation from service from the Company and its affiliates within the
meaning of Section 409A.

  



  

 **14.** ** ****No Re-Employment with the Company.** Executive waives and
relinquishes all rights to employment, reemployment or reinstatement
(collectively " ** _employment_** ") with the Company and Resaca and their
respective affiliates and subsidiaries. Executive agrees that he will not work
for the Company, Resaca and their respective affiliates and subsidiaries, or
apply for employment with them, or accept employment with them in any
capacity. Executive further acknowledges that if he applies for or seeks
employment with any of

  



        
   

  



  

the Company, Resaca and their respective affiliates and subsidiaries, their
refusal to hire Executive based on this provision will provide a complete
defense to any claims arising from his attempt to apply for employment. In
addition, for a period of five (5) years beginning on the Closing Date,
Executive agrees that he will not serve as a member of the board of directors
or officer of any of the Company, Resaca and their respective affiliates and
subsidiaries.

  



  

 **15.** ** ****Return of Company** **Property** **.** On or prior to the
Separation Date, Executive shall, to the extent not previously returned or
delivered: (a) return all equipment, records, files, programs or other
materials and property in his possession which belongs to any member of the
Company Group or any one or more of its subsidiaries or affiliates,
including, without limitation, all, computer access codes, Blackberries,
credit cards, keys and access cards; and (b) deliver all original and copies
of notes, materials, records, plans, technical data or other documents, files
or programs (whether stored in paper form, computer form, digital form,
electronically or otherwise) that relate or refer to (1) the Company or any
one or more of its subsidiaries or affiliates, or (2) the Company or any one
or more of the Companys subsidiaries or affiliates financial statements,
business contacts, and sales. Executive further agrees that he will
not improperly copy, alter, destroy, or delete any Company (including other
Company Group members) files, documents or other materials currently in his
possession and he will not improperly use or disclose such materials in any
way, or in any format, including written information in any form, information
stored by electronic means, and any and all copies of these materials. By
signing this Agreement, Executive represents and warrants that he has not
retained and has or will timely return and deliver all the items described or
referenced in subsections (a) or (b) above; and, that should he later
discover additional items described or referenced in subsections (a) or (b)
above, he will promptly notify the Company and return/deliver such items to
the Company.  This Section does not apply to, and Executive may retain a copy
of, personnel, benefit or payroll documents of the Company concerning him, or
any contacts, personal non-work related e-mails, calendars or any items
that Executive owned and brought to the Company himself.

  



  

 **16.** ** ****Return of Company Credit Card and Club Membership**.

  



  

(a) Executive agrees that he shall return any Company credit cards in his
possession to the Company on the Separation Date. During the period
beginning on the date hereof, and ending on the Closing Date, Executive
agrees that (i) he shall use the Company credit cards to pay for
only reasonable and necessary business expenses incurred in the ordinary
course of business and consistent with the Companys expense policies and
procedures; and (ii) the Company may deduct from the Separation Payment any
expenses that, in the Companys sole discretion, are not reasonable and
necessary expenses incurred in the ordinary course of business or are in
violation of the Companys expense reimbursement policies and procedures.

  



  

(b) For all periods on and after the Separation Date, Executive, and not the
Company or Resaca, shall be solely responsible for all fees, costs, and
expenses associated with his membership at **** the Fort Worth Club.

  



  

 **17.** ** ****Breach of Agreement. **In the event Executive fails to
materially fulfill any of his obligations in this Agreement, or Executive or
anyone acting on his behalf brings suit against the Company or Resaca seeking
to declare any term of this Agreement void or unenforceable, and if in such
suit one or more material terms of this Agreement are ruled by a court to be
void or unenforceable or subject to reduction or modification, then the
Company shall be entitled to (a) terminate this Agreement, (b) terminate any
remaining Separation Payments set forth in Section 3, and Executive shall not
be entitled to receive any remaining Separation Payments, (c) recover
Separation Payments and all other benefits set forth in Section 3 already
paid to Executive upon court order, (d) recover attorneys fees, expenses and
costs the Company incurs in any court

  



     

      
 

  



  

action the Company or Resaca lodges to pursue any remedies for breach of
this Agreement, and/or (e) recover any and all other damages to which the
Company may be entitled at law or in equity as a result of a breach of
this Agreement. The Company and Executive agree that at the time Executive
and the Company enter into this Agreement, the damages remedies for
Executives breach of this Agreement cannot be easily ascertained and the
damages remedies specified in this Section 17 are a reasonable forecast of
just compensation to the Company for any breach. The Company and Executive
understand and willingly agree that the damages remedies for any breach of
the Agreement are not disproportionate to any actual damages amount and are
not a penalty. If Executive breaches this Agreement, the Company may seek all
other equitable and legal relief including, without limitation, a temporary
restraining order, temporary injunctive relief, and a permanent injunction
against Executive and any other persons, individuals, corporations,
businesses, groups, partnerships or other entities acting by, through, under,
or in concert with Executive. At the Companys sole option, the
remaining terms of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.

  



  

 **18.** ** ****No Assignment of Claims.**  Executive represents that he has
not transferred or assigned, to any person or entity, any claim released by
this Agreement, or any portion thereof or interest therein.

  



  

 **19.** ** ****Binding Effect of Agreement.** This Agreement shall be binding
upon Executive and his heirs, spouse, representatives, successors and
assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon the Company, Resaca and their
respective representatives, successors and assigns.

  



  

 **20.** ** ****Controlling Law.** This Agreement shall in all respects be
interpreted, enforced, and governed under the laws of the State of Texas. The
Company and Executive agree that the language on this Agreement shall, in all
cases, be construed as a whole, according to its fair meaning, and not
strictly for, or against, any of the Parties.

  



  

 **21.** ** ****Severability.** Should any provision of this Agreement
be declared or determined to be illegal or invalid by any government agency
or court of competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remaining parts,
terms or provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected and such
provisions shall remain in full force and effect. In addition, any illegal,
invalid or unenforceable provisions shall be, and are, automatically reformed
to the maximum limitation permitted by applicable law.

  



  

 **22.** ** ****Entire Agreement.** This Agreement sets forth the entire
agreement between the Parties, and fully supersedes any and all prior
agreements, understandings, or representations between the Parties pertaining
to Executives employment with the Company, the subject matter of this
Agreement or any other term or condition of the relationship between the
Company and Executive, including, without limitation, the Employment
Agreement. Executive represents and acknowledges that in executing this
Agreement, he does not rely, and has not relied, upon any representation(s)
by the Company or Resaca or their agents except as expressly contained in
this Agreement. No oral statements or prior written material purporting to be
part of this Agreement not specifically incorporated in this Agreement shall
be of any force and effect, and no changes in or additions to this Agreement
shall be recognized, unless incorporated in this Agreement by written
amendment, such amendment to become effective on the date stipulated in it.

 **23.** ** ****Independent Representation**. Executive acknowledges and
agrees that he is not relying on any Released Party and any of their
advisors, including, without limitation, Haynes and Boone, LLP and Thompson and
Knight LLP, for advice, including with respect to tax or legal matters, that
he has been advised by the Company to consult advisors of his choice prior to

 **24.** ** ****Knowing** **and** **Voluntary Waiver.** Executive, by his free
and voluntary act of signing below, acknowledges that (i) he has been given a
period of forty-five (45) days to consider whether to agree to the terms
contained in this Agreement, (ii) the Company advises him to consult with an
attorney before executing this Agreement, (iii) he understands that this

agrees to all of the Agreement terms and intends to be legally bound by them,
and (v) he has received, contemporaneous with this Agreement, a Supplemental

Information Chart (together, the " ** _OWBPA Memorandum_** "),
which identify the job titles and ages of all employees of the Company who
have been offered a Separation Agreement and Release Agreement in connection
with Transactions (as defined in the Merger Agreement).  Further, Executive
acknowledges that the payments and benefits provided for in Section 3 of this

Waiver and Release become effective, enforceable and irrevocable. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that each Party has reviewed and negotiated the terms
and provisions of this Agreement and has contributed to its preparation (with
advice of counsel). Accordingly, the rule of construction that ambiguities
are resolved against the drafting party shall not be employed in interpreting
this Agreement. Rather, this Agreements terms shall be construed fairly as
to the Parties and not in favor of or against either Party, regardless of
which Party generally was responsible for the Agreements preparation.

five (45) days after the date on which Executive first received this

Executive agrees that he will immediately reimburse the Company for the
amounts of such payments and benefits.

 ** _OFFICER S CERTIFICATE_**

  



  

The undersigned officer of Resaca Exploitation, Inc., a Texas corporation ("
** _Parent_** "), in connection with the opinion as to certain tax matters to
be delivered by Thompson and Knight LLP pursuant to Section 8.3 of the
Agreement and Plan of Merger (the " ** _Merger Agreement_** ") dated as of
September 29, 2009, by and among Parent, Resaca Acquisition Sub, Inc., a
Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" **
_Merger Sub_** "), and Cano Petroleum, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" **
_Target_** "), and recognizing that said counsel will rely on this Officers
Certificate in delivering such opinion, hereby certifies and represents that
the facts that relate to the Merger and the Transactions, as described in the
Merger Agreement, the Registration Statement filed with the SEC in connection
with the Merger, including the Proxy/Prospectus contained therein, and the
Readmission Document published on the AIM in connection with the Merger, each
as amended or supplemented through the date hereof, are true, correct and
complete in all material respects and will be true, correct and complete in
all material respects at the Effective Time, and the undersigned further
certifies and represents that, to the extent the facts related to Parent (and
to the extent otherwise without reason to believe to the contrary), the
following statements and representations stated herein are true, correct and
complete:

  



  

1. The Merger will be consummated in compliance with the material terms of the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement, the Registration Statement, the Readmission Document and the other documents described in the Registration Statement and the Readmission Document represent the entire understanding of Parent with respect to the Merger. Parent has bona fide business reasons for engaging in the Merger, in particular, to combine the business operations of Parent and Target.

  



  

2. The fair market value of the Parent Common Shares received by each holder of Target Common Shares and the cash received by each holder of Target Common Shares in lieu of a fractional share thereof, if any, or the consideration received by each holder of Target Common Shares as determined under Section 262 of the DGCL in exchange for Target Dissenting Shares, if any, all in connection with the Merger, will be approximately equal to the fair market value of the shares of Target Common Shares surrendered in the exchange. The fair market value of the Parent Series A Preferred Shares received by each holder of Series D Stock and the cash received by each holder of Series D Stock in lieu of a fractional share thereof, if any, or the consideration received by each holder of Series D Stock as determined under Section 262 of the DGCL in exchange for Target Dissenting Shares, if any, all in connection with the Merger, will be approximately equal to the fair market value of the shares of Series D Stock surrendered in the exchange.

        
   

  



  

3. To the knowledge of Parent, the aggregate fair market value, determined at the Effective Time, of the Parent Common Shares and the Parent Series A Preferred Shares to be received in the Merger will not be less than forty percent (40%) of the value, determined at the Effective Time, of the Target Common Shares and Series D Stock outstanding immediately before the Effective Time. For this purpose, we assume that the fair market value of the outstanding Target Common Shares and Series D Stock will equal the fair market value of the aggregate Merger Consideration.

  



  

4. Pursuant to the Merger, no holder of Target Common Shares will receive in exchange for Target Common Shares, directly or indirectly, any consideration other than the Common Conversion Consideration and cash in lieu of a fractional share thereof, if any, or the consideration determined under Section 262 of the DGCL in exchange for Target Dissenting Shares, if any.  Pursuant to the Merger, no holder of Series D Stock will receive in exchange for Series D Stock, directly or indirectly, any consideration other than the Preferred Conversion Consideration and cash in lieu of a fractional share thereof, if any, or the consideration determined under Section 262 of the DGCL in exchange for Target Dissenting Shares, if any. Neither Parent nor a person related to Parent as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(e)(4) (a " ** _Parent Related Person_** ") has participated, nor will participate, in a purchase, redemption or other acquisition of, Target Common Shares or Series D Stock, in connection with or in contemplation of the Merger, or otherwise as part of a plan of which the Merger is a part. Neither Parent, any Parent Related Person nor any affiliate of Parent, has paid or will pay, in connection with the Merger or otherwise as part of a plan of which the Merger is a part, any amount to, or on behalf of, any Target shareholder in connection with any sale, redemption or other disposition of any Target Common Shares, Series D Stock or Parent Common Shares. Any reference to Parent or Target in this paragraph includes a reference to any successor or predecessor of such corporation, except that Target is not treated as a predecessor of Parent and Parent is not treated as a successor of Target. Each partner of a partnership will be treated as owning or acquiring any stock owned or acquired, as the case may be, by the partnership (and as having paid any consideration paid by the partnership to acquire such stock) in accordance with that partners interest in the partnership. For purposes of this Officers Certificate, an acquisition of Parent Common Shares, Target Common Shares or Series D Stock by a person pursuant to any transaction, agreement, arrangement or other understanding with Parent, Target, a person related to Target as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(e)(4) (a " ** _Target Related Person_** ") or a Parent Related Person will be treated as made by Parent, Target, the Target Related Person or the Parent Related Person, respectively.

  



  

5. Following the Merger, Target will hold at least ninety percent (90%) of the fair market value of its net assets and at least seventy percent (70%) of the fair market value of its gross assets held immediately prior to the Merger.  Following the Merger, Target will hold at least ninety percent (90%) of the fair market value of 

  



        
   

  



  

Merger Subs net assets and at least seventy percent (70%) of the fair market
value of Merger Subs gross assets held immediately prior to the Merger. For
purposes of this representation, amounts paid by Target or Merger Sub to
shareholders who receive cash or other property, amounts used by Target or
Merger Sub to pay reorganization expenses, all redemptions and distributions
(except for regular, normal dividends) made by Target or Merger Sub in
connection with the Merger, and any cash or other property used by Target or
any of its subsidiaries to make payments to creditors in connection with the
Merger will be included as assets of Target or Merger Sub, respectively, held
immediately prior to the Merger.

  



  

6. Except as otherwise provided in Section 7.6 of the Merger Agreement, Parent, Merger Sub, Target and the shareholders of Target will each pay their respective expenses, if any, incurred in connection with the Merger.

  



  

7. There is no intercorporate indebtedness existing between Parent (or any of its subsidiaries, including Merger Sub), on the one hand, and Target (or any of its subsidiaries), on the other hand, that was issued, acquired or settled prior to the Effective Time at a discount or, to the knowledge of Parent, will be settled after the Effective Time at a discount.

  



  

8. Prior to the Merger, Parent will be in control of Merger Sub within the meaning of Section 368(c) of the Code.

  



  

9. In the Merger, shares of Target representing control of Target, as defined in Section 368(c) of the Code, will be exchanged solely for voting stock of Parent (except to the extent that cash is paid for fractional shares or cash or other consideration is paid for Target Dissenting Shares).  Furthermore, no expenses or liabilities of any Target stockholder will be assumed by Parent or Merger Sub, nor will any Target Common Shares or Series D Stock be acquired subject to any expenses or liabilities. For purposes of this representation, if any stock of Target is exchanged for cash or other property originating with Parent, such stock will be treated as outstanding stock of Target on the date of the Merger.

  



  

10. The Surviving Corporation will continue the "historic business" of Target or use a "significant portion" of Targets "historic business assets" in a business following the Merger (as such terms are used in Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(d)).

  



  

11. Parent is not an "investment company," as defined in Sections 368(a)(2)(F)(iii) and (iv) of the Code.

  



  

12. None of the compensation received (or to be received) by any stockholder-employees of Target will be separate consideration for, or allocable to, any Target Common Shares or Series D Stock held by such shareholder-employees; none of the shares of Parent Common Shares or Parent Series A Preferred Shares issued to any stockholder-employees pursuant to the Merger Agreement are (or will be) 

  



        
   

  



  

separate consideration for, or allocable to, any employment agreement; and
the compensation paid (or to be paid) to any shareholder-employees was
(or will be) for services actually rendered or to be rendered and was (or
will be) commensurate with amounts paid to third parties bargaining at
arms-length for similar services.

  



  

13. Parent has no stock repurchase program and has no current plan or intention to adopt such a plan.

  



  

14. Neither Parent nor any Parent Related Person owns, nor has it owned during the past five (5) years, any shares of stock of Target. Neither Parent nor any Parent Related Person has caused any other person to acquire stock of Target on behalf of Parent or a Parent Related Person, and will not directly or indirectly acquire any stock of Target in connection with the Merger, except as described in the Merger Agreement.

  



  

15. Parent has not, directly or indirectly, transferred any cash or property to Target (or any entity controlled directly or indirectly by Target) for less than full and adequate consideration and has not made any loan to Target (or any entity controlled directly or indirectly by Target) in anticipation of the Merger.

  



  

16. Parent has no plan or intention to liquidate, sell, merge, convert or otherwise dispose of Target or any of the assets of Target except for dispositions of assets made in the ordinary course of business.

  



  

17. Parent is paying no consideration for the Target Shares other than the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of a fractional share thereof or the consideration determined under Section 262 of the DGCL in exchange for Target Dissenting Shares, if any.

  



  

18. Merger Sub will have no liabilities assumed by Target, and will not transfer to Target any assets subject to liabilities, in the Merger.

  



  

19. Parent will not take, and Parent has no knowledge of any plan or intention of any of the Parent stockholders to take, any position on any federal, state or local income or franchise tax return, or take any other tax reporting position, that is inconsistent with the treatment of the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, unless otherwise required by a "determination" (as defined in Section 1313(a)(1) of the Code).

  



  

20. Except for in accordance with the terms of the Separation Agreements, no stock or securities of Parent, or, to the knowledge of Parent, no stock or securities of Target, will be issued to any Target stockholder for services rendered to or for the benefit of Parent or Target in connection with the Merger.

  



        
   

  



  

21. No stock or securities of Parent, or, to the knowledge of Parent, no stock or securities of Target, will be issued to any Target stockholder for any indebtedness owed to any Target stockholder in connection with the Merger.

  



  

22. The undersigned is authorized to make all of the representations set forth herein on behalf of Parent.

  



  

Terms used herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in, and shall
be interpreted in accordance with, the applicable federal income tax law
and regulations. Except as otherwise provided, capitalized terms used but
not defined herein have the meaning ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement
and the phrase " ** _to the knowledge of Parent_** " and other similar
phrases, shall have the meaning ascribed to such phrases in the Merger
Agreement. As used herein, the term " ** _Separation Agreements_** " means (i)
that certain Separation Agreement and Release, dated September 29, 2009, by
and between Target and S. Jeffrey Johnson; and (ii) that certain
Separation Agreement and Release, dated September 29, 2009, by and between
Target and Ben Daitch. Except as otherwise indicated, all "Section"
references contained herein refer to sections of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended.

  



  

Parent understands that Thompson and Knight LLP, as counsel to Target,
will rely, without further inquiry, on this certificate in rendering its
opinion concerning certain of the United States federal income tax
consequences of the Merger and hereby commits to inform them if, for any
reason, any of the foregoing representations or statements ceases to be true,
correct or complete prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

 ** _[Signature page follows]_**

  



        
   

  



  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have, on behalf of Parent, caused this Officers
Certificate to be executed on this [ ] day of
 20 .
