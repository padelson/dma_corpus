definitions in this Agreement, Purchaser shall not raise any objections to
resulting amounts. Seller shall make available to Purchaser such information
as is reasonably necessary to allow Purchaser to review and evaluate such
estimates. The Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance with
the same accounting principles, practices, methodologies and policies,
including the use of the same line items and line item entries, set forth on
and used in the preparation of the Sample Closing Statement, and, to the
extent not in conflict therewith, GAAP; _provided_ , _however_ , that assets
newly acquired and liabilities newly incurred following the date of the Sample
Closing Statement which cannot appropriately be placed in line items and line
item entries previously used by the Seller, but that constitute Purchased
Assets, Assumed Liabilities, Assumed Taxes or the assets or liabilities of an
IM Business Entity will also be included to the extent consistent with the
accounting principles, practices, methodologies and policies applied in
preparing the Sample Closing Statement. The principles, practices,
methodologies and policies determined in accordance with the immediately
preceding sentence are referred to herein as the " _Transaction
Accounting Principles_ ".

 



-7-  (c) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, the Seller shall cause to
be prepared and delivered to the Purchaser a working capital statement (the "
_Post-Closing Statement_ "), setting forth the Adjustment Amount and the
calculation of the Adjustment Amount, including the Closing Working Capital
and Cash Amount, in each case, prepared and calculated in good faith and in
the manner and on a basis consistent with the Transaction Accounting
Principles.

(d) Within thirty (30) days following receipt by the Purchaser of the Post-
Closing Statement, the Purchaser shall deliver written notice to the Seller of
any dispute the Purchaser has with respect to the preparation or content of
the Post-Closing Statement; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such disputes
will be limited to the determination of the Adjustment Amount and the
Purchaser may not dispute the accounting principles, practices, methodologies
and policies used in preparing the Post-Closing Statement unless they are
different than the Transaction Accounting Principles. If the Purchaser does
not so notify the Seller of a dispute with respect to the Post-Closing
Statement within such thirty (30)-day period, the Post-Closing Statement will
be final, conclusive and binding on the parties. In the event of such
notification of a dispute, the Purchaser and the Seller shall negotiate in
good faith to resolve such dispute. If the Purchaser and the Seller,
notwithstanding such good faith effort, fail to resolve such dispute within
fifteen (15) days after the Purchaser advises the Seller of its objections,
then the Purchaser and the Seller jointly shall engage Grant Thornton LLP
(the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ ") to resolve such dispute. As promptly
as practicable, and in any event not more than fifteen (15) days thereafter,
the Purchaser and the Seller shall each prepare and submit a presentation
detailing each partys complete statement of proposed resolution of the
dispute to the Independent Accounting Firm. As soon as practicable thereafter,
the Purchaser and the Seller shall cause the Independent Accounting Firm to
review this Agreement and the disputed items or amounts for the purpose of
calculating the Adjustment Amount. In making such calculation, the Independent
Accounting Firm shall consider only those items or amounts in the Post-
Closing Statement as to which the Purchaser has disagreed. Such Independent
Accounting Firm shall deliver to the Purchaser and the Seller, as promptly as
practicable, a report setting forth such calculation. Such report shall be
final and binding on the Purchaser and the Seller. The cost of such review
and report shall be borne by the party whose calculation of the Adjustment
Amount delivered pursuant to Section 1.09(c) or Section 1.09(d), as
applicable, is closer in value to the Adjustment Amount as finally delivered
by the Independent Accounting Firm, and otherwise equally by the Purchaser and
the Seller.

(e) For purposes of complying with the terms set forth in this Section 1.09,
each party shall cooperate with and make available to the other parties and
their respective representatives all information, records, data and working
papers (including the audit findings from the IM Business Entities 2011
audit, when available), in each case, to the extent related to the Purchased
Shares, Purchased Assets, Assumed Liabilities, Assumed Taxes, IM Business
Entities or IM Business, and shall permit access to its facilities and
personnel, as may be reasonably required in connection with the preparation
and analysis of the Post-Closing Statement and the resolution of any
disputes thereunder.

(f)(i) If the Adjustment Amount (as finally determined pursuant to Sections
1.09(c) and 1.09(d)) is less than the Estimated Adjustment Amount, then the
Purchase Price will be adjusted downward by the amount of such shortfall, and
the Seller shall pay or cause to be

 



-8-   paid an amount in cash equal to such shortfall to the Purchaser by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated
in writing by the Purchaser to the Seller. Any such payment is to be made
within five (5) Business Days of the date on which the Adjustment Amount is
finally determined pursuant to Sections 1.09(c) and 1.09(d).

(ii) If the Adjustment Amount (as finally determined pursuant to Sections
1.09(c) and 1.09(d)) is greater than the Estimated Adjustment Amount, then the
Purchase Price will be adjusted upward by the amount of such excess, and the
Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid an amount in cash equal to such excess
to the Seller by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or
accounts designated in writing by the Seller to the Purchaser. Any such
payment is to be made within five (5) Business Days of the date on which the
Adjustment Amount is finally determined pursuant to Sections 1.09(c) and
1.09(d).

 

1.10 _Allocation_. The Seller and the other Seller Entities, on the one hand,
and the Parent and the Purchaser, on the other hand, agree to allocate the
Purchase Price among the Purchased Shares and the Purchased Assets (and to
allocate the ADSP among the assets of the 338(h)(10) Designated Entities) (a)
as set forth in _Schedule A_ (for the avoidance of doubt, which schedule may
set forth certain allocation principles and certain specific allocations as
agreed upon by the Seller and the Purchaser prior to the date hereof) (the "
_Scheduled Allocation_ ") and (b) as set forth in an allocation statement to
be agreed upon by Parent and the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Seller
and the other Seller Entities, on the other hand (or as determined by the
Independent Accounting Firm, as set forth below) (the " _Allocation
Statement_ "). The Purchaser shall deliver to the Seller as soon as practical
after the Closing Purchasers proposal with respect to the Allocation
Statement. The Allocation Statement shall be made in accordance with Sections
338 and 1060 of the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder
(provided, for the avoidance of doubt, that the Allocation Statement shall
incorporate, reflect, and be consistent with the Scheduled
Allocation). Within forty-five (45) days following receipt by the Seller of
the Purchasers proposal with respect to the Allocation Statement, the Seller
shall deliver written notice to the Purchaser of any disagreement the Seller
has with respect to such proposal. If the Seller does not so notify the
Purchaser of a dispute with respect to such proposal within such forty-five
(45)-day period, the Purchasers proposal shall constitute the Allocation
Statement and shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties. In the
event of such notification of a dispute, the Purchaser and the Seller shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute. If the Purchaser and the
Seller, notwithstanding such good faith effort, fail to resolve such dispute
within fifteen (15) days after the Seller advises the Purchaser of its
objections, then the Purchaser and the Seller jointly shall engage the
Independent Accounting Firm to resolve such dispute. The Independent
Accounting Firm shall deliver to the Purchaser and the Seller, as promptly as
practicable, an allocation statement setting forth the allocation of the
Purchase Price among the Purchased Shares and the Purchased Assets in
accordance with this Agreement, the Scheduled Allocation, and applicable Law
(including, for the absence of doubt, Sections 338 and 1060 of the Code),
which statement shall be the Allocation Statement for purposes of this
Agreement. Such Allocation Statement shall be final and binding on the
Purchaser and the Seller. The cost of such review and report shall be borne
equally by the Purchaser and the Seller. The Purchaser and the Seller and
their respective Affiliates shall report and act, in each case, for Tax
purposes, and file Tax Returns (including, but not limited to Internal
Revenue Service (" _IRS_ ") Form 8883 and 8594) in all respects and for all
Tax purposes consistent with the Allocation Statement. Neither the Purchaser
nor the Seller nor their respective Affiliates shall

 



-9-   take any Tax position (whether in audits, Tax Returns or otherwise) that is
inconsistent with the Allocation Statement unless required to do so by
applicable Law or pursuant to a Final Determination.

1.11 _Non-Assignment_. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign
or transfer any of the Purchased Shares or Purchased Assets or any claim or
right or any benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom if an attempted
assignment or transfer thereof or change of control of any IM Business Entity
is (a) prohibited by Law, or (b) without the approval, authorization or
consent of, or granting or issuance of any license or permit by, any third
party thereto (or with respect thereto) or any Governmental
Entity (collectively " _Approval_ "), would (i) constitute a breach thereof,
(ii) be reasonably likely to subject any Seller Entity, Parent, the Purchaser,
or any IM Business Entity, or any of their respective officers, directors,
agents or Affiliates to civil or criminal liability, (iii) be reasonably
likely to make such assignment, transfer or change of control void or
voidable, or (iv) in any way negatively affect the rights of the Seller
Entities, Parent, the Purchaser or the IM Business Entities, and such
Approval is not obtained at or before the Closing. If the Closing occurs and
either of the circumstances described in clauses (a) or (b) of the preceding
sentence exist, then the Seller will cooperate with the Purchaser in good
faith without further consideration (other than as provided in subclause (y)
of this sentence) in any arrangement reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser
and the Seller intended to both (x) provide the Purchaser with the benefit of
any such Purchased Shares or Purchased Asset, and (y) cause the Purchaser to
bear all costs and obligations of or under any such Purchased Assets in
accordance with this Agreement. Any transfer or assignment to the Purchaser
of any Purchased Asset that shall require Approval as described above in this
Section shall be made subject to such Approval being obtained.

1.12 _Delayed Transfer of Hyderabad Facility_. (a) If the Hyderabad Approvals
have not been obtained prior to the Closing Date, then on the Hyderabad
Transfer Date, (i) Parent and the Purchaser shall, and shall cause the IM
Business Entities to, sell, assign, transfer and convey to the Seller or
another Seller Entity designated by the Seller, and the Seller or such Seller
Entities shall purchase, acquire and accept from the IM Business Entities,
all of the right, title and interest of Parent and its Subsidiaries, including
Purchaser and the IM Business Entities, in (A) the Hyderabad Retained
Facility, (B) such computer hardware, equipment, furniture, and other similar
personal property located in the Hyderabad Facility as is used primarily to
provide services to the businesses of the Seller and its Subsidiaries other
than the IM Business as of immediately prior to the Closing, including the
property set forth on _Schedule 1.12(a)(i)(B)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedules, (C) the Contracts and Intellectual Property set forth on Schedule
1.12(a)(i)(C) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules, and (D) any cash or current
assets generated by the operation of the assets described in clauses (A),
(B), or (C) from the Closing Date through the Hyderabad Transfer Date (the
assets described in clauses (A), (B), (C) and (D) collectively, the "
_Hyderabad Retained Assets_ "); and (ii) the Seller shall assume or retain,
as applicable, and agree to discharge or perform all of the liabilities
(including liabilities for Taxes) of the Seller Entities and the IM Business
Entities that arise out of, and bear all costs and obligations of or under,
the Hyderabad Retained Assets or the Hyderabad Retained Employees or the
conduct of business related to the Hyderabad Retained Assets (collectively,
the " _Hyderabad Retained Liabilities_ "). If the Hyderabad Approvals have
not been obtained prior to the Closing Date, then in respect of the transfer
of the Hyderabad Retained Assets and Hyderabad Retained Liabilities, 

 



-10-   on the Hyderabad Transfer Date, Seller shall cause an Indian Subsidiary of
the Seller designated by the Seller to pay to Convergys Information Management
(India) Pvt. Ltd., by wire transfer(s) to one or more bank accounts
designated in writing by Convergys Information Management (India) Pvt. Ltd.
(such designation to be made at least two (2) Business Days prior to the
Hyderabad Transfer Date), the amount of Five Million Nine Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($5,900,000) (the " _Hyderabad Payment Amount_ "), and the Purchaser
shall pay to the Seller, by wire transfer(s) to one or more bank accounts
designated in writing by the Seller (such designation to be made at least two
(2) Business Days prior to the Hyderabad Transfer Date), the Hyderabad Payment
Amount.

(b) If the Hyderabad Approvals have not been obtained prior to the Closing
Date, then anything to the contrary in Section 4.09 notwithstanding, Purchaser
shall, and shall cause its applicable Affiliates to, effective as of the
Hyderabad Transfer Date, transfer (or cause the applicable IM Business Entity
to transfer) each IM Business Entity Employee who is listed on _Schedule
1.12(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules (each, a " _Hyderabad Retained
Employee_ "), which shall be updated by the Seller, subject to the consent of
the Purchaser, prior to the Closing and as close as practicable to the Closing
to list each IM Business Entity Employee at the Hyderabad Facility who does
not perform a majority of his or her duties on behalf of the IM Business,
from the applicable IM Business Entity to a Seller Entity (or an Affiliate of
a Seller Entity designated by a Seller Entity) such that, immediately after
the Hyderabad Transfer Date, each such Hyderabad Retained Employee shall
be employed by a Seller Entity (or such Affiliate) on no less favorable terms
and with continuity of service. For the avoidance of doubt, except as set
forth otherwise in Section 4.09, the Hyderabad Retained Employees shall not be
Continuing Employees for any purpose or provision of this Agreement.

(c) If the Hyderabad Approvals have not been obtained prior to the Closing
Date, then during the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the
Hyderabad Transfer Date, the Purchaser shall provide Seller with its
reasonable cooperation in obtaining the Hyderabad Approvals.

 

(d) If the Hyderabad Approvals have not been obtained prior to the Closing
Date, then during the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the
Hyderabad Transfer Date, except as the Seller may consent in writing,
Purchaser shall conduct the operations of the Hyderabad Retained Assets in the
ordinary course consistent with past practice, and the Purchaser shall not,
and shall not permit the IM Business Entities to: (i) except as required by
applicable Law or the terms of an applicable Employee Plan, grant to any
Hyderabad Retained Employee any increase in compensation or benefits; (ii)
except in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice,
incur or assume any liabilities, obligations or indebtedness for borrowed
money that are Hyderabad Retained Liabilities, or (iii) sell, lease, license
or otherwise dispose of any Hyderabad Retained Assets to any Person other
than an IM Business Entity.

(e) Anything to the contrary in this Section 1.12 notwithstanding, if the
Hyderabad Approvals have not been obtained by the first anniversary of the
Closing Date, then each of the parties shall use their reasonable best efforts
to wind down and terminate operations of the Hyderabad Retained Assets and
terminate the Hyderabad Retained Employees or transfer them to an entity
designated by the Seller. Upon completion of such wind down and termination

 



-11-   or transfers, the obligations of the parties pursuant to this Section 1.12
shall terminate; provided, however, that (i) the Sellers obligations pursuant
to Section 5.06 and Section 8.02 shall not be affected by such wind down and
termination and (ii) the Seller Entities shall be solely responsible for all
costs, expenses, liabilities and obligations arising out of such wind down,
and termination or transfers. 

1.13 _Withholding_. Any party shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
any payment payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as such party is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of any such payment
under any applicable U.S. federal, state or local, or other foreign Tax law at
the applicable rate for such withholding, unless, with respect to a certain
payment, the payee provides the payor with a valid exemption from or reduction
of withholding tax in respect of such payment at least five (5) Business Days
prior to the date of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
and paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
person in respect of which such deduction and withholding were made.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SELLER

Except as set forth in, or qualified by any matter set forth in, the Seller
Disclosure Schedules (it being agreed that the disclosure of any matter in the
Seller Disclosure Schedules shall apply to the corresponding Section or
Subsection of this Agreement, as well as to matters in other Sections or
Subsections of this Agreement with respect to which the applicability of such
disclosure is reasonably apparent), the Seller hereby represents and warrants

and authority, and each of the Seller Entities that owns any Purchased Shares

consummate the Transaction and the other transactions contemplated hereby.
Seller is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in
good standing in each jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary,
except for those jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have an IM Business Material Adverse
Effect. Seller has heretofore delivered to Purchaser true and complete copies
of the articles of incorporation and code of regulations of Seller as
currently in effect.

 

2.02 _Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability_. The Seller has full
power and authority to execute this Agreement and to consummate the
Transaction and the other transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and
delivery by the Seller of this Agreement and the consummation by the Seller of
the Transaction and the other transactions contemplated hereby have been
duly authorized by all necessary corporate action of the Seller. The Seller
has

 



-12-   duly executed and delivered this Agreement, and this Agreement constitutes
its valid and binding obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with
its terms.

 

2.03 _No Conflicts; Consents_. The execution and delivery by the Seller of
this Agreement does not, and the consummation of the Transaction and the
other transactions contemplated hereby and compliance by the Seller with the
terms hereof will not, conflict with, or result in any violation of or default
(with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a
right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to
loss of a benefit under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the
Purchased Shares or Purchased Assets under, any provision of (a) any
Seller Entitys organizational documents, (b) any Contract to which any
Seller Entity is a party or by which any of a Seller Entitys properties or
assets are bound, or (c) any Judgment or Law applicable to any Seller Entity
or its properties or assets; except, in each case of clauses (b) and (c), for
any such items that have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, an IM Business Material Adverse Effect. No
consent of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any Governmental
Entity is required to be obtained or made by or with respect to the Seller
Entities in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this

the IM Business Entities or any other securities or obligations convertible or

(or his or her dependent or beneficiary); 

(vii) such plan, to the extent it is subject to the group health plan

(ix) such plan has been operated and administered in all material respects in
accordance with its terms and applicable Law, including but not limited to

timely fulfillment of any notice, registration, reporting and filing
obligation;

 

(x) except as has not resulted and would not reasonably be expected to result,
individually or in the aggregate, in a material liability, any contributions
and insurance premiums required to be made under the terms of such plan have
been timely made and, to the extent not yet due, any contributions, premiums
and other liabilities as to such plan have been appropriately accrued on the
IM Business Financial Statements; and

(xi) such plan has no terms or other condition that could prevent such plans
sponsor from amending such plan in any manner whatsoever or terminating such
plan and the obligations to provide benefits under such plan, except for (A)
benefits that as of the date of the amendment or termination have been
accrued under the terms of such plan in the event that such plan is an
employee pension benefit plan (within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA),

(g) With respect to any Assumed Plan, except as has not resulted and would not
reasonably be expected to result, individually or in the aggregate, in a
material liability, there

 



-28-   are no actions, suits or claims (other than routine claims for benefits)

any funds, accruals and reserves under the International Plans.

(i) If an Assumed Plan is a nonqualified deferred compensation plan as defined
in Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(a): (i) such plan is in both
documentary and operational compliance, in all material respects, with the
regulations issued under Code Section 409A, and (ii) to the Sellers
Knowledge, nothing has occurred, whether by action or failure to act, or is
reasonably expected or intended to occur, that would subject an individual
having rights under such plan to a Tax imposed under Code Section 409A(a)(1)
or 409A(b). For any Assumed Plan that is not intended to be subject to Code
Section 409A because it is not a nonqualified deferred compensation plan
under Treasury Regulations section 1.409A-1(a)(2) through 1.409A-1(a)(5), or
due to the application of Treasury Regulations section 1.409A-1(b), to the
Sellers Knowledge, all of the conditions required to retain such treatment
remain in effect and are not expected to change so as to subject such plan to
Code Section 409A.

(j) No Assumed Plan provides any participant therein with the right to any
gross-up, indemnification or other reimbursement for any tax incurred,
including under Section 409A, 457A or 4999 of the Code. No Employee Plan,
individually or collectively, will result in the payment of any amount that
would not be deductible by any of the IM Business Entities under Section 280G
of the Code.

(k) There has been no amendment to, written interpretation of or announcement
(whether or not written) by the Seller or any of its Affiliates relating to,
or change in employee participation or coverage under, any Assumed Plan that
would materially increase the expense of maintaining such plan above the level
of expense incurred in respect thereof for the most recent fiscal year ended
prior to the date hereof.

 

2.17 _Labor Relations; Employees_. (a) The Seller and its Affiliates are not,
with respect to any IM Employee, a party to, bound by, or negotiating in
respect of, any collective bargaining agreement or any other agreement with
any labor union, association or other employee group, nor, to the Knowledge of
the Seller, is any IM Employee represented by any labor union or similar
association. The consent or formal consultation of, or the rendering of formal
advice by, any labor or trade union, works council or other employee
representative body is not required for the Seller to enter into this
Agreement or to consummate the Transaction.

(b) No labor union or employee organization has been certified or recognized
as the collective bargaining representative of any IM Employees. To the
Knowledge of the

 



-29-   Seller, no efforts to have a labor union or employee organization certified
or recognized as the collective bargaining representative of any IM Employee
are pending.

 

(c) Within the last three (3) years, there has been no labor strike, work
stoppage, lockout, slowdown or other material labor dispute with respect to
any IM Employee and no labor strike, work stoppage, lockout, slowdown or other
material labor dispute is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Seller,
threatened that involves IM Employees. Except as has not resulted and
would not reasonably be expected to result, individually or in the aggregate,
in a material liability, (i) the Seller and its Affiliates have not, with
respect to any IM Employee, committed any unfair labor practice or violated
any employment Laws, including those relating to labor management relations,
wages, hours, overtime, employee classification, discrimination, sexual
harassment, civil rights, affirmative action, work authorization, immigration,
safety and health, information privacy and security, workers compensation,
continuation coverage under group health plans, wage payment and the payment
and withholding of taxes, and (ii) there is no charge or complaint against the
Seller, any of the Sellers Affiliates or any of the IM Business Entities,
with respect to any IM Employee, by a Governmental Entity pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Seller, threatened.

(d) None of the Seller and its Affiliates is a party to any Contract or
subject to any requirement that in any manner restricts it from relocating,
consolidating, merging or closing, in whole or in part, any portion of the IM
Business, subject to applicable Law, other than any such Contract that is
terminable by the Seller or its Affiliates without material liability to the
IM Business.

 

(e) Except as has not resulted and would not reasonably be expected to result,
individually or in the aggregate, in a material liability, all IM Employees
have been, or will have been on or before the Closing, paid all compensation
(including any overtime, shift differential non-salary compensation, bonuses,
commissions, or applicable severance and termination pay) owed and payable
to them by the Seller Entities as of the Closing.

(f) Except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement, neither the
execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement by the Seller nor the
consummation of the Transaction and the other transactions contemplated hereby
(either alone or together with any other event) will (i) result in any payment
or benefit (including severance, unemployment compensation, golden parachute,
bonus or otherwise) to any IM Employee, (ii) increase any compensation or
benefits otherwise payable to any IM Employee, (iii) result in the
acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such benefits, (iv)
trigger any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of
compensation or benefits under, or increase the amount payable or trigger any
other material obligation under, any Assumed Plan or (v) limit or restrict
the right of the IM Business Entities (and, after the Closing, Purchaser and
its Affiliates) to merge, amend or terminate any Assumed Plan.

(g) No independent contractors, temporary employees or contract laborers of
the IM Business Entities (including without limitation independent contractors
whose contracts are Assigned Contracts) have any reasonable basis to claim
status as an employee of the Seller Entities or the IM Business Entities.

 



-30-  (h) Neither the Seller nor any of its Affiliates has taken any action that
would reasonably be expected to cause Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to
have any material liability or other material obligation following the Closing
Date under the WARN Act.

(i) As of the date hereof, no IM Employee who holds a title of Grade D or
above has given notice or, to Sellers Knowledge, intends to give notice to
the Seller or any of its Affiliates that he or she intends to resign or
retire as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
otherwise within one year after the Closing Date.

(j) The Seller is in compliance in all material respects with the provisions
of the Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970 ("CLRA"), the
Employees Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 and the
Employees State Insurance Act, 1948. All independent contractors engaged by
the Seller for providing contract laborers have the necessary licenses
required under CLRA and are in compliance with the provisions thereof.

through the date of this Agreement, except for any changes set forth in

of goods and services from or sales to the Seller or to materially change any
terms of the Contracts with such Material Customer.

and maintained by the Seller and its Subsidiaries as of the date of this
Agreement that relate to the IM Business, as conducted by the Seller and its
Subsidiaries, are set forth in _Schedule 2.19_ of the Seller Disclosure

or in the aggregate, an IM Business Material Adverse Effect, (a) there is no
claim by Seller relating to the IM Business that is pending under any of such
policies as to which coverage has been denied or disputed by the underwriters
of such policies or in respect of which the underwriters have reserved their
rights, (b) all premiums payable under all such policies have been timely paid
and Seller has otherwise fully complied with the terms and conditions of all
such policies, and (c) such policies of insurance (or other policies providing
substantially similar insurance coverage) remain in full force and effect. To

increase with respect to, or material alteration of coverage under, any of
such policies.

2.20 _Seller Entity Credit Enhancements_. _Schedule 2.20_ of the Seller
Disclosure Schedules sets forth a true and complete list and description of
the material arrangements, including, but not limited to, surety, performance

the outstanding voting securities of Seller or any of its Affiliates (other

Business, (y) creating, terminating, or divesting relationships, ventures,
contractual rights or obligations of Parent, the Purchaser or the IM Business
Entities (or any of their respective

 



-35-   Subsidiaries) or the IM Business, and (z) otherwise taking or committing to
take any action that would limit Parents, the Purchasers or the IM Business
Entities freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain or
hold, directly or indirectly, any businesses, assets, equity interests,
product lines or properties of Parent, the Purchaser or the IM Business
Entities (including any of their respective Subsidiaries) in each case as may
be required in order to obtain all approvals, consents, clearances,
expirations or terminations of waiting periods, authorizations and other
confirmations required directly or indirectly under any Antitrust Law or to
avoid the commencement of any action to prohibit the Transaction or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any Antitrust Law, or,
in the alternative, to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of,
any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any action or
proceeding seeking to prohibit the Transaction or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that
neither the Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries shall become subject to, or
consent or agree to or otherwise take any action with respect to, any
requirement, condition, understanding, agreement or order of a Governmental
Entity to sell, to hold separate or otherwise dispose of, or to conduct,
restrict, operate, invest or otherwise change the assets or business of the IM
Business Entities or the IM Business, unless such requirement, condition,
understanding, agreement or order is binding on the Seller only in the
event that the Closing occurs. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, nothing in this Agreement shall require Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries to, nor shall Seller or any of its Subsidiaries without the prior
written consent of Purchaser agree or offer to: (i) effect any divestiture
of, or hold separate (including by establishing a trust or otherwise), or
agree to restrict its ownership or operation of, any business or assets of the
IM Business or of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries, or to enter into any
settlement or consent decree, or agree to any material limitation on the
operation or conduct of the businesses of the IM Business or of Purchaser or
its Subsidiaries, (ii) otherwise waive, abandon or alter any rights or
obligations of the IM Business or of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries, or (iii)
take any other action contemplated by the first sentence of this Section
4.01(c), in each of cases (i), (ii) and (iii), that would have an adverse
effect on the Purchaser and its Subsidiaries or on the IM Business, in either
case of a magnitude that, if affecting the IM Business only, would or would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or aggregated with other actions
described in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) above, an IM Business Material
Adverse Effect (provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, none of the
exclusions set forth in the definition of IM Business Material Adverse Effect
shall be deemed to apply). 

(d) Each of Parent, Purchaser and Seller shall not, and shall cause each of
its Affiliates not to, take any action which is intended to or which would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the ability of any of the parties
hereto from obtaining (or cause delay in obtaining) any Regulatory Approvals,
from performing its covenants and agreements under this Agreement, or from
consummating the Transaction and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(e) Prior to the Closing, each party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
to, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, and to cooperate in
obtaining, all consents from third parties other than Regulatory Approvals
necessary or appropriate to permit the consummation of the Transaction and
the other transactions contemplated hereby including, without limitation, the
consents and approvals referred to in Section 2.03 and 3.03 hereof, and in
addition, prior to the Closing, Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain the consents set forth on _Schedule_

 



-36-    _4.01(e)(i)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules (the " _Required Third
Party Consents_ ") in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser
and remaining in full force and effect at Closing; _provided_ , _however_ ,
in each case, that the parties shall not be required to pay or commit to pay
any amount to (or incur any obligation in favor of) any Person from whom any
such consent may be required (other than de minimis fees or nominal filing or
application fees); _provided_ , _further_ , that the Seller shall not enter
into any amendment or additional agreement with the counterparty from whom a
Required Third Party Consent is sought that is adverse to any IM Business
Entity, the Purchaser or Parent without the prior written consent of
Purchaser. Seller shall keep Purchaser reasonably apprised of the status of
obtaining any Required Third Party Consent. If Seller shall not have obtained
a Required Third Party Consent on or before the Closing Date, it shall take
the actions (if any) set forth in _Schedule 4.01(e)(ii)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Schedules for the relevant Required Third Party Consent. The
actions set forth in _Schedule 4.01(e)(ii)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedules and indemnification identified in Item 1 of _Schedule 8.02(a)_ of
the Seller Disclosure Schedules shall be the sole remedies, if any, of Parent
and the Purchaser for the failure to obtain any Required Third Party Consent,
regardless of the reason for such failure, and the Seller shall have no other
liability or indemnification for such failure. Nothing in this Section 4.01(e)
limits the rights and obligations of the parties under the other provisions
of this Section 4.01.

4.02 _Covenants Relating to Conduct of IM Business_. (a) Except as set forth
in _Schedule 4.02_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules or as required by
applicable Law or as otherwise expressly permitted or required by the terms of
this Agreement, from the date of this Agreement to the Closing, except as the
Purchaser may consent in writing (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), the Seller shall (and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to) conduct the IM Business in the ordinary course and, to
the extent consistent therewith, use commercially reasonable efforts to keep
intact their respective businesses, keep available the services of their
current employees and preserve their relationships with customers, suppliers,
licensors, licensees, distributors and others with whom they deal, in each
case, as it relates to the IM Business, _provided_ , _however_ , that no
action by Seller or its Subsidiaries with respect to matters specifically
addressed by any provision of Section 4.02(b) shall be deemed a breach of
this Section 4.02(a) unless such action would constitute a breach of such
provision of Section 4.02(b).

(b) The foregoing notwithstanding, except as set forth in _Schedule 4.02_ of
the Seller Disclosure Schedules or as required by applicable Law or as
otherwise expressly permitted or required by the terms of this Agreement or
as relates to Taxes (Taxes being governed by Article V), the Seller shall not
do (or permit any of its Subsidiaries, including any of the IM Business
Entities, to do) any of the following without the prior written consent of
the Purchaser (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed):

(i) except (A) as required by applicable Law (including to avoid the
imposition of any penalty taxes under Section 409A of the Code) or the terms
of any Employee Plan as in effect on the date hereof or (B) as expressly
contemplated pursuant to Section 4.09, (1) grant any severance, retention or
termination pay to, or enter into or amend any severance, retention,
termination, employment, consulting, bonus, change in control or severance

any such employee who (i) holds a title of Grade A, B, C or D and (ii) has an
annual base salary or wage rate not in excess of $100,000 (or for non-U.S.
employees, the applicable foreign currency equivalent) (the " _Non-Key
Employees_ ")), (3) establish, adopt, enter into or amend any employee benefit
plan or arrangement with respect to any IM Employee (other than any
establishment, adoption, entering into or amendment of a Retained Plan in a
manner that applies substantially similarly to employees of Seller or any
Affiliate of Seller who are not IM Employees and that does not materially
increase the cost to any IM Business Entity), (4) terminate the employment of
any IM Employee (other than for cause or in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice for any Non-Key Employee), (5) hire any
individual who, upon such hiring, would be an IM Employee, other than hiring
in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice an individual
who would be a Non-Key Employee or (6) transfer the employment of (x) any
IM Employee (other than a Removed Employee or Non-Continuing Employee) to any
Seller Entity or (y) any individual who is not an IM Employee to any IM
Business Entity;

 

(ii) incur or assume any liabilities, obligations or indebtedness, in each
case, for borrowed money with respect to the IM Business or guarantee any
such liabilities, obligations or indebtedness, other than (A) in the ordinary
course of business; (B) liabilities, obligations or indebtedness to the Seller
or any of its wholly owned Subsidiaries; or (C) as is satisfied or assumed by
any Seller Entity prior to or at Closing such that no IM Business Entity is
liable for such liabilities, obligations, indebtedness or guarantees following
the Closing;

 

(iii) make any material change in any method of financial accounting or
financial accounting practice or policy applicable to the IM Business, other
than those required by GAAP;

Schedules; (B) capital expenditures and commitments required on an emergency
basis or to respond to an event of force majeure; and (C) other capital
expenditures and commitments in an amount not in excess of $2,500,000 for all
commitments in the aggregate;

 

(vi) sell, assign, lease, license, abandon, allow to lapse, transfer, convey
or otherwise dispose of (A) any of the Purchased Assets to any person other
than the Seller or any of its wholly owned Subsidiaries or (B) any of the
properties or assets of the Purchased Entities (including, in each case, any
IM Business Intellectual Property) to any person other than an IM Business
Entity, except in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice or for the purpose of disposing of obsolete or worthless

 



-38-   assets with suitable replacements being obtained therefor as necessary for
the continued conduct of the IM Business as presently conducted;

 

(vii) enter into, modify, amend, extend or terminate any Lease, other than any
such entry into, modification, amendment, extension or termination that would
not reasonably be expected to adversely affect the IM Business;

any such modification, amendment, extension or termination that is entered
into in the ordinary course of business and that would not reasonably be
expected to adversely affect the IM Business;

(ix) enter into any Contract that would be a Material Contract, other than any
such Contract entered into in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice and that would not reasonably be expected to adversely affect
the IM Business;

(x) enter into, modify, amend or extend any Contract that is or would be a
Scheduled Contract;

(xi) other than in connection with actions permitted by Section 4.02(b)(v) or
Section 4.02(b)(vi), permit any IM Business Entity to make any loans, advances
or capital contributions to, or investments in, any other Person (other than
any other IM Business Entity), other than in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice;

(xii) enter into any agreement or arrangement that limits or otherwise
restricts in any material respect any IM Business Entity from engaging or
competing in any line of business, in any location or with any Person;

(xiii) permit any of the IM Business Entities to enter into or agree to enter
into any merger or consolidation with any Person other than another IM
Business Entity;

(xiv) settle, or offer or propose to settle any litigation, investigation,

Business Entities that requires the payment by an IM Business Entity of more
than $1,000,000 individually or that limits or otherwise restricts the IM
Business from operating in the ordinary course of business in any material
respect; or

(xv) authorize any of, or commit or agree to take, whether in writing or
otherwise, or do any of, the foregoing actions.

4.03  _Confidentiality_. The Purchaser acknowledges that the information
being provided to it in connection with the Transaction and the other
transactions contemplated hereby is subject to the terms of a confidentiality
agreement between Parent and the Seller effective as of November 7, 2011, as
amended (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), the terms of which are
incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Effective upon, and only
upon, the Closing, 

 



-39-   the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate with respect to information
relating solely to the IM Business; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and
the Purchaser acknowledge that their obligations of confidentiality and non-
disclosure with respect to any and all other information provided to it by the
Seller or its Representatives concerning the Seller or any of its Affiliates
shall continue to remain subject to the terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement for such period of time as provided in the
Confidentiality Agreement, any termination of the Confidentiality Agreement
that has or would otherwise occur notwithstanding, until such time as the
information is no longer deemed to be Confidential Information, as that term
is defined in the Confidentiality Agreement.

4.04 _Access to Information_. (a) The Seller shall afford to the Purchaser
reasonable access, upon reasonable notice during normal business hours during
the period prior to the Closing, to all the properties, books, Contracts and
records of the Seller and its Subsidiaries related to the IM Business
(including, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, personnel records of
the IM Employees) and, during such period shall furnish promptly to the
Purchaser, at the Purchasers expense, any information concerning the IM
Business as the Purchaser may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such access shall, in all cases, be subject to confidentiality
obligations that the Seller Entities have to third parties with respect to
records, documents and information, and provided such access does not
unreasonably disrupt the normal operations of the IM Business. All such
information and documents obtained by the Purchaser shall be subject to the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. The Seller shall have no obligation
to disclose, and neither Parent nor the Purchaser shall disclose, to any
Representative of Parent or the Purchaser any confidential information
relating to the Seller Entities, the IM Business Entities or the IM Business
unless such Representative shall have agreed in writing to be bound by the
terms the Confidentiality Agreement and such writing shall have been delivered
to the Seller.

 

(b) The Purchaser shall afford to the Seller reasonable access, upon
reasonable notice during normal business hours during the period following
the Closing, to all the properties, books, Contracts and records of the IM
Business Entities, and, during such period shall furnish promptly to the
Seller, at the Sellers expense, any information concerning the IM Business as
the Seller may reasonably request, in each case in order to permit the Seller
Entities to satisfy financial reporting obligations and comply with applicable
Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that such access shall, in all cases, be subject
to confidentiality obligations that the IM Business Entities have to third
parties with respect to records, documents and information, and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that such access does not unreasonably disrupt the normal
operations of the IM Business. The Seller shall, and shall cause the other
Seller Entities to, keep confidential and not use for any purpose for one year
all non-public information received pursuant to this Section 4.04(b) regarding
the IM Business, subject to the use by the Seller contemplated by the
preceding sentence and except as contemplated by the Transaction Document;
_provided_ that such confidentiality obligations shall not apply to any
information that becomes public without breach of such obligations by the
Seller, any information that is received by the Seller Entities from a third
party not known by the Seller Entities to be bound by a confidentiality
obligation to the IM Business Entities, and any information that is
independently developed by the Seller Entities.

4.05 _Publicity_. Each party has allowed or shall allow the other party
reasonable time to comment on such partys initial press release, if any, to
be issued with respect to the

 



-40-   Transaction and the other transactions contemplated hereby. From the date
hereof through the Closing Date, neither Seller, on the one hand, nor Parent
nor Purchaser, on the other hand, shall make any public statement, release or
announcement concerning the Transaction and the other transactions
contemplated hereby that is inconsistent with such initial press release, and
in any case shall allow the other party (to the extent feasible and permitted
by Law) reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance
of such issuance (it being understood that the consent of such other party
shall not be required).

 

4.06 _No Solicitation_. (a) From and after the date of this Agreement, the
Seller shall not, nor shall it permit any of its Subsidiaries to, nor shall
it authorize or knowingly permit any officer, director or employee of or any
investment banker, attorney, accountant or other advisor or representative
(collectively, the " _Representatives_ ") of the Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries to, (i) solicit, initiate, endorse or knowingly encourage or
facilitate (including by way of furnishing non-public information) any IM
Proposal or offer or afford access to the employees, business,
properties, assets, books or records of the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries
with respect to, or the making or completion of, any IM Proposal, (ii) enter
into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any Person any information or data with respect to,
or otherwise cooperate in any way with, any agreement with respect to any IM
Proposal, or (iii) resolve, propose or agree to do any of the foregoing. The
Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, immediately after the date
of this Agreement, (x) cease and cause to be terminated any existing
activities, discussions or negotiations by the Seller, its Subsidiaries or any
Representative of the Seller with any Person conducted heretofore with
respect to any of the foregoing and (y) promptly request and use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the prompt return or cause the destruction of all
copies of confidential information previously furnished to any such Person.

(b) After the date of this Agreement, the Seller shall promptly inform its
Representatives, and shall cause its Subsidiaries promptly to inform their
respective Representatives, of the obligations under this Section 4.06.
Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the
provisions of this Section 4.06 by the Sellers Subsidiaries or the
Representatives of the Seller or its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a
breach of this Section 4.06 by the Seller.

4.07 _Intercompany Arrangements_. Prior to or at the Closing, all intercompany
balances and accounts between the Seller Entities, on the one hand, and the IM
Business Entities, on the other hand, shall be eliminated or settled, whether
by way of repayment, satisfaction, distribution, contribution or otherwise,
and, except for the Transaction Documents to be entered into in connection
with this Agreement, all Contracts and other arrangements between the Seller
Entities, on the one hand, and the IM Business Entities, on the other hand,
shall automatically terminate, in each case without further payment or
performance and cease to have any further force and effect, such that no
party thereto shall have any further obligations therefor or thereunder
following the Closing.

4.08 _Tail Coverage_. On or prior to the Closing Date, the Seller shall cause
the IM Business Entities to purchase errors and omissions insurance tail
coverage for a period of six years after the Closing Date covering any and all
occurrences prior to the Closing with respect to the IM Business. Such
coverage shall be in a minimum amount of $20,000,000, with a

 



-41-   maximum deductible of $2,500,000. The foregoing notwithstanding, in lieu of
causing the purchase of such errors and omissions insurance tail coverage, the
Seller may maintain, for a period of six years following the Closing Date,
its existing errors and omissions insurance coverage with respect to
occurrences prior to the Closing with respect to the IM Business, or
replacement insurance with deductible and coverage limits at least
as favorable to the insured as the Sellers errors and omissions coverage as
of the date of this Agreement. Any tail or replacement insurance required to
be purchased pursuant to this paragraph shall be written by one or more
insurance companies having an A.M. Best or comparable rating at least equal
to that of the insurance company that has written the Sellers errors and
omissions insurance coverage as of the date of this Agreement.

 

4.09 _Employee Matters_. (a) _Employee Schedule_. _Schedule 4.09(a)(i)_ of
the Seller Disclosure Schedules sets forth each employee who is employed by
an IM Business Entity that is not an IM Corporate Service Employee (each, an "
_IM Business Entity Employee_ ") as of March 18, 2012, and shall be updated by
the Seller (and promptly furnished to the Purchaser) to be current as of
fifteen (15) Business Days following the date hereof, and shall be updated by
Seller and promptly furnished to the Purchaser no less frequently than every
ten (10) Business Days thereafter until the Closing Date. _Schedule
4.09(a)(ii)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules sets forth each employee who
is employed by a Seller Entity and performs (or would perform but for being on
any leave described below) a majority of his or her duties on behalf of the
IM Business but is not an IM Corporate Service Employee (each, an " _IM Seller
Entity Employee_ ") as of March 18, 2012, and shall be updated by the Seller
to be current as of fifteen (15) Business Days following the date hereof (and
promptly furnished to the Purchaser), and shall be updated by Seller (and
promptly furnished to the Purchaser) no less frequently than every ten (10)
Business Days thereafter until the Closing Date. Each such schedule sets
forth, for each employee set forth on such schedule and to the extent
permissible under applicable privacy Laws, such employees employee
identification number, employer, title, hire date, date of birth, location,
annual base salary or hourly wage rate, most recent annual bonus received,
target bonus opportunity, whether full- or part-time and whether active or on
leave (and, if on leave, the nature of the leave, the commencement date of
leave and the expected return date). _Schedule 4.09(a)(iii)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Schedules sets forth, for each independent contractor who is an
individual engaged by an IM Business Entity as of February 29, 2012, such
service providers duties, rate of base fees and, if applicable, incentive
opportunity, and shall be updated by the Seller (and promptly furnished to the
Purchaser) to be current as of the last day of each calendar month thereafter
until the Closing Date.

 

(b) _Continuing Employees and Removed Employees_. _Schedule 4.09(b)_ of the
Seller Disclosure Schedules, which shall be updated by the Seller, subject to
the consent of the Purchaser, to be current as of a date fifteen (15) Business
Days following the date hereof and delivered to the Purchaser no later than
twenty (20) Business Days following the date hereof, sets forth each IM
Business Entity Employee who shall not continue to be employed by the IM
Business Entities on or after the Closing Date (each, a " _Removed Employee_
"). Effective as of as close as practicable to the Closing Date, the Seller
shall (or shall cause the applicable IM Business Entity to) transfer each
Removed Employee from the applicable IM Business Entity to a Seller Entity
such that, immediately prior to the Closing, each such employee shall be
employed by a Seller Entity. No later than ten (10) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, the Purchaser may designate IM Business Entity Employees and
IM Seller Entity Employees that

 



-42-   will not continue with or transfer to the IM Business (each, a " _Non-
Continuing IM Business Employee_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, the Removed
Employees, Non-Continuing IM Business Employees and Hyderabad Retained
Employees shall in each case not be Continuing Employees for any purpose or
provision of this Agreement, and Seller and its Affiliates shall, except as
expressly set forth otherwise in this Section 4.09, retain or assume all
liabilities for such employees, regardless of when incurred. Effective as of
the Closing, each individual who as of the Closing is an IM Business Entity
Employee who is not a Removed Employee or a Non-Continuing IM Business
Employee shall, subject to Section 1.12, continue to be an employee of the
applicable IM Business Entity immediately after the Closing (each a "
_Continuing IM Business Employee_ ").

 

(c) _Employment Offers_. The Purchaser shall (or shall cause an Affiliate to)
make an offer of employment to each IM Seller Entity Employee who is not a
Non-Continuing IM Business Employee no later than five (5) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date; _provided_ that, to the extent such offer provides for
terms and conditions of employment, such terms and conditions shall not be
inconsistent with Section 4.09(e). The Purchaser may (or may cause an
Affiliate to), with respect to each individual listed on _Schedule 4.09(c)_ of
the Seller Disclosure Schedules (each, an " _IM Corporate Service Employee_
"), designate such IM Corporate Service Employee for transfer and make an
offer of employment to such IM Corporate Service Employee no later than five
(5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ that, to the extent
such offer provides for terms and conditions of employment, such terms and
conditions shall not be inconsistent with Section 4.09(e). Each IM Seller
Entity Employee and IM Corporate Service Employee who accepts such offer
of employment from Purchaser or its Affiliate and commences such employment
is referred to herein as a " _Transferred Employee_ " (and, together with the
Continuing IM Business Employees, the " _Continuing Employees_ ").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any IM Seller Entity Employee who is not a Non-
Continuing IM Business Employee and who is on a leave of absence (other than
long-term disability) from employment with any Seller Entity on the Closing
Date (each, an " _Inactive Employee_ ") shall remain an employee of such
Seller Entity immediately after the Closing and, upon such employees return
to active employment within 180 days after the commencement of such leave,
Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, make an offer of employment
to such employee; _provided_ that, to the extent such offer provides for terms
and conditions of employment, such terms and conditions shall not
be inconsistent with Section 4.09(e). Any such Inactive Employee who accepts
such offer of employment shall become a Transferred Employee and a Continuing
Employee upon such employees commencement of employment with Purchaser or
its Affiliate. For the avoidance of doubt, the Seller shall retain all
liabilities with respect to any (i) Inactive Employee who does not return to
active employment within 180 days after the commencement of such employees
leave of absence, (ii) Inactive Employee who returns to active employment
within such 180 days but who either does not receive an offer of employment
from Purchaser (or its applicable Affiliate) or who does not accept an offer
of employment from Purchaser (or its applicable Affiliate) or who accepts
such offer but does not commence such employment or (iii) IM Seller Entity
Employee who is on long-term disability on the Closing Date.

 

(d) _Specified Employee Expenses_. The Seller shall be liable for the items
set forth on Item 1 of _Schedule 4.09(d)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules,
and the Seller shall promptly reimburse Purchaser for the items set forth on
Item 2 of _Schedule 4.09(d)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules; _provided_
that the Sellers liability under this Section 4.09(d), shall not

 



-43-   exceed $15,000,000 in the aggregate and the Purchaser shall be responsible
for all items on _Schedule 4.09(d)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules to the
extent exceeding $15,000,000 in the aggregate.

(e) _Maintenance of Compensation and Benefits_. The " _Transfer Date_ " means,
for any Transferred Employee, the date on which such employee commences
employment with the Purchaser or its Affiliate (including any IM Business
Entity) and, for any Continuing IM Business Employee, the Closing Date. For
the period beginning on the applicable Transfer Date and ending on the first
(1st) anniversary of the Closing Date (or, in the case of each Hyderabad
Retained Employee, the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the
Hyderabad Transfer Date), (i) Purchaser shall provide (or cause the
applicable Affiliate to provide) to each Continuing Employee (or Hyderabad
Retained Employee) (A) a base salary or wage rate that is no less than that
provided to such employee immediately prior to the Closing Date, (B)
severance benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those
provided to such employee immediately prior to the Closing Date, and (C) other
compensation and benefits (excluding long-term and short-term incentive
payments (which are addressed in Section 4.09(l)), retention bonuses, one-
time bonus payments, one-time incentive payments and implementation bonuses)
that are no less favorable in the aggregate, than those provided to such
employee immediately prior to Closing Date and (ii) Purchaser shall not
require or provide for the relocation of any Continuing Employees principal
place of work from such employees principal place of work in effect
immediately prior to such Transfer Date;  _provided_ that the foregoing
provisions of clause (ii) notwithstanding, the Purchaser or an Affiliate of
Purchaser may require the relocation of any Continuing Employee who, as of
immediately prior to the applicable Transfer Date, serves in a customer-
facing role, including without limitation in a sales or professional services
role. Nothing in this Agreement shall obligate Purchaser or its Affiliates to
continue the employment of any Continuing Employee or otherwise alter
the "at-will" status of any such employee. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Removed Employees, the Non-Continuing IM Business Employees, the Hyderabad
Retained Employees and the IM Seller Entity Employees who do not commence
employment with Purchaser or one of its Affiliates shall not be Continuing
Employees for any purpose or provision of this Agreement, and the Seller and
its Affiliates shall, except to the extent expressly provided otherwise in
Section 4.09(d), retain all liabilities for such employees, regardless of
when incurred.

(f) _Retained Plans_. Effective as of the Closing, the Seller Entities shall
assume or retain sponsorship and administration of each Retained Plan, which
plans specifically shall not be assumed or retained by Purchaser. The Seller
shall take all action necessary to cause, (i) effective as of the Closing
Date, the IM Business Entities to cease to be participating employers in the
Retained Plans and (ii) except as provided otherwise in this Section 4.09,
effective as of the applicable Transfer Date, the active participation of
the Continuing Employees in the Retained Plans to terminate; _provided_ that
nothing herein shall be construed to limit the rights of any Continuing
Employees, and their dependents and beneficiaries, with respect to benefits
accrued under the Retained Plans with respect to periods prior to the Closing
Date.

(g) _Assumed Plans_. Purchaser or one of its Affiliates shall, as of the
applicable Transfer Date, assume or retain sponsorship and administration of
each Assumed Plan with respect to the obligations thereunder related to each
Continuing Employee; _provided_ that nothing in this Agreement shall be
interpreted as limiting the power, after the applicable Transfer Date,

 



-44-   of the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to amend or terminate any
particular Assumed Plan in accordance with the terms of such plan and
applicable Law.

 

(h) _Employee Communication_. The Seller, Parent and Purchaser intend that for
purposes of any Employee Plan that is a severance or termination benefit
plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement, the Transaction and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall not alone constitute a
severance of employment of any IM Employee prior to or upon the
consummation of the Transaction and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that the Continuing Employees will have continuous and
uninterrupted employment immediately before, during and immediately following
their applicable Transfer Dates. The Seller shall cooperate in good faith
with Purchaser, commencing promptly after the date hereof, to facilitate full
and complete access to and communication with, and if requested by Purchaser
arrange individual meetings with, each of the IM Employees, on reasonable
notice to the Seller and during normal business hours, in connection
Purchasers or its Affiliates offers of employment (or consideration for
continued employment) and transitioning issues for all such employees. 

(i) _Vacation and Sick Leave_. Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
to, take appropriate actions so that each Continuing Employee shall after the
applicable Transfer Date continue to be credited with the unused vacation and
unused sick leave credited to such employee through such Transfer Date under
the applicable vacation and sick leave policies of the Seller Entities and
their Affiliates, and the Purchaser and its Affiliates shall permit or cause
such employees to use such vacation and sick leave after such Transfer Date in
accordance with such policies; _provided_ that Purchasers obligation
pursuant to this Section 4.09(i) shall apply only to the extent that the
amount of such unused vacation and unused sick leave is reflected or reserved
on the Post-Closing Statement.

 

(j) _Retiree Medical_. Following each Continuing Employees termination of
employment with Purchaser and its Affiliates at any time on or prior to the
first (1st) anniversary of the Closing Date, the Seller shall provide such
employee with post-retirement medical, life insurance and other benefits under
the applicable Retained Plan in accordance with the terms of such plan on the
same basis as if such employees employment had continued with the Seller
Entities through the date of such termination. The foregoing shall not be
construed to limit the Sellers ability to amend or terminate any such
Retained Plan in accordance with its terms and applicable Law; _provided_
that no such action shall cause the Continuing Employees entitlement to
benefits under any such plan pursuant to this Section 4.09(j) to be less
favorable than that of similarly situated participants in such plan who are
not Continuing Employees. For the avoidance of doubt, the Seller Entities
shall retain all liabilities arising out of relating to the benefits provided
to Continuing Employees pursuant to this Section 4.09(j).

(k) _Pension, Deferred Compensation and Retirement Savings Plans_. The Seller
shall take appropriate action to cause, effective as of the applicable
Transfer Date, each Continuing Employee who is a participant in the Convergys
Pension Plan, the Convergys Excess Plan, the Convergys Supplemental Executive
Retirement Plan, the Sellers 401(k) plan (the " _Seller 401(k) Plan_ ") or
the Convergys Executive Deferred Compensation Plan to become fully vested in
such employees benefit or account balance under such plan, as applicable. As
soon as administratively practicable following the Closing Date, Purchaser
shall (or shall cause one of its

 



-45-   Affiliates to) accept rollovers by Continuing Employees of their account
balances under the Seller 401(k) Plan into a defined contribution plan
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code that is maintained by Purchaser or
one of its Affiliates. The parties agree that no loan balances or promissory
notes of the Continuing Employees under the Seller 401(k) Plan shall be
transferred pursuant to this Section 4.09(k). The Purchasers obligation to
accept such rollovers shall be subject to the Purchasers receipt from the
Seller of a favorable determination or opinion letter from the IRS regarding
the qualified status of the Seller 401(k) Plan. With respect to (i) non-U.S.
Continuing Employees who, immediately prior to the applicable Transfer Date,
participate in a defined contribution, account balance or other retirement
savings arrangement that is a Retained Plan, Purchaser in its sole discretion
may adopt or designate a replacement defined contribution, account balance or
other retirement savings arrangement sponsored or maintained by Purchaser (or
any of its Affiliates) to which such non-U.S. Continuing Employees may,
following the applicable Transfer Date and to the extent permitted without
penalty under applicable Law, roll over their account balances from the
applicable Retained Plan, and (ii) non-U.S. Non-Continuing IM Business
Employees who, immediately prior to the Closing Date, participate in a
defined contribution, account balance or other retirement savings arrangement
that is an Assumed Plan, Seller may, in its sole discretion, designate a
Retained Plan as a replacement defined contribution, account balance or other
retirement savings arrangement to which such non-U.S. Non-Continuing IM
Business Employees may, following the applicable Transfer Date and to the
extent permitted without penalty under applicable Law, roll over their
account balances from the applicable Assumed Plan.

(l) _Incentive Compensation_.

 

(i) The Seller shall take all action necessary to cause each Continuing
Employee who holds awards of equity-based compensation granted under any
Retained Plan in calendar years prior to the 2012 calendar year to become
fully vested in such awards as of the applicable Transfer Date, and the Seller
shall retain all liability arising from or relating to such awards. With
respect to each Continuing Employee who holds one or more awards of equity-
based compensation granted under any Retained Plan in the 2012 calendar year
that will be forfeited in accordance with their terms (including pursuant to
a reasonable interpretation of such terms by the board of directors of Seller
or a committee thereof) as of the applicable Transfer Date (each, a "2012
Forfeited Award"), the material terms of which 2012 Forfeited Awards are set
forth in Schedule 4.09(l) (including number of shares or amount subject to
such award and the vesting acceleration and forfeiture terms of such award),
Purchaser shall, as soon as reasonably practicable after the applicable
Transfer Date, grant such employee one or more incentive compensation awards
that provide incentive opportunities that are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to the incentive opportunities applicable to such Continuing
Employees 2012 Forfeited Award(s) as of immediately prior to the Closing.

(ii) With respect to any cash bonuses (excluding incentive
compensation replacing any 2012 Forfeited Award) and other short-term cash
incentive compensation (the aggregate amount of such compensation that is paid
by Purchaser pursuant to this Section 4.09(l)(ii), the "Cash Incentive
Compensation"), Purchaser and its Affiliates shall pay to each Continuing
Employee for the year in which the Closing occurs an amount not less than that
which such Continuing Employee would otherwise

 



-46-   have received pursuant to the applicable Retained Plan (the Seller has
provided to the Purchaser or made available in the data room a complete list
of each of the incentive compensation recipients and each such recipients
target incentive amount) (as if each Continuing Employees employment with
Purchaser or its applicable Affiliate after the Closing were deemed to be
employment with Seller or its applicable Affiliate for purposes of
eligibility to receive such Cash Incentive Compensation), with any appropriate
adjustments to be made by the Purchaser in good faith. Within twenty (20)
Business Days after the date that the Cash Incentive Compensation is
paid, the Seller shall reimburse the Purchaser for a pro rata portion of the
Cash Incentive Compensation, to the extent not reflected in the Adjustment
Amount, with such portion determined by multiplying the Cash Incentive
Compensation by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days from
January 1 of the year in which the Closing occurs through the Closing Date,
and the denominator of which is 366.

(m) _Service Credit_. Purchaser and its Affiliates shall, as of and after the
applicable Transfer Date, take appropriate actions so that, for all purposes
under each employee benefit plan maintained by Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates in which Continuing Employees become eligible to participate, each
Continuing Employee shall be given credit for all service (including service
used to determine eligibility for, vesting in, and benefit accruals under
such plan, except benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan of
the Purchaser or its Affiliates) credited prior to the applicable Transfer
Date with the Seller Entities. The preceding sentence notwithstanding, no such
service will be credited to the extent it would result in a duplication of
benefits.

(n) _Pre-Existing Conditions; Co-Payments and Deductibles_. Upon and after
the applicable Transfer Date, the Purchaser and its Affiliates shall use their
reasonable best efforts to (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting
conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to the Continuing Employees under any welfare
or fringe benefit plans maintained by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (the
" _Parent Welfare Plans_ ") in which such employees may be eligible to
participate after the applicable Transfer Date, other than limitations or
waiting periods that are in effect with respect to such employees and that
have not been satisfied under the corresponding welfare or fringe benefit
plans maintained by the Seller Entities prior to such Transfer Date and (ii)
provide each Continuing Employee with credit under any Parent Welfare Plans in
which such employee becomes eligible to participate after the applicable
Transfer Date for any co-payments and deductibles and other out-of-pocket
expenses paid by such employee for the then current plan year under the
corresponding welfare plans maintained by the Seller Entities and their
respective Affiliates prior to such Transfer Date. 

(o) _WARN Act_. Purchaser shall be responsible for any obligation with respect
to the Continuing Employees under the WARN Act arising or accruing after the
Closing Date, and the Seller shall be responsible for any such obligation with
respect to the Continuing Employees arising or accruing on or before the
Closing Date. The parties agree to cooperate in good faith to determine
whether any notification may be required under the WARN Act as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



-47-  (p) _Personnel Records_. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, the
originals of all records (including without limitation forms I-9) set forth
in the Continuing Employees personnel files (the " _Personnel Records_ ")
that are created prior to the applicable Transfer Date, to the extent not
otherwise transferred in connection with the Transaction and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, shall be transferred to Purchaser
or Purchasers Affiliates as of such Transfer Date (with the Seller retaining
copies of all such records, at the Sellers option). The originals of all
personnel records of all former employees of the IM Business and all IM
Employees who are not Continuing Employees shall remain with the Seller
Entities; _provided_ that Purchaser shall be provided with a copy of all
employee health and safety records required by applicable Law, and Seller
shall, and shall cause the other Seller Entities to, permit Purchaser or its
Affiliates or successors and their authorized representatives to have full
access upon reasonable notice during normal business hours to all such
personnel records to the extent permitted by applicable Law and reasonably
necessary in order for Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or successors to
respond to a subpoena, court order, audit, investigation or otherwise as
required by applicable Law or in connection with any pending or threatened
lawsuits, actions, arbitrations, claims, complaints, investigations or other
Proceedings. Purchaser and its Affiliates shall permit the Seller Entities to
have full access upon reasonable notice during normal business hours to all
the Personnel Records in order for any of the Seller Entities to respond to a
subpoena, court order, audit, investigation, or to obtain data for pension or
other benefits, or otherwise as required by applicable Law (such determination
by the parties of access shall be reasonable and shall not be unreasonably
delayed), and Purchaser and its Affiliates shall provide the Seller Entities,
upon the Sellers reasonable request and at the Sellers expense (or the
expense of another Seller Entity), with copies of such Personnel Records.

(q) Nothing in this Section 4.09 is intended or shall be intended to entitle
any person other than the parties hereto and their respective transferees and
permitted assigns to any claim, cause of action, remedy or right of any kind.
Nothing in this Section 4.09 shall be deemed to amend any employee benefit
plan of the Seller or Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates.

 

4.10 _Indebtedness_. The Seller shall cause the IM Business Entities, at the
Closing, not to have any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness of a type
described in clause (g) of the definition thereof).

4.11 _Financial Obligations_. Each of Parent and the Purchaser agrees that it
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (a) obtain, at or before the
Closing or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter, replacement Credit
Enhancements for, and (b) have the Seller Entities completely and irrevocably
released from any and all liability incurred by the Seller Entities post-
Closing for the Credit Enhancements that are in effect at the Closing,
including by having Parent or the Purchaser substituted as a replacement
guarantor on such Credit Enhancements. Parent and the Purchaser, jointly and
severally, shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Seller Entities from
and against any and all losses, costs, liabilities and expenses incurred by
the Seller Entities after the Closing relating to the Credit Enhancements
related to any Purchased Shares, any Purchased Asset, any Assumed Liability,
or any asset or liability of any IM Business Entity and shall reimburse the
Seller for any such amounts promptly and in no event later than five (5)
Business Days after written demand therefor from the Seller. All Affiliates of
Seller which have liability for any Credit Enhancements referenced in this
Section 4.11 are intended 

 



-48-   third-party beneficiaries of this Section 4.11 and shall have the right to
enforce the benefits intended to be conferred upon each of them under this
Section 4.11 as though they were parties to this Agreement.

4.12 _Names Following Closing_. (a) Neither the Purchaser nor any of its
Affiliates shall have the right, by virtue of this Agreement or the
consummation of the Transaction (or, in the case of the Purchased Entities, by
virtue of their affiliation with the Seller Entities prior to the Closing
Date), to use any trademarks or logos owned by the Seller Entities (the "
_Names_ "), including the "Convergys" name, or any confusingly similar
variations or derivatives thereof, except as provided in this Section 4.12 or
the Transition Services Agreement. Within one hundred eighty (180) days
following the Closing, the Purchaser shall cause each of the IM Business
Entities whose names include "Convergys" to change its name to remove
"Convergys" from such name. 

(b) After the Closing, the Purchaser, the IM Business Entities and the
Purchasers other Affiliates shall have the right to use existing packaging,
labeling, containers, stationery, business forms, supplies, advertising and
promotional materials and any similar materials bearing the Names until the
date that is one hundred eighty (180) days following the Closing Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, with respect to the Names listed in _Schedule
4.12(b)_ of the Purchaser Disclosure Schedules, the Purchaser, the IM Business
Entities and the Purchasers other Affiliates, may use such Names for the
purposes set forth in _Schedule 4.12(b)_ of the Purchaser Disclosure Schedules
for a period of one (1) year following the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that during the applicable period set forth in this Section
4.12(b), (i) neither the Purchaser, the IM Business Entities nor any of the
Purchasers other Affiliates shall take any action that could reasonably be
expected to impair the value of the Names, (ii) when using the items listed
in this Section 4.12(b) in the context of entering into or conducting
contractual relationships, the Purchaser shall clearly inform all other
applicable parties that Parent or the Purchaser, rather than the Seller, is
the party (or the direct or indirect parent of the party) entering into or
conducting the contractual relationship, and (iii) the personnel of the
Purchaser, the IM Business Entities or the Purchasers other Affiliates using
the above items shall not, and shall have no authority to, hold themselves
out as officers, employees or agents of any of the Seller Entities. The
Purchaser, the IM Business Entities, and the Purchasers other Affiliates
shall comply with all applicable Laws in any use of packaging or labeling
containing the Names.

(c) Parent and the Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to minimize use of the Names by the Purchaser and its Affiliates, and, in any
event, shall cease using the Names on fixed assets as soon as practicable and
in any event before the applicable dates provided in Sections 4.12(a) and
4.12(b).

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 4.12 to the contrary, nothing in
this Section 4.12 shall prevent or restrict in any way the Purchaser, the IM
Business Entities or any of the Purchasers other Affiliates from (i)
referring to or otherwise describing the acquisition of the IM Business in the
ordinary course of business and/or (ii) using the Names in any other manner
which would not constitute a violation of the Sellers and its Affiliates
rights in the Names under applicable Law.

 



-49-  4.13 _Insurance_. Each of Parent and the Purchaser acknowledges and agrees
that no insurance policy maintained by the Seller or its Affiliates with
respect to the Purchased Shares, Purchased Assets, Assumed Liabilities, IM
Business Entities, or the IM Business shall cover any of the Purchased Shares,
Purchased Assets, Assumed Liabilities or the operations, assets or
liabilities of the IM Business Entities or the IM Business after the Closing
Date, and all benefits and coverage under each such insurance policy shall
terminate on the Closing Date.

 

4.14 _Non-Competition Agreement_. During the period beginning on the Closing
Date and ending on the third (3rd) anniversary thereof, the Seller shall not,
and shall cause the other Seller Entities not to, directly or indirectly
engage, as a principal or jointly with others, in any business or activities
that directly compete with the IM Business as and where conducted as of the
Closing Date; _provided_ , that neither the Seller nor any of its Affiliates
shall be prevented from:

(a) acquiring as an investment in the ordinary course of business any class of
securities traded on a national securities exchange to the extent that such
acquisitions do not result in the acquiror owning in the aggregate ten
percent (10%) or more of the aggregate equity interests in, or voting power
of, the issuer of such class of securities;

(b) acquiring (through merger, stock purchase or purchase of all or
substantially all of the assets or otherwise) ownership of any business,
division, or operation that directly competes with the IM Business ("
_Competitive Operations_ ") or any equity interest in any Person (an "
_Investee_ ") that has Competitive Operations, _provided_ that (i) the total
annual revenues for the most recently completed full fiscal year from such
Competitive Operations do not account for more than ten percent (10%) of the
Sellers or the Investees total annual revenues and (ii) if the Competitive
Operations are owned by the Seller or a Subsidiary of the Seller, or the
Investee is a Subsidiary of the Seller, immediately after such acquisition and
derives annual revenues (on a last twelve (12) months basis) of $30,000,000 or
more from Competitive Operations, then the Seller will use its reasonable
best efforts to sell all or part of such Competitive Operations within twelve
(12) months following such acquisition such that the total annual revenues (on
a last twelve (12) months basis) derived from all Competitive Operations
acquired hereunder decreases below $30,000,000, and the Seller invites the
Purchaser to offer to purchase the Competitive Operations simultaneously with
any invitation to a third party to offer to purchase the
Competitive Operations or promptly after receiving any unsolicited offer from
any third party;

(c) complying with Sellers obligations under Section 1.11;

(d) any other provision of this Agreement notwithstanding, including any
provision or restriction in Section 4.14(b), engaging, directly or
indirectly, as a principal or jointly with others, in (i) the business
currently conducted by Convergyss Customer Management segment, as publicly
reported (in filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) as a
separate business, (ii) training and training-related consulting services,
including delivery of training in all forms (including instructor lead
training, train the trainer, on line training and virtual training),
instructional design, curriculum development and redesign, content
maintenance, performance-based learning approaches, training treatments, and
consulting services and technology, (iii) collections management, support
and systems, and/or

 



-50-   (iv) centralized business policy management, including the marketing, sale,
customization, maintenance and support of the Dynamic Decisioning Solution
platform.

 

(e) Without limiting Section 10.09, if any provision contained in this Section
shall for any reason be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any
other provisions of this Section, but this Section shall be construed as if
such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been
contained herein. It is the intention of the parties that if any of the
restrictions or covenants contained herein is held to cover a geographic area
or to be for a length of time which is not permitted by applicable law, or in
any way construed to be too broad or to any extent invalid, such provision
shall not be construed to be null, void and of no effect, but to the extent
such provision would be valid or enforceable under applicable Law, a court of
competent jurisdiction shall construe and interpret or reform this Section to
provide for a covenant having the maximum enforceable geographic area, time
period and other provisions (not greater than those contained herein) as shall
be valid and enforceable under such applicable Law. Seller acknowledges that
Purchaser would be irreparably harmed by any breach of this Section and that
there would be no adequate remedy at law or in damages to compensate Purchaser
for any such breach. Seller agrees that Purchaser shall be entitled
to injunctive relief requiring specific performance by Seller of this
Section, and Seller consents to the entry thereof.

4.15  _Non-Solicitation of Employees_. (a) The Seller shall not, directly or
indirectly, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, from the Closing Date
until the eighteen (18)-month anniversary of the Closing Date, (i) solicit
for employment any Continuing Employee; _provided_ that, this covenant shall
not apply to Continuing Employees whose employment is terminated by the
Purchaser, any IM Business Entity, or any other Affiliate of the Purchaser
following the Closing;  _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall
prohibit the Seller or its Affiliates from making, or soliciting for
employment any person who responds to, a general solicitation or advertisement
by the Seller or its Affiliates that is not directed to Continuing Employees;
or (ii) hire or continue to employ, as applicable, (x) any Continuing
Employee, (y) any IM Business Entity Employee (other than a Removed Employee
or a Non-Continuing IM Business Employee) who does not become a Continuing
Employee or (z) any IM Seller Entity Employee (other than a or a Non-
Continuing IM Business Employee) who does not accept the offer of employment
made by Purchaser or one of its Affiliates and commence such employment, or
to whom an offer of employment is not made, in each case in accordance with
Section 4.09(c).

(b) Without limiting Section 10.09, if any provision contained in this
Section shall for any reason be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any
other provisions of this Section, but this Section shall be construed as if
such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained
herein. It is the intention of the parties that if any of the restrictions or
covenants contained herein is held to cover a geographic area or to be for a
length of time which is not permitted by applicable law, or in any way
construed to be too broad or to any extent invalid, such provision shall not
be construed to be null, void and of no effect, but to the extent
such provision would be valid or enforceable under applicable Law, a court of
competent jurisdiction shall construe and interpret or reform this Section to
provide for a covenant having the maximum enforceable geographic area, time
period and other provisions (not greater than those contained herein) as
shall be valid and enforceable under such applicable Law. Seller acknowledges
that Purchaser

 



-51-   would be irreparably harmed by any breach of this Section and that there
would be no adequate remedy at law or in damages to compensate Purchaser for
any such breach. Seller agrees that Purchaser shall be entitled to injunctive
relief requiring specific performance by Seller of this Section, and Seller
consents to the entry thereof.

4.16 _Enterprise Licenses_. During the period that is no more than one hundred
twenty (120) days prior to, and no less than ninety (90) days prior to, the
expiration of the Sellers obligation to use enterprise software licenses to
provide transition services under the Transition Services Agreement, the
Purchaser shall have the right to provide a list of enterprise software
licenses to the Seller that the Purchaser would like the Seller to review to
determine if the Seller Entities have the right to grant the Purchaser the
right to use at the expiration of the Transition Services Agreement. If, and
only if, providing a right to the IM Business Entities to use any
such license in connection with the IM Business (including any assignments of
individual user licenses) creates no out-of-pocket cost to the Seller Entities
and is permitted under the Contracts governing the Seller Entities rights to
use such enterprise software licenses, Seller shall grant such rights to use
the applicable licenses.

4.17 _Parent Guarantee_. Parent hereby guarantees the due, prompt and
faithful payment, performance and discharge by Purchaser of, and the
compliance by Purchaser with, all of the covenants, agreements, obligations
and undertakings of Purchaser under this Agreement in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, and covenants and agrees to take all actions
necessary or advisable to cause or ensure such payment, performance, discharge
and compliance by Purchaser hereunder or to otherwise satisfy such
covenants, agreements, obligations and undertakings directly by action of
Parent.

4.18 _Liquidations_. Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall use its
reasonable best efforts to (a) initiate and (b) complete, the liquidation of
the Subsidiaries of the Purchased Entities listed in _Schedule 4.18_ of the
Seller Disclosure Schedules at the Sellers cost and expense.

4.19 _Cash and Cash Equivalents_. Prior to or on the Closing Date, the Seller
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each IM Business Entity not to
have any cash or cash equivalents, other than, in the case of each IM Business
Entity not organized in the United States or a political subdivision thereof,
the Cash Needs of such IM Business Entity. 

4.20 _Corporate and Infrastructure Liabilities_. The Seller intends, but shall
have no obligation to, to minimize, as of the Closing Date, the liabilities
of the IM Business of a type reflected or reserved on the IM Business Balance
Sheet that primarily relate to corporate services and general infrastructure.
For the avoidance of doubt, Seller shall have no liability or indemnification
obligation for any failure to minimize such liabilities or otherwise comply
with this Section 4.20.

 

4.21 _Further Actions After the Closing_. From time to time following the
Closing, the parties hereto shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to, execute, acknowledge and deliver all reasonable further
conveyances, notices, assumptions, releases, acquittances and instruments, and
take such other reasonable actions, in each case as may be necessary or
appropriate to make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the other Transaction Documents if reasonably requested by any other party
hereto (including executing

 



-52-   and filing appropriate Intellectual Property assignment agreements, in forms
reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser, with respect to the IM Business
Registered IP included in the Assigned IM Business Intellectual Property).
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if, after the Closing Date,
the Purchaser or the Seller (or any of their respective Affiliates) identifies
any Purchased Asset, Assumed Liability, Excluded Asset, or Retained Liability
that was not previously assigned, assumed or otherwise transferred as
contemplated by this Agreement, the Purchaser and Seller shall, or shall cause
their respective subsidiaries to, promptly assign, assume, or otherwise
transfer the applicable Purchased Asset, Assumed Liability, Retained Asset,
or Retained Liability without additional consideration, subject to (a) the
terms and conditions of this Agreement (including Section 1.11) and (b) to the
extent applicable, the license of any Intellectual Property on the terms and
conditions set forth in the IP License Agreement.

 

ARTICLE V

TAX MATTERS

5.01 _Section 338 Elections_. (a) The Seller and the Purchaser shall timely
file (or cause to be filed) such forms as may be contemplated by applicable
Tax law or administrative practice to effect timely joint elections (the "
_Section 338(h)(10) Elections_ ") under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and
any similar provision of any U.S. state or local jurisdiction) with respect
to the purchase and sale of (A) Convergys Information Management Group Inc.,
and (B) each subsidiary of Convergys Information Management Group Inc. that is
organized under the laws of a U.S. state (such entities the " _338(h)(10)
Designated Entities_ "). On or prior to the Closing, the Seller and the
Purchaser shall agree on the form and content of and execute IRS Forms 8023
(and any similar forms of another jurisdiction) with respect to the purchase
and sale of the 338(h)(10) Designated Entities based on information then
available and in a manner that is consistent with the Allocation Statement and
Section 1.10. The Seller and the Purchaser shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to, treat any Excluded Assets that are distributed by
the 338(h)(10) Designated Entities to the Seller or the Seller Entities (or,
with respect 338(h)(10) Designated Entities that are subsidiaries of
Convergys Information Management Group Inc., Excluded Assets that are
distributed to Convergys Information Management Group Inc. and subsequently to
the Seller or the Seller Entities) as having been distributed in the
deemed liquidation resulting from the Section 338(h)(10) Elections. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Purchaser may not make any elections pursuant to
Section 338(g) of the Code (or any similar provision of any other
jurisdiction) with respect to the purchase and sale of any IM Business Entity
organized under the laws of a U.S. state unless such election is a Section
338(h)(10) Election.

(b) Neither the Seller nor the Purchaser shall, or shall permit any of its
Subsidiaries to, take any position for Tax purposes inconsistent with the
Section 338(h)(10) Elections without the written consent of the Purchaser or
the Seller, as the case may be, except as may be required pursuant to a Final
Determination.

(c) With respect to any state Tax for which any IM Business Entity files a
separate return and that would not be borne by Purchaser or any Affiliate of
Purchaser (including after the Closing Date, the IM Business Entities) but for
the Section 338(h)(10) Elections made pursuant to this Article, Seller shall
pay the aggregate of all such amounts to Purchaser within 10 days prior to the
date on which Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser files the relevant Tax 

 



-53-   Return. Purchaser shall deliver to Seller (i) written notice of the date on
which it intends to file each relevant return at least 20 days prior to such
date and (ii) a copy of each relevant return on the date on which Purchaser
or such Affiliate of Purchaser (as the case may be) files the relevant return.

 

(d) On or prior to Closing, Purchaser shall deliver written notice to Seller
identifying each Non-U.S. Business Entity with respect to which it shall
effect a timely election under Section 338(g) of the Code (or any similar
provision of any U.S. state or local jurisdiction) (each such election a "
_Notified Section 338(g) Election_"). For the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser
may not make any election pursuant to Section 338(g) of the Code (or any
similar provision of any other jurisdiction) with respect to the purchase and
sale of any Non-U.S. Business Entity unless such election is a Notified
Section 338(g) Election.

(e) Without the prior written consent of the Purchaser and the Seller, none of
the Seller, the IM Business Entities, any Affiliate of the Seller, Parent,
the Purchaser or any Affiliate of the Purchaser shall make or file any
election under Section 336(e) of the Code (or any similar provision of state,
local or foreign law) in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

5.02 _Tax Covenants_. (a) From the date hereof through the Closing Date,
without the prior written consent of Purchaser, (i) none of the IM Business
Entities shall, to the extent, in each case, that it would reasonably be
expected to materially adversely affect the IM Business Entities, (A) change
its tax residence, (B) in the case of any IM Business Return, make or change
any material Tax election, change any material annual Tax accounting period,
adopt or change any material method of Tax accounting, file any
amended material Tax Return, enter into any material closing agreement,
settle any material Tax claim or assessment, surrender any right to claim a
material Tax refund or offset, or consent to any extension or waiver of the
limitations period applicable to any Tax claim or assessment and (ii) in the
case of any IM Business Return, none of the Seller or any Affiliate of the
Seller shall, to the extent it would reasonably be expected to materially
adversely affect the Purchased Assets, make or change any material Tax
election, change any material annual Tax accounting period, adopt or change
any material method of Tax accounting, settle any material Tax claim or
assessment, surrender any right to claim a material Tax refund or offset,
or consent to any extension or waiver of the limitations period applicable to
any Tax claim or assessment, except, with respect to both clauses (i) and
(ii), as may be required by Law or as disclosed on _Schedule 5.02_ of the
Seller Disclosure Schedules.

(b) (i) Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed (A) all Tax Returns required to be filed under applicable Law by or
with respect to any of the IM Business Entities that do not include any Post-
Closing Tax Period, (B) all Tax Returns required to be filed under applicable
Law by any of the Seller Entities with respect to the Purchased Assets that
are due (including extensions) on or before the Closing Date, and (C) all Tax
Returns that the IM Business Entities file jointly with the Seller or any of
its Affiliates (other than the IM Business Entities), including Combined Tax
Returns. Any Covered Taxes shown as due and payable on any such Tax Return
shall be paid by Seller. With respect to IM Business Returns described in
subsection (A) of the first sentence of this Section 5.02(b), Seller shall,
or shall cause its Affiliates, to prepare such Tax Returns consistent with the
past practices, elections, and methods of the IM Business Entities. With
respect to IM Business Returns described in 

 



-54-   subsection (C) of the first sentence of this Section 5.02(b), to the extent
that any such Tax Return includes any Post-Closing Tax Period of an IM
Business Entity, Seller shall submit pro forma Tax Returns reflecting the
portion of such Tax Return that relates to the IM Business, the IM Business
Entities or the Purchased Assets to Purchaser no later than 60 days prior to
the date on which such Tax Return is due, permit Purchaser to review and
comment on each such Tax Return prior to filing it and shall reasonably and in
good faith consider any changes to such Tax Returns that Purchaser reasonably
requests within 15 days of the date on which Purchaser receives such
Tax Return from Seller. If Seller disagrees with any change requested by
Purchaser, Seller shall deliver written notice to Purchaser of such
disagreement within 10 days of the date on which Seller received Purchasers
request for the change.1 If Purchaser and Seller are unable to resolve such
disagreement within 5 days of Sellers delivery of such notice to Purchaser,
Purchaser and Seller jointly shall engage the Independent Accounting Firm to
resolve such disagreement prior to the filing of such Tax Return in a manner
consistent with this Agreement. The cost of such Independent Accounting Firm
shall be borne equally by Seller and Purchaser. If any Taxes shown as due and
payable on any Tax Return which Seller is responsible for preparing and filing
under this Section 5.02(b)(i) are Assumed Taxes, such Assumed Taxes shall be
paid by Purchaser. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Section
5.02(b)(i) shall apply with respect to an amended Tax Return as if it were an
original Tax Return.

 

(ii) Except as set forth in Section 5.02(b)(i) and Section 5.02(c), Parent and
Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed
all Tax Returns with respect to the IM Business Entities and the Purchased
Assets. In the case of any such Tax Return that relates to Taxes for which
Seller is indemnifying Purchaser under this Article V to the extent that such
Tax Return could result in a Tax liability for which Seller would be
responsible, Parent and the Purchaser (A) shall, or shall cause the IM
Business Entities to, prepare such Tax Return consistent with the
past practices, elections, and methods of the IM Business Entities and, to
the extent any such Tax Return relates to the Taxes described in clause (v) of
the definition of Covered Taxes, in such manner as the Seller shall reasonably
request subject to applicable Law as reasonably determined by Purchaser, and
(B) to the extent that such Tax Return could result in a Tax liability for
which Seller would be responsible, shall submit such Tax Return to Seller no
later than 60 days prior to the date on which such Tax Return is due, permit
Seller to review and comment on each such Tax Return prior to filing it and
shall reasonably and in good faith consider any changes to such Tax Returns
that the Seller reasonably requests within 15 days of the date on which
Seller receives such Tax Return from Purchaser. If Purchaser disagrees with
any change requested by Seller, Purchaser shall deliver written notice to
Seller of such disagreement within 10 days of the date on which
Purchaser received Sellers request for the change. If Seller and Purchaser
are unable to resolve such disagreement within 5 days of Purchasers delivery
of such notice to Seller, Seller and Purchaser jointly shall engage the
Independent Accounting Firm to resolve such disagreement prior to the filing
of such Tax Return in a manner consistent with this

-55-   Agreement. The cost of such Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne
equally by Purchaser and Seller. If any Taxes shown as due and payable on any
such Tax Return are Covered Taxes, such Covered Taxes shall be paid by
Seller. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Section 5.02(b)(ii)
shall apply with respect to an amended Tax Return as if it were an original
Tax Return.

 

(c) To the extent consistent with the past practices of the Seller Entities,
the Seller shall include the IM Business Entities in any Combined Tax Return
through the close of business on the Closing Date.

(d) Liability for all Transfer Taxes incurred in connection with transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (other than any Transfer Taxes relating to the
transactions described in Section 1.12, which shall be borne solely by Seller)
shall be borne equally by the Seller and the Seller Entities, on the one
hand, and Parent and the Purchaser, on the other hand, and each shall pay one-
half of the amount of such Transfer Taxes when due. The Seller and the
Purchaser shall jointly prepare and file all necessary Tax Returns with
respect to all such Taxes.

(e) At the request of Purchaser, Seller shall use reasonable best efforts
promptly to make a valid election under Section 754 of the Code with respect
to any IM Business Entity that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal
income tax purposes.

5.03 _Tax Sharing_. Any and all existing Tax Sharing Agreements between Seller
and any of its Affiliates (other than the IM Business Entities), on the one
hand, and the IM Business Entities, on the other hand, shall be terminated as
of or prior to the Closing Date. After the Closing Date, the Seller Entities
and the IM Business Entities shall not have any further rights or liabilities
thereunder.

 

5.04 _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. (a) Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate
fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in
connection with the preparation and filing of any Tax Return (including any
report required pursuant to Section 6043A of the Code and all Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder ), any audit, litigation or
other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the other partys request) the provision of records and
information that are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or
other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder. Purchaser and Seller agree (i) to retain all books and
records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the IM Business Entities
relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period until the expiration of any applicable
statute of limitations, and to abide by all record retention agreements
entered into with any Taxing Authority for all periods required by
such Taxing Authority, and (ii) to use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide the other party with at least thirty (30) days prior written notice
before destroying any such books and records, during which period the party
receiving the notice can elect to take possession, at its own expense, of
such books and records.

(b) Purchaser and Seller further agree, upon request, to use all reasonable
efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any governmental
authority or customer of the IM Business Entities or any other Person as may
be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



-56-  5.05 _Tax Benefits_. (a) Purchaser shall be entitled to retain the Tax
benefit received by any IM Business Entity from the use in any Pre-Closing
Tax Period of a carryback of any Tax Asset of any IM Business Entity arising
in a Post-Closing Tax Period to the extent such carryback is required by
applicable Law. To the extent that such Tax benefit is a refund that is sent
by the Taxing Authority to the Seller, Seller agrees to pay over such refund
to Purchaser. Such benefit shall be considered equal to the excess of (i) the
amount of Taxes that would have been payable by the IM Business Entities in
the absence of such carryback over (ii) the amount of Taxes actually payable
by the IM Business Entities (taking into account any Tax refund, credit,
offset or other reduction in Tax liability resulting from the carryback). If
Seller pays over any refund to Purchaser and, subsequent to any such payment,
there is (A) a Final Determination which results in a disallowance or a
reduction of the Tax Asset so carried back or (B) a reduction in the amount
of the benefit realized by the IM Business Entities from such Tax Asset as a
result of a Final Determination or the use of a Tax Asset of any Seller Group,
Purchaser shall repay to Seller, within thirty (30) days of such
event described in (A) or (B), any amount that would not have been payable to
Purchaser pursuant to this Section 5.05(a) had the amount of the benefit been
determined in light of such events. To the extent that an event described in
(A) or (B) above results in the Seller or any of its Affiliates making a
payment to a Taxing Authority or making a deposit with a Taxing Authority to
stop the running of interest, Purchaser shall pay Seller interest at a rate
per annum equal to the Prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal,
Eastern Edition, or the equivalent rate with respect to the jurisdiction and
currency, on the amount repaid to Seller from the date such amount was paid by
Seller to Purchaser until such repayment. In addition, Purchaser shall hold
Seller harmless for any penalty or interest payable by the IM Business
Entities, Seller or any of its Affiliates as a result of any such event. Any
such amount shall be paid by Purchaser to Seller within thirty (30) days of
the payment by Seller of any such interest or penalty. Seller agrees, at the
expense of Purchaser, to cause the IM Business Entities to file Tax Returns
(including amended Tax Returns and claims for Tax refunds) reflecting
the benefits to which they are entitled from the carrybacks described in this
Section 5.05(a).

(b) Purchaser agrees to pay to Seller any Tax refunds or credits received by
an IM Business Entity with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period. If any Tax
refunds or credits with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period are not permitted
by Law or administrative practice to be claimed on a Tax Return for which the
Seller has filing responsibility hereunder and are permitted by Law or
administrative practice to be claimed on a Tax Return for which the Purchaser
has filing responsibility hereunder, then the Purchaser shall, at the expense
of Seller, claim such refund or credit and pay to the Seller the amount of any
Tax benefit resulting from such refund or credit. If under applicable Tax Law,
a refund or credit to which Seller is entitled under this Section 5.05(b)
must be credited against a Post-Closing Period Tax rather than paid to the
taxpayer in cash, and, as a result, the IM Business Entities actually reduce a
Tax liability with respect to a Post-Closing Tax Period, Purchaser shall pay
or cause to be paid to Seller the amount of the Tax benefit of such reduction
in Tax liability. Such benefit shall be considered equal to the excess of (i)
the amount of Taxes that would have been payable by the IM Business Entities
in the absence of such reduction over (ii) the amount of Taxes actually
payable by the IM Business Entities (taking into account any Tax refund,
credit, offset or other reduction in Tax liability resulting from the
reduction). Purchaser agrees to pay the amount of such benefit to Seller
within thirty (30) days of the filing of the applicable Tax Return. If,
subsequent to any payment, there is (A) a Final Determination which results in
a disallowance or a reduction of the 

 



-57-   Tax refund or credit or reduction in Tax liability or (B) a reduction in the
amount of the benefit realized by the IM Business Entities from such Tax
refund or credit or reduction as a result of a Final Determination or the use
of a Tax Asset of Purchaser or its Affiliates, Seller shall repay to
Purchaser, within thirty (30) days of such event described in (A) or (B), any
amount that would not have been payable to Seller pursuant to this Section
5.05(b) had the amount of the reduction been determined in light of such
events. To the extent that an event described in (A) or (B) above results in
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates making a payment to a Taxing Authority or
making a deposit with a Taxing Authority to stop the running of interest,
Seller shall pay Purchaser interest at a rate per annum equal to the Prime
rate as published in the Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, or the
equivalent rate with respect to the jurisdiction and currency, on the amount
repaid to Purchaser from the date such amount was paid by Purchaser to Seller
until such repayment. In addition, Seller shall hold Purchaser harmless from
any penalty or interest payable by the IM Business Entities, Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates as a result of any such event. Any such amount shall be paid
by Seller to Purchaser within thirty (30) days of the payment by Purchaser of
any such interest or penalty. 

5.06 _Tax Indemnification_. (a) (i) The Seller hereby indemnifies each
Purchaser Tax Indemnitee against and agrees to hold each Purchaser Tax
Indemnitee harmless from any Covered Taxes and any costs and expenses
(including, without limitation, reasonable expenses of investigation and
attorneys fees and expenses) related to any Covered Taxes (together, a "
_Seller Indemnified Tax Loss_ "); and (ii) Parent and the Purchaser hereby
indemnify each Seller Tax Indemnitee against and agree to hold each Seller Tax
Indemnitee harmless from any Assumed Taxes and any costs and expenses
(including, without limitation, reasonable expenses of investigation and
attorneys fees and expenses) related to any Assumed Taxes (together, a "
_Purchaser Indemnified Tax Loss_ " and, together with a Seller Indemnified
Tax Loss, a " _Tax Loss_ ").

(b) In order to apportion appropriately any Taxes relating to a Straddle Tax
Period between the portion of such Straddle Tax Period ending on and including
the Closing Date and the portion of such Straddle Tax Period beginning after
the Closing Date, the Parties shall, to the extent permitted under applicable
law, elect with the relevant Taxing Authority to treat for all Tax purposes
the Closing Date as the last day of a taxable period. In the case of any other
Taxes for a Straddle Tax Period for which such election to close the taxable
period is not permitted, the portion of such Taxes that are allocable to the
portion of the Straddle Tax Period ending on and including the Closing Date
shall be: (i) in the case of ad valorem or similar Taxes that are imposed on a
periodic basis, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire period
(or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis (such as real
property taxes), the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding
period) multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days
in the Straddle Tax Period ending on and including the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire relevant Straddle Tax
Period; and (ii) in the case of Taxes not described in (i) (such as Taxes
that are either (x) based upon or related to income, receipts or premiums, or
(y) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or assignment of
property (real or personal, tangible or intangible)), deemed equal to the
amount that would be payable if the taxable period ended on and included the
Closing Date. All determinations necessary to give effect to the allocation
set forth in the foregoing clause (ii) shall be made in a manner consistent
with prior practice of IM Business Entities.

 



-58-  (c) To the extent permitted by Law or administrative practice, the taxable
year of each of the Purchased Entities that includes the Closing Date shall
be treated as closing on (and including) the Closing Date. For the avoidance
of doubt, the parties hereto agree that neither party will make a ratable
allocation election under Treas. Reg. § 1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii) or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign law with respect to Straddle Tax Periods.
In accordance with Treas. Reg. § 1.1502-76 and any analogous provision of
state, local or foreign law, any Tax related to an extraordinary transaction
(not contemplated by this Agreement to occur on the Closing Date) that occurs
on the Closing Date but after the Closing shall be allocated to the Post-
Closing Tax Period.

 

(d) (i) The party first receiving notice of any Tax Loss or Tax Proceeding in
respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder promptly shall provide
written notice thereof to the other party or parties to this Agreement
(specifying with reasonable particularity the basis therefor and including a
copy of the relevant portion of any correspondence received from the relevant
Taxing Authority) and will give such other party or parties such information
with respect thereto as such other party or parties may reasonably request;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the failure of the party first receiving notice
to give such prompt notice shall not relieve the other party or parties of
any of its obligations under this Section 5.06(d), except to the extent that
such other party is actually prejudiced thereby.

 

(ii) In the case of a Tax Proceeding with respect to an IM Business Entity or
the Purchased Assets for a Straddle Tax Period (other than a Tax Proceeding
otherwise covered by Section 5.06(d)(iv)(A) or (B) below), the Purchaser shall
have the right to conduct, at its own expense, such Tax Proceeding; _provided_
, _however_ , that, to the extent the proceeding relates to Taxes for which
Seller is indemnifying Purchaser under this Article V and could result in a
Tax liability for which Seller would be responsible, (A) the Seller may
participate in such Tax Proceeding and attend any meetings or conferences
with the relevant Taxing Authority, if such Tax Proceeding could have an
adverse impact on the Seller or any of its Affiliates, (B) Parent and the
Purchaser shall not settle, compromise or abandon such Tax Proceeding without
the consent of the Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed, if such settlement, compromise or abandonment could have a
disproportionate adverse impact on the Seller or any of its Affiliates, (C)
the Purchaser shall provide the Seller with a timely and reasonably detailed
account of each stage of such Tax Proceeding, (D) the Purchaser shall consult
with the Seller before taking any significant action in connection with such
Tax Proceeding, (E) the Purchaser shall consult with the Seller and offer the
Seller an opportunity to comment before submitting any written materials
prepared or furnished in connection with such Tax Proceeding, and (F) the
Purchaser shall defend such Tax Proceeding diligently and in good faith as if
it were the only party in interest in connection with such Tax Proceeding. If
Purchaser elects not to assume such defense, Seller shall be entitled to
assume the defense and Purchaser shall be liable for the reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel employed by Seller for any period during which Purchaser
has not assumed the defense thereof. Seller shall pay Purchaser, and Purchaser
shall pay Seller, promptly for any Seller Indemnified Tax Loss or Purchaser
Indemnified Tax Loss, respectively, that results from the resolution of any
such Tax Proceeding.

 



-59-  (iii) With respect to any Tax Proceeding with respect to an IM
Business Entity or the Purchased Assets for a Pre-Closing Tax Period (other
than a Tax Proceeding otherwise covered by Section 5.06(d)(ii) or Section
5.06(d)(iv)(A) or (B) below), Seller may, at its own expense, assume the
defense of such Tax Proceeding; _provided_ that, to the extent the proceeding
relates to Taxes for which Purchaser is indemnifying Seller under this Article
V and could result in a Tax liability for which Purchaser would be
responsible, (A) the Purchaser may participate in such Tax Proceeding and
attend any meetings or conferences with the relevant Taxing Authority, if such
Tax Proceeding could have an adverse impact on the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates, (B) Seller and its Affiliates shall not settle, compromise or
abandon such Tax Proceeding without the consent of the Purchaser, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, if such settlement,
compromise or abandonment could have a disproportionate adverse impact on
the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, (C) the Seller shall provide the
Purchaser with a timely and reasonably detailed account of each stage of such
Tax Proceeding, (D) the Seller shall consult with the Purchaser before taking
any significant action in connection with such Tax Proceeding, (E) the Seller
shall consult with the Purchaser and offer the Purchaser an opportunity to
comment before submitting any written materials prepared or furnished in
connection with such Tax Proceeding, and (F) the Seller shall defend such Tax
Proceeding diligently and in good faith as if it were the only party in
interest in connection with such Tax Proceeding. If Seller elects not to
assume such defense, Purchaser shall be entitled to assume the defense and
Seller shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel
employed by Purchaser for any period during which Seller has not assumed the
defense thereof. Seller shall pay Purchaser, and Purchaser shall pay Seller,
promptly for any Seller Indemnified Tax Loss or Purchaser Indemnified Tax
Loss, respectively, that results from the resolution of any such Tax
Proceeding.

 

(iv) Any other provisions of this Agreement notwithstanding, (A) in the case
of a Tax Proceeding with respect to any Tax Return of the Seller or other
Seller Entity or any Combined Tax Return, the Seller shall have the right to
conduct and control in all respects such Tax Proceeding and neither the
Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall be entitled to participate in any
such Tax Proceeding, (B) the Seller shall not be required to provide any
Person with any such Tax Return or copy thereof or materials relating thereto;
_provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent that such Tax Returns would be
required to be delivered but for this Section 5.06(d)(iv)(B), the Person that
would be required to deliver such Tax Returns shall instead deliver pro forma
Tax Returns relating solely to the IM Business, and (C) all of the
parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution of any Tax
Proceeding.

(e)(i) If the Purchaser is required to pay an amount to a Taxing Authority
that would constitute a Seller Indemnified Tax Loss in connection with but
prior to the resolution of a Tax Proceeding, the Seller shall pay such amount
to the Purchaser within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice of the payment
by the Purchaser. In the event that the Purchaser receives a partial or total
refund of any such payment, the Purchaser shall transfer that amount to the
Seller within thirty (30) days of receipt (less any Tax paid on receipt
of such refund).

 



-60-  (ii) If the Seller is required to pay an amount to a Taxing Authority
that would constitute a Purchaser Indemnified Tax Loss in connection with but
prior to the resolution of a Tax Proceeding, the Purchaser shall pay such
amount to the Seller within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice of the
payment by the Seller. In the event that the Seller receives a partial or
total refund of any such payment, the Seller shall transfer that amount to the
Purchaser within thirty (30) days of receipt (less any Tax paid on receipt of
such refund).

 

(f) Any claim of any Purchaser Tax Indemnitee under this Section may be made
and enforced by the Purchaser on behalf of such Purchaser Tax Indemnitee. Any
claim of any Seller Tax Indemnitee under this Section may be made and enforced
by the Seller on behalf of such Seller Tax Indemnitee.

(g) The amount of any Seller Indemnified Tax Loss or Purchaser Indemnified Tax
Loss subject to indemnification pursuant to this Section 5.06 shall be
calculated on an After-Tax Basis.

 

5.07 _Purchase Price Adjustment and Interest_. Any amount paid by Seller or
Purchaser under Article V will be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price unless a Final Determination to the contrary is made. Any payment
required to be made by Purchaser or Seller under Article V that is not made
when due shall bear interest, compounded daily, at a rate per annum equal to
the Prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition for
each day until paid.

5.08 _Survival_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
the representations and warranties contained in Section 2.15 shall not survive
the Closing, and the provisions of this Article V shall survive until three
months after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (giving
effect to any waiver, mitigation or extension thereof).

8.04 _Procedures_. (a) _Third Party Claims_. In order for a Person (the "
_Indemnified Party_ ") to be entitled to any indemnification provided for
under Section 8.02 or 8.03 in respect of, arising out of or involving a claim
made by any Person against the Indemnified Party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "),
such Indemnified Party must notify the indemnifying party in writing (and in
reasonable detail) of the Third Party Claim within ten (10) Business Days
after receipt by such indemnified party of notice of the Third Party Claim;
_provided_ , _however_ , that failure to give such notification shall not
affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the
indemnifying party shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such
failure. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the indemnifying
party, within five (5) Business Days time after the Indemnified Partys
receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers)
received by the indemnified party relating to the Third Party Claim.

(b) _Assumption_. If a Third Party Claim is made against an Indemnified Party,
the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in the defense
thereof and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with counsel
selected by the indemnifying party, in each case at its own expense. The
indemnifying party shall not be entitled to assume or maintain control of the
defense of any Third Party Claim and shall pay the fees and expenses of
counsel retained by the Indemnified Party if (i) the Third Party Claim relates
to or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding, action,
indictment, allegation or investigation, or (ii) the indemnifying party has
failed or is failing to prosecute or defend the Third Party Claim. Should the
indemnifying party be so entitled to and so elect to assume the defense of a
Third Party Claim, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the
Indemnified Party for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by the
Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof. If the indemnifying
party assumes such defense, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel (not reasonably
objected to by the indemnifying party), at its own expense,

 



-66-   separate from the counsel employed by the indemnifying party, it being
understood that the indemnifying party shall control such defense. The
foregoing notwithstanding, the indemnifying party shall be liable for the
fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party for any period
during which the indemnifying party has not assumed the defense thereof (other
than during any period in which the Indemnified Party shall have failed to
give notice of the Third Party Claim as provided above) or if the Indemnified
Party has been advised by its outside counsel that there exists a conflict of
interest that would make it inappropriate for the same counsel to represent
both the Indemnified Party and the indemnifying party. If the indemnifying
party is entitled to and chooses to defend or prosecute a Third Party Claim,
all the Indemnified Parties shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution
thereof; if the Indemnified Parties are entitled to and choose to so defend
or prosecute, the indemnifying party shall cooperate in such defense or
prosecution. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the
indemnifying partys request) the provision to the indemnifying party of
records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Third Party
Claim, and making directors, officers, agents, advisors and employees
reasonably available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.
With respect to any Third Party Claim, neither the indemnifying party (if it
does not assume the defense of such Third Party Claim) nor the Indemnified
Party (whether or not the indemnifying party assumes the defense of such
Third Party Claim), without the prior written consent of the other party, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, may settle,
compromise or discharge any Third-Party Claim or permit a default or consent
to entry of any judgment with respect to such Third-Party Claim. If the
indemnifying party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, it shall not,
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, settle, compromise or
discharge any Third-Party Claim or permit a default or consent to entry of any
judgment with respect to such Third-Party Claim, unless (i) the
indemnifying party pays the full amount of the monetary liability in
connection with such Third Party Claim, (ii) such settlement or compromise
does not contain any admission of liability or wrongdoing by the Indemnified
Party and (iii) such settlement or compromise does not impose any sanctions,
restrictions or obligations (other than monetary liabilities paid by the
indemnifying party)) on the Indemnified Party.

(c) _Other Claims_. In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim
against any indemnifying party under Sections 8.02 or 8.03 that does not
involve a Third Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be collected
from such Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall deliver notice of
such claim with reasonable promptness to the indemnifying party. Subject to
Section 8.01, the failure by any Indemnified Party so to notify
the indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any
liability that it may have to such Indemnified Party under Sections 8.02 or
8.03, except to the extent that the indemnifying party demonstrates that it
has been actually prejudiced by such failure. If the indemnifying party does
not notify the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days following the receipt
of a notice with respect to any such claim that the indemnifying party
disputes its indemnity obligation to the Indemnified Party for any Covered
Losses with respect to such claim, such Covered Losses shall be conclusively
deemed a liability of the indemnifying party and the indemnifying party shall
promptly pay to the Indemnified Party any and all Covered Losses arising out
of such claim. If the indemnifying party has timely disputed its indemnity
obligation for any Covered Losses with respect to such claim, the parties
shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute and, if
not resolved through negotiations, such

 



-67-   dispute shall be resolved by litigation in an appropriate court of
jurisdiction determined pursuant to Sections 10.07 and 10.08.

 

8.05 _Limitations on Liability_. (a) Except as otherwise specifically provided
in this Agreement (including Sections 7.01 and 10.06), each of Parent and the
Purchaser acknowledges that its sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any
and all claims relating to this Agreement, the Transaction and the other
transactions contemplated hereby (other than claims of, or causes of action
arising from, fraud) shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set
forth in this Article VIII. In furtherance of the foregoing, each of Parent
and the Purchaser hereby waives, from and after the Closing, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all rights, claims and causes
of action (other than claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud,
willful misconduct, or willful misrepresentation) it may have against the
Seller and/or any of its Affiliates arising under or based upon this
Agreement, any document or certificate delivered in connection herewith, any
applicable Law or otherwise (except pursuant to the indemnification provisions
set forth in this Article VIII and except as otherwise specifically provided
in this Agreement (including Section 7.01 and 10.06)).

(b) The Seller shall have no liability for indemnification pursuant to
Section 8.02(a)(i) (other than a misrepresentation or breach of warranty under
any of Sections 2.01, 2.02, 2.03(a), 2.04 and 2.08) with respect to Covered
Losses for which indemnification is provided thereunder, unless such Covered
Losses exceed in the aggregate $3,000,000, in which case the Seller shall be
liable for all such Covered Losses in excess of such threshold amount, and in
no event shall the Seller have any liability or indemnification obligation
for Covered Losses for claims made pursuant to Section 8.02(a)(i) in excess of
twelve percent (12%) of the Purchase Price (the " _Cap_ ") in the aggregate.
No indemnified party shall be entitled to recover from an indemnifying party
more than once in respect of the same Covered Losses.

(c) Parent and the Purchaser shall have no liability for indemnification
pursuant to Section 8.03(a), with respect to Covered Losses for which
indemnification is provided thereunder (i) unless such Covered Losses exceed
in the aggregate $3,000,000, in which case Parent and the Purchaser shall be
liable for all such Covered Losses in excess of such threshold amount;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Parent and the Purchaser have
any liability or indemnification obligation for Covered Losses for claims
made pursuant to Section 8.03(a)(i) in excess of the Cap in the aggregate. No
indemnified party shall be entitled to recover from an indemnifying party more
than once in respect of the same Covered Losses.

 

8.06 _Mitigation._ (a) Parent and the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the
Seller, on the other hand, shall mitigate any Covered Loss for which
indemnification is sought under this Agreement in accordance with applicable
law and in the event that Parent, the Purchaser or the Seller shall fail to so
mitigate any claim or liability, then anything to the contrary
contained herein notwithstanding, the other party shall not be required to
indemnify any Person solely for the portion of Covered Losses that would
reasonably be expected to have been avoided if Parent, the Purchaser or the
Seller, as the case may be, had made such efforts.

(b) The Indemnified Party shall seek full recovery from any third parties and
under all insurance policies covering any Covered Loss to the same extent as
it would if such Covered Loss were not subject to indemnification pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement. In

 



-68-   the event that any payment is made in respect of Covered Losses, the
indemnifying party who made such payment shall be subrogated to the extent of
such payment to any related rights of recovery of the indemnitee receiving
such payment against any third party; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
indemnifying party exercising such subrogation rights shall consult in good
faith with the indemnitee prior to and during the course of seeking any
recovery. In the event that an insurance or other recovery is made by the
indemnitee with respect to any Covered Loss for which it has been indemnified
hereunder, then a refund equal to the aggregate amount of the recovery or
benefit (less any Tax payable in respect of such recovery or benefit) shall
be made promptly to the indemnifying party that provided such indemnification
to the indemnitee; _provided_ , _howeve_ r, that such refund shall not exceed
the aggregate amount of indemnity payments made by the indemnitee to the
indemnifying party with respect to such Covered Loss.

8.07  _Adjustments_. All payments made pursuant to this Article VIII shall be
treated by the parties hereto on all applicable Tax Returns as an adjustment
to the Purchase Price, unless required to be treated otherwise by applicable
Tax Law. 

8.08 _Tax Claims_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
provisions of this Article VIII shall not apply to representations and
warranties relating to Taxes, claims for Seller Indemnified Tax Losses,
Purchaser Indemnified Tax Losses, indemnification pursuant to Section 5.06 or
any other Tax matters.

10.06 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto hereby agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached,
and that the parties would not have an adequate remedy at law. Accordingly,
the parties hereto acknowledge and hereby (a) agree that, to prevent breaches
or threatened breaches by the Seller, Parent or the Purchaser of any of their
respective covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provision of this Agreement, the Seller and the
Purchaser shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or
restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the other party
(as applicable), and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the other party under this
Agreement, and (b) waive any requirement for security or the posting of any
bond in connection with any such remedy. Each of Parent and the Purchaser
hereby agrees not to raise any objections to the availability of the
equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement by Parent or the Purchaser, and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants and obligations of Parent or the Purchaser under this Agreement. The
foregoing is in addition to any other remedy to which any party is entitled
at law, in equity or otherwise. The parties hereto further agree that nothing
set forth in this Section 10.06 shall require any party hereto to institute
any Proceeding for (or limit any partys right to institute any Proceeding
for) specific performance under this Section 10.06 prior or as a condition to
exercising any termination right under Article VII (and pursuing damages after
such termination). A party who commences any Proceeding for specific
performance pursuant to this Section 10.06 may not thereafter terminate this
Agreement in accordance with the terms of Article VII unless such party
irrevocably withdraws from such Proceeding or such Proceeding is dismissed
with prejudice prior to or simultaneously with such termination.

10.07 _Governing Law and Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall be governed by,
and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of New
York, without regard to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule
(whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New
York. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that all Proceedings
arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the rights and obligations
arising hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in
respect of this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder
brought by the other party hereto or its successors or assigns shall be
brought,

 



-85-   heard and determined in any New York State or federal court sitting in the
Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York. Consistent with the preceding
sentence, each of the parties hereto hereby (a) submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts for the purpose of any Proceeding arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or the rights and obligations arising
hereunder brought by any party hereto and (b) irrevocably waives, and agrees
not to assert by way of motion, defense, counterclaim, or otherwise, in any
such Proceeding, any claim that it or its property is not subject personally
to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that the Proceeding is brought
in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the Proceeding is improper, or
that this Agreement, the Transaction or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may not be enforced in or by any of the above-
named courts. Each party agrees that service of process upon such party in
any such action or proceeding shall be effective if notice is given in
accordance with Section 10.05. Each party hereto irrevocably designates CT
Corporation as its agent and attorney-in-fact for the acceptance of service
of process and making an appearance on its behalf in any such claim or
proceeding and for the taking of all such acts as may be necessary or
appropriate in order to confer jurisdiction over it before the above-named
courts and each party hereto stipulates that such consent and appointment is
irrevocable and coupled with an interest.

10.08 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each party hereby knowingly, intentionally, and
voluntarily waives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any
right it may have to a trial by jury in respect to any litigation directly or
indirectly arising out of, relating to, under or in connection with this
Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby. Each party (a) certifies
that no representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented,
expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of
litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it
and the other parties hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement
by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section
10.08.

10.09 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement (or any portion
thereof) or the application of any such provision (or any portion thereof) to
any Person or circumstance shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in
any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality
or unenforceability shall not, as to that jurisdiction, affect any other
provision hereof (or the remaining portion thereof) or the application of such
provision to any other Persons or circumstances. If any provision of this
Agreement (or any portion thereof) shall be held to be so broad as to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is
enforceable.

10.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument,
and shall become effective when one or more such counterparts have been signed
by each party and delivered (by facsimile, e-mail, or otherwise) to the other
party. This Agreement has been executed in the English language. If this
Agreement is translated into another language, the English language text shall
in any event prevail.

10.11  _Expenses_. Whether or not the Closing takes place, and except as set
forth in this Section 10.11 and Article VIII, all costs and expenses incurred
in connection with this Agreement, the Transaction and the other transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expense,
including all costs and expenses incurred pursuant to Section 4.01.

 



-86-   The Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Seller, on the other hand shall be
responsible 50/50 for all filing fees of the notification and report form
required for the Transaction and the other transactions contemplated hereby
pursuant to the HSR Act and any other applicable Antitrust Laws.

-87-  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Seller, Parent and the Purchaser have duly executed
this Agreement as of the date first written above.
