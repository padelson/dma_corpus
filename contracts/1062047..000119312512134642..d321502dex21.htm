Prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, or the equivalent rate with respect to the jurisdiction and currency, on the amount repaid to Seller from the date such amount was paid by Seller to Purchaser until such repayment.
In addition, Purchaser shall hold Seller harmless for any penalty or interest payable by the IM Business Entities, Seller or any of its Affiliates as a result of any such event. Any such amount shall be paid by Purchaser to Seller within thirty
(30)&nbsp;days of the payment by Seller of any such interest or penalty. Seller agrees, at the expense of Purchaser, to cause the IM Business Entities to file Tax Returns (including amended Tax Returns and claims for Tax refunds) reflecting the
