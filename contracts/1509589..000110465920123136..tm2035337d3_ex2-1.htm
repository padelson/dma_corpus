</FONT></FONT><U>No Fractional Shares of Parent Common Stock</U>. No certificates or scrip or shares representing fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the exchange of Eligible Shares and such fractional share interests will not entitle
the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights of a stockholder of Parent or a holder of shares of Parent Common Stock. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of Eligible Shares exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have
been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates and Book&#45;Entry
Shares held by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to the product of (i)&nbsp;such
fractional part of a share of Parent Common Stock multiplied by (ii)&nbsp;the volume weighted average price of Parent Common Stock
for the five (5) consecutive trading days immediately prior to the Closing Date as reported by Bloomberg, L.P. As promptly as
practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of fractional interests, the Exchange
Agent shall so notify Parent, and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to forward payments to such holders of fractional interests
subject to and in accordance with the terms hereof. The payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock is
not a separately bargained&#45;for consideration but merely represents a mechanical rounding&#45;off of the fractions in

notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval, to be
held as promptly as reasonably practicable following the clearance of the Joint Proxy Statement by the SEC and the
Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC. Except as permitted by <U>Section&nbsp;6.4(e)</U>, the Parent Board
shall recommend that the stockholders of Parent approve the Parent Stock Issuance and the Parent Board shall solicit from
stockholders of Parent proxies in favor of the Parent Stock Issuance, and the Joint Proxy Statement shall include the Parent
Board Recommendation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Parent (i)&nbsp;shall be required
to adjourn or postpone the Parent Stockholders Meeting (A)&nbsp;to the extent necessary to ensure that any legally required
supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement is provided to the Parent&#8217;s stockholders or (B)&nbsp;if, as of the
time for which the Parent Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, there are insufficient shares of Parent Common Stock represented
(either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct business at such Parent Stockholders Meeting and
(ii)&nbsp;may adjourn or postpone the Parent Stockholders Meeting if, as of the time for which the Parent Stockholders
Meeting is scheduled, there are insufficient shares of Parent Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to
obtain the Parent Stockholder Approval; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties, the
Parent Stockholders Meeting shall not be adjourned or postponed to a date that is more than fifteen (15) Business Days after
the date for which the meeting was previously scheduled (it being understood that such Parent Stockholders Meeting shall be
adjourned or postponed every time the circumstances described in the foregoing <U>clauses&nbsp;(i)(A) </U>and <U>(i)(B)</U>
exist, and such Parent Stockholders Meeting may be adjourned or postponed every time the circumstances described in the
foregoing <U>clause&nbsp;(ii)</U> exist); and <U>provided further</U> that the Parent Stockholders Meeting shall not be
adjourned or postponed to a date on or after three (3) Business Days prior to the Outside Date. If requested by the Company,
Parent shall promptly provide the Company with all voting tabulation reports relating to the Parent Stockholders Meeting that
have been prepared by Parent or Parent&#8217;s transfer agent, proxy solicitor or other Representative, and shall otherwise
keep the Company reasonably informed regarding the status of the solicitation and any material oral or written communications
from or to Parent&#8217;s stockholders with respect thereto. Unless there has been a Parent Change of Recommendation in
accordance with <U>Section&nbsp;6.4</U>, the Parties agree to cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to defend
against any efforts by any of the Parent&#8217;s stockholders or any other Person to prevent the Parent Stockholder Approval
from being obtained. Once Parent has established a record date for the Parent Stockholders Meeting, Parent shall not change
such record date or establish a different record date for the Parent Stockholders Meeting without the prior written consent
of the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless required to do so by
applicable Law or its Organizational Documents or in connection with a postponement or adjournment permitted hereunder.</P>

</FONT></B></FONT><B><U>Specific Performance</U></B>. The Parties agree that irreparable damage, for which monetary damages would
not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached by the Parties. Prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;8.1</U>,
it is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, or any other appropriate form of specific
performance or equitable relief, to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions hereof in any court of competent jurisdiction, in each case in accordance with this <U>Section&nbsp;9.11</U>, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under the terms of this Agreement at Law or in equity. Each Party
accordingly agrees (a) the non-breaching Party will be entitled to injunctive and other equitable relief, without proof of actual
damages; and (b) the alleged breaching Party will not raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific
performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations
of such Party under this Agreement and will not plead in defense thereto that there are adequate remedies at Law, all in accordance
with the terms of this <U>Section&nbsp;9.11</U>. Each Party further agrees that no other Party or any other Person shall be required
to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred
to in this <U>Section&nbsp;9.11</U>, and each Party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing

the performance of the terms and provisions hereof by any other Party, the Outside Date shall automatically be extended by such
other time period established by the court presiding over such action.</P>

similar rights. If the Issuer is required to purchase outstanding Notes or such other Indebtedness pursuant to a Change of
Control Offer, the Issuer expects that it would seek third-party financing to the extent it does not have available funds to
meet its purchase obligations. However, the Issuer cannot assure any Holder that the Issuer would be able to obtain such
financing. In addition, the Issuer may be required to obtain a waiver or amendment under the Senior Credit Facility to permit
the repurchase of the Notes. The Issuer cannot assure you that it could obtain such a waiver or amendment. Additionally, the
occurrence of certain change of control events identified in the Senior Credit Facility would constitute an event of default
under the Senior Credit Facility which would permit the lenders thereunder to accelerate all indebtedness under the Senior
Credit Facility. The failure of the Issuer to make or consummate the Change of Control Offer or pay the required amount for

the investor owns its interest). Payments of principal, premium (if any) and interest with respect to the Notes represented by
a Global Note will be made by the trustee to DTC&rsquo;s nominee as the registered holder of the Global Note. We understand that
under existing industry practice, in the event an owner of a beneficial interest in a Global Note desires to take any action that
the DTC, as the holder of the Global Note, is entitled to take, the DTC would authorize the participants to take such action, and
the participants would authorize beneficial owners owning through such participants to take such action or would otherwise act
upon the instructions of beneficial owners owning through them.</P>

its nominee, upon receipt of any payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Global Notes will credit participants&rsquo;
accounts with payments in amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in the principal amount of the Global
Notes as shown on the records of the DTC or its nominee. We also expect that payments by participants or indirect participants
to owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes held through such participants or indirect participants will be governed
by standing instructions and customary practices and will be the responsibility of such participants or indirect participants.
We will not have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to, or payments made on account of, beneficial
ownership interests in the Global Notes for any Note or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such
beneficial ownership interests or for any other aspect of the relationship between the DTC and its participants or indirect participants
