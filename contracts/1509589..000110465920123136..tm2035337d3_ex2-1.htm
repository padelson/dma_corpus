conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub will be
merged with and into the Company in accordance with the provisions of the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "). As a
result of the Merger, the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and

take place by the exchange of documents by "portable document format" ("

is three (3) Business Days following the satisfaction or (to the extent
permitted by applicable Law) waiver in accordance with this Agreement of all
of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (other than any such conditions
which by their nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date, which shall
be required to be so satisfied or (to the extent permitted by applicable Law)
waived in accordance with this Agreement on the Closing Date), unless another
date or place is agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company. For purposes
of this Agreement " _Closing Date_" shall mean the date on which the Closing
occurs.

  



  

(b)  As soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the Parties
will cause a certificate of merger prepared and executed in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be
filed with the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The
Merger shall become effective at such time on the Closing Date as the Parties
shall agree in writing and shall specify in the Certificate of Merger (the
time the Merger becomes effective being the " _Effective Time_").

  



  

Section 2.3   _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the
Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and the applicable
provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of each of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the
Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions,
disabilities and duties of each of the Company and Merger Sub shall become
the debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of
the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

Section 2.4 _Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation_. At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the
Company in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended
and restated in its entirety as of the Effective Time to be in the form set

Merger Sub or the Company:

  



  

(a)   _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of capital stock
of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and shall represent one fully paid and nonassessable

Corporation, which shall constitute the only outstanding shares of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective Time.

(b)   _Capital Stock of the Company_.

  



  

(i)  Subject to the other provisions of this _Article III_ ,
each share of Company Common Stock, issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (excluding any Excluded Shares and Non-Cancelled Shares,
but, for purposes of clarity, including Company Stock Awards and shares of
Company Common Stock underlying Company RSU Awards, the " _Eligible Shares_
") shall be converted into the right to receive from Parent that number of
fully paid and nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the
Exchange Ratio (together with any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with _Section 3.3(h)_, the "
_Merger Consideration_ "). As used in this Agreement, " _Exchange Ratio_ "
means a number (rounded to five decimal places) obtained by dividing the
Existing Company Stockholder Equity Recovery by Eligible Shares.

  



  

(ii)  All such shares of Company Common Stock, when so converted,
shall cease to be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and cease
to exist. Each holder of a share of Company Common Stock that was outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Non-Cancelled Shares)
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive (A) the Merger Consideration (including any cash to be paid in lieu
of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with  _Section

applicable, in accordance with _Section 3.3(a)_.

  



  

(iii)  All shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company as
treasury shares or by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time and, in each case, not held on behalf of third parties (collectively, "
_Excluded Shares_ ") shall automatically be cancelled and cease to exist as
of the Effective Time, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor. All shares of Company Common Stock held by any direct or
indirect Subsidiary of the Company or Parent (other than Merger Sub) shall
remain outstanding with appropriate adjustment to the number thereof to
preserve the relative percentage interest in the Company represented by such
shares (collectively, the " _Non -Cancelled Shares_").

  



  

(iv)   Following November 19, 2020 (the " _Tax Plan Record Date_
"), each share of Parent Common Stock will have an associated right (each, a
" _Parent Right_ ") to purchase one-one thousandth (subject to adjustment) of
a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per
share (the " _Parent Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock_ "), of
Parent pursuant to the terms of the Tax Plan, and, following the Tax Plan
Record Date, all references in this Agreement to shares of Parent Common
Stock shall be deemed to refer to the Parent Rights associated therewith, as
appropriate.

  



  

(c) _Impact of Stock Splits, Etc_. In the event of any change
in (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock, or
securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of
Company Common Stock or (ii) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock, or
securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of
Parent Common Stock (including options to purchase Parent Common Stock), in
each case issued and outstanding after the date of this Agreement and prior
to the Effective Time by reason of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, combination,
exchange of shares or the like, the Exchange Ratio shall be equitably adjusted
to reflect the effect of such change and, as so adjusted, shall from and
after the date of such event, be the Merger Consideration, subject to further
adjustment in accordance with this _Section 3.1(c)_. Nothing in this _Section
3.1(c) _shall be construed to permit the Parties to take any action except to
the extent consistent with, and not otherwise prohibited by, the terms of
this Agreement.

Section 3.2   _Treatment of Equity Compensation Awards_.

  



  

(a)  Each outstanding award of
restricted Company Common Stock issued pursuant to the Company's 2012 Equity
Incentive Plan, as amended (the " _Company Equity Plan_ ") that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a  " _Company
Stock Award_ ") shall terminate and be cancelled as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time and be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, net of any Taxes withheld pursuant to _Section 3.3(i)_ (which
Taxes shall be withheld by the Surviving Corporation and deemed conveyed to
the holder as shares of Parent Common Stock that would otherwise be received
by the holder pursuant to _Section 3.3(a)_), with respect to the numbers of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time. For purposes of clarity,
notwithstanding this _Section 3.2(a)_, such Company Stock Awards shall be
deemed outstanding shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time and shall be treated as Eligible Shares within the meaning of
_Section 3.1(b)(i)_. Following the Effective Time, no such Company Stock
Award that was outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
remain outstanding and each former holder of any such Company Stock Award
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive the Merger Consideration in exchange for such Company Stock Award
in accordance with this _Section 3.2(a)_.

  



  

(b)  Each outstanding award of restricted stock units issued
pursuant to the Company Equity Plan that is outstanding or payable
immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a " _Company RSU Award_ "),
whether vested or unvested, shall terminate and be cancelled as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time and be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, net of any Taxes withheld pursuant to
_Section 3.3(i)_ (which Taxes shall be withheld by the Surviving Corporation
and deemed conveyed to the holder as shares of Parent Common Stock that would
otherwise be received by the holder pursuant to _Section 3.3(a)_), with
respect to the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time. For purposes of
clarity, notwithstanding this _Section 3.2(b)_, the shares of Company Common
Stock underlying such Company RSU Awards shall be deemed outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time and shall be
treated as Eligible Shares within the meaning of _Section 3.1(b)(i)_.
Following the Effective Time, no such Company RSU Award that was outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding and each
former holder of any such Company RSU Award shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
exchange for such Company RSU Award in accordance with this _Section 3.2(b)_.

  



  

(c)   Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if
appropriate, any committee thereof administering the Company Equity Plan)
shall pass any necessary resolutions to effect the foregoing provisions of
this _Section 3.2_. The Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration contemplated within this _Section 3.2_ in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Company Equity Plan.

Section 3.3   _Payment for Securities; Exchange_.

  



  

(a)   _Exchange Agent; Exchange Fund_. Prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall enter into an agreement with a commercial bank, trust
company or transfer agent that is mutually acceptable to the Company and
Parent to act as agent for the holders of Company Common Stock in connection
with the Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") and to receive the Merger
Consideration (including cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional
shares, pursuant to _Section 3.3(h)_) to which such holders shall become
entitled pursuant to this _Article III_. Promptly after the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for
the benefit of the holders of Eligible Shares, for issuance in accordance
with this _Article III_ through the Exchange Agent, the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable to in respect of Eligible Shares pursuant to
_Section 3.1_. Parent agrees to make available to the Exchange Agent, from
time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay any dividends and other
distributions pursuant to _Section 3.3(g)_ and to make payments in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to _Section 3.3(h)_. The Exchange Agent shall,
pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration
contemplated to be issued in exchange for Eligible Shares pursuant to this
Agreement out of the Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated by this _Section
3.3(a)_, _Section 3.3(g)_ and _Section 3.3(h)_, the Exchange Fund shall not
be used for any other purpose. Any cash and shares of Parent Common Stock
deposited with the Exchange Agent (including as payment for fractional shares
in accordance with _Section 3.3(h)_ and any dividends or other
distributions in accordance with _Section 3.3(g)_) shall hereinafter be
referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_." Parent or the Surviving Corporation
shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Exchange Agent, in
connection with the exchange of Eligible Shares pursuant to this Agreement.
The cash portion of the Exchange Fund may be invested by the Exchange
Agent as reasonably directed by Parent. To the extent, for any reason, the
amount in the Exchange Fund is below that required to make prompt payment of
the aggregate cash payments contemplated by this _Article III_ , Parent shall
promptly replace, restore or supplement the cash in the Exchange Fund so as
to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level
sufficient for the Exchange Agent to make the payment of the aggregate cash
payments contemplated by this _Article III_. Any interest or other income
resulting from investment of the cash portion of the Exchange Fund shall
become part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts
payable hereunder shall, at the discretion of Parent, be promptly returned to
Parent or the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

(b)   _Payment Procedures_.

  



  

(i) _Certificates_. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to deliver to each
record holder, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, of an
outstanding certificate or certificates that immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented Eligible Shares (" _Certificates_ "), a notice
advising such holders of the effectiveness of the Merger and a letter of
transmittal (" _Letter of Transmittal_ ") (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificates shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of such Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and which
shall be in a customary form and agreed to by Parent and the Company prior
to the Closing) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
Certificates for payment of the Merger Consideration set forth in _Section
3.1(b)(i)_. Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together
with the Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other customary documents
as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) one or more
shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in uncertificated book-entry
form) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares of Parent
Common Stock, if any, that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
_Section 3.1_ (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock
then held by such holder) and (B) a check in the amount equal to the cash
payable in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to
_Section 3.3(h)_ and dividends and other distributions pursuant to _Section
3.3(g)_.

(ii)   _Non -DTC Book-Entry Shares_. As soon as practicable after
the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to deliver to each
record holder, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, of Eligible
Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book -Entry Shares_") not held through
the Depository Trust Company ("DTC"), (A) a notice advising such holders of
the effectiveness of the Merger, (B) a statement reflecting the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in uncertificated book-entry
form) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares of
Parent Common Stock, if any, that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to _Section 3.1_ (after taking into account all shares of Company
Common Stock then held by such holder) and (C) a check in the amount equal to
the cash payable in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
pursuant to _Section 3.3(h)_ and dividends and other distributions
pursuant to _Section 3.3(g)_.

  



  

(iii)   _DTC Book -Entry Shares_. With respect to Book-Entry Shares
held through DTC, Parent and the Company shall cooperate to establish
procedures with the Exchange Agent and DTC to ensure that the Exchange Agent
will transmit to DTC or its nominees as soon as reasonably practicable on or
after the Closing Date, upon surrender of Eligible Shares held of record by
DTC or its nominees in accordance with DTC's customary surrender procedures,
the Merger Consideration (including cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with _Section 3.3(h)_, if any)
and any unpaid non-stock dividends and any other dividends or other
distributions, in each case, that DTC has the right to receive pursuant to
this _Article III_.

  



  

(iv)  No interest shall be paid or accrued on any amount payable
for Eligible Shares pursuant to this _Article III_.

  



  

(v) With respect to Certificates, if payment of the Merger
Consideration (including any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock in accordance with _Section 3.3(h)_) and dividends or
other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section
3.3(g)_ is to be made to a Person other than the record holder of such
Eligible Shares, it shall be a condition of payment that shares so surrendered
shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer
and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and
other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration
(including any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock in accordance with _Section 3.3(h)_) and dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section
3.3(g)_ to a Person other than the registered holder of such shares
surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that such Taxes either have been paid or are not applicable. With
respect to Book-Entry Shares, payment of the Merger Consideration (including
any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
in accordance with _Section 3.3(h)_) and dividends or other distributions
with respect to Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section 3.3(g)_ shall only
be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered in
the stock transfer books of the Company as of the Effective Time. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.3(b)(v)_, each Certificate
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration (including any
cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock in
accordance with _Section 3.3(h)_) and any dividends or other distributions
to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 3.3(g)_ payable
in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock.

(c)   _Termination of Rights_. All Merger Consideration
(including any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock in accordance with _Section 3.3(h)_) and dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section
3.3(g)_ paid upon the surrender of and in exchange for Eligible Shares in
accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Common Stock. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation shall be
closed immediately, and there shall be no further registration of transfers
on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of
Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged for the Merger Consideration (including any cash to be paid in lieu
of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with _Section
3.3(h)_) and dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common
Stock pursuant to _Section 3.3(g)_ payable in respect of the Eligible Shares
previously represented by such Certificates.

  



  

(d)   _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the former stockholders of the
Company on the 180th day after the Closing Date shall be delivered to Parent,
upon demand, and any former common stockholders of the Company who have not
theretofore received the Merger Consideration, (including any cash to be paid
in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with
_Section 3.3(h)_) and dividends or other distributions with respect to
Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section 3.3(g)_, in each case without
interest thereon, to which they are entitled under this _Article III_ shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation and Parent for payment of
their claim for such amounts.

  



  

(e)   _No Liability_. None of the Surviving Corporation, Parent,
Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of Company
Common Stock for any amount of Merger Consideration properly delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. If any Certificate has not been surrendered prior to the time
that is immediately prior to the time at which Merger Consideration in
respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property
of any Governmental Entity, any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions
in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest
of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

   

10

 



    



    

(f)   _Lost, Stolen, or Destroyed Certificates_. If any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by the Surviving Corporation,
the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the
Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
Merger Consideration (including any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with _Section 3.3(h)_) and
dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock pursuant
to _Section 3.3(g)_ payable in respect of the shares of Company Common
Stock formerly represented by such Certificate.

  



  

(g)   _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of
Parent Common Stock_. No dividends or other distributions declared or made
with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the
Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate
with respect to the whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder would
be entitled to receive upon surrender of such Certificate and no cash payment
in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any such
holder, in each case until such holder shall surrender such Certificate in
accordance with this _Section 3.3_. Following surrender of any such
Certificate, there shall be paid to such holder of whole shares of Parent
Common Stock issuable in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly
after the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid
with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a
payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole
shares of Parent Common Stock. For purposes of dividends or other
distributions in respect of shares of Parent Common Stock, all whole shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled to
dividends pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence as if such whole
shares of Parent Common Stock were issued and outstanding as of the Effective
Time.

  



  

(h)   _No Fractional Shares of Parent Common Stock_. No
certificates or scrip or shares representing fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock shall be issued upon the exchange of Eligible Shares and such
fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
have any rights of a stockholder of Parent or a holder of shares of Parent
Common Stock. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each
holder of Eligible Shares exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise
have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock
(after taking into account all Certificates and Book-Entry Shares held by
such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an
amount equal to the product of (i) such fractional part of a share of Parent
Common Stock multiplied by (ii) the volume weighted average price of Parent
Common Stock for the five (5) consecutive trading days immediately prior to
the Closing Date as reported by Bloomberg, L.P. As promptly as practicable
after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders
of fractional interests, the Exchange Agent shall so notify Parent, and
Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to forward payments to such holders of
fractional interests subject to and in accordance with the terms hereof. The
payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock is not a
separately bargained-for consideration but merely represents a mechanical
rounding-off of the fractions in the exchange.

  



  

   

11

 



    



  

(i)   _Withholding Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange
Agent, each of their respective Affiliates and any other applicable
withholding agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts
otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement any amount required
to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that except with respect to
withholding of Taxes pursuant to or in accordance with _Section 3.2_, Parent
shall provide at least five (5) days' written notice to the Company if Parent
intends to withhold any amounts under this _Section 3.3(i)_. To the extent
that such amounts are so properly deducted or withheld and paid over to the
relevant Taxing Authority, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person with
respect to which such amounts would have been paid absent such deduction or
withholding, and if withholding is taken in Parent Common Stock, the relevant
withholding agent shall be treated as having sold such Parent Common Stock on
behalf of such Person for an amount of cash equal to the fair market value
thereof at the time of such deemed sale and paid such cash proceeds to the
relevant Taxing Authority.

  



  

Section 3.4   _No Dissenters ' Rights_. No dissenters' or appraisal
rights shall be available with respect to the Transactions.

  



  

Article IV

operate its assets and properties and to carry on its business as now being
conducted, other than, in the case of the Company's Subsidiaries, where the
failure to be so organized or to have such power, authority or standing would

Material Adverse Effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole
(a  " _Company Material Adverse Effect_ "). Each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed and in good standing to do
business in each jurisdiction in which the business it is conducting, or the
operation, ownership or leasing of its assets or properties, makes such
qualification or license necessary, other than where the failure to so
qualify, license or be in good standing would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.
The Company has heretofore made available to Parent complete and correct
copies of its Organizational Documents and the Organizational Documents of
each Subsidiary of the Company, each as amended prior to the execution of
this Agreement, and each as made available to Parent is in full force

filed or furnished under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, respectively
(such forms, reports, certifications, schedules, statements and documents,
collectively, the " _Company SEC Documents_ "). As of their respective dates,
each of the Company SEC Documents, as amended, complied, or if not yet filed
or furnished, will comply, as to form in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the

subsequent to the date of this Agreement, will contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

  



  

(b)  The financial statements of the Company included in the
Company SEC Documents, including all notes and schedules thereto, complied,

case of Company SEC Documents filed after the date of this Agreement, will
be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in
the United States (" _GAAP_ ") applied on a consistent basis during the

internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls
and procedures (as such terms are defined in Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15, as
applicable, under the Exchange Act); such disclosure controls and procedures
are designed to ensure that material information relating to the Company,
including its consolidated Subsidiaries, required to be disclosed by Parent
in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated
and communicated to the Company's principal executive officer and its
principal financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure; and such disclosure controls and procedures are effective to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC
rules and forms, and further designed and maintained to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of the Company's financial reporting and
the preparation of Company financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP. There (i) is no significant deficiency or material
weakness in the design or operation of internal controls of financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act utilized by
the Company or its Subsidiaries, (ii) is not, and since January 1, 2020
there has not been, any illegal act or fraud, whether or not material, that

Company's internal controls, and (iii) is not, and since January 1, 2020 there
has not been, any "extensions of credit" (within the meaning of Section 402
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) or prohibited loans to any executive officer of
the Company (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) or director of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The principal executive officer and
the principal financial officer of the Company have made all certifications
required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Exchange Act and any related rules and
regulations promulgated by the SEC with respect to the Company SEC Documents,

Section 4.17   _Oil and Gas Matters_.

  



  

(a) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect, and except for property (i) sold
or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of business since the date of
the reserve report prepared by Netherland, Sewell and Associates, Inc. (in such
capacity, the " _Company Independent Petroleum Engineers_ ") relating to the
Company interests referred to therein as of December 31, 2019 (the " _Company
Reserve Report_ ") or (ii) reflected in the Company Reserve Report or in the
Company SEC Documents as having been sold or otherwise disposed of (other
than sales or dispositions after the date hereof in accordance with _Section
6.1(b)(v)_), the Company and its Subsidiaries have good and defensible title
to all Oil and Gas Properties forming the basis for the reserves reflected
in the Company Reserve Report and in each case as attributable to interests
owned by the Company and its Subsidiaries, free and clear of any
Encumbrances, except for Permitted Encumbrances. For purposes of the foregoing
sentence, "good and defensible title" means that the Company's or one and/or
more of its Subsidiaries', as applicable, title (as of the date hereof and as
of the Closing) to each of the Oil and Gas Properties held or owned by them
(or purported to be held or owned by them) beneficially or of record with any
applicable Governmental Entity that (1) entitles the Company (and/or one or
more of its Subsidiaries, as applicable) to receive (after satisfaction of all
Production Burdens applicable thereto), not less than the net revenue
interest share shown in the Company Reserve Report of all Hydrocarbons
produced from such Oil and Gas Properties throughout the productive life of
such Oil and Gas Properties (other than decreases in connection with
operations in which the Company and/or its Subsidiaries may be a non-
consenting co-owner, decreases resulting from reversion of interests to co-
owners with respect to operations in which such co-owners elected not to
consent, decreases resulting from the establishment of pools or units, and
decreases required to allow other working interest owners to make up past
underproduction or pipelines to make up past under deliveries; in each case,
to the extent occurring after the date of the Company Reserve Report), (2)
obligates the Company (and/or one or more of its Subsidiaries, as applicable)
to bear a percentage of the costs and expenses for the maintenance and
development of, and operations relating to, such Oil and Gas Properties, of
not greater than the working interest shown on the Company Reserve Report for
such Oil and Gas Properties (other than any positive difference between such
actual percentage and the applicable working interest shown on the Company
Reserve Report for such Oil and Gas Properties that are accompanied by a
proportionate (or greater) increase in the net revenue interest in such Oil
and Gas Properties) and (3) is free and clear of all Encumbrances (other than
Permitted Encumbrances).

  



  

(b)  Except for any such matters that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect, the factual, non-interpretive data supplied by the Company to
the Company Independent Petroleum Engineers relating to the Company interests
referred to in the Company Reserve Report, by or on behalf of the Company and
its Subsidiaries that was material to such firm's estimates of proved oil and
gas reserves attributable to the Oil and Gas Properties of the Company and
its Subsidiaries in connection with the preparation of the Company Reserve
Report was, as of the time provided (or modified or amended prior to the
issuance of the Company Reserve Reports), accurate in all respects. To the
Company's knowledge, any assumptions or estimates provided by the Company
Subsidiaries to the Company Reserve Engineer in connection with its
preparation of the Company Reserve Reports were made in good faith and on a
reasonable basis based on the facts and circumstances in existence and that
were known to the Company at the time such assumptions or estimates were made.
Except for any such matters that, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, the oil and
gas reserve estimates of the Company set forth in the Company Reserve Report
are derived from reports that have been prepared by the Company
Independent Petroleum Engineers, and such reserve estimates fairly reflect,
in all respects, the oil and gas reserves of the Company at the dates
indicated therein and are in accordance with SEC guidelines applicable thereto
applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved. Except for
changes generally affecting the oil and gas exploration, development and
production industry (including changes in commodity prices) and normal
depletion by production, there has been no change in respect of the matters
addressed in the Company Reserve Report that would reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

timely paid or contested in good faith in the ordinary course of business,
(ii) all royalties, minimum royalties, overriding royalties and other
Production Burdens with respect to any Oil and Gas Properties owned or held
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries have been timely and properly paid
or contested in good faith in the ordinary course of business (other than any
such Production Burdens which are being held in suspense by the Company or its
Subsidiaries in accordance with applicable Law) and (iii) none of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (and, to the Company's knowledge, no third party
operator) has violated any provision of, or taken or failed to take any act
that, with or without notice, lapse of time, or both, would constitute a
default under the provisions of any Oil and Gas Lease (or entitle the lessor
thereunder to cancel or terminate such Oil and Gas Lease) included in the Oil
and Gas Properties owned or held by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. To the Company's knowledge, Schedule 4.17(c) of the Company
Disclosure Letter sets forth all the material Oil and Gas Leases where the

and completion (and plugging and abandonment) of such Wells and such other
wells that were drilled and completed (and plugged and abandoned) by the
Company or its Subsidiaries have been conducted in compliance with all such
applicable Oil and Gas Lease(s), Contracts and applicable Law except, in each
case, as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(f)  Except as would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, all Oil
and Gas Properties operated by the Company or its Subsidiaries (and, to the

Company or any of its Subsidiaries and operated by a third party) have been
operated as a reasonably prudent operator in accordance with its past

individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has elected not to participate in any
operation or activity proposed with respect to any of the Oil and Gas
Properties owned or held by it (or them, as applicable) that could result in a
penalty or forfeiture as a result of such election not to participate in such
operation or activity that would be material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole and is not reflected in the Company Reserve
Reports.

  



  

(i)  Except as would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, and to
the knowledge of the Company as of the date of this Agreement, Schedule
4.17(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter lists, as of December 31, 2019, all
transportation, plant, production and other imbalances and overlifts with
respect to Hydrocarbon production from the Oil and Gas Properties of the
Company and its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(j)  Except as would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, with
respect to Oil and Gas Properties operated by the Company and its
Subsidiaries, all currently producing Wells and all tangible equipment
included therein, used in connection with the operation thereof or otherwise
primarily associated therewith (including all buildings, plants, structures,
platforms, pipelines, machinery, vehicles and other rolling stock) are in a
good state of repair and are adequate and sufficient to maintain normal
operations in accordance with past practices (ordinary wear and tear
excepted).

Article V 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB

  



  

Except as set forth in the disclosure letter dated as of the date of this
Agreement and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub to the Company on or
prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Parent Disclosure Letter_ ") and
except as disclosed in the Parent SEC Documents (including all exhibits and
schedules thereto and documents incorporated by reference therein) filed with
or furnished to the SEC and available on Edgar since January 1, 2019 and prior
to the date of this Agreement (excluding any disclosures set forth or
referenced in any risk factor section or in any other section, in each
case, to the extent they are forward-looking statements or cautionary,
predictive, non-specific or forward-looking in nature (but, for clarity,
including any historical factual information contained within such headings,
disclosure or statements)), Parent and Merger Sub jointly and severally
represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

  



  

Section 5.1 _Organization, Standing and Power_. Each of Parent and its
Subsidiaries is a corporation, partnership or limited liability company duly
organized, as the case may be, validly existing and in good standing under the
Laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, with all requisite
entity power and authority to own, lease and operate its assets and
properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted, other than,
in the case of Parent's Subsidiaries, where the failure to be so organized or
to have such power, authority or standing would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (a " _Parent Material Adverse Effect_
"). Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed and in
good standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which the business it is
conducting, or the operation, ownership or leasing of its assets or its
properties, makes such qualification or license necessary, other than where
the failure to so qualify, license or be in good standing would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has heretofore made
available to the Company complete and correct copies of its Organizational
Documents and the Organizational Documents of each Subsidiary of Parent, each
as amended prior to the execution of this Agreement, and each as made
available to Parent is in full force and effect, and neither Parent nor any of
its Subsidiaries is in violation of any of the provisions of such
Organizational Documents.

a direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, are free and clear of
all Encumbrances, other than Permitted Encumbrances, and have been duly

Stock thereunder, which were reserved for issuance as set forth in _Section

Section 5.3 _Authority; No Violations; Consents and Approvals_.

  



  

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate
power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its
obligations hereunder. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent
and Merger Sub and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the
Transactions have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on
the part of each of Parent (subject to obtaining Parent Stockholder Approval)
and Merger Sub (other than the adoption of this Agreement by Parent as sole
stockholder of Merger Sub), which shall occur immediately after the execution
and delivery of this Agreement, and the filing of the Certificate of Merger
with the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each of Parent and Merger
Sub, and assuming the due and valid execution of this Agreement by the
Company, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and
Merger Sub enforceable against Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its
terms, subject, as to enforceability to Creditors' Rights. The Parent Board,
at a meeting duly called and held, has by unanimous vote (i) determined that
this Agreement and the Transactions, including the Parent Stock Issuance, are
fair to, and in the best interests of, Parent and the holders of Parent
Capital Stock, (ii) approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the
Transactions, including the Parent Stock Issuance, and (iii) resolved to
recommend that the holders of Parent Common Stock approve the Parent
Stock Issuance (such recommendation described in _clause (iii)_, the "
_Parent Board Recommendation_ "). The Merger Sub Board, at a meeting duly
called and held, has by unanimous vote (A) determined that this Agreement and
the Transactions, including the Merger, are fair to, and in the best
interests of, Merger Sub and the sole stockholder of Merger Sub and (B)
approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the Transactions,
including the Merger. Parent, as the owner of all of the outstanding shares of
capital stock of Merger Sub, will immediately after the execution and

time or both, result in a violation of, a termination (or right of

statements and documents required to be filed or furnished under the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, respectively (such forms, reports,
certifications, schedules, statements and documents, collectively, the "
_Parent SEC Documents_ "). As of their respective dates, each of the Parent
SEC Documents, as amended, complied, or if not yet filed or furnished, will
comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of
the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case

date of such amendment with respect to those disclosures that are amended),
or if filed with or furnished to the SEC subsequent to the date of this
Agreement, will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading.

regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, were, or, in the case of Parent
SEC Documents filed after the date of this Agreement, will be prepared in

control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures (as
such terms are defined in Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15, as applicable, under the
Exchange Act); such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure
that material information relating to Parent, including its
consolidated Subsidiaries, required to be disclosed by the Company in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and
communicated to Parent's principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure;
and such disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files
or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and
further designed and maintained to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of Parent's financial reporting and the preparation of Parent
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. There (i)
is no significant deficiency or material weakness in the design or operation
of internal controls of financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)
under the Exchange Act) utilized by Parent or its Subsidiaries, (ii) is
not, and since January 1, 2020 there has not been, any illegal act or fraud,

meaning of Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) or prohibited loans to any
executive officer of Parent (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act)
or director of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. The principal executive
officer and the principal financial officer of Parent have made all
certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Exchange Act and any
related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC with respect to Parent
SEC Documents, and the statements contained in such certifications were
complete and correct as of the dates they were made.

forming the basis for the reserves reflected in the Parent Reserve Report and
in each case as attributable to interests owned by Parent and its

positive difference between such actual percentage and the applicable working
interest shown on the Parent Reserve Report for such Oil and Gas Properties

(b) Except for any such matters that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect, the factual, non-interpretive data supplied by Parent to the Parent
Independent Petroleum Engineers relating to Parent interests referred to in
the Parent Reserve Report, by or on behalf of Parent and its Subsidiaries
that was material to such firm's estimates of proved oil and gas reserves
attributable to the Oil and Gas Properties of Parent and its Subsidiaries in
connection with the preparation of the Parent Reserve Report was, as of the
time provided (or modified or amended prior to the issuance of the Company
Reserve Reports), accurate in all respects. To the Company's knowledge, any
assumptions or estimates provided by the Company Subsidiaries to the Company
Reserve Engineer in connection with its preparation of the Company Reserve
Reports were made in good faith and on a reasonable basis based on the facts
and circumstances in existence and that were known to the Company at the time
such assumptions or estimates were made. Except for any such matters that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect, the oil and gas reserve estimates of Parent
set forth in the Parent Reserve Report are derived from reports that
have been prepared by the Parent Independent Petroleum Engineers, and such
reserve estimates fairly reflect, in all respects, the oil and gas reserves
of Parent at the dates indicated therein and are in accordance with SEC
guidelines applicable thereto applied on a consistent basis throughout the
periods involved. Except for changes generally affecting the oil and
gas exploration, development and production industry (including changes in
commodity prices) and normal depletion by production, there has been no
change in respect of the matters addressed in the Parent Reserve Report that
would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a

contested in good faith in the ordinary course of business, (ii)
all royalties, minimum royalties, overriding royalties and other Production
Burdens with respect to any Oil and Gas Properties owned or held by Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries have been timely and properly paid or contested in
good faith in the ordinary course of business (other than any such Production
Burdens which are being held in suspense by Parent or its Subsidiaries in
accordance with applicable Law) and (iii) none of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (and, to Parent's knowledge, no third party operator) has
violated any provision of, or taken or failed to take any act that, with or
without notice, lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default under the
provisions of any Oil and Gas Lease (or entitle the lessor thereunder to
cancel or terminate such Oil and Gas Lease) included in the Oil and Gas
Properties owned or held by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. To the
Parent's knowledge, Schedule 5.17(c) of the Parent Disclosure Letter sets

scheduled to expire by the express terms of such Oil and Gas Lease at any time
in the twelve (12)-month period immediately following the date of this

party operator thereof or any other Person) for any reason other than
awaiting preparation and approval of division order title opinions and the
receipt of division orders for execution for recently drilled Wells.

Effect.

  



  

(f) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, all Oil and Gas

result of such election not to participate in such operation or activity that
would be material to Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole and is not
reflected in the Parent Reserve Reports.

  



  

(i) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, and to the knowledge
of Parent as of the date of this Agreement, Schedule 5.17(i) of the Parent
Disclosure Letter lists, as of December 31, 2019, all transportation, plant,
production and other imbalances and overlifts with respect to
Hydrocarbon production from the Oil and Gas Properties of Parent and its
Subsidiaries.

  



  

(j) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, with respect to Oil
and Gas Properties operated by Parent and its Subsidiaries, all currently
producing Wells and all tangible equipment included therein, used in
connection with the operation thereof or otherwise primarily associated
therewith (including all buildings, plants, structures, platforms, pipelines,
machinery, vehicles and other rolling stock) are in a good state of
repair and are adequate and sufficient to maintain normal operations in
accordance with past practices (ordinary wear and tear excepted).

furnished until the Company receives an executed confidentiality agreement
from such Person containing limitations on the use and disclosure of non-
public information furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Company
that are no less favorable to the Company in the aggregate than the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement, as determined by the Company Board or any
committee thereof in good faith after consultation with its legal counsel; (
_provided_ , _further_ , that such confidentiality agreement does not contain
provisions that prohibit the Company from providing any information to Parent
in accordance with this _Section 6.3_ or that otherwise prohibits the
Company from complying with the provisions of this _Section 6.3_), (B)

prior to taking any such actions, the Company Board or any committee thereof
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company's financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Company Competing Proposal is,
or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company Superior Proposal and
(D) prior to taking any such actions, the Company Board determines in good
faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel that failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by
the Company Board to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law;

  



  

   

63

 



    



  

(iii)  prior to, but not after, the receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval, in response to a _bona fide_ written Company Competing
Proposal from a third party that was not solicited at any time following the
execution of this Agreement and did not arise from a breach of the
obligations set forth in this _Section 6.3_, if the Company Board so chooses,
the Company Board may effect a Company Change of Recommendation if:

  



  

(A)  the Company Board or any committee thereof determines in good
faith after consultation with the Company's financial advisors and outside
legal counsel that such Company Competing Proposal is a Company Superior
Proposal;

  



  

(B)  the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to effect a Company
Change of Recommendation in response to such Company Superior Proposal would
be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by the Company Board to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable Law;

  



  

(C)  the Company provides Parent written notice of such proposed
action and the basis thereof five (5) Business Days in advance, which notice
shall set forth in writing that the Company Board or a committee thereof

and financing documents;

  



  

(D)  after giving such notice and prior to effecting such Company
Change of Recommendation or termination, the Company negotiates (and causes
its officers, employees, financial advisor and outside legal counsel to
negotiate) in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent wishes to
negotiate) to make such adjustments or revisions to the terms of this
Agreement as would permit the Company Board or a committee thereof not to
effect a Company Change of Recommendation in response thereto; and

  



  

(E) at the end of the five (5) Business Day period, prior to
taking action to effect a Company Change of Recommendation, the Company Board
or a committee thereof takes into account any adjustments or revisions to the
terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in writing and any other
information offered by Parent in response to the notice, and determines in
good faith after consultation with the Company's financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, that the Company Competing Proposal remains a Company
Superior Proposal and that the failure to effect a Company Change of
Recommendation in response to such Company Superior Proposal would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by the Company Board to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable Law; _provided_ , that in the
event of any material amendment or material modification to any Company
Superior Proposal (it being understood that any amendment or modification to
the economic terms of any such Company Superior Proposal shall be deemed
material), the Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice to
Parent and to comply with the requirements of this _Section 6.3(e)(iii)_
with respect to such new written notice, except that the advance written
notice obligation set forth in this _Section 6.3(e)(iii)_ shall be reduced to
two (2) Business Days; _provided_ , _further_ , that any such new written
notice shall in no event shorten the original five (5) Business Day notice
period; and

  



  

   

64

 



    



  

(iv)  prior to, but not after, the receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval, in response to a Company Intervening Event that occurs
or arises after the date of this Agreement and that did not arise from or in
connection with a breach of this Agreement by the Company, the Company may,
if the Company Board so chooses, effect a Company Change of Recommendation;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such a Company Change of Recommendation may not
be made unless and until:

  



  

(A)  the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation
with the Company's financial advisors and outside legal counsel that a
Company Intervening Event has occurred;

  



  

(B)  the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to effect such
Company Change of Recommendation in response to such Company Intervening Event
would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by the Company Board to
the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law;

  



  

(C)  the Company provides Parent written notice of such proposed
action and the basis thereof five (5) Business Days in advance, which notice
shall set forth in writing that the Company Board or a committee thereof
intends to consider whether to take such action and includes a reasonably
detailed description of the facts and circumstances of the Company Intervening
Event;

  



  

(D)  after giving such notice and prior to effecting such Company
Change of Recommendation or termination, the Company negotiates (and causes
its officers, employees, financial advisor and outside legal counsel to
negotiate) in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent wishes to
negotiate) to make such adjustments or revisions to the terms of this
Agreement as would permit the Company Board not to effect a Company Change of
Recommendation in response thereto; and

  



  

(E) at the end of the five (5) Business Day period, prior to
taking action to effect a Company Change of Recommendation, the Company Board
takes into account any adjustments or revisions to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by Parent in writing and any other information offered by Parent in
response to the notice, and determines in good faith after consultation with
the Company's financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure
to effect a Company Change of Recommendation in response to such Company
Intervening Event would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by the
Company Board to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law;
_provided_ , that in the event of any material changes regarding any Company
Intervening Event, the Company shall be required to deliver a new written
notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this _Section
6.3(e)(iv) _with respect to such new written notice, except that the advance
written notice obligation set forth in this _Section 6.3(e)(iv) _shall be
reduced to two (2) Business Days; _provided_ , _further_ , that any such new
written notice shall in no event shorten the original five (5) Business Day
notice period.

of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier of the Effective Time and
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article VIII_ , the Company
shall not (and it shall cause its Subsidiaries not to) terminate, amend,
modify or waive any provision of any confidentiality, "standstill" or similar
agreement to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party; _provided_ ,
that, notwithstanding any other provision in this _Section 6.3_, prior to,
but not after, the time the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, if, in
response to an unsolicited request from a third party to waive any
"standstill" or similar provision, the Company Board or a committee thereof
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary
duties owed by the Company Board to the stockholders of the Company under
applicable Law, the Company may waive any such "standstill" or similar
provision solely to the extent necessary to permit a third party to make a
Company Competing Proposal, on a confidential basis, to the Company Board or a
committee thereof and communicate such waiver to the applicable third party;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall advise Parent at least two (2)
Business Days prior to taking such action. The Company represents and
warrants to Parent that it has not taken any action that (i) would be
prohibited by this _Section 6.3(f)_ or (ii) but for the ability to avoid
actions inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by the Company Board to
the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, would have been
prohibited by this _Section 6.3(f)_ during the thirty (30) days prior to the
date of this Agreement.

 _provided_ , that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, Parent or any of its Representatives may, (A) in response to an
unsolicited inquiry or proposal, seek to clarify the terms and conditions of
such inquiry or proposal to determine whether such inquiry or proposal
constitutes a Parent Superior Proposal and (B) in response to an unsolicited
inquiry or proposal from a third party, inform a third party or its
Representative of the restrictions imposed by the provisions of this _Section

(c) From and after the date of this Agreement, Parent shall
promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify the Company of the receipt

Parent shall provide to the Company promptly (and in any event within 24
hours) (i) an unredacted copy of any such expression of interest, inquiry,

(d)  Except as permitted by _Section 6.4(e)_, Parent and its
officers and directors and other Representatives will not, will cause
Parent's Subsidiaries and their respective officers and directors not to, and
will use their reasonable best efforts to cause the other Representatives of
Parent and its Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly:

  



  

(i)  withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify, or publicly propose
or announce any intention to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify, in a
manner adverse to the Company, the Parent Board Recommendation;

  



  

(ii)  fail to include the Parent Board Recommendation in the Joint
Proxy Statement;

  



  

(iii)  publicly declare advisable or publicly propose to enter
into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement (other than a
confidentiality agreement referred to in _Section 6.4(e)(ii)_ entered into in
compliance with  _Section 6.4(e)(ii)_) relating to a Parent Competing
Proposal (a " _Parent Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ");

  



  

(iv)  in the case of a Parent Competing Proposal that is structured
as a tender offer or exchange offer pursuant to Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange
Act for outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock (other than by the Company
or an Affiliate of the Company), fail to recommend, in a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9, against acceptance of
such tender offer or exchange offer by its stockholders on or prior to the

Parent Stockholders Meeting (or promptly after commencement of such tender
offer or exchange offer if commenced on or after the third Business Day prior
to the date of the Parent Stockholders Meeting) or (B) ten (10) Business Days
(as such term is used in Rule 14d-9 of the Exchange Act) after commencement

to the earlier of (A) five (5) Business Days after the Company so requests in
writing or (B) three (3) Business Days prior to the date of the Parent
Stockholders Meeting (or promptly after announcement or disclosure of such
Parent Competing Proposal if announced or disclosed on or after the third
Business Day prior to the date of the Parent Stockholders Meeting); or

  



  

   

68

 



    



  

(vi)  cause or permit Parent to enter into a Parent Alternative
Acquisition Agreement (together with any of the actions set forth in the
foregoing _clauses (i)_, _(ii)_ , _(iii)_ , _(iv)_ , _(v)_ and _(vi)_ , a "
_Parent Change of Recommendation_ ").

  



  

(e)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary:

  



  

(i)  the Parent Board or any committee thereof may after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, make such disclosures as the
Parent Board or any committee thereof determines in good faith are necessary
to comply with Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act
or other disclosure required to be made in the Joint Proxy Statement by
applicable U.S. federal securities Laws; _provided_ , _however_ , that if
such disclosure has the effect of withdrawing or adversely modifying the
Parent Board Recommendation, such disclosure shall be deemed to be a Parent
Change of Recommendation and the Company shall have the right to terminate
this Agreement as set forth in _Section 8.1(d)_;

  



  

(ii)  prior to, but not after, the receipt of the Parent
Stockholder Approval, Parent and its Representatives may engage in
the activities prohibited by _Sections 6.4(b)(ii)_ or _6.4(b)(iii)_ with any
Person if (1) Parent receives a _bona fide_ written Parent Competing Proposal
from such Person that was not solicited at any time following the execution of
this Agreement and (2) such Parent Competing Proposal did not arise from a
breach of the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.4_;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (A) no information that is prohibited from being furnished
pursuant to _Section 6.4(b)_ may be furnished until Parent receives an
executed confidentiality agreement from such Person containing limitations on
the use and disclosure of non-public information furnished to such Person by
or on behalf of Parent that are no less favorable to Parent in the aggregate
than the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, as determined by the Parent
Board or any committee thereof in good faith after consultation with its
legal counsel; ( _provided_ , _further_ , that such confidentiality agreement
does not contain provisions that prohibit Parent from providing any
information to the Company in accordance with this _Section 6.4_ or that
otherwise prohibits Parent from complying with the provisions of this _Section
6.4_), (B) that any such non-public information has previously been made
available to, or is made available to, the Company prior to or
concurrently with (or in the case of oral non-public information only,
promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) after) the time such information
is made available to such Person, (C) prior to taking any such actions, the
Parent Board or any committee thereof determines in good faith, after
consultation with Parent's financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that
such Parent Competing Proposal is, or would reasonably be expected to lead
to, a Parent Superior Proposal and (D) prior to taking any such actions, the
Parent Board determines in good faith after consultation with its outside
legal counsel that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
fiduciary duties owed by the Parent Board to the stockholders of Parent under
applicable Law;

  



  

(iii) prior to, but not after, the receipt of the Parent
Stockholder Approval, in response to a _bona fide_ written Parent
Competing Proposal from a third party that was not solicited at any time
following the execution of this Agreement and did not arise from a breach of
the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.4_, if the Parent Board so
chooses, the Parent Board may effect a Parent Change of Recommendation if:

  



  

   

69

 



    



  

(A)  the Parent Board or any committee thereof determines in good
faith after consultation with Parent's financial advisors and outside legal
counsel that such Parent Competing Proposal is a Parent Superior Proposal;

  



  

(B)  the Parent Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to effect a Parent
Change of Recommendation in response to such Parent Superior Proposal would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by the Parent Board to the
stockholders of Parent under applicable Law;

  



  

(C)  Parent provides the Company written notice of such proposed
action and the basis thereof five (5) Business Days in advance, which notice
shall set forth in writing that the Parent Board or a committee thereof
intends to consider whether to take such action and include a copy of the
available proposed Parent Competing Proposal and any applicable transaction
and financing documents;

  



  

(D)  after giving such notice and prior to effecting such Parent
Change of Recommendation or termination, Parent negotiates (and causes its
officers, employees, financial advisor and outside legal counsel to negotiate)
in good faith with the Company (to the extent the Company wishes to
negotiate) to make such adjustments or revisions to the terms of this
Agreement as would permit the Parent Board or a committee thereof not to
effect a Parent Change of Recommendation in response thereto; and

  



  

(E)  at the end of the five (5) Business Day period, prior to
taking action to effect a Parent Change of Recommendation, the Parent Board
or a committee thereof takes into account any adjustments or revisions to the
terms of this Agreement proposed by the Company in writing and any other
information offered by the Company in response to the notice, and determines
in good faith after consultation with Parent's financial advisors and outside
legal counsel, that the Parent Competing Proposal remains a Parent Superior
Proposal and that the failure to effect a Parent Change of Recommendation in
response to such Parent Superior Proposal would be inconsistent with the
fiduciary duties owed by the Parent Board to the stockholders of Parent under
applicable Law; _provided_ , that in the event of any material amendment or
material modification to any Parent Superior Proposal (it being understood
that any amendment or modification to the economic terms of any such Parent
Superior Proposal shall be deemed material), Parent shall be required to
deliver a new written notice to the Company and to comply with the
requirements of this  _Section 6.4(e)(iii)_ with respect to such new written
notice, except that the advance written notice obligation set forth in this
_Section 6.4(e)(iii)_ shall be reduced to two (2) Business Days; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that any such new written notice shall in no event shorten the
original five (5) Business Day notice period; and

  



  

(iv) prior to, but not after, the receipt of the Parent
Stockholder Approval, in response to a Parent Intervening Event that occurs
or arises after the date of this Agreement and that did not arise from or in
connection with a breach of this Agreement by Parent, Parent may, if the
Parent Board so chooses, effect a Parent Change of Recommendation; provided,
however, that such a Parent Change of Recommendation may not be made unless
and until:

  



  

   

70

 



    



  

(A)  the Parent Board or any committee thereof determines in good
faith after consultation with Parent's financial advisors and outside legal
counsel that a Parent Intervening Event has occurred;

  



  

(B)  the Parent Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to effect a Parent
Change of Recommendation in response to such Parent Intervening Event would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by the Parent Board to the
stockholders of Parent under applicable Law;

  



  

(C)  Parent provides the Company written notice of such proposed
action and the basis thereof five (5) Business Days in advance, which notice
shall set forth in writing that the Parent Board or a committee thereof
intends to consider whether to take such action and includes a reasonably
detailed description of the facts and circumstances of the Parent Intervening
Event;

  



  

(D)  after giving such notice and prior to effecting such Parent
Change of Recommendation or termination, Parent negotiates (and causes its
officers, employees, financial advisor and outside legal counsel to negotiate)
in good faith with the Company (to the extent the Company wishes to
negotiate) to make such adjustments or revisions to the terms of this
Agreement as would permit the Parent Board or a committee thereof not to
effect a Parent Change of Recommendation in response thereto; and

  



  

(E)  at the end of the five (5) Business Day period, prior to
taking action to effect a Parent Change of Recommendation, the Parent Board
or a committee thereof takes into account any adjustments or revisions to the
terms of this Agreement proposed by the Company in writing and any other
information offered by the Company in response to the notice, and determines
in good faith after consultation with Parent's financial advisors and outside
legal counsel, that the failure to effect a Parent Change of Recommendation
in response to such Parent Intervening Event would be inconsistent with the
fiduciary duties owed by the Parent Board to the stockholders of Parent under
applicable Law; _provided_ , that in the event of any material changes
regarding any Parent Intervening Event, Parent shall be required to deliver a
new written notice to the Company and to comply with the requirements of this
_Section 6.4(e)(iv)_ with respect to such new written notice, except that the
advance written notice obligation set forth in this _Section 6.4(e)(iv)_
shall be reduced to two (2) Business Days; _provided_ , _further_ , that any
such new written notice shall in no event shorten the original five (5)
Business Day notice period.

  



  

(f) During the period commencing with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier of the
Effective Time and termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article
VIII_ , Parent shall not (and it shall cause its Subsidiaries not to)
terminate, amend, modify or waive any provision of any confidentiality,
"standstill" or similar agreement to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party; _provided_ , that, notwithstanding any other provision in this
_Section 6.4_, prior to, but not after, the time the Parent Stockholder
Approval is obtained, if, in response to an unsolicited request from a third
party to waive any "standstill" or similar provision, the Parent Board or a
committee thereof determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by the Parent Board to the
stockholders of Parent under applicable Law, Parent may waive any such
"standstill" or similar provision solely to the extent necessary to permit a
third party to make a Parent Competing Proposal, on a confidential basis, to
the Parent Board or a committee thereof and communicate such waiver to the
applicable third party; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall advise the
Company at least two (2) Business Days prior to taking such action. Parent
represents and warrants to the Company that it has not taken any action that
(i) would be prohibited by this _Section 6.4(f)_ or (ii) but for the ability
to avoid actions inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by the Parent
Board to the stockholders of Parent under applicable Law, would have been
prohibited by this _Section 6.4(f) _during the thirty (30) days prior to the
date of this Agreement.

  



  

   

71

 



    



  

(g)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section
6.4_, any action, or failure to take action, that is taken by or at the
direction of a director or officer of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in
violation of this _Section 6.4_ shall be deemed to be a breach of this
_Section 6.4_ by Parent.

  



  

Section 6.5   _Preparation of Joint Proxy Statement, Exchange
Prospectus, Registration Statements and Prepackaged Plan_.

  



  

(a)  Parent will promptly furnish to the Company such data and
information relating to it, its Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub) and the
holders of its capital stock, as the Company may reasonably request for the
purpose of including such data and information in the Joint Proxy Statement,
the Exchange Prospectus, the Prepackaged Plan and any amendments or
supplements thereto. The Company will promptly furnish to Parent such data
and information relating to it, its Subsidiaries and the holders of its
capital stock, as Parent may reasonably request for the purpose of including
such data and information in the Registration Statements, the Joint Proxy
Statement, the Exchange Prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto.

  



  

(b) Promptly following the date hereof, the Company and Parent shall
cooperate in preparing and shall use their respective reasonable best efforts
to cause to be filed with the SEC as promptly as practicable following the
execution of this Agreement, (i) a mutually acceptable (A) Joint Proxy
Statement relating to matters submitted to the holders of Company Common Stock
at the Company Stockholders Meeting and matters submitted to holders of
Parent Capital Stock at the Parent Stockholders Meeting and (B) Exchange
Prospectus (of which the Prepackaged Plan will be a part) and (ii) (A) the
Merger Registration Statement (of which the Joint Proxy Statement will be a
part) and (B) the Exchange Registration Statement (of which the Exchange
Prospectus will be a part). The Company and Parent shall each use reasonable
best efforts to cause the Registration Statements, the Joint Proxy Statement
and the Exchange Prospectus to comply with the rules and regulations
promulgated by the SEC and to respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or
its staff. Parent and the Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts
to cause the Merger Registration Statement to become effective under the
Securities Act as soon after such filing as reasonably practicable and on the
same day as the Exchange Registration Statement. Parent and the Company shall
use reasonable best efforts to keep the Registration Statements effective as
long as is necessary to consummate the Exchange Offer and the Merger. Each of
the Company and Parent will advise the other promptly after it receives any
request by the SEC for amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement or Exchange
Prospectus or the Registration Statements or comments thereon and responses
thereto or any request by the SEC for additional information and Parent and
the Company shall jointly prepare any response to such comments or requests,
and each of Parent and the Company agrees to permit the other (in each case,
to the extent practicable), and their respective counsels, to participate in
all meetings and conferences with the SEC. Each of the Company and Parent
shall use reasonable best efforts to cause all documents that it is
responsible for filing with the SEC in connection with the Transactions to
comply as to form and substance in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing the
Registration Statements (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or filing or
mailing the Joint Proxy Statement or Exchange Prospectus (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect
thereto, each of the Company and Parent will (A) provide the other with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document or response
(including the proposed final version of such document or response), (B)
include in such document or response all comments reasonably and promptly
proposed by the other and (C) not file or mail such document or respond to
the SEC prior to receiving the approval of the other, which approval shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  



  

   

72

 



    



  

(c)  Parent and the Company shall make all necessary filings with
respect to the Merger and the Transactions under the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act and applicable blue sky laws and the rules and regulations
thereunder. Each Party will advise the other, promptly after it receives
notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statements have become
effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any
stop order, the suspension of the qualification of (i) the Parent
Common Stock issuable in the Exchange Offer or (ii) the Parent Common Stock
issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction. Each of the Company and Parent will use reasonable best efforts
to have any such stop order or suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise
terminated.

  



  

(d)  If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information
relating to Parent or the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates,
officers or directors, should be discovered by Parent or the Company that
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Registration
Statements, the Exchange Prospectus or the Joint Proxy Statement, so that such
documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Party and an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law,
disseminated to the stockholders of the Company and the stockholders of
Parent.

  



  

Section 6.6   _Stockholders Meeting_.

  



  

(a) The Company shall take all action necessary in accordance with
applicable Laws and the Organizational Documents of the Company to duly give
notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, to be held as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the clearance of the Joint Proxy Statement by
the SEC and the Merger Registration Statement is declared effective by the
SEC. Except as permitted by _Section 6.3_, the Company Board shall recommend
that the stockholders of the Company approve and adopt this Agreement at the
Company Stockholders Meeting and the Company Board shall solicit from
stockholders of the Company proxies in favor of the adoption of this

for which the Company Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, there are
insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or
by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct business at such Company
Stockholders Meeting and (ii) may adjourn or postpone the Company
Stockholders Meeting if, as of the time for which the Company
Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, there are insufficient shares of Company
Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to obtain the Company
Stockholder Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that unless otherwise agreed to
by the Parties, the Company Stockholders Meeting shall not be adjourned or
postponed to a date that is more than fifteen (15) Business Days after the
date for which the meeting was previously scheduled (it being understood that
such Company Stockholders Meeting shall be adjourned or postponed every time
the circumstances described in the foregoing _clauses (i)(A) _and _(i)(B)_
exist, and such Company Stockholders Meeting may be adjourned or postponed
every time the circumstances described in the foregoing clause (ii) exist);
and provided further that the Company Stockholders Meeting shall not be
adjourned or postponed to a date on or after three (3) Business Days prior to
the Outside Date. The Company shall promptly provide Parent with all
voting tabulation reports relating to the Company Stockholders Meeting that
have been prepared by the Company or the Company's transfer agent, proxy
solicitor or other Representative, and shall otherwise keep Parent reasonably
informed regarding the status of the solicitation and any material oral or
written communications from or to the Company's stockholders with respect
thereto. Unless there has been a Company Change of Recommendation in
accordance with _Section 6.3_, the Parties agree to cooperate and use their
reasonable best efforts to defend against any efforts by any of the
Company's stockholders or any other Person to prevent the Company Stockholder
Approval from being obtained. Once the Company has established a record date
for the Company Stockholders Meeting, the Company shall not change such record
date or establish a different record date for the Company Stockholders
Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless required to do so by
applicable Law or its Organizational Documents or in connection with a
postponement or adjournment permitted hereunder. Without the prior written
consent of Parent or as required by applicable Law, the Company shall not
call any meeting of the stockholders of the Company other than the Company
Stockholders Meeting.

  



  

   

73

 



    



  

(b) Parent shall take all action necessary in accordance with
applicable Laws and the Organizational Documents of Parent to duly
give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders for the

that the stockholders of Parent approve the Parent Stock Issuance and the
Parent Board shall solicit from stockholders of Parent proxies in favor of
the Parent Stock Issuance, and the Joint Proxy Statement shall include the
Parent Board Recommendation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, Parent (i) shall be required to adjourn or
postpone the Parent Stockholders Meeting (A) to the extent necessary to ensure
that any legally required supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy
Statement is provided to the Parent's stockholders or (B) if, as of the time
for which the Parent Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, there are insufficient
shares of Parent Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct business at such Parent Stockholders
Meeting and (ii) may adjourn or postpone the Parent Stockholders Meeting if,
as of the time for which the Parent Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, there
are insufficient shares of Parent Common Stock represented (either in person
or by proxy) to obtain the Parent Stockholder Approval; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties, the Parent
Stockholders Meeting shall not be adjourned or postponed to a date that is
more than fifteen (15) Business Days after the date for which the meeting was
previously scheduled (it being understood that such Parent Stockholders
Meeting shall be adjourned or postponed every time the circumstances
described in the foregoing _clauses (i)(A) _and _(i)(B)_  exist, and such
Parent Stockholders Meeting may be adjourned or postponed every time the
circumstances described in the foregoing _clause (ii)_ exist); and _provided
further_ that the Parent Stockholders Meeting shall not be adjourned or
postponed to a date on or after three (3) Business Days prior to the Outside
Date. If requested by the Company, Parent shall promptly provide the Company
with all voting tabulation reports relating to the Parent Stockholders Meeting
that have been prepared by Parent or Parent's transfer agent, proxy solicitor
or other Representative, and shall otherwise keep the Company reasonably
informed regarding the status of the solicitation and any material oral or
written communications from or to Parent's stockholders with respect thereto.
Unless there has been a Parent Change of Recommendation in accordance with
_Section 6.4_, the Parties agree to cooperate and use their reasonable best
efforts to defend against any efforts by any of the Parent's stockholders or
any other Person to prevent the Parent Stockholder Approval from being
obtained. Once Parent has established a record date for the Parent
Stockholders Meeting, Parent shall not change such record date or establish a
different record date for the Parent Stockholders Meeting without the prior
written consent of the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless required to do so by applicable Law
or its Organizational Documents or in connection with a postponement or
adjournment permitted hereunder.

  



  

(c)  The Parties shall cooperate and use their reasonable best
efforts to set the record dates for and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting
and the Parent Stockholders Meeting, as applicable, on the same day and within
two (2) Business Days after the Exchange Offer Expiration Date and at
approximately the same time.

  



  

(d) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, unless this
Agreement shall have been terminated pursuant to _Article VIII_ , each of the
Company and Parent agrees that its obligations to call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting and the Parent Stockholders
Meeting, as applicable, pursuant to this _Section 6.6_ shall not be affected
by the making of a Company Change of Recommendation or a Parent Change of
Recommendation, as applicable, and its obligations pursuant to this _Section
6.6_ shall not be affected by the commencement, announcement, disclosure,
or communication to the Company or Parent, as applicable, of any Company
Competing Proposal or Parent Competing Proposal or other proposal (including,
with respect to the Company, a Company Superior Proposal) or the occurrence or
disclosure of any Company Intervening Event or Parent Intervening Event.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, the Company shall not be required to convene the Company
Stockholders Meeting after (x) the Company Chapter 11 Cases have commenced or
(y) the Company stipulates to bankruptcy relief after the occurrence of an
Involuntary Insolvency Event pursuant to _Section 6.24(a)(v)_.

  



  

   

74

Section 6.7   _Access to Information_.

  



  

(a)  Subject to applicable Law and the other provisions of this
_Section 6.7_, the Company and Parent each shall (and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to), upon request by the other, furnish the other with all
information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the Exchange Prospectus, the Joint Proxy
Statement, any Registration Statement, or any other statement, filing, notice
or application made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to any third party or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Transactions. The Company shall, and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and its Representatives, during the
period prior to the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to the terms of _Section 8.1_, reasonable access, at
reasonable times upon reasonable prior notice, to the officers, employees,
agents, properties, offices and other facilities of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and to their books, records, Contracts and documents and shall,
and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish reasonably promptly to
Parent and its Representatives such information concerning its and its
Subsidiaries' business, properties, Contracts, records and personnel as may be
reasonably requested, from time to time, by or on behalf of Parent. Parent
and its Representatives shall conduct any such activities in such a manner as
not to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company
or its Subsidiaries or otherwise cause any unreasonable interference with the
prompt and timely discharge by the employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries of their normal duties. Notwithstanding the foregoing:

  



  

(i)  No Party shall be required to, or to cause any of its
Subsidiaries to, grant access or furnish information, as applicable, to the
other Party or any of its Representatives to the extent that such information
is subject to an attorney/client privilege or the attorney work product
doctrine or that such access or the furnishing of such information, as
applicable, is prohibited by applicable Law or an existing Contract or
agreement ( _provided_ , _however_ , the Company or Parent, as applicable,
shall inform the other Party as to the general nature of what is being
withheld and the Company and Parent shall reasonably cooperate to make
appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable disclosure that does
not suffer from any of the foregoing impediments, including through the use
of commercially reasonable efforts to (A) obtain the required Consent or
waiver of any third party required to provide such information and (B)
implement appropriate and mutually agreeable measures to permit the
disclosure of such information in a manner to remove the basis for the
objection, including by arrangement of appropriate clean room
procedures, redaction or entry into a customary joint defense agreement with
respect to any information to be so provided, if the Parties determine that
doing so would reasonably permit the disclosure of such information without
violating applicable Law or jeopardizing such privilege);

  



     

   

75

 



    



    

(ii)   No Party shall have access to personnel records of the other
Party or any of its Subsidiaries relating to individual performance or
evaluation records, medical histories or other personnel information that in
the other Party's good faith opinion the disclosure of which could subject
the other Party or any of its Subsidiaries to risk of liability;

  



  

(iii)  Each Party shall not be permitted to conduct any invasive or
intrusive sampling or analysis (commonly known as a "Phase II") of any
environmental media or building materials at any facility of the other Party
or its Subsidiaries without the prior written consent of the other Party
(which may be granted or withheld in such other Party's sole discretion); and

  



  

(iv)  No investigation or information provided pursuant to this
_Section 6.7_ shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty made by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub herein and no Party shall,
and each Party shall cause their respective Representatives to not, use any
information obtained pursuant to this _Section 6.7_ for any purpose
unrelated to the evaluation, negotiation or consummation of the Transactions.

  



  

(b)  The Confidentiality Agreement dated as of June 15, 2020 between
Parent and the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") shall survive
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and shall apply to all
information furnished thereunder or hereunder. All information provided to
any Party or its Representative pursuant to or in connection with this
Agreement is deemed to be "Evaluation Material" as defined under the
Confidentiality Agreement. From and after the date of this Agreement until
the earlier of the Effective Time and termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Article VIII_ , each Party shall continue to provide access
to the other Party and its Representatives to the electronic data room
relating to the Transactions maintained by or on behalf of it to which the
other Party and its Representatives were provided access prior to the date of
this Agreement.

  



  

Section 6.8   _HSR and Other Approvals_.

  



  

(a) Parent and the Company shall use their reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done,
all things necessary, proper or advisable, including under any applicable
Laws, to consummate and make effective the Transactions, including (i) the
prompt preparation and filing of all forms, notifications, declarations,
registrations, notices and other submissions required to be filed with any
Governmental Entity prior to the consummation of the Transactions, (ii) the
satisfaction of the conditions to consummating the Transactions, (iii) taking
all reasonable actions necessary to obtain (and cooperating with each other
in obtaining) any Consent, clearance, authorization, order or approval of, or
any exemption by, any third party, including any Governmental Entity (which
actions shall include furnishing all information and documentary material
required or requested under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws) required
to be obtained or made by Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in connection with or that are necessary to consummate the
Transactions, (iv) taking reasonable actions to defend any Proceedings
challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions, including
seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any
Governmental Entity vacated or reversed and (v) the execution and delivery of
any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions and to
fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event shall
the Company, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates be required to pay
any consideration to any third parties or give anything of value to obtain any
such Person's authorization, approval, Consent or waiver to effectuate the
Transactions. In the event that any litigation, administrative or judicial
action or other proceeding is commenced challenging the Transactions, the
Parties shall cooperate with each other and use their respective reasonable
best efforts to contest and resist any such litigation, action or Proceeding
and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment,
injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that
is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the
Transactions. Additionally, Parent and the Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to fulfill all conditions precedent to the Transactions and shall not
take any action after the date of this Agreement that would reasonably be
expected to materially delay the obtaining of, or result in not obtaining,
any Consent, clearance, authorization, order or approval from any Governmental
Entity necessary to be obtained prior to Closing. To the extent that
transfers of any permits issued by any Governmental Entity are required as
a result of the execution of this Agreement or the consummation of the
Transactions, the Parties shall use reasonable best efforts to effect such
transfers.

  



  

   

76

 



    



  

(b) Parent and the Company shall each keep the other apprised of
the status of matters relating to the completion of the Transactions and work
cooperatively in connection with obtaining all required Consents, clearances,
authorizations, orders or approvals of, or any exemptions by, any
Governmental Entity undertaken pursuant to the provisions of this _Section
6.8_. In that regard, each Party shall promptly consult with the other Party
to this Agreement with respect to, provide any necessary information with
respect to (and, in the case of correspondence, provide the other Party (or
its counsel) copies of), all filings, notices or other submissions made by
such Party with any Governmental Entity or any other information supplied
by such Party to, or correspondence with, a Governmental Entity in connection
with this Agreement and the Transactions. Each Party shall promptly inform
the other Party, and if in writing, furnish the other Party with copies of
(or, in the case of oral communications, advise the other Party orally of)
any material communication from any Governmental Entity regarding
the Transactions, and permit the other Party to review and discuss in
advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other Party in
connection with, any proposed written or oral communication with any such
Governmental Entity. If either Party or any Representative of such Party
receives a request for additional information or documentary material from any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Transactions, then such Party will
use reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be made, promptly and after
consultation with the other Party, an appropriate response in substantial
compliance with such request. Neither Parent nor the Company shall
participate in any meeting or teleconference with any Governmental Entity
where material issues would likely be discussed in connection with this
Agreement and the Transactions unless it consults with the other Party in
advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the
other Party the opportunity to attend and participate thereat. Each Party
shall furnish the other Party with copies of all correspondence, filings
and communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof)
between it and any such Governmental Entity with respect to this Agreement
and the Transactions, and furnish the other Party with such necessary
information and reasonable assistance as the other Party may reasonably
request in connection with its preparation of necessary filings, notices or
other submissions of information or documents to any such Governmental
Entity; _provided_ , _however_ , that materials provided pursuant to this
_Section 6.8_ may be redacted (i) to remove references concerning the
valuation of the Company, Parent, the Transaction or other confidential or
competitively sensitive information, (ii) as necessary to comply with
contractual requirements and (iii) as necessary to address reasonable
privilege waiver risks.

  



  

(c)  The Company and Parent shall file, as promptly as practicable,
but in any event no later than ten (10) Business Days after the date of this
Agreement, the notification and report forms required under the HSR Act. In
the event that the Parties receive a request for information or documentary
material pursuant to the HSR Act (a " _Second Request_ "), the Parties will
use their respective reasonable best efforts to respond to such Second Request
as promptly as practicable, and counsel for both Parties will closely
cooperate during the entirety of any such Second Request review process;
provided, however, the final determination as to the appropriate course of
action shall be made by Parent.

  



  

   

77

 



    



  

Section 6.9   _Employee Matters_.

  



  

(a)  Between the date hereof and the Effective Time, the Company
shall (and the Company shall cause its Subsidiaries to) make available to
Parent the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries so that Parent may
interview such employees and evaluate their roles and responsibilities with
the Company and its Subsidiaries, including with respect to potential
promotions, transfers, or job eliminations following the Closing.

  



  

(b)  The Parties agree that for a period of 12 months following the
Closing Date, each employee who is employed as of the Closing Date by the
Company or a Subsidiary thereof (each, a " _Company Employee_ ") shall be
provided with annual base salary or base wage rate, and employee benefits
that are, in the aggregate, substantially comparable to those in effect for
similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries. In addition, a
Company Employee whose employment is involuntarily terminated other than for
cause within the period of 12 months following the Closing Date (or such
longer change in control coverage period as required under the applicable
Company Benefit Plan) shall be provided with severance benefits (subject to
satisfying any applicable release requirements) that are no less favorable
than those in effect for such Company Employee immediately prior to the
Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the covenants within this _Section
6.9(b)_ shall not apply to the Company Employees listed on Schedule 6.9(b) of
the Company Disclosure Letter, which shall consist of the individuals
that are a party to those certain Retention and Sale Payment retention
agreements executed with the Company prior to the Closing Date (the "
_Excluded Employees_ ") which Excluded Employees will, on and after the
Closing Date, only be entitled to receive the severance benefits set forth in
and subject to the terms and conditions of the Retention and Sale Payment
retention agreements provided to Parent.

  



  

(c)  Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries, to assume and honor their respective obligations under all
employment, severance, change in control, retention and other agreements, if
any, between the Company (or a Subsidiary thereof) and a Company Employee,
including, but not limited to, those Company Benefit Plans set forth on
Schedule 6.9(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter, it being understood that
the foregoing shall not be construed to limit any amendments
otherwise permitted by the terms of the applicable agreements.

  



  

(d) From and after the Effective Time, as applicable, the Parties
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, to take
commercially reasonable efforts to credit the Company Employees for purposes
of vesting, eligibility, severance and benefit accrual under the Parent
Benefit Plans and the Company Benefit Plans, as applicable, (other than
(i) for any purposes with respect to any "defined benefit plan" as defined in
Section 3(35) of ERISA, retiree medical benefits or disability benefits or to
the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits or compensation for
the same period of service, or (ii) with respect to the Excluded Employees,
any severance benefits or rights) in which the Company Employees participate,
for such Company Employees' service with the Company and its Subsidiaries,
as applicable, to the same extent and for the same purposes that such service
was taken into account under a corresponding Company Benefit Plan in effect
immediately prior to the Closing Date, to the extent that such credit does not
result in duplicate benefits.

  



  

   

78

 



    



  

(e)  The Parties shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries, to take commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive any
limitation on health coverage of any Company Employees or any of their
covered, eligible dependents due to pre-existing conditions and/or waiting
periods, active employment requirements and requirements to show evidence
of good health under the applicable Parent Benefit Plan to the extent such
Company Employee or covered, eligible dependents are covered under an
analogous Company Benefit Plan, as applicable, immediately prior to the
Closing Date, and such conditions, periods or requirements are satisfied or
waived under such Parent Benefit Plan and (ii) give each Company Employee
credit for the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs towards applicable
deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for medical expenses incurred
prior to the Closing Date for which payment has been made, in each case, to
the extent permitted by the applicable insurance plan provider and only to
the extent such deductibles or limits for medical expenses were satisfied or
did not apply under the analogous Company Benefit Plan in effect immediately
prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

(f) Prior to the Closing Date, (i) if requested by Parent in
writing at least three (3) days before the Closing, the Company shall cause
the Company and its Subsidiaries to take all necessary and appropriate actions
to cause (A) each Company Benefit Plan intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code (the " _Company 401(k) Plan_ ") to be terminated and (B)
all participants to cease participating under the Company 401(k) Plan, in
each case, effective no later than the Business Day preceding the Closing
Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that such actions may be contingent upon
Closing and (ii) no sooner than the date thirty (30) days prior to the Closing
Date (or such earlier date approved by the Bankruptcy Court, if applicable),
the Company shall take and shall cause its Subsidiaries to take all necessary
and appropriate actions to terminate the Executive Nonqualified Excess Plan
(the  " _Excess Plan_ ") and distribute to each participant in the Excess
Plan, such participant's account balance under the Excess Plan in accordance
with Section 409A of the Code (including Treasury Regulation
Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(A) or (B), as applicable). The Company shall
provide Parent with an advance copy of all documentation necessary to effect
this _Section 6.9(f)_ and a reasonable opportunity to comment thereon prior
to the adoption or execution thereof. In the event the Company 401(k) Plan is
terminated as set forth in the preceding sentence, as soon
as administratively practicable following the Effective Time, Parent shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to take any and all action as may be
reasonably required, including amendments to a defined contribution retirement
plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code designated by
Parent (the " _Parent 401(k) Plan_ ") to (A) cause the Parent 401(k) Plan to
accept any "eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of Section
402(c)(4) of the Code) in the form of cash in an amount equal to the full
account balance distributed or distributable to such Company Employee from the
Company 401(k) Plan to the Parent 401(k) Plan, including any outstanding
loans and (B) cause each Company Employee to become a participant in the
Parent 401(k) Plan as of the Closing Date (subject to any applicable
eligibility requirements, but giving effect to the service
crediting provisions of _Section 6.9(d))_.

  



  

   

79

 



    



  

(g)  Nothing in this Agreement shall constitute an establishment or
termination of, or an amendment to, or be construed as establishing,
terminating or amending, any Employee Benefit Plan sponsored, maintained or
contributed to by the Company, Parent or any of their respective
Subsidiaries. The provisions of this _Section 6.9_ are for the sole benefit
of the Parties and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or will
be construed to confer upon or give to any Person (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, any Company Employee or other current or former employee
of the Company, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates), other than the
Parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any third party
beneficiary, legal or equitable or other rights or remedies (including with
respect to the matters provided for in this _Section 6.9_) under or by
reason of any provision of this _Section 6.9_. Nothing in this _Section 6.9_
is intended to (i) prevent Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Affiliates from terminating the employment or service of any Person,
including a Company Employee, at any time and for any reason, (ii) provide
any Person any right to employment or service or continued employment or
service with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including following the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) or any particular term or
condition of employment or service, or (iii) prevent Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Affiliates from terminating, revising or amending
any Employee Benefit Plan sponsored, maintained or contributed to by
the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries.

  



  

Section 6.10   _Indemnification; Directors ' and Officers' Insurance_.

  



  

(a) Without limiting any other rights that any Indemnified Person
may have pursuant to any employment agreement or indemnification agreement in
effect on the date hereof or otherwise, from the Effective Time, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally, indemnify, defend and
hold harmless, in the same manner as provided by the Company immediately
prior to the date of this Agreement, each Person who is now, or has been at
any time prior to the date of this Agreement or who becomes prior to the
Effective Time, a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or who acts as a fiduciary under any Company Benefit Plan, in
each case, when acting in such capacity (the " _Indemnified Persons_ ")
against all losses, claims, damages, costs, fines, penalties, expenses
(including attorneys' and other professionals' fees and expenses),
liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement, of
or incurred in connection with any threatened or actual Proceeding to which
such Indemnified Person is a party or is otherwise involved (including as a
witness) based, in whole or in part, on or arising, in whole or in part, out
of the fact that such Person is or was a director or officer of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, a fiduciary under any Company Benefit Plan or is
or was serving at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a
director, officer, employee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership,
limited liability company, joint venture, Employee Benefit Plan, trust or
other enterprise, as applicable, or by reason of anything done or not done by
such Person in any such capacity, whether pertaining to any act or omission
occurring or existing prior to, but not after, the Effective Time and whether
asserted or claimed prior to, but not after, the Effective Time ("
_Indemnified Liabilities_ "), including all Indemnified Liabilities based in
whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to,
this Agreement or the Transactions, in each case to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law (and Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall, jointly and severally, pay expenses incurred in connection therewith,
including but not limited to expenses for the retention of the Company's
regularly engaged legal counsel or other counsel satisfactory to them, in
advance of the final disposition of any such Proceeding to each Indemnified
Person to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law). Without
limiting the foregoing, in the event any such Proceeding is brought or
threatened to be brought against any Indemnified Persons (whether arising
before or after the Effective Time), (i) the Indemnified Persons may retain
the Company's regularly engaged legal counsel or other counsel
satisfactory to them, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall pay all
reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Persons as
promptly as statements therefor are received, and (ii) Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall use its best efforts to assist in the defense of
any such matter. Any Indemnified Person wishing to claim indemnification
or advancement of expenses under this _Section 6.10_, upon learning of any
such Proceeding, shall notify the Surviving Corporation (but the failure so
to notify shall not relieve a Party from any obligations that it may have
under this _Section 6.10_ except to the extent such failure materially
prejudices such Party's position with respect to such claims). With respect
to any determination of whether any Indemnified Person is entitled to
indemnification by Parent or Surviving Corporation under this _Section
6.10_, such Indemnified Person shall have the right, as contemplated by the
DGCL, to require that such determination be made by special, independent
legal counsel selected by the Indemnified Person and approved by Parent or
Surviving Corporation, as applicable (which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), and who has not otherwise performed material services
for Parent, Surviving Corporation or the Indemnified Person within the last
three (3) years.

  



  

   

80

 



    



  

(b)  Parent and the Surviving Corporation agree that, until the six
(6) year anniversary date of the Effective Time, that neither Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation shall amend, repeal or otherwise modify any provision in
the Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries
in any manner that would affect (or manage the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries, with the intent to or in a manner that would) adversely the
rights thereunder or under the Organizational Documents of the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries of any Indemnified Person to
indemnification, exculpation and advancement except to the extent required by
applicable Law. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries to, fulfill and honor any indemnification, expense
advancement or exculpation agreements between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and any of its directors or officers existing and in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(c)  Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify any
Indemnified Person against all reasonable costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses), such amounts to be payable in
advance upon request as provided in _Section 6.10(a)_, relating to the
enforcement of such Indemnified Person's rights under this _Section 6.10_ or
under any charter, bylaw or Contract regardless of whether such Indemnified
Person is ultimately determined to be entitled to indemnification
hereunder or thereunder.

  



  

(d) Parent and the Surviving Corporation will cause to be put in
place, and Parent shall fully prepay immediately prior to the Effective Time,
"tail" insurance policies with a claims reporting or discovery period of at
least six (6) years from the Effective Time (the " _Tail Period_ ") from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company's
current insurance carrier with respect to directors' and officers' liability
insurance (" _D andO Insurance_") in an amount and scope at least as favorable
as the Company's existing policies with respect to matters, acts or
omissions existing or occurring at, prior to, or after, the Effective Time;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the aggregate cost of the DandO
Insurance exceed during the Tail Period 300% of the current aggregate annual
premium paid by the Company for such purpose; and _provided_ , _further_ ,
that if the cost of such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, the
Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

  



  

   

81

 



    



  

(e)  In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their Subsidiaries or any of their respective successors or assignees (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case
may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.10_. The
provisions of this _Section 6.10_ are intended to be for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, the Parties and each Person entitled to
indemnification or insurance coverage or expense advancement pursuant to this
_Section 6.10_, and his heirs and Representatives. The rights of the
Indemnified Persons under this _Section 6.10_ are in addition to any rights
such Indemnified Persons may have under the Organizational Documents of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under any applicable Contracts or Law.
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall pay all expenses, including
reasonable and documented attorneys' fees, that may be incurred by any
Indemnified Person in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided
in this _Section 6.10_.

  



  

Section 6.11   _Transaction Litigation_. In the event any Proceeding
by any Governmental Entity or other Person is commenced or, to the knowledge
of the Company or Parent, as applicable, threatened, that questions the
validity or legality of the Transactions or seeks damages or an injunction in
connection therewith, including stockholder litigation ("
_Transaction Litigation_ "), the Company or Parent, as applicable, shall
promptly notify the other Party of such Transaction Litigation and shall keep
the other Party reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof. Each
Party shall give the other Party a reasonable opportunity to participate in
the defense or settlement of any Transaction Litigation (at such
Party's cost) and shall consider in good faith, acting reasonably the other
Party's advice with respect to such Transaction Litigation; provided that the
Party that is subject to such Transaction Litigation shall not offer or agree
to settle any Transaction Litigation without the prior written consent of the
other Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

  



  

Section 6.12 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with
respect to the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to
be reasonably agreed upon by the Parties. No Party shall, and each will cause
its Representatives not to, issue any public announcements or make other
public disclosures regarding this Agreement or the Transactions, without the
prior written approval of the other Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a
Party, its Subsidiaries or their Representatives may issue a public
announcement or other public disclosures (a) required by applicable Law, (b)
required by the rules of any stock exchange upon which such Party's or its
Subsidiary's capital stock is traded or (c) consistent with the final form of
the joint press release announcing the Merger and the investor presentation
given to investors on the morning of announcement of the Merger; _provided_ ,
in the case of clauses (a) and (b), such Party uses reasonable best efforts
to afford the other Party an opportunity to first review the content of the
proposed disclosure and provide reasonable comments thereon; and _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no provision in this Agreement shall be deemed to restrict
in any manner a Party's ability to communicate with its employees and that
neither Party shall be required by any provision of this Agreement to consult
with or obtain any approval from any other Party with respect to a
public announcement or press release issued in connection with the receipt
and existence of a Company Competing Proposal or a Parent Competing Proposal,
as applicable, and matters related thereto or a Parent Change of
Recommendation other than as set forth in _Section 6.3_ or _Section 6.4_,
as applicable.

  



  

   

82

 



    



  

Section 6.13   _Control of Business_. Without limiting in any way any
Party's rights or obligations under this Agreement, nothing contained in this
Agreement shall give any Party, directly or indirectly, the right to control
or direct the other Party and their respective Subsidiaries' operations prior
to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of the Parties shall
exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete
control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries' respective operations.

  



  

Section 6.14   _Transfer Taxes_. To the extent any Transfer Taxes are
imposed with respect to the Merger and are not eliminated through the
application of Section 1146 of the Bankruptcy Code, if applicable, such
Transfer Taxes imposed with respect to the Merger shall be borne by the
Surviving Corporation. The Parties will cooperate, in good faith, in the
filing of any Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer Taxes and the
minimization, to the extent reasonably permissible under applicable Law
(including under Section 1146 of the Bankruptcy Code, if applicable), of the
amount of any such Transfer Taxes.

  



  

Section 6.15   _Reasonable Best Efforts; Notification_.

  



  

(a)  Except to the extent that the Parties' obligations are
specifically set forth elsewhere in this _Article VI_ , upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement (including _Section
6.3_), each of the Parties shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to
assist and cooperate with the other Party in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious
manner reasonably practicable, the Merger and the other Transactions.

  



  

(b)  Subject to applicable Law and as otherwise required by any
Governmental Entity, the Company and Parent each shall keep the other
apprised of the status of matters relating to the consummation of the
Transactions, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices
or other communications received by Parent or the Company, as applicable, or
any of its Subsidiaries, from any third party or any Governmental Entity with
respect to the Transactions (including those alleging that the approval
or consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Transactions). The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent
shall give prompt written notice to the Company, upon becoming aware of (i)
any condition, event or circumstance that will result in any of the
conditions in _Sections 7.2(a)_ or _7.3(a)_ not being met, or (ii) the
failure by such Party to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under
this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall
affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the
Parties or the conditions to the obligations of the Parties under this
Agreement.

  



  

   

83

 



    



  

Section 6.16 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall take all such steps as may be
required to cause any dispositions of equity securities of the Company
(including derivative securities) or acquisitions of equity securities of
Parent (including derivative securities) in connection with this Agreement by
each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a)
of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, or will become subject to
such reporting requirements with respect to Parent, to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 under the Exchange Act.

  



  

Section 6.17   _Stock Exchange Listing and Deregistration_. Parent
shall take all action necessary to cause the Parent Common Stock to be issued
in the Merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE prior to the Effective
Time, subject to official notice of issuance. Prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all
things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under
applicable Law and rules and policies of the NYSE to enable the delisting by
the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock from the NYSE
and the deregistration of the shares of Company Common Stock under the
Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, and in any
event no more than ten (10) days after the Effective Time. If the Surviving
Corporation is required to file any quarterly or annual report pursuant to
the Exchange Act by a filing deadline that is imposed by the Exchange Act and
which falls on a date within the fifteen (15) days following the Closing Date,
the Company shall make available to Parent, at least ten (10) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, a substantially final draft of any such annual or
quarterly report reasonably likely to be required to be filed during such
period.

  



  

Section 6.18   _Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a)  Each of Parent and the Company will use (and will cause each
of its Affiliates to use) reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to
qualify, and will not take (and will prevent each of its Affiliates from
taking) any actions that could reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger
from qualifying, as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code. Each of Parent and the Company will comply (and will
cause each of its Affiliates to comply) with all representations, warranties,
and covenants contained in the Parent Tax Certificate and the Company Tax

Vinson and Elkins LLP (or other applicable legal counsel) a duly executed
certificate containing such representations, warranties and covenants as shall
be reasonably necessary or appropriate to enable such counsel to render the
opinion described in _Section 7.3(d)_ and any opinions to be filed in
connection with the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement (the " _Parent Tax
Certificate_ ") and (ii) the Company shall deliver to such counsel a duly
executed certificate containing such representations, warranties and
covenants as shall be reasonably necessary or appropriate to enable such
counsel to render the opinion described in _Section 7.3(d)_ and any opinions
to be filed in connection with the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement (the
" _Company Tax Certificate_ "), in each case dated as of the Closing Date
(and, if requested, dated as of the date on which the Registration Statement
is declared effective by the SEC). Parent and the Company shall provide such
other information as reasonably requested by Kirkland and Ellis LLP and Vinson
and Elkins LLP (or other applicable legal counsel) for purposes of rendering
the opinion described in _Section 7.3(d)_ and any opinions to be filed in
connection with the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement.

(c)  Each of Parent and the Company will notify the other Party
promptly after becoming aware of any reason to believe that the Merger may
not qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code.

  



  

(d)  This Agreement is intended to constitute and be adopted as a
"plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code and
within the meaning of Treasury Regulations §§ 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a).

  



  

Section 6.19   _Takeover Laws_. None of the Parties will take any
action that would cause the Transactions to be subject to requirements

within its control to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the
Transactions from the Takeover Laws of any state that purport to apply to this
Agreement or the Transactions.

  



  

Section 6.20   _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall take all
action necessary to cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform

the Company has not filed the Company Chapter 11 Cases, not less than three
Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, deliver to Parent from the administrative agent under the
Company Amended Credit Facility, a copy of a payoff letter in form reasonably
satisfactory to Parent, setting forth the total amounts payable pursuant to
the Company Amended Credit Facility to fully satisfy all principal, interest,
fees, costs, and expenses owed to each holder of Indebtedness under the
Company Amended Credit Facility as of the anticipated Closing Date (and the
daily accrual thereafter), together with appropriate wire instructions, and
the agreement from the administrative agent under the Company Amended Credit
Facility that upon payment in full of all such amounts owed to such holder,
all Indebtedness under the Company Amended Credit Facility shall be

Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective assets and equity securing
the Company Amended Credit Facility shall be released and terminated, together
with any applicable documents necessary to evidence the release and
termination of all liens on the Company and its Subsidiaries and their

Section 6.23   _Exchange Offer_.

  



  

(a)  Provided that nothing shall have occurred that would result in
a failure to satisfy any of the conditions set forth in this _Section 6.23_
of this Agreement, Parent shall, as promptly as practicable, commence the
Exchange Offer to (i) issue to all holders of Company Senior Notes validly
tendered in accordance with the terms of the Exchange Offer prior to the
expiration date of the Exchange Offer and not validly withdrawn (x) an
aggregate of 9,314,214 shares of Parent Common Stock and (y) the
Parent Senior Notes in an aggregate principal amount equal to the Parent
Senior Notes Consideration Amount ((x) and (y) collectively, the " _Exchange
Consideration_ ") in exchange for any and all of the $625 million in aggregate
principal amount outstanding of Company Senior Notes and (ii) in the event
the Company has not filed the Company Chapter 11 Cases, pay in cash on the
Closing Date all accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the
Closing Date. In the Exchange Offer, the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock and the aggregate principal amount of Parent Senior Notes to be issued
in exchange for each $1,000 principal amount of outstanding Company Senior
Notes will vary depending on the aggregate principal amount of Company Senior
Notes validly tendered pursuant to the Exchange Offer. Calculations of share
amounts for such purpose will be rounded down with respect to each holder to
the nearest whole share and no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock will
be issued for the Company Senior Notes. Calculations of principal amounts for
Parent Senior Notes for such purpose will be rounded down with respect to each
holder to the nearest amount that is equal to $2,000 and integral multiples
of $1,000 in excess thereof and no additional shares of Parent Common Stock
will be issued or payment made in compensation for such adjustments.

  



  

(b)  The obligations of Parent under the Exchange Offer shall be
subject to the satisfaction of the conditions to the consummation of the
Merger set forth in _Article VII_ of this Agreement and to the further
condition that, in the case of the Exchange Offer, not less than 97.5% of the
aggregate outstanding principal amount of Company Senior Notes and not less
than a majority of the outstanding principal amount of each series of Company
Senior Notes shall have been validly tendered in accordance with the terms of
the Exchange Offer prior to the expiration date of the Exchange Offer and not
validly withdrawn (such 97.5% of the outstanding principal amount of the
Company Senior Notes and no less than a majority of the outstanding principal
amount of each series of Company Senior Notes validly tendered and not
withdrawn being herein referred to as the " _Minimum Participation Condition_
"). Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, no term or condition of
the Exchange Offer may be amended or modified without the prior written
consent of Company and Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld.

  



  

   

86

 



    



  

(c)  Holders of Company Senior Notes who tender into the Exchange
Offer will be required, as a condition to a valid tender, to give their
consent (the " _Note Consents_ ") with respect to all Company Senior Notes
tendered by them to (i) vote to accept the Prepackaged Plan, (ii) make such
amendments to the definition of "Change of Control" and other related
provisions in the respective indenture or supplemental indentures to which
such Company Senior Notes are subject as are required to expressly exclude
the Transactions from such definitions and related provisions (the " _Change
of Control Amendment_ "), such Change of Control Amendment shall be subject
to a consent fee of $2.50 per $1,000 principal amount of the Company
Senior Notes (the " _Change of Control Amendment Consent Fee_ "), which shall
be paid by the Company to consenting holders promptly upon satisfaction of
the Minimum Participation Condition, and (iii) the following amendments to the
respective indenture or supplemental indentures to which such Company Senior
Notes are subject, together with such additional amendments thereto
or waivers thereof as shall be determined and consented to by each of Parent
and the Company to be necessary or desirable (the " _Other Indenture
Amendments_ "): amendments to eliminate (A) any covenants which may be
modified or eliminated by majority vote of the Company Senior Notes,
including without limitation any covenants which restrict (s) the sale of
assets, (t) any change of control, (u) the incurrence of indebtedness, (v)
the making of restricted payments, (w) the existence of limitations
on distributions by Subsidiaries, (x) the existence of Encumbrances, (y)
transactions with Affiliates or related persons or (z) the issuance and sale
of stock of subsidiaries, (B) any events of default which relate to (x) with
respect to a series of Company Senior Notes, the non-payment or acceleration
of Indebtedness other than such series of Company Senior Notes, (y) the
failure to discharge judgments for the payment of money, or (z) the
bankruptcy or insolvency of Subsidiaries, and (C) any provisions
which condition mergers or consolidations on compliance with any financial
criteria. Such holders will also be required, as a condition to a valid
tender but subject to the consummation of the Merger and payment in full of
the Exchange Consideration, to waive (the  " _Note Waivers_ ") any and all
existing defaults on or with respect to the Company Senior Notes that may be
modified or eliminated by majority vote of the Company Senior Notes and any
and all rights to rescind their acceptance of the Exchange Offer after the
Exchange Offer Expiration Date (as defined in _Section 6.23(c)_), such waiver
of rescission rights to be subject, however, to their withdrawal rights under
applicable Law, or to claim any payments relating to the Company Senior Notes
tendered under applicable Law, and for any other relief, legal or equitable,
based on any possible future judicial, administrative or other governmental
or legal determination that the Note Consents or the adoption of the Change of
Control Amendment or any of the Other Indenture Amendments are invalid or
unenforceable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Note
Waivers shall not be deemed to cover claims for violations of federal or
state securities Laws relating to the Exchange Offer.

  



  

(d)  Provided the conditions to the Exchange Offer set forth in this
_Section 6.23_ above have been satisfied or waived and Parent has fulfilled
its obligation hereunder to accept for exchange Company Senior Notes validly
tendered and not withdrawn and the Company has not filed the Company Chapter
11 Cases, Company Senior Notes that are not accepted in the Exchange Offer
will remain outstanding as obligations of Parent or the Surviving Corporation,
as the case may be, after consummation of the Merger and Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, alone shall be obligated to comply
with the terms thereof, except as may otherwise be provided in the
Prepackaged Plan or the Confirmation Order if the Company Chapter 11 Cases are
commenced. Such Company Senior Notes shall be modified only to the extent
provided in the Change of Control Amendment, the Other Indenture Amendments
and the Note Consents.

  



  

(e)  The Exchange Offer will expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City
time, on the twentieth business day after such commencement, or, consistent
with this Agreement and the provisions of _Section 6.24_, at such later time
and date as Parent and the Company shall select consistent with applicable
Law and regulations (the " _Exchange Offer Expiration Date_ ").

  



  

(f) The Parent Common Stock and Parent Senior Notes to be issued
in exchange for the Company Senior Notes tendered and accepted in the
Exchange Offer will be so issued only after timely receipt by the exchange
agent selected by Parent (the " _Notes Exchange Agent_ ") of: (i)
certificates for all physically delivered Company Senior Notes in proper form
for transfer, or timely confirmation of book-entry transfer of such Company
Senior Notes for such purposes; (ii) a properly completed and duly executed
letter of transmittal in the form provided on behalf of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation or a duly transmitted "agent's message" under DTC
procedures, as the case may be, for such purpose; (iii) a duly executed form
of Note Consent and Note Waiver or a duly transmitted "agent's message" under
DTC procedures; and (iv) in the case of any other physically delivered
Company Senior Notes, any other documents required by the letter
of transmittal.

  



  

   

87

 



    



  

(g)  For purposes of the Exchange Offer, Parent shall be deemed to
have accepted for exchange the tendered Company Senior Notes when Parent
gives oral or written notice to the Notes Exchange Agent of its acceptance of
such notes for exchange. The Notes Exchange Agent will act as agent for the
tendering holders for the purpose of receiving the Company Senior Notes and
transmitting the Parent Common Stock and Parent Senior Notes in exchange
therefor.

  



  

(h)  Parent and the Company shall jointly establish such additional
procedures and requirements with respect to the conduct of the Exchange Offer
and shall cause the same to be communicated to holders of the Company Senior
Notes in such manner as they shall determine to be necessary or appropriate,
including procedures and requirements as may be necessary to obtain
confirmation of the Prepackaged Plan if the Company Chapter 11 Cases are
commenced. All questions concerning the timeliness, validity,
form, eligibility, and acceptance for exchange or withdrawal of any tender of
the Company Senior Notes pursuant to any of the procedures described herein
or any additional procedures established by the parties shall be determined
jointly by the parties, whose determinations shall be final and binding.
Parent reserves the absolute right to: (i) waive any defect or irregularity in
any tender with respect to any particular Company Senior Note or any
particular holder; or (ii) permit a defect or irregularity to be
corrected within such time as it may determine. Tenders shall not be deemed
to have been received or accepted until all defects and irregularities have
been cured or waived within such time as Parent may determine in its sole
discretion. None of Parent, the Company or the Notes Exchange Agent or any
other Person shall be under any duty to give notification of any defects or
irregularities relating to tenders or incur any liability for failure to give
such notification.

  



  

(i)  Parent shall accept the Company Senior Notes tendered in the
Exchange Offer, and deposit the Exchange Consideration (including, in the
event the Company has not filed the Company Chapter 11 Cases, cash in the
amount of any accrued and unpaid interest on the Company Senior Notes from
the most recent payment date to, but excluding the Closing Date) with the Note
Exchange Agent at the Effective Time.

  



  

(j)  In the event the Company has not filed the Company Chapter 11
Cases, promptly upon receipt of the consents of the holders of at least a
majority of the outstanding principal amount of a series of Company Senior
Notes, the Company shall execute the applicable supplemental indenture
providing for the Change of Control Amendment and the Other Indenture
Amendments, each such supplemental indenture to become effective immediately
upon the execution and delivery thereof (each, a " _Supplemental Indenture
Effective Date_ ") (x) each applicable Change of Control Amendment to be
operative upon payment of the Change of Control Amendment Consent Fee and (y)
the Other Indenture Amendments to become operative only as of the Effective
Time.

Common Stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable
for shares of Parent Common Stock (including options to purchase Parent Common
Stock), in each case issued and outstanding after the date of this Agreement
and prior to the Effective Time by reason of any stock split, reverse stock
split, stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization,
combination, exchange of shares or the like, the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Exchange Offer shall be equitably
adjusted to reflect the effect of such change and, as so adjusted, shall from
and after the date of such event, be the Parent Common Stock portion of the
Exchange Consideration, subject to further adjustment in accordance with this
_Section 6.23(k)_. Nothing in this _Section 6.23(k)_ shall be construed to
permit the Parties to take any action except to the extent consistent with,
and not otherwise prohibited by, the terms of this Agreement.

Transactions; _provided_ , _further_ , that if Parent enters into a merger or
acquisition transaction following the commencement of the Company Chapter 11

the Company Termination Fee represents the Parties' reasonable estimate of
Parent's actual damages resulting from the breach of this Agreement caused by

impracticable to ascertain and (ii) the receipt of the Company Termination Fee
as liquidated damages is reasonable and does not constitute a penalty.

commercially reasonable efforts to assist Parent, its Affiliates and its and
their Representatives in the amendment, assignment or novation of any
Derivative Transaction (including any commodity hedging arrangement or

interest shall accrue on such amount from the date such payment was required
to be paid pursuant to the terms of this Agreement until the date of payment
at the rate of 8% per annum. If, in order to obtain such payment, the other
Party commences a Proceeding that results in judgment for such Party for such
amount, the defaulting Party shall pay the other Party its reasonable out-of-
pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses)
incurred in connection with such Proceeding. The Parties agree that the
monetary remedies set forth in this _Section 8.3_, _Section 6.24(h)_ and the

and Merger Sub and any of their respective former, current or future
directors, officers, shareholders, Representatives or Affiliates for any loss
suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated except in

or obligation (in which case only Parent and Merger Sub shall be liable for

respective former, current or future directors, officers, shareholders,
Representatives or Affiliates shall have any further liability or obligation

Section 9.4   _Rules of Construction_.

  



  

(a)  Each of the Parties acknowledges that it has been
represented by independent counsel of its choice throughout all negotiations
that have preceded the execution of this Agreement and that it has executed
the same with the advice of said independent counsel. Each Party and its
counsel cooperated in the drafting and preparation of this Agreement and the
documents referred to herein, and any and all drafts relating thereto
exchanged between the Parties shall be deemed the work product of the Parties
and may not be construed against any Party by reason of its preparation.
Accordingly, any rule of Law or any legal decision that would require
interpretation of any ambiguities in this Agreement against any Party that
drafted it is of no application and is hereby expressly waived.

  



  

(b) The inclusion of any information in the Company Disclosure
Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed an admission
or acknowledgment, in and of itself and solely by virtue of the inclusion of
such information in the Company Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure
Letter, as applicable, that such information is required to be listed in the
Company Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter, as applicable, that
such items are material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, or Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as the case may
be, or that such items have resulted in a Company Material Adverse Effect or
a Parent Material Adverse Effect. The headings, if any, of the individual
sections of each of the Parent Disclosure Letter and Company Disclosure
Letter are inserted for convenience only and shall not be deemed
to constitute a part thereof or a part of this Agreement. The Company
Disclosure Letter and Parent Disclosure Letter are arranged in sections
corresponding to the Sections of this Agreement merely for convenience, and
the disclosure of an item in one section of the Company Disclosure Letter or
Parent Disclosure Letter, as applicable, as an exception to a particular
representation or warranty, or as an exception to _Section 6.1_ or _Section
6.2_, shall be deemed adequately disclosed as an exception with respect to
all other representations or warranties to the extent that the relevance of
such item to such representations or warranties, or to such other subclauses
of _Section 6.1_ or _Section 6.2_, is reasonably apparent on its face,
notwithstanding the presence or absence of an appropriate section of the
Company Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter with respect to such
other representations or warranties or an appropriate cross reference
thereto.

  



  

   

102

 



    



  

(c) The specification of any dollar amount in the
representations and warranties or otherwise in this Agreement or in the
Company Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter is not intended and
shall not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment of the
materiality of such amounts or items, nor shall the same be used in any
dispute or controversy between the Parties to determine whether
any obligation, item or matter (whether or not described herein or included
in any schedule) is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement.

  



  

(d) All references in this Agreement to Annexes, Exhibits,
Schedules, Articles, Sections, subsections and other subdivisions refer
to the corresponding Annexes, Exhibits, Schedules, Articles, Sections,
subsections and other subdivisions of this Agreement unless expressly
provided otherwise. Titles appearing at the beginning of any Articles,

limitation." Pronouns in masculine, feminine or neuter genders shall be
construed to state and include any other gender and words, terms and titles

requires. Any capitalized terms herein which are defined with reference to
another agreement are defined with reference to such other agreement as of
the date hereof, without giving effect to any termination of such other
agreement or amendments to such capitalized terms in any such other agreement
following the date hereof. Unless the context otherwise requires, all defined
terms contained herein shall include the singular and plural and the
conjunctive and disjunctive forms of such defined terms. Unless the context
otherwise requires, all references to a specific time shall refer to Houston,
Texas time. The word "or" is not exclusive. The word "extent" in the phrase
"to the extent" shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing
extends and such phrase shall not mean simply "if." The term "dollars" and
the symbol "$" mean United States Dollars. The table of contents and headings
herein are for convenience of reference only, do not constitute part of this
Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the
provisions hereof.

all Parties need not sign the same counterpart.

  



  

Section 9.6 _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This

_Article III_ (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the rights of the
former holders of Company Common Stock to receive the Merger Consideration)

from and after the Effective Time is intended for the benefit of, and shall
be enforceable by, the Persons referred to therein and by their respective
heirs and Representatives) but only from and after the Effective Time,
nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer
upon any Person other than the Parties any right, benefit or remedy of any
nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the event of Parent's or Merger Sub's Willful and Material
Breach of this Agreement or fraud, then the Company's stockholders, acting
solely through the Company, shall be beneficiaries of this Agreement and shall
be entitled to pursue any and all legally available remedies, including
equitable relief, and to seek recovery of all losses, liabilities, damages,
costs and expenses of every kind and nature, including reasonable attorneys'
fees; _provided_ , _however_ , that the rights granted pursuant to this
sentence shall be enforceable only by the Company, on behalf of the
Company stockholders, in the Company's sole discretion, it being understood
and agreed such rights shall attach to such shares of Company Common Stock
and subsequently trade and transfer therewith and, consequently, any damages,
settlements, or other amounts recovered or received by the Company with
respect to such rights may, in the Company's sole discretion, be (a)
distributed, in whole or in part, by the Company to the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock of record as of any date determined by the Company or
(b) retained by the Company for the use and benefit of the Company on behalf
of its stockholders in any manner the Company deems fit.

(d)  EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH

ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY
LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT
OR THE TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO

MAKES THE FOREGOING WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED

Section 9.8   _Severability_. Each Party agrees that, should any
court or other competent authority hold any provision of this Agreement or
part hereof to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or
provision of this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such other
term or provision in any other jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the
Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in a
mutually acceptable manner in order that the Transactions be consummated as
originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible. Except as otherwise
contemplated by this Agreement, in response to an order from a court or other
competent authority for any Party to take any action inconsistent herewith or
not to take an action consistent herewith or required hereby, to the extent
that a Party took an action inconsistent with this Agreement or failed to take
action consistent with this Agreement or required by this Agreement pursuant
to such order, such Party shall not incur any liability or obligation unless
such Party did not in good faith seek to resist or object to the imposition
or entering of such order.

  



  

Section 9.9 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the
Parties (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other Party. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement
will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the
Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Any purported
assignment in violation of this _Section 9.9_ shall be void.

  



  

   

106

 



    



  

Section 9.10   _Affiliate Liability_. Each of the following is herein
referred to as a " _Company Affiliate_ ": (a) any direct or indirect holder
of equity interests or securities in the Company (whether stockholders or
otherwise), including the Company Designated Stockholder and any Affiliate of
the Company Designated Stockholder and (b) any director, officer, employee,
Representative or agent of (i) the Company, (ii) the Company Designated
Stockholder or any Affiliate of the Company Designated Stockholder or (iii)
any Person who controls the Company. No Company Affiliate shall have any
liability or obligation to Parent or Merger Sub of any nature whatsoever in
connection with or under this Agreement, the Transaction Support Agreement or
the Transactions, and Parent and Merger Sub hereby waive and release all
claims of any such liability and obligation, except in each case as expressly
provided by the Transaction Support Agreement as between the Company
Designated Stockholder and Parent. Each of the following is herein referred
to as a " _Parent Affiliate_ ": (x) any direct or indirect holder of equity
interests or securities in Parent (whether stockholders or otherwise), and (y)
any director, officer, employee, Representative or agent of (i) Parent or
(ii) any Person who controls Parent. No Parent Affiliate shall have any
liability or obligation to the Company of any nature whatsoever in connection
with or under this Agreement or the Transactions, and the Company hereby
waives and releases all claims of any such liability and obligation.

  



  

Section 9.11   _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that
irreparable damage, for which monetary damages would not be an adequate
remedy, would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached by the Parties. Prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 8.1_, it is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions, or any other appropriate form of
specific performance or equitable relief, to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in any court of competent jurisdiction, in each case in
accordance with this _Section 9.11_, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled under the terms of this Agreement at Law or
in equity. Each Party accordingly agrees (a) the non-breaching Party will be
entitled to injunctive and other equitable relief, without proof of
actual damages; and (b) the alleged breaching Party will not raise any
objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of
specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches
of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of such
Party under this Agreement and will not plead in defense thereto that there
are adequate remedies at Law, all in accordance with the terms of this
_Section 9.11_. Each Party further agrees that no other Party or any other
Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar
instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy
referred to in this _Section 9.11_, and each Party irrevocably waives any
right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such
bond or similar instrument. If prior to the Outside Date, any Party brings an
action to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions
hereof by any other Party, the Outside Date shall automatically be extended by
such other time period established by the court presiding over such action.

  



  

Section 9.12 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the Parties
at any time before or after adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders
of the Company, but, after any such adoption, no amendment shall be made
which by Law would require the further approval by such stockholders without
first obtaining such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the Parties.

  



  

   

107

 



    



  

Section 9.13   _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, the Company and Parent may, to the extent legally allowed:

  



  

(a)  extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or acts of the other Party hereunder;

  



  

(b)  waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
of the other Party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant
hereto; or

  



  

(c)  waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of
the other Party contained herein.

  



  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company or Parent
in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall
any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
of any other right hereunder. No agreement on the part of a Party to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid unless set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such Party. No waiver by any of the Parties of
any default, misrepresentation or breach of representation, warranty,
covenant or other agreement hereunder, whether intentional or not, shall be
deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation or
breach or affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or
subsequent such occurrence.

  



  

Section 9.14   _Non -Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced
against, and any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or
related to this Agreement or the Transactions may only be brought against, the
entities that are expressly named as parties hereto and then only with
respect to the specific obligations set forth herein with respect to
such party. Except to the extent a named party to this Agreement (and then
only to the extent of the specific obligations undertaken by such named party
in this Agreement and not otherwise), no past, present or future director,
manager, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, equityholder,
Affiliate, agent, attorney, advisor, consultant or Representative or Affiliate
of any of the foregoing shall have any liability (whether in Contract, tort,
equity or otherwise) for any one or more of the representations,
warranties, covenants, agreements or other obligations or liabilities of any
one or more of Parent, the Company or the Merger Sub under this Agreement
(whether for indemnification or otherwise) or of or for any claim based on,
arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the Transactions.

6.   _Limitation of Liability; Indemnification_.

  



  

(A)  The Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law as it presently exists or may
hereafter be amended, any person who was or is made a party or is threatened
to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any threatened, pending or
completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative

employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture,
trust, other enterprise or nonprofit entity, including service with respect
to an employee benefit plan (a " _Covered Person_ "), whether the basis of

prosecuting such claim to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. In
any such action, the Corporation shall have the burden of proving that the
Covered Person is not entitled to the requested indemnification or advancement

(E)  The rights conferred on any Covered Person by this _Article
6_ shall not be exclusive of any other rights that such Covered Person may
have or hereafter acquire under any statute, any provision of this Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation (as amended, restated, supplemented or
otherwise modified from time to time, this " _Certificate of Incorporation_
"), the Bylaws, any agreement or vote of stockholders or disinterested
directors or otherwise.

  



  

(F)  This _Article 6_ shall not limit the right of the
Corporation, to the extent and in the manner permitted by applicable law, to
indemnify and to advance expenses to persons other than Covered Persons when
and as authorized by appropriate corporate action.

  



  

(G)  Any Covered Person entitled to indemnification and/or
advancement of expenses, in each case pursuant to this _Article 6_ , may have
certain rights to indemnification, advancement and/or insurance provided by
one or more persons with whom or which such Covered Person may be associated.
The Corporation hereby acknowledges and agrees that (i) the Corporation shall
be the indemnitor of first resort with respect to any proceeding, expense,
liability or matter that is the subject of this _Article 6_ , (ii) the
Corporation shall be primarily liable for all such obligations and any
indemnification afforded to a Covered Person in respect of a proceeding,
expense, liability or matter that is the subject of this _Article 6_ , whether

Person may be associated to indemnify such Covered Person and/or advance
expenses or liabilities to such Covered Person in respect of any proceeding
shall be secondary to the obligations of the Corporation hereunder, (iv) the
Corporation shall be required to indemnify each Covered Person and advance
expenses to each Covered Person hereunder to the fullest extent
provided herein without regard to any rights such Covered Person may have
against any other person with whom or which such Covered Person may be
associated or insurer of any such person, and (v) the Corporation irrevocably
waives, relinquishes and releases any other person with whom or which a
Covered Person may be associated from any claim of contribution, subrogation
or any other recovery of any kind in respect of amounts paid by the
Corporation hereunder.

  



  

   

Exhibit A-2

 



    



  

(H)  A director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable
to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of
fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability (i) for any breach of the
director's duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for
acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or
a knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the DGCL, or (iv) for
any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.

director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest
extent permitted by the DGCL, as so amended.

  



  

7.   _Certificate Amendments_. The Corporation reserves the right at any time, and from time to time, to amend or repeal any provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation, and add other provisions authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware at the time in force, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by applicable law; and all rights, preferences and privileges of whatsoever nature conferred upon stockholders, directors or any other persons whomsoever by and pursuant to this Certificate of Incorporation are granted subject to the rights reserved in this _Article 7_.

Exhibit B

DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES

  



  

Bonanza Creek Energy, Inc. (the " _Issuer_ ") will issue the notes (the "
_Notes_ ") under an indenture to be dated as of the Issue Date (the "
_Indenture_ ") among itself, the Subsidiary Guarantors and [●], as trustee
(the " _Trustee_ "). The terms of the Notes will include those stated in the
Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust
Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the " _TIA_ ").

  



  

The following summary of certain provisions of the Indenture does not purport
to be complete and (except to the extent inconsistent with the following
summary) is qualified in its entirety by reference to, the TIA and to all of
the provisions of the Indenture, including the definitions of certain
terms therein and those terms made a part of the Indenture by reference to
the TIA as in effect on the date of the Indenture. A copy of the Indenture
may be obtained from the Issuer. The definitions of certain capitalized terms
used in the following summary are set forth below under "--Definitions." For
purposes of this "Description of the Notes" section, references to the
"Issuer" do not include its subsidiaries.

  



  

Brief Description of the Notes and the Subsidiary Guarantees

  



  

The Notes will be senior unsecured obligations of the Issuer ranking _pari
passu_ in right of payment to all existing and future unsubordinated
indebtedness of the Issuer and will rank senior in right of payment to all
existing and future subordinated indebtedness of the Issuer. The Subsidiary
Guarantees (as defined below) will be senior unsecured obligations of the
Subsidiary Guarantors and will rank _pari passu_ in right of payment to all
existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness of the Subsidiary Guarantors,
and will rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future
subordinated indebtedness of the Subsidiary Guarantors. However, the Notes
will be effectively subordinated to secured indebtedness of the Issuer and
the Subsidiary Guarantors, including indebtedness under the Issuer's Senior
Credit Facility to the extent of the value of the assets securing such
indebtedness. The Issuer's Senior Credit Facility is secured by liens on
substantially all assets of the Issuer and each guarantor of the Senior Credit
Facility, subject to customary exceptions.

  



  

Initially, the Trustee will act as paying agent and registrar for the Notes.
The Notes may be presented for registration of transfer and exchange at the
offices of the Registrar, which initially will be the Trustee's corporate
trust office. The Issuer may change any paying agent and registrar
without notice to holders of the Notes (the " _Holders_ "). The registered
Holder of any note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only
registered Holders will have rights under the Indenture. The Issuer will pay
principal (and premium, if any) on the Notes at the Trustee's corporate
office in New York, New York. At the Issuer's option, interest may be paid at
the Trustee's corporate trust office or by check mailed to the registered
addresses of the Holders.

  



  

Subsidiary Guarantees

  



  

The Issuer's obligations under the Notes and the Indenture will be jointly
and severally guaranteed (the " _Subsidiary Guarantees_ ") initially, by [all
of the Subsidiaries of the Issuer]1, but in the future the Indenture may not
require all of our Subsidiaries to guarantee the Notes. In the event of a
bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of these non-guarantor
Subsidiaries, these non-guarantor Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their
debts and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of
their assets to us.

  



  

[As of the date of the Indenture, all of our Subsidiaries will be "Restricted
Subsidiaries."]2 However, under the circumstances described below under the
subheading "--Certain Covenants--Limitation on Restricted and Unrestricted
Subsidiaries," the Issuer will be permitted to designate any of its
Subsidiaries as "Unrestricted Subsidiaries." The effect of designating a
Subsidiary as an "Unrestricted Subsidiary" will be that:

  



   | *| an Unrestricted Subsidiary will not be subject to many of the
restrictive covenants in the Indenture; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | *| a Subsidiary that has previously been a Subsidiary Guarantor and
that is designated an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be released from its
Subsidiary Guarantee and its obligations under the Indenture; and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | *| the assets, income, cash flow and other financial results of an
Unrestricted Subsidiary will not be consolidated with those of the Issuer for
purposes of calculating compliance with the restrictive covenants contained in
the Indenture. 
---|---|--- 
 



  

  



  



  

1 NTD: to confirm based on post-transaction structure.

  

2 NTD: to confirm based on post-transaction structure.

  



  

   



 



    



  

The obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor under its Subsidiary Guarantee
will be limited to the maximum amount as will, after giving effect to all
other contingent and fixed liabilities of such Subsidiary Guarantor
(including, without limitation, any borrowings or guarantees under any Credit
Facility) and after giving effect to any collections from or payments made by
or on behalf of any other Subsidiary Guarantor in respect of the obligations
of such other Subsidiary Guarantor under its Subsidiary Guarantee or pursuant
to its contribution obligations under the Indenture, result in the
obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor under its Subsidiary Guarantee not
constituting a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under federal or
state law. Each Subsidiary Guarantor that makes a payment for distribution
under its Subsidiary Guarantee is entitled to a contribution from each other
Subsidiary Guarantor in a pro rata amount based on adjusted net assets of
each Subsidiary Guarantor.

  



  

Each Subsidiary Guarantor may consolidate with or merge into or sell its
assets to the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary that is a Subsidiary
Guarantor without limitation, or with or to other Persons upon the terms and
conditions set forth in the Indenture. See "--Certain Covenants--
Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets."

  



  

A Subsidiary Guarantor shall be released from its obligations under its
Subsidiary Guarantee and its obligations under the Indenture:

  



   | (1)| in the event of a sale or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the assets of such Subsidiary Guarantor, by way of
merger, consolidation or otherwise, or a sale or other disposition of all of
the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary Guarantor then held by the Issuer and
the Restricted Subsidiaries; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (2)| if such Subsidiary Guarantor is designated as an Unrestricted
Subsidiary or otherwise ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary, in each case in
accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, upon effectiveness of such
designation or when it first ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary,
respectively; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (3)| at such time such Subsidiary Guarantor shall no longer guarantee
Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor under a Credit
Facility; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (4)| upon Covenant Defeasance, Legal Defeasance or satisfaction and
discharge of the Indenture as provided pursuant to the defeasance or
satisfaction and discharge provisions of the Indenture; or 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (5)| upon the liquidation or dissolution of such Subsidiary Guarantor
provided no Default or Event of Default has occurred or is continuing. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Principal, Maturity and Interest

  



  

The Notes will mature on , 20263. The Issuer will issue up to
$[●] million in aggregate principal amount of the Notes pursuant to the
Exchange Offer, on the Issue Date. The Indenture will provide for the
issuance of additional notes having identical terms and conditions to the
Notes (the " _Additional Notes_ "). The issuance of Additional Notes will be
subject to the limitations set forth under the subheading "--Certain
Covenants--Limitation on Incurrence of Additional Indebtedness and Issuance of
Preferred Stock." The Notes and any Additional Notes subsequently issued
under the Indenture will be treated as a single class for all purposes under
the Indenture, including, without limitation, waivers, amendments, redemptions
and offers to purchase.

  



  

Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate of 7.50% per annum and will be
payable semiannually in cash in arrears on each  and ,
commencing on , 2021, to the Persons who are registered Holders at
the close of business on and , respectively,
immediately preceding the applicable interest payment date. Interest on the
Notes will accrue from and including the most recent date to which interest
has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from and including the date of
issuance. Interest on overdue principal and interest, if any, will accrue at
the then applicable interest rate on the Notes. Interest will be computed
on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of 12 30-day months.

  



  

  



  



  

3 NTD: to be 5 years from issue date.

  



  

   

2

 



    



  

If any payment date falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment to
be made on such payment date will be made on the next succeeding Business Day
with the same force and effect as if made on such payment date, and no
additional interest will accrue solely as a result of such delayed payment.

  



  

The Notes will be issued in denominations of at least $2,000 and integral
multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof thereafter.

  



  

Optional Redemption

  



  

The Notes will be redeemable, at the Issuer's option, in whole at any time or
in part from time to time, prior to , 20224, at a redemption price
equal to 107.50% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be
redeemed, plus unpaid accrued interest, if any, thereon to the date of
redemption. On or after , 2022, the Notes will be redeemable, at the
Issuer's option, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at a
redemption price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes
to be redeemed, plus unpaid accrued interest, if any, thereon to the date of
redemption.

  



  

Selection and Notice of Redemption

  



  

If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, selection of
such Notes, or portions thereof, for redemption will be made by the Trustee
either:

  



   | (1)| in compliance with the requirements of the principal national
securities exchange, if any, on which the Notes are listed; or 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (2)| if the Notes are not then listed or admitted to trading on a
national securities exchange, on a pro rata basis, by lot or by such other
method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

No Notes of a principal amount of $2,000 or less shall be redeemed in part.
If a partial redemption is made, selection of the Notes or portions thereof
for redemption shall be made by the Trustee only on a pro rata basis or on as
nearly a pro rata basis as is practicable (subject to the procedures of The
Depository Trust Company (" _DTC_ ")), unless such method is otherwise
prohibited. Any notice of redemption shall be mailed by first-class mail (or
sent electronically if DTC is the recipient) at least 10, but not more than
60, days before the redemption date to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed at
its registered address. If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the
notice of redemption that relates to such Note shall state the portion of the
principal amount thereof to be redeemed. Notes called for redemption become
due on the date fixed for redemption, subject to satisfaction of any
conditions to such redemption. A new Note in a principal amount equal to the
unredeemed portion thereof will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof
upon cancellation of the original Note. On and after the applicable
redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on Notes or portions thereof
called for redemption as long as the Issuer has previously deposited with the
paying agent for the Notes funds in satisfaction of the applicable redemption
price pursuant to the Indenture.

  



  

Any redemption or notice of redemption may, at the Issuer's discretion, be
subject to one or more conditions precedent. If a redemption is subject to the
satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, the related notice shall
describe each such condition, and if applicable, shall state that, in the
Issuer's discretion, the date of redemption may be delayed until such time as
any or all such conditions shall be satisfied or waived (provided that in no
event shall such date of redemption be delayed to a date later than 60 days
after the date on which such notice was sent), or such redemption may not
occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such
conditions shall not have been satisfied or waived by the Issuer by the date
of redemption, or by the date of redemption as so delayed.

  



  

  



  



  

4 NTD: to be the first anniversary of the Issue Date.

other things, the following:

  



   | (1)| that a Change of Control has occurred and that such Holder has
the right to require the Issuer to purchase such Holder's Notes at a purchase
price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof on the date of
purchase, plus unpaid accrued interest, if any, to the date of purchase
(subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to
receive interest on the relevant interest payment date); 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (2)| the purchase date (which shall be no earlier than 30 days nor
later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed; such purchase date,
the " _Change of Control Payment Date_ "); and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (3)| the instructions, as determined by the Issuer, consistent with
the covenant described hereunder, that a Holder must follow in order to have
its Notes purchased. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Holders electing to have a Note purchased pursuant to a Change of Control
Offer will be required to surrender the Note, with the form entitled "Option
of Holder to Elect Purchase" on the reverse of the Note completed, to the
Paying Agent for the Notes at the address specified in the notice prior to
the close of business on the third Business Day prior to the Change of Control
Payment Date. If the Change of Control Payment Date is on or after an
interest record date and on or before the related interest payment date, any
accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name a Note
is registered at the close of business on the record date, and no
additional interest will be payable to holders who tender pursuant to the
Change of Control Offer.

  



  

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a
Change of Control Triggering Event if (i) a third party makes the Change of
Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with
the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control
Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not
withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer, (ii) notice of redemption of
all Notes has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described above under
the caption "--Optional Redemption," unless there is a default in payment of
the applicable redemption price or (iii) in connection with or in
contemplation of any Change of Control, the Issuer has made an offer to
purchase (an " _Alternate Offer_ ") any and all Notes validly tendered at a
cash price equal to or higher than the Change of Control Payment and has
purchased all Notes properly tendered in accordance with the terms of such
Alternate Offer.

  



  

Any Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control,
and, at the Issuer's discretion, conditioned upon the occurrence of such
Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in effect for the Change of
Control at the time of making the Change of Control Offer.

  



  

If a Change of Control Offer is made, there can be no assurance that the
Issuer will have available funds sufficient to pay the Change of Control
Payment for all the Notes that might be delivered by Holders seeking to accept
the Change of Control Offer. Other debt securities that the Issuer may issue
in the future that rank equally in right of payment with the Notes, may
have similar rights. If the Issuer is required to purchase outstanding Notes
or such other Indebtedness pursuant to a Change of Control Offer, the Issuer
expects that it would seek third-party financing to the extent it does not
have available funds to meet its purchase obligations. However, the Issuer
cannot assure any Holder that the Issuer would be able to obtain
such financing. In addition, the Issuer may be required to obtain a waiver or
amendment under the Senior Credit Facility to permit the repurchase of the
Notes. The Issuer cannot assure you that it could obtain such a waiver or
amendment. Additionally, the occurrence of certain change of control events
identified in the Senior Credit Facility would constitute an event of
default under the Senior Credit Facility which would permit the lenders
thereunder to accelerate all indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facility.
The failure of the Issuer to make or consummate the Change of Control Offer or
pay the required amount for any Notes tendered and not withdrawn when due
will constitute a Default under the Indenture and will otherwise give
the Trustee and the Holders the rights described under "--Events of Default."
See ["Risk Factors--Risks Relating to the Notes--We may not be able to
repurchase the notes upon a change of control as required by the indenture
governing the notes."]

Restrictions in the Indenture described herein on the ability of the Issuer
and its Restricted Subsidiaries to incur additional Indebtedness, to grant
Liens on their property, to make Restricted Payments, to engage in mergers or
similar transactions and to make Asset Sales may also make more difficult or
discourage a takeover of the Issuer, whether favored or opposed by the
management of the Issuer. Consummation of any such transaction in certain
circumstances may require repurchase of the Notes, and there can be no
assurance that the Issuer or the acquiring party will have sufficient
financial resources to effect such repurchase. Such restrictions and the
restrictions on transactions with Affiliates may, in certain circumstances,
make more difficult or discourage any leveraged buyout of the Issuer by the
management of the Issuer. While such restrictions cover a wide variety of
arrangements which have traditionally been used to effect highly leveraged
transactions, the Indenture may not afford the Holders protection in all
circumstances from the adverse aspects of a highly leveraged transaction,
reorganization, restructuring, merger or similar transaction.

  



  

The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may in certain
circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of the
Issuer and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control
purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the Issuer and the
initial purchasers. The Issuer has no present intention to engage in a
transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is possible that the
Issuer could decide to do so in the future.

  



  

A Change of Control Offer shall remain open for a period of 20 Business Days
or such longer period as may be required by law. The Issuer will comply with
the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other
securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws and
regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of Notes
pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of
any securities laws or regulations conflict with the "Change of Control"
provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer shall comply with the applicable
securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its
obligations under the "Change of Control" provisions of the Indenture by
virtue thereof.

  



  

The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the sale,
lease, exchange or other transfer of "all or substantially all" of the
properties or assets of the Issuer. Although there is a limited body of case
law interpreting the phrase "substantially all," there is no precise
established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the
ability of a Holder to require the Issuer to repurchase its Notes as a result
of a sale, lease, exchange or other transfer of less than all of the assets of
the issuer to another Person or group may be uncertain.

  



  

In the event that upon consummation of a Change of Control Offer or Alternate
Offer less than 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes (including,
without limitation, Additional Notes, if any) that were originally issued are
held by Holders other than the Issuer or Affiliates thereof, the Issuer will
have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days prior notice,
given not more than 60 days following the purchase pursuant to the Change of
Control Offer described above, to redeem all of the Notes that remain
outstanding following such purchase at a redemption price equal to the Change
of Control Payment plus, to the extent not included in the Change of Control
Payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes that remain
outstanding, to the date of redemption, subject to the rights of holders of
Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest on the relevant interest
payment date.

  



  

The provisions under the Indenture relative to the Issuer's obligation to
make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control
Triggering Event may be waived or modified or terminated with the consent of
the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes (including any
Additional Notes) then outstanding (including consents obtained in
connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes).

Certain Covenants

  



  

Covenant Suspension

  



  

During any period of time that (a) the Notes have an Investment Grade Rating
and (b) no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the
Indenture, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to
the provisions of the Indenture described under:

  



   | *| "--Limitation on Incurrence of Additional Indebtedness and Issuance
of Preferred Stock"; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | *| "--Limitation on Restricted Payments"; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | *| "--Limitation on Asset Sales"; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | *| "--Limitation on Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting
Restricted Subsidiaries"; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | *| Clauses (2) and (3) of the first paragraph and clause (3) of the
fourth paragraph of "Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets"; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | *| "--Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates"; and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | *| "--Subsidiary Guarantors." 
---|---|--- 
  



  

If the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to these
covenants for any period of time as a result of the previous sentence (a "
_Fall-Away Period_ ") and, subsequently, the ratings assigned to the Notes
are withdrawn or downgraded so the Notes no longer have an Investment
Grade Rating, then the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter
again be subject to these covenants. The ability of the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries to make Restricted Payments after the time of such
withdrawal or downgrade will be calculated as if the covenant governing
Restricted Payments had been in effect during the entire period of time from
the Issue Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the continued existence after
the end of the Fall-Away Period of facts and circumstances or obligations
arising from transactions which occurred during a Fall-Away Period shall not
constitute a breach of any covenant set forth in the Indenture or cause an
Event of Default thereunder.

  



  

The Indenture will contain, among others, the following covenants:

  



  

Limitation on Incurrence of Additional Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred
Stock

  



  

Other than Permitted Indebtedness, the Issuer will not, and will not cause or
permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create,
incur, issue, assume, guarantee, acquire, become liable, contingently or
otherwise, with respect to, or otherwise become responsible for payment of
(collectively, " _incur_ ") any Indebtedness (including, without limitation,
Acquired Indebtedness) and the Issuer will not permit any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to issue any Preferred Stock; _provided_ , _however_ , that if no
Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time
of or as a consequence of the incurrence of any such Indebtedness or issuance
of Preferred Stock, then the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries or any of
them may incur Indebtedness and any Restricted Subsidiary may issue Preferred
Stock, in each case, if on the date of the incurrence of such Indebtedness or
issuance of Preferred Stock, after giving _pro forma_ effect to the
incurrence thereof and the receipt and application of the proceeds
therefrom, the Issuer's Consolidated EBITDAX Coverage Ratio would have been
greater than 2.25 to 1.0.

  



  

For purposes of determining any particular amount of Indebtedness under this
covenant, (i) guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit
relating to, Indebtedness otherwise included in the determination of such
amount shall not also be included and (ii) if obligations in respect of
letters of credit are incurred pursuant to a Credit Facility and are being
treated as incurred pursuant to clause (2) of the definition of " _Permitted
Indebtedness_ " and the letters of credit relate to other Indebtedness, then
such other Indebtedness shall not be included.

  



  

   

6

 



    



  

Indebtedness or Preferred Stock of a Person existing at the time such Person
becomes a Restricted Subsidiary (whether by merger, consolidation, acquisition
of Capital Stock or otherwise) or is merged with or into the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary or which is secured by a Lien on an asset acquired by
the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (whether or not such Indebtedness is
assumed by the acquiring Person) shall be deemed incurred at the time the
Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary or at the time of the asset
acquisition, as the case may be.

  



  

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Subsidiary Guarantor to, incur
any Indebtedness which by its terms (or by the terms of any agreement
governing such Indebtedness) is subordinated in right of payment to any
Indebtedness of the Issuer or such Subsidiary Guarantor, as the case may be,
other than the Notes and the Subsidiary Guarantees, unless such Indebtedness
is also by its terms (or by the terms of any agreement governing such
Indebtedness) made expressly subordinate in right of payment to the Notes or
the Subsidiary Guarantee of such Subsidiary Guarantor, as the case may be,
pursuant to subordination provisions that are at least as favorable to the
Holders or such Subsidiary Guarantee as the subordination provisions of such
Indebtedness (or agreement).

  



  

For purposes of the Indenture, no Indebtedness will be deemed to be
subordinate or junior in right of payment to other Indebtedness solely by
virtue of not having the benefit of a Lien on assets, or guarantee of a
Person, that benefits the other Indebtedness or having the benefit of such a
Lien or guarantee ranking subordinate or junior to a Lien or guarantee
benefiting the other Indebtedness.

  



  

Limitation on Restricted Payments

  



  

The Issuer will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly:

  



   | (1)| declare or pay any dividend or make any distribution (other than
dividends or distributions made to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
and other than any dividends or distributions payable solely in Qualified
Capital Stock of the Issuer) on or in respect of shares of the Capital Stock
of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to holders of such Capital Stock; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (2)| purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire for value any
Capital Stock of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (or make any other
payment on account of, or set apart money for a sinking fund or other
analogous fund for the purchase, redemption or other acquisition or
retirement for value of, any Capital Stock of the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary) other than through the exchange therefor solely of Qualified
Capital Stock of the Issuer and other than any acquisition or retirement for
value from, or payment to, the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (3)| make any principal payment on, purchase, defease, redeem, prepay,
decrease or otherwise acquire or retire for value before twelve months prior
to any scheduled final maturity, scheduled repayment or scheduled sinking fund
payment, any Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Subsidiary Guarantor that is
subordinate or junior in right of payment to the Notes or such Subsidiary
Guarantor's Subsidiary Guarantee, as the case may be (other than a purchase,
repurchase or other acquisition of any such subordinated or
junior Indebtedness that is so purchased, repurchased or otherwise acquired
in anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund obligation,
principal installment or payment at final maturity, in each case due within
one year of the date of such purchase, repurchase or other acquisition); or 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (4)| make any Investment (other than a Permitted Investment) in any
other Person; 
---|---|--- 
  



  

(each of the foregoing actions set forth in clauses (1), (2), (3) and (4)
being referred to as a " _Restricted Payment_ "; _provided_ , _however_
, that no Permitted Investment shall be deemed to be a Restricted Payment),
if at the time of such Restricted Payment or immediately after giving effect
thereto:

  



   | (i)| a Default or an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (ii)| the Issuer is not able to incur at least $1.00 of additional
Indebtedness (other than Permitted Indebtedness) in compliance with the first
paragraph of the covenant "--Limitation on Incurrence of Additional
Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock" above; or 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

7

 



    



   | (iii)| the aggregate amount of Restricted Payments (including such
proposed Restricted Payment) made after the Issue Date, except as provided
below (the amount expended for such purposes, if other than in cash, being the
Fair Market Value of such property) shall exceed the sum (without
duplication) of: 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (a)| 50% of the cumulative Consolidated Net Income (or if cumulative
Consolidated Net Income shall be a loss, minus 100% of such loss) of the
Issuer earned after [●], 20215 and on or prior to the last date of the
Issuer's fiscal quarter immediately preceding such Restricted Payment (the "
_Reference Date_ ") (treating such period as a single accounting period);
_plus_ 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| 100% of the aggregate net cash proceeds, or the Fair Market Value
of Property (including any Property received in any Asset Acquisition or
other acquisition) other than cash, received by the Issuer from any Person
(other than a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer) from the issuance and sale
of Qualified Capital Stock of the Issuer after the Issue Date (excluding any
net cash proceeds from an Equity Offering used to redeem the Notes); _plus_ 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (c)| 100% of the aggregate net cash proceeds, or the Fair Market Value
of Property (including any Property received in any Asset Acquisition or
other acquisition) other than cash, of any equity contribution received by the
Issuer from a holder of the Issuer's Capital Stock after the Issue Date
(excluding any net cash proceeds from an Equity Offering to the extent used to
redeem the Notes);  _plus_ 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (d)| an amount equal to the net reduction in Investments in
Unrestricted Subsidiaries resulting from dividends, interest
payments, distributions, redemptions or repurchases, sales or other
dispositions thereof, repayments of loans or advances, or other transfers of
cash or Properties (including transfers as a result of merger or liquidation),
in each case to the Issuer or to any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer from
Unrestricted Subsidiaries (but without duplication of any such amount included
in calculating cumulative Consolidated Net Income of the Issuer), or from
redesignations of Unrestricted Subsidiaries as Restricted Subsidiaries (in
each case valued as provided in "--Limitation on Restricted and Unrestricted
Subsidiaries" below), not to exceed, in the case of any such redesignation,
the amount of Investments previously made by the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary in such Unrestricted Subsidiary and which was treated as a
Restricted Payment under the Indenture; _plus_ 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (e)| the amount by which Indebtedness of the Issuer is reduced on the
consolidated balance sheet of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries upon
the conversion or exchange subsequent to the Issue Date of any Indebtedness of
the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries that is convertible or exchangeable
for Qualified Capital Stock of the Issuer (less the amount of any cash, or the
Fair Market Value of any other property, distributed by the Issuer to the
holder of such Indebtedness upon such conversion or exchange); _provided_ , 
_however_ , that the foregoing amount shall not exceed the Net Cash Proceeds,
or the Fair Market Value of Property (including any Property received in any
Asset Acquisition or other acquisition) other than cash, received by the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary from the sale of such Indebtedness
(excluding Net Cash Proceeds from sales to a Restricted Subsidiary of the
Issuer);  _plus_ 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (f)| an amount equal to the net reduction in Investments (other than
Permitted Investments) resulting from dividends, distributions, redemptions
or repurchases, proceeds of sales or other dispositions thereof, interest
payments, repayments of loans or advances, or other transfers of cash or
Properties (including transfers as a result of merger or liquidation), in each
case to the Issuer or to any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer from any
Person (other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary), or from the
obligation underlying any guarantee previously entered into by the Issuer or
a Restricted Subsidiary no longer existing (and without such guarantee having
been called upon), in each case not to exceed the amount in respect of such
Investment which had been treated as a Restricted Payment (but without
duplication of any such amount included in calculating cumulative Consolidated
Net Income of the Issuer); plus 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (g)| $[●] million.6 
---|---|--- 
  



  



  



  

5 NTD: to be the beginning of the fiscal quarter in which the Issue Date
occurs.

  

6 NTD: to include rollover amount from 2025 Notes.

  



  

   

8

 



    



  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions set forth in the immediately
preceding paragraph shall not prohibit:

  



   | (1)| the payment of any dividend or redemption payment or the making
of any distribution within 60 days after the date of declaration thereof if
the dividend, redemption or distribution payment, as the case may be, would
have been permitted on the date of declaration; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (2)| the acquisition of any Capital Stock of the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary, either (i) solely in exchange for shares of Qualified
Capital Stock of the Issuer or (ii) through the application of net proceeds of
a substantially concurrent sale for cash (other than to a Restricted
Subsidiary of the Issuer) of Qualified Capital Stock of the Issuer; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (3)| the purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other
acquisition or retirement for value of any Indebtedness of the Issuer or any
Subsidiary Guarantor that is subordinate or junior in right of payment to the
Notes or such Subsidiary Guarantor's Subsidiary Guarantee, as the case may
be, either (i) solely in exchange for Qualified Capital Stock of the Issuer,
(ii) through the application of the net proceeds of a substantially
concurrent sale for cash (other than to a Restricted Subsidiary of the
Issuer) of (a) Qualified Capital Stock of the Issuer or (b) Refinancing
Indebtedness or (iii) solely in exchange for Indebtedness
constituting Refinancing Indebtedness; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (4)| the purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other
acquisition or retirement for value of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer
or any Subsidiary Guarantor either (i) through the application of the net
proceeds of a substantially concurrent sale for cash (other than to a
Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer) of Refinancing Indebtedness or (ii)
solely in exchange for Indebtedness constituting Refinancing Indebtedness; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (5)| if no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, the redemption or repurchase of equity interests in the Issuer
held by then present or former officers, directors or employees of the Issuer;
provided, that the aggregate cash consideration paid for all such redemptions
or repurchases in any calendar year shall not exceed $4.0 million plus (A) the
cash proceeds received during such calendar year by the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries from the sale of the Issuer's Qualified Capital Stock
to any such officers, directors or employees (provided that the amount of such
cash proceeds utilized for any such redemption or repurchase will not
increase the amount available for Restricted Payments under clause (iii)(b) of
the immediately preceding paragraph) plus (B) the cash proceeds of key man
life insurance policies received during such calendar year by the Issuer and
its Restricted Subsidiaries (with unused amounts in any calendar year being
carried forward to succeeding calendar years); 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (6)| if no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, repurchases of Indebtedness that is subordinated or junior in
right of payment to the Notes or a Subsidiary Guarantee at a purchase price
not greater than (i) 101% of the principal amount of such subordinated or
junior Indebtedness and accrued and unpaid interest thereon in the event of a
Change of Control or (ii) 100% of the principal amount of such subordinated
or junior Indebtedness and accrued and unpaid interest thereon in the event
of an Asset Sale, in each case plus accrued interest, in connection with any

with and fully satisfied its obligations under the provisions described under
"--Change of Control"; or 
---|---|---

fully satisfied its obligations in accordance with the covenant under the
heading, "--Limitation on Asset Sales";

merger or consolidation involving the Issuer or Restricted Subsidiary or any
other transaction permitted by the Indenture; 
---|---|---

   | (8)| repurchases of Capital Stock deemed to occur upon the exercise or
conversion of stock options, warrants or other convertible securities if such
Capital Stock represents a portion of the exercise or conversion price
thereof;

Additional Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock"; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (10)| the payment of any dividend or any similar distribution by a
Restricted Subsidiary to the holders (other than the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary) of Qualified Capital Stock of such Restricted Subsidiary; provided

of such Qualified Capital Stock;

stock options, restricted stock and phantom stock) in order to satisfy any
tax withholding obligation with respect to such exercise or vesting; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (12)| any payments in connection with the Merger Transactions, or any
payments to dissenting stockholders (x) pursuant to applicable law or (y) in
connection with the settlement or other satisfaction of claims made pursuant
to or in connection with a consolidation, merger or transfer of assets in
connection with a transaction that is not prohibited by the Indenture;

   | (13)| any redemption of share purchase rights at a redemption price
not to exceed $0.01 per right;

Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor, by application of (i)
cash provided from operations in the ordinary course of business or (ii)
proceeds from borrowings under the revolving portion of the Senior Credit
Facility (so long as within 30 days prior to such purchase or redemption, a
corresponding amount of borrowings under the revolving portion of the Senior
Credit Facility was repaid from cash provided from operations in the ordinary
course of business); _provided_ , in any such case, that the Issuer is able
to incur an additional $1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph
of the covenant described under the caption "--Limitation on Incurrence of
Additional Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock" after giving effect
to such purchase or redemption; provided, further, that this clause (14)
shall not permit the application of any proceeds from any other borrowings
under any Credit Facility to effect any such purchase or redemption; or 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (15)| any other Restricted Payments, which when combined with any
other outstanding Restricted Payments made pursuant to this clause (15), does

---|---|--- 
  



  

In determining the aggregate amount of Restricted Payments after the Issue
Date in accordance with clause (iii) of the second preceding paragraph,
amounts expended pursuant to clauses (1), (2), (3)(i), (3)(ii)(a), (7), and
(13) of the immediately preceding paragraph shall be included in such
calculation, and amounts expended pursuant to clauses (3)(ii)(b), (3)(iii),
(4), (5), (6), (8), (9), (10), (11), (12), (14) and (15) of the immediately
preceding paragraph shall be excluded from such calculation. In determining
the aggregate net cash proceeds or Fair Market Value of Property other than
cash received by the Issuer from the issuance and sale of Qualified Capital
Stock in accordance with clause (3)(b) of the second preceding paragraph,
amounts of cash received by the Issuer pursuant to clauses (2)(ii) or
(3)(ii)(a), or the Fair Market Value of Capital Stock of the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness of the Issuer or any
Subsidiary Guarantor acquired or retired for value pursuant to clauses (2)(i)
or (3)(i), of the immediately preceding paragraph shall be included in such
calculation. For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the
event that a Restricted Payment meets the criteria of more than one of the
exceptions described in (1) through (15) above or is entitled to be made
pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, the Issuer shall, in its
sole discretion, classify such Restricted Payment, or later classify,
reclassify or re-divide all or a portion of such Restricted Payment, in any
manner that complies with this covenant.

  



  

   

10

 



    



  

A sale will be deemed to be "substantially concurrent" if the related
purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance, satisfaction and discharge,
retirement or other acquisition for value or payment of principal occurs
within 90 days before or after such sale.

  



  

Limitation on Asset Sales

  



  

The Issuer will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to, consummate an Asset Sale unless:

  



   | (1)| the Issuer or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary, as the case
may be, receives consideration at the time of such Asset Sale at least equal
to the Fair Market Value of the assets sold or otherwise disposed of, which
may be determined as of the date of any agreement with respect to such Asset
Sale; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (2)| either (a) at least 75% of the consideration received by the
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, from such Asset
Sale shall be in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents and is received at the
time of such disposition or (b) the Fair Market Value (determined at the time
of receipt) of all forms of consideration other than cash and Cash Equivalents
received for all Asset Sales since the Issue Date does not exceed in the
aggregate 15 % of the Adjusted Consolidated Net Tangible Assets of the Issuer
at the time such determination is made; and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (3)| the Issuer shall apply, or cause such Restricted Subsidiary to
apply, the Net Cash Proceeds relating to such Asset Sale within 360 days of
receipt thereof either: 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (a)| to repay or prepay Indebtedness outstanding under the Senior
Credit Facility (or, if the Senior Credit Facility is no longer in existence,
any Indebtedness secured by a Lien permitted to be incurred pursuant to "--
Limitations on Liens" below); 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| to permanently repay, redeem or repurchase any Indebtedness of
the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor that is not subordinated to the Notes
or the Subsidiary Guarantees; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (c)| to make an investment (including, without limitation, capital
expenditures) in (i) properties or assets that replace the properties or
assets that were the subject of such Asset Sale or (ii) properties or assets
that will be used in the Crude Oil and Natural Gas Business of the Issuer and
its Restricted Subsidiaries or in businesses reasonably related thereto
(collectively, " _Replacement Assets_ "); 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (d)| to make a Permitted Industry Investment or to acquire or make an
investment in Crude Oil and Natural Gas Related Assets; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (e)| to the extent not included in (c) or (d) above, any investment in
(i) Capital Stock of a Person that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary as a
result of the acquisition of such Capital Stock by the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary, (ii) Capital Stock constituting a minority interest in any Person
that at such time is a Restricted Subsidiary, and (iii) Capital Stock of any
Subsidiary of Issuer, provided that all the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary
held by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries shall entitle
the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary to not less than a pro rata share of
all dividends or other distributions made by such Subsidiary upon any of such
Capital Stock; or 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (f)| to make a combination of prepayment and investment permitted by
the foregoing clauses (3)(a) through (3)(e). 
---|---|--- 
  



  

On the 361st day after an Asset Sale or such earlier date, if any, as the
Issuer determines not to apply the Net Cash Proceeds relating to such Asset
Sale as set forth in clauses (3)(a) through (3)(f) of the immediately
preceding paragraph (each a " _Net Proceeds Offer Trigger Date_ "), such
aggregate amount of Net Cash Proceeds which have been received by the Issuer
or such Restricted Subsidiary but which have not been applied on or before
such Net Proceeds Offer Trigger Date as permitted in clauses (3)(a) through
(3)(f) of the immediately preceding paragraph (each a " _Net Proceeds Offer
Amount_ ") shall be applied by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as
the case may be, to make an offer to purchase (a  " _Net Proceeds Offer_ ")
on a date (the " _Net Proceeds Offer Payment Date_ ") not less than 30, nor
more than 45, days following the applicable Net Proceeds Offer Trigger Date,
from all Holders and, to the extent required by the terms of any Pari Passu
Indebtedness, the holders of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, on a pro rata
basis, that principal amount of Notes (and Pari Passu Indebtedness)
purchasable with the Net Proceeds Offer Amount at a price equal to 100% of
the principal amount of the Notes (and Pari Passu Indebtedness) to be
purchased (or, in the event such other Pari Passu Indebtedness was issued
with significant original issue discount, 100% of the accreted value thereof),
plus unpaid accrued interest, if any, thereon to the date of purchase;
provided, however, that if at any time consideration other than cash or Cash
Equivalents received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case
may be, in connection with any Asset Sale is converted into or sold or
otherwise disposed of for cash or Cash Equivalents (other than interest
received with respect to any such non-cash or non-Cash Equivalents
consideration), then such conversion or disposition shall be deemed
to constitute an Asset Sale hereunder and the Net Cash Proceeds thereof shall
be applied in accordance with this covenant.

  



  

   

11

 



    



  

The Issuer may defer the Net Proceeds Offer until there is an aggregate
unutilized Net Proceeds Offer Amount equal to or in excess of $40.0 million
resulting from one or more Asset Sales (at which time, the entire unutilized
Net Proceeds Offer Amount, and not just the amount in excess of $40.0
million shall be applied as required pursuant to this covenant). Pending
application of Net Cash Proceeds pursuant to this covenant, such Net Cash
Proceeds may be temporarily invested in Cash Equivalents or applied to
temporarily reduce revolving credit indebtedness.

  



  

If the Net Proceeds Offer Payment Date is on or after an interest record date
and on or before the related interest payment date, any accrued and unpaid
interest will be paid to the Person in whose name a Note is registered at the
close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be
payable to holders who tender Notes pursuant to the Net Proceeds Offer.

  



  

Notwithstanding the first two paragraphs of this covenant, the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to consummate an Asset Sale without
complying with such paragraphs to the extent that:

  



   | (1)| the consideration for such Asset Sale constitutes Replacement
Assets and/or Crude Oil and Natural Gas Related Assets and/or the assumption
of obligations secured by Liens that burden some or all of the assets being
sold and/or cash or Cash Equivalents;  _provided_ that, in the case of any
such assumption, (a) the Person assuming such obligations shall have no
recourse with respect to such obligations to the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries and (b) no assets of the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries (other than those assets being sold) are subject to
such Liens; and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (2)| such Asset Sale is for Fair Market Value; _provided_ that at
least 75% of the total consideration received by the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with any such Asset Sale shall be in the
form of Replacement Assets and Crude Oil and Natural Gas Related Assets, the
assumption of obligations secured by Liens described in (1) above, cash or
Cash Equivalents, or any combination of the foregoing, and that any Net Cash
Proceeds so received shall be subject to the provisions of clause (3) of the
first paragraph and to the provisions of the second paragraph of this
covenant. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

For the purposes of clause (2) of both the first and immediately preceding
paragraphs of this covenant and for the purposes of clause (1) of the
immediately preceding paragraph, the following are deemed to be cash or Cash
Equivalents:

  



   | (1)| the assumption of Indebtedness or other liabilities shown on the
balance sheet of the Issuer (other than obligations in respect of
Disqualified Stock of the Issuer and Indebtedness or other liabilities that
are by their terms subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or any
Subsidiary Guarantee) or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than obligations in
respect of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock of a Subsidiary Guarantor
and Indebtedness or other liabilities that are by their terms subordinated in
right of payment to the Notes or any Subsidiary Guarantee) and the release of
the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on such
Indebtedness or liabilities in connection with such Asset Sale (or in lieu of
such a release, the agreement of the acquiror or its parent company to
indemnify and hold the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary harmless from and
against any loss, liability or cost in respect of such assumed Indebtedness
or liabilities; and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (2)| securities received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
from the transferee that are converted by the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary into cash within 180 days of the Asset Sale, to the extent of cash
received in that conversion; and 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

12

 



    



   | (3)| with respect to any Asset Sale involving oil and gas properties
in which the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary retains an interest, the
obligation of any purchaser or transferee of such properties or their
Affiliates to fund all or a portion of the costs and expenses of exploring or
developing such properties. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

The requirement of clause (3)(c), (3)(d) or (3)(e) above shall be deemed to
be satisfied if an agreement (including a lease, whether a capital lease or an
operating lease) committing to make the acquisitions or investment referred
to therein is entered into by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary within
the time period specified in clause (3) and such Net Cash Proceeds are
subsequently applied in accordance with such agreement within six months
following such agreement.

  



  

Notice of each Net Proceeds Offer will be mailed to the record Holders as
shown on the register of Holders within 30 days following the Net Proceeds
Offer Trigger Date, with a copy to the Trustee, and shall comply with the
procedures set forth in the Indenture. Upon receiving notice of the Net
Proceeds Offer, Holders may elect to tender their Notes in whole or in part
in exchange for cash. To the extent Holders properly tender Notes and holders
of Pari Passu Indebtedness properly tender such Indebtedness with an aggregate
principal amount exceeding the Net Proceeds Offer Amount, Notes of tendering
Holders and Pari Passu Indebtedness will be purchased on a pro rata basis
(based on principal amounts of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness (or, in the
case of Pari Passu Indebtedness issued with significant original issue
discount based on the accreted value thereof) tendered). A Net Proceeds Offer
shall remain open for a period of 20 Business Days or such longer period as
may be required by law.

  



  

The Issuer's ability to repurchase Notes in a Net Proceeds Offer may be
restricted by the terms of the Senior Credit Facility and may be prohibited or
otherwise limited by the terms of any then existing borrowing arrangements
and the Issuer's financial resources. The exercise by the Holders of their
right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes upon a Net Proceeds Offer
or a Change of Control Triggering Event could cause a default under these
other agreements, even if the Change of Control Triggering Event or Asset Sale
itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchases on the
Issuer or otherwise. In the event a Change of Control or Asset Sale occurs at
a time when the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing Notes, the Issuer could
seek the consent of the applicable lenders to the purchase of Notes or could
attempt to refinance the Indebtedness that contain such prohibitions. If the
Issuer does not obtain a consent or repay the Indebtedness, the Issuer will
remain prohibited from purchasing Notes. In that case, the Issuer's failure
to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the
Indenture which could, in turn, constitute a default under other
Indebtedness.

  



  

The provisions under the Indenture relative to the Issuer's obligation to
make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of an Asset Sale may be
waived or modified with the consent of a majority in principal amount of the
Notes (including Additional Notes) then outstanding (including
consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender or exchange
offer for, Notes).

  



  

The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange
Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent
such laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of
Notes pursuant to a Net Proceeds Offer. To the extent that the provisions
of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the " _Asset Sale_ "
provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer shall comply with the applicable
securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its
obligations under the " _Asset Sale_ " provisions of the Indenture by virtue
thereof.

  



  

If all or any portion of any Net Proceeds Offer Amount remains after
consummation of a Net Proceeds Offer, the Issuer may use such remaining
portion of such Net Proceeds Offer Amount for any purpose not otherwise
prohibited by the Indenture.

  



  

Limitation on Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted
Subsidiaries

  



  

The Issuer will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create or otherwise cause or permit
to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction on the
ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to:

  



   | (1)| pay  dividends or make any other distributions on or in respect
of its Capital Stock (it being  understood that the priority of any Preferred
Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating  distributions prior to dividends
or liquidating distributions being paid on Common Stock  shall not be deemed
a restriction on the ability to pay dividends or make distributions  on or in
respect of Capital Stock); 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

13

 



    



   | (2)| make loans or advances, or to pay any Indebtedness or other
obligation owed, to the Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary (it being
understood that the subordination of loans or advances made by a Restricted
Subsidiary to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness
or obligations incurred or owed by the Issuer or such other Restricted
Subsidiary, or of Indebtedness or any other obligation owed by any Restricted
Subsidiary to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness or
obligations incurred or owed by such Restricted Subsidiary shall not be
deemed a restriction on the ability of a Restricted Subsidiary to make loans
or advances or to pay such Indebtedness or such other obligation); 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (3)| guarantee any Indebtedness or any other obligation of the Issuer
or any Restricted Subsidiary; or 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (4)| transfer any of its property or assets to the Issuer or any other
Restricted Subsidiary, 
---|---|--- 
  



  

except for such encumbrances or restrictions existing under or by reason of:

  



   | (1)| With respect to clauses (1)-(4) above: 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (a)| applicable law, rule, regulation, order, approval, license,
permit or similar restriction; 
---|---|---

agreement in effect at the Issue Date; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (c)| (i) the Indenture or any other indentures governing Pari Passu
Indebtedness; _provided_ , _however_ , that the provisions relating to such
encumbrances or restriction contained in any such other indenture are no less
favorable to the Holders in any material respect as determined by the Issuer
in its reasonable and good faith judgment than the provisions relating to such
encumbrances or restrictions contained in the Indenture or (ii) instruments
governing other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries permitted to be incurred pursuant to an agreement
entered into subsequent to the Issue Date in accordance with the covenant
described under the caption "--Limitation on Incurrence of Additional
Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock"; _provided_ that the provisions
relating to such encumbrance or restriction contained in such instruments
are not materially less favorable to the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, as determined by the Issuer in good faith,
than the provisions contained in the Senior Credit Facility and in the
Indenture as in effect on the Issue Date; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (d)| the Senior Credit Facility; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (e)| customary encumbrances and restrictions contained in agreements
of the types described in the definition of "Permitted Industry Investments"; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (f)| customary non-assignment provisions of any contract or any lease
governing a leasehold interest of any Restricted Subsidiary; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (g)| any encumbrance or restriction with respect to any Person at the
time it becomes a Restricted Subsidiary or is merged with or into the Issuer
or a Restricted Subsidiary, which encumbrance or restriction is not applicable
to such Restricted Subsidiary, or the properties or assets of such Restricted
Subsidiary, other than the Person or the properties or assets of the Person so
acquired; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (h)| customary restrictions with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary of
the Issuer pursuant to an agreement that has been entered into for the sale
or disposition of Capital Stock or assets of such Restricted Subsidiary to be

of the assets or Capital Stock to be sold or disposed of; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (i)| any instrument governing a Permitted Lien, to the extent and only
to the extent such instrument restricts the transfer or other disposition of
assets subject to such Lien; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (j)| encumbrances  and restrictions contained in contracts entered
into in the ordinary course of business,  not relating to any Indebtedness,
and that do not, individually or in the aggregate,  detract from the value
of, or from the ability of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries  to
realize the value of, property or assets of the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary  in any manner material to the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary; 
---|---|---

agreement referred to in clause (b), (c), (d) or (g) above or this clause (k),

(d) or (g) above or this clause (k); _provided_ , _however_ , that the
provisions relating to such encumbrance or restriction contained in any such
agreement governing Refinancing Indebtedness or amended agreement are, taken
as a whole, no less favorable to the Holders in any material respect as
determined by the Issuer in its reasonable and good faith judgment than the
provisions relating to such encumbrance or restriction contained in the
applicable agreement referred to in such clause (b), (c), (d) or (g) or this
clause (k); 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (l)| Commodity Agreements, Currency Agreements or Interest Rate

payment of dividends thereon in accordance with the terms thereof; _provided_
that issuance of such Preferred Stock is permitted pursuant to the covenant
described under "--Limitation on Incurrence of Additional Indebtedness and
Issuance of Preferred Stock" and the terms of such Preferred Stock do not
expressly restrict the ability of a Restricted Subsidiary to pay dividends or
make any other distributions on its Capital Stock (other than requirements to
pay dividends or liquidation preferences on such Preferred Stock prior to
paying any dividends or making any other distributions on such other Capital
Stock); and 
---|---|---

if (x) either (a) the encumbrance or restriction applies only in the event of
a payment default or a default with respect to a financial covenant in such
Indebtedness or agreement or (b) any such encumbrance or restriction will not
affect the Issuer's ability to make principal or interest payments on the
Notes, as determined in good faith by the Issuer, and (y) the encumbrance or

provisions contained in the Senior Credit Facility or the Indenture;

   | (p)| any Permitted Investment; and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (2)| with respect to clause (4) above only: 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (a)| any encumbrance or restriction contained in security agreements,
mortgages, purchase money agreements, Finance Lease Obligations or similar
instruments securing Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary to the extent
such encumbrance or restriction restricts the transfer of the property
subject to such security agreements, mortgages, purchase money agreements or
similar instruments;

contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business;

Limitation on Liens

  



  

The Issuer will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, assume or permit or
suffer to exist any Liens of any kind, which Liens secure Indebtedness,
against or upon any property or assets of the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries (whether owned on the Issue Date or acquired after
the Issue Date), other than Permitted Liens, unless:

  



   | (1)| in the case of Liens securing Indebtedness that is expressly
subordinate or junior in right of payment to the Notes or any Subsidiary
Guarantee, the Notes or such Subsidiary Guarantee, as the case may be, are
secured by a Lien on such property, assets or proceeds that is senior in
priority to such Liens at least to the same extent as the Notes are senior in
priority to such Indebtedness for so long as such Indebtedness is so secured;
and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (2)| in all other cases, the Notes and the Subsidiary Guarantees are
equally and ratably secured with the Indebtedness so secured for so long as
such Indebtedness is so secured. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Any Lien created for the benefit of the Holders pursuant to the preceding
sentence shall provide by its terms that such Lien shall be automatically and
unconditionally released and discharged upon the release and discharge of the
initial Lien.

  



  

Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets

  



  

Other than the Merger Transaction, the Issuer will not, in a single
transaction or series of related transactions, consolidate or merge with or
into any Person, or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise
dispose of (or cause or permit any Restricted Subsidiary to sell, assign,
transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of) all or substantially all of

   | (x)| shall be an entity organized and validly existing under the laws
of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia; and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (y)| shall expressly assume, by supplemental indenture, executed and

premium, if any, and interest on all of the Notes and the performance of every
covenant of the Notes and the Indenture on the part of the Issuer to be
performed or observed; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (2)| immediately  after giving effect to such transaction and the
assumption contemplated by clause (1)(b)(y)  above (including giving effect
to any Indebtedness incurred or anticipated to be incurred  or repaid in
connection with or in respect of such transaction as if the same had
occurred  at the beginning of the applicable Four Quarter Period) and the
application of any net  proceeds therefrom, the Issuer or such Surviving
Entity, as the case may be, either (x)  shall be able to incur at least $1.00
of additional Indebtedness (other than Permitted  Indebtedness) pursuant to
the covenant entitled "--Limitation on Incurrence  of Additional Indebtedness
and Issuance of Preferred Stock" above, or (y) would  have a Consolidated
EBITDAX Coverage Ratio that is equal to or greater than the Consolidated 
EBITDAX Coverage Ratio of the Issuer immediately prior to such transaction;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that this clause (2) will not be applicable to (A)
a Restricted Subsidiary  consolidating with, merging into or transferring all
or part of its properties and assets  to the Issuer or one or more other
Restricted Subsidiaries or (B) the Issuer merging  with an Affiliate of the
Issuer solely for the purpose and with the sole effect of reincorporating 
the Issuer in another jurisdiction, converting to an entity taxable for
federal income  tax purposes as a corporation or a combination of the
foregoing; 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

16

 



    



   | (3)| immediately after giving effect to such transaction and the
assumption contemplated by clause (1)(b)(y) above (including,
without limitation, giving effect to any Indebtedness incurred or anticipated
to be incurred or repaid and any Lien granted in connection with or in
respect of the transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have
occurred or be continuing; _provided_ , _however_ , that this clause (3) will
not be applicable to a Restricted Subsidiary consolidating with, merging into
or transferring all or part of its properties and assets to the Issuer or one
or more other Restricted Subsidiaries; and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (4)| the Issuer or the Surviving Entity, as the case may be, shall
have delivered to the Trustee an officers' certificate and an opinion of
counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger, sale, assignment,
transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition and, if a supplemental
indenture is required in connection with such transaction, such supplemental
indenture, complies with the applicable provisions of the Indenture, and that
all conditions precedent in the Indenture relating to such transaction have
been satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that such counsel may rely, as to
matters of fact, on a certificate or certificates of officers of the Issuer. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

For purposes of the foregoing, the transfer (by lease, assignment, sale or
otherwise, in a single transaction or series of transactions) of all or
substantially all of the properties or assets of one or more Restricted
Subsidiaries, the Capital Stock of which constitutes all or substantially all
of the properties and assets of the Issuer, shall be deemed to be the
transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the
Issuer.

  



  

Upon any consolidation or merger or any transfer of all or substantially all
of the assets of the Issuer in accordance with the foregoing, in which the
Issuer is not the Surviving Entity, the Surviving Entity formed by such
consolidation or into which the Issuer is merged or to which such
conveyance, lease or transfer is made shall succeed to, and be substituted
for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Issuer under the
Indenture and the Notes with the same effect as if such Surviving Entity had
been named as such, and thereafter (except in the case of a lease of all or
substantially all of the Issuer's assets) the Issuer will be relieved of all
obligations and covenants under the Indenture and the Notes.

  



  

Each Subsidiary Guarantor (other than any Subsidiary Guarantor whose
Subsidiary Guarantee is to be released in accordance with the terms of the
Subsidiary Guarantee and the Indenture in connection with any transaction
complying with the provisions of the Indenture described under "--
Limitation on Asset Sales") will not, and the Issuer will not cause or permit
any such Subsidiary Guarantor to, consolidate with or merge with or into any
Person other than the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary that is a
Subsidiary Guarantor unless:

  



   | (1)| the entity formed by or surviving any such consolidation or
merger (if other than the Subsidiary Guarantor) or to which such sale, lease,
conveyance or other disposition shall have been made is an entity organized
and existing under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the
District of Columbia; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (2)| such entity (if other than the Subsidiary Guarantor) assumes by
execution of a supplemental indenture all of the obligations of the
Subsidiary Guarantor under its Subsidiary Guarantee; and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (3)| immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Default
or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Any merger or consolidation of a Subsidiary Guarantor with and into the
Issuer (with the Issuer being the surviving entity) or another Restricted
Subsidiary that is a Subsidiary Guarantor need only comply with clause (4) of
the first paragraph of this covenant.

  



  

Upon any consolidation or merger of any Subsidiary Guarantor in accordance
with the second preceding paragraph (excluding any merger or consolidation of
a Subsidiary Guarantor whose Subsidiary Guarantee is to be released as
specified in the second preceding paragraph and any merger or consolidation
of a Subsidiary Guarantor referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph)
in which such Subsidiary Guarantor is not the continuing Person, the Person
formed by such consolidation or into which such Subsidiary Guarantor is
merged shall succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right
and power of, such Subsidiary Guarantor under the Indenture and the Notes
with the same effect as if such Person had been named as such.

Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates

  



  

The Issuer will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, enter into, amend or conduct any
transaction or series of related transactions (including, without limitation,
the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property, the guaranteeing of
any Indebtedness or the rendering of any service) involving aggregate
consideration in excess of $2.0 million with, or for the benefit of, any of
their respective Affiliates (each an " _Affiliate Transaction_ "), other than
Affiliate Transactions that are on terms that, taken as a whole, are fair and
reasonable to the Issuer or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary from
a financial point of view, or are no less favorable to the Issuer or the
applicable Restricted Subsidiary than those that might reasonably have been
obtained in a comparable transaction at such time on an arm's-length basis
from a Person that is not an Affiliate of the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary.

  



  

Any Affiliate Transaction (and each series of related Affiliate Transactions
which are part of a common plan) that involves aggregate payments or other
property with a Fair Market Value in excess of $25.0 million shall be
approved by the Board of Directors of the Issuer, including a majority of
the disinterested members of the Board of Directors of the Issuer, if any,
such approval to be evidenced by a Board Resolution stating that such Board
of Directors has determined that such transaction complies with the foregoing
provisions. If the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary enters into an
Affiliate Transaction (or a series of related Affiliate Transactions which are
part of a common plan) that involves an aggregate Fair Market Value of more
than $10.0 million, the Issuer shall, prior to the consummation
thereof, deliver an officers' certificate to the Trustee certifying that such
transaction complies with the foregoing provision.

  



  

The restrictions set forth in the second paragraph of this covenant shall not
apply to:

  



   | (1)| reasonable fees and compensation paid to, and indemnity provided
on behalf of, officers, directors, employees or consultants of the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (2)| transactions exclusively between or among the Issuer and any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries or exclusively between or among such Restricted
Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that such transactions are not
otherwise prohibited by the Indenture; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (3)| any Investment or other Restricted Payments permitted by the
Indenture; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (4)| any issuance of securities or other payments, awards or grants in
cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, employment or
severance arrangements, stock options and stock ownership, phantom stock or
other incentive compensation plans approved by the Issuer; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (5)| (a) loans or advances to officers, directors or employees in the
ordinary course of business in accordance with the past practices of the
Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries, but in any event not to exceed $5.0
million in the aggregate outstanding at any one time; and (b) advances to or
reimbursements of officers, directors or employees for moving, entertainment
and travel expenses, drawing accounts and similar expenditures in the
ordinary course of business; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (6)| the issuance or sale of any Capital Stock (other than
Disqualified Stock) of the Issuer, or the receipt by the Issuer of
any capital contribution from the holders of its Capital Stock; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (7)| transactions and arrangements in effect, or effected in
accordance with agreements or arrangements in effect, on the Issue Date
(including the Merger Transaction), including any modifications, extensions or
renewals thereof that do not adversely affect the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries, considered as a single enterprise in any material respect as
compared to the kinds of transactions, arrangements or agreements in effect
on the Issue Date; 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

18

 



    



   | (8)| transactions with a Person that is an Affiliate of the Issuer
solely because the Issuer owns, directly or through a Subsidiary, an equity
interest in, or controls, such Person; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (9)| transactions with any joint venture or similar entity, which
joint venture or similar entity is an Affiliate of the Issuer solely because
an Affiliate of the Issuer is a general partner in such joint venture or
similar entity; _provided_ that Affiliates (all such Affiliates taken
together) of the Issuer (other than the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries) do not in the aggregate beneficially own or hold, directly or
indirectly, 10% or more of any class of voting interests in such joint venture
or similar entity; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (10)| (a) guarantees by the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries of performance of obligations of Unrestricted Subsidiaries in
the ordinary course of business, except for guarantees of Indebtedness in
respect of borrowed money, and (b) pledges by the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary of Capital Stock in Unrestricted Subsidiaries for the benefit of
lenders or other creditors of Unrestricted Subsidiaries; and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (11)| any transaction in which the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, delivers to the Trustee a letter from an
Independent Advisor stating that such transaction is fair to the Issuer or
such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or that such
transaction meets the requirements of the first paragraph of this covenant. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Limitation on Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries.

  



  

On the Issue Date, [all] of the Subsidiaries of the Issuer will be Restricted
Subsidiaries.7 The Issuer may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an
Unrestricted Subsidiary, _provided_ that (1) any Subsidiary of any already
existing Unrestricted Subsidiary shall be (and shall be deemed designated as)
an Unrestricted Subsidiary (without necessity for any designation), (2)
subject to the foregoing clause (1), any designation of an Unrestricted
Subsidiary (other than during any Fall-Away Period) shall be effective only
if the Investment deemed to be made in that Subsidiary is made in compliance
with the covenant described above under "--Limitation on Restricted
Payments." After a Subsidiary of the Issuer has been designated as an
Unrestricted Subsidiary, the Issuer may, if no Default or Event of Default
would arise therefrom, redesignate such Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a
Restricted Subsidiary.

  



  

After a Subsidiary of the Issuer has been designated as a Restricted
Subsidiary, the Issuer also may, if no Default or Event of Default would arise
therefrom, redesignate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted
Subsidiary if such redesignation is at that time permitted under "--
Limitation on Restricted Payments" above. Upon such permitted redesignation,
such former Restricted Subsidiary's Subsidiary Guarantee will be released.

  



  

Any such designation or redesignation (other than any deemed designation
referred to in clause (1) of the proviso to the first paragraph of this
covenant) of an Unrestricted Subsidiary shall be evidenced to the Trustee by
the filing with the Trustee of an officers' certificate certifying that
such designation or redesignation complied with the foregoing conditions and
setting forth in reasonable detail the underlying calculations.

  



  

For purposes of the covenant described under "--Limitation on Restricted
Payments" above:

  



   | (1)| an "Investment" shall be deemed to have been made at the time any
Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in an
amount (proportionate to the Issuer's equity interest in such Subsidiary)
equal to the net worth of such Restricted Subsidiary at the time that such
Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary (" _net
worth_ " to be calculated based upon the Fair Market Value of the assets of
such Subsidiary as of any such date of designation as such Fair Market Value
is determined in good faith by the Issuer); and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (2)| any property transferred to or from an Unrestricted Subsidiary
shall be valued at its Fair Market Value at the time of such transfer as such
Fair Market Value is determined in good faith by the Issuer. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

  



  



  

7 NTD: to confirm based on post-transaction structure.

  



  

   

19

 



    



  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer may not designate any Subsidiary of
the Issuer to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary (other than during any Fall-Away
Period) if, after such designation or redesignation:

  



   | (1)| the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary: 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (a)| provides credit support for, or a guarantee of, any Indebtedness
of such Subsidiary (including any undertaking, agreement or instrument
evidencing such Indebtedness); or 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| is otherwise directly or indirectly liable for any Indebtedness
of such Subsidiary; or 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (2)| such Subsidiary owns any Capital Stock of, or owns or holds any
Lien on any property of, any Restricted Subsidiary which (a) is not a
Subsidiary of the Subsidiary to be so designated and (b) is not also then
being designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

During any Fall-Away Period, a Restricted Subsidiary may be redesignated an
Unrestricted Subsidiary only if such Restricted Subsidiary does not own, at
that time, Restricted Property, unless such Restricted Subsidiary
constitutes, at the time of redesignation, less than 15 % of the Issuer's
Adjusted Consolidated Net Tangible Assets.

  



  

Subsidiary Guarantors

  



  

If, after the Issue Date, the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
acquires or creates another Restricted Subsidiary that guarantees Indebtedness
of the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor under a Credit Facility, then, in
either case, that Subsidiary will become a Subsidiary Guarantor by executing
a supplemental indenture and delivering an officers' certificate and an
opinion of counsel to the Trustee within 30 days after the date that
Subsidiary was acquired or created or on which it guaranteed such
Indebtedness.

  



  

Reports to Holders

  



  

The Indenture will provide that, whether or not required by the rules and
regulations of the Commission, so long as any Notes are outstanding, the
Issuer will file with the Commission for public availability (or furnish to
the Holders and securities analysts and prospective investors (upon request):

  



   | (1)| all quarterly and annual financial information that would be
required to be contained in a filing with the Commission on Forms 10-Q and
10-K if the Issuer were required to file such Forms, including a "Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"
that describes the financial condition and results of operations of the
Issuer and its consolidated Subsidiaries and, with respect to the annual
information only, a report thereon by the Issuer's certified independent
accountants; and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (2)| all current reports that would be required to be filed with the
Commission on Form 8-K if the Issuer were required to file such reports, in
each case within the time periods specified in the Commission's rules and
regulations. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

In the event that any direct or indirect parent company of the Issuer becomes
a guarantor of the Notes, the Issuer may satisfy its obligations under this
covenant by furnishing financial information relating to such parent;
_provided_ that (a) such financial statements are accompanied by
consolidating financial information for such parent, the Issuer, the
Subsidiary Guarantors and the Subsidiaries of the Issuer that are not
Subsidiary Guarantors in the manner prescribed by the Commission and (b) such
parent is not engaged in any business in any material respect other than
incidental to its ownership, directly or indirectly, of the Capital Stock of
the Issuer.

  



  

The Issuer will be deemed to have furnished to the Holders and to securities
analysts and prospective investors the reports or information referred to in
clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant or the information
referred to in the second paragraph of this covenant if the Issuer has posted
such reports or information on the Issuer Website with access to current and
prospective investors. For purposes of this covenant, the term "Issuer
Website" means the collection of web pages that may be accessed on the World
Wide Web using the URL address _http://www.bonanzacrk.com_ or such other
address as the Issuer may from time to time designate in writing to the
Trustee. Information on such website shall not be deemed incorporated by
reference into this prospectus.

  



  

   

20

 



    



  

This covenant will not impose any duty on the Issuer under the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 and the related Commission rules that would not otherwise be
applicable.

  



  

No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers and Employees

  



  

No director, officer, employee, incorporator, partner, member or stockholder
of the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor, as such, shall have any liability
for any of the Issuer's or any Subsidiary Guarantor's obligations under the
Notes or the Indenture or any Subsidiary Guaranty or any claim based on, in
respect of, by reason of, these obligations or their creation. Each Holder, by
accepting a Note, waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and
release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. The waiver
may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws
and it is the view of the Commission that such a waiver is against
public policy.

  



  

Events of Default

  



  

The following events will be defined in the Indenture as " _Events of
Default_ ":

  



   | (1)| the failure to pay interest on any Notes when the same becomes
due and payable and the failure continues for a period of 30 days; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (2)| the failure by the Issuer to (a) pay the principal on any Notes,
when such principal becomes due and payable, at maturity, upon redemption or
otherwise, or (b) consummate a purchase of Notes when required pursuant to the
covenants described above under (i) "--Change of Control" and (ii) "--Certain
Covenants--Limitation on Asset Sales," which failure, solely in the case of
clause (b)(i), continues for a period of 30 days or, solely in the case of
clause (b)(ii), continues for a period of 30 days after the Issuer receives
written notice specifying the default (and demanding that such default be
remedied) from the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% of the outstanding
principal amount of the Notes (including any Additional Notes); 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (3)| the failure to comply with any other covenant contained in the
Indenture and described above under the caption "--Certain Covenants," which
failure continues for a period of 30 days after the Issuer receives written
notice specifying the default (and demanding that such default be remedied)
from the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% of the outstanding principal
amount of the Notes (including any Additional Notes) (except in the case of a
failure to comply with any of the terms or provisions of (i) the first
paragraph of "--Certain Covenants--Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets"
which will constitute an Event of Default with such notice requirement but
without such passage of time requirement or (ii) "--Certain Covenants--
Reports to Holders," which will constitute an Event of Default only after a
period of 90 days after such notice); 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (4)| the failure of the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor to comply
with its other agreements contained in the Indenture for 60 days after the
Issuer receives written notice from the Trustee or the Holders of 25% in
principal amount of the outstanding Notes (including any Additional Notes)
specifying the failure (and demanding that such failure be remedied); 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (5)| a default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which
there is issued or by which there is secured or evidenced any Indebtedness of
the Issuer or of any Restricted Subsidiary (or the payment of which is
guaranteed by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary), whether such
Indebtedness exists on the Issue Date or is created thereafter, which default
(i) is caused by a failure to pay principal of or premium, if any, or
interest on such Indebtedness after any applicable grace period provided in
such Indebtedness on the date of such default (a " _payment default_ ") or
(ii) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its express
maturity and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness,
together with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which
there has been a payment default or the maturity of which has been so
accelerated, aggregates at least $50.0 million; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (6)| one  or more judgments for the payment of money in an aggregate
amount in excess of $50.0  million (unless covered by insurance by a
reputable insurer as to which the insurer has  not disclaimed coverage) shall
have been rendered against the Issuer or any of its Restricted  Subsidiaries
and such judgment(s) remain undischarged, unpaid or unstayed for a period  of
60 days after such judgment or judgments become final and non-appealable; 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

21

 



    



     | (7)| certain events of bankruptcy affecting the Issuer or any of
its Significant Subsidiaries; or 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (8)| any of the Subsidiary Guarantees cease to be in full force and
effect or any of the Subsidiary Guarantees are declared to be null and void
or invalid and unenforceable or any of the Subsidiary Guarantors denies or
disaffirms its liability under its Subsidiary Guarantees (in each case other
than in accordance with the terms of the Indenture). 
---|---|--- 
  



  

The Indenture will provide that, if an Event of Default (other than an Event
of Default specified in clause (7) above relating to the Issuer) shall occur
and be continuing, the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of
outstanding Notes (including any Additional Notes) may, or the Trustee
may, in the event that the Trustee is deemed to have notice of such Event of
Default, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, on all the Notes to be due and payable by notice in writing
to the Issuer and the Trustee specifying the Event of Default and that it is
a "notice of acceleration," and the same shall become immediately due and
payable. If an Event of Default specified in clause (7) above relating to the
Issuer occurs and is continuing, then all unpaid principal of, and premium,
if any, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all of the outstanding
Notes shall _ipso facto_  become and be immediately due and payable without
any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder. The
effect of such provision may be limited by applicable law. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if an Event of Default specified in clause (5) above shall
have occurred and be continuing, such Event of Default and any acceleration
resulting therefrom shall be automatically rescinded if (i) the Indebtedness
that is the subject of such Event of Default has been repaid, or (ii) the
default relating to such Indebtedness has been waived or cured and, if such
Indebtedness has been accelerated, the holders thereof have rescinded
their declaration of acceleration in respect of such Indebtedness.

  



  

The Indenture will provide that, at any time after a declaration of
acceleration with respect to the Notes as described in the preceding
paragraph, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes
(including any Additional Notes) may rescind and cancel such declaration and
its consequences:

  



   | (1)| if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (2)| if all existing Events of Default have been cured or waived
except nonpayment of principal or interest that has become due solely because
of such acceleration; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (3)| to the extent the payment of such interest is lawful, interest on
overdue installments of interest and overdue principal, which has become due
otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration, has been paid; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (4)| if the Issuer has paid the Trustee its reasonable compensation
and reimbursed the Trustee for its expenses, disbursements and advances; and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (5)| in the event of the cure or waiver of an Event of Default of the
type described in clause (7) of the description of Events of Default above,
the Trustee shall have received an officers' certificate that such Event of
Default has been cured or waived;  _provided_ , _however_ , that such counsel
may rely, as to matters of fact, on a certificate or certificates of
officers of the Issuer. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

No such rescission shall affect any subsequent Default or impair any right
consequent thereto.

  



  

The Indenture will provide that, at any time prior to the declaration of
acceleration of the Notes, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of
the Notes (including any Additional Notes) may waive (including by any
waivers obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender or exchange
offer for, Notes) any existing Default or Event of Default under the
Indenture, and its consequences, except a default in the payment of the
principal of or interest on any Notes.

  



  

The Indenture will provide that Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the
Notes except as provided in the Indenture and under the TIA. During
the existence of an Event of Default, the Trustee is required to exercise
such rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture and use the same
degree of care and skill in its exercise thereof as a prudent man would
exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs.
Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of
the Trustee, whether or not an Event of Default shall occur and be
continuing, the Trustee is under no obligation to exercise any of its rights
or powers under the Indenture at the request, order or direction of any of the
Holders, unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee reasonable
indemnity. Subject to all provisions of the Indenture and applicable law, the
Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding
Notes (including any Additional Notes) have the right to direct the time,
method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the
Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The
Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law
or the Indenture or that the Trustee reasonably determines is unduly
prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would in the opinion of
its counsel involve the Trustee in personal liability.

  



  

   

22

 



    



  

The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement
regarding compliance with the Indenture. Upon becoming aware of any Default or
Event of Default, the Issuer is required within ten Business Days to deliver
to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default or Event of
Default, unless such Default or Event of Default has been cured before the
end of the ten-Business Day period.

  



  

Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance

  



  

The Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have its obligations
and the corresponding obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors discharged with
respect to the outstanding Notes (" _Legal Defeasance_ ").

  



  

Such Legal Defeasance means that the Issuer shall be deemed to have paid and
discharged the entire indebtedness represented by the outstanding Notes, and
satisfied all of its obligations with respect to the Notes, except for:

  



   | (1)| the rights of Holders to receive payments in respect of the
principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes when such payments
are due; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (2)| the Issuer's obligations with respect to the Notes concerning
issuing temporary Notes, registration of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or
stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payments; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (3)| the rights, powers, trust, duties and immunities of the Trustee
and the Issuer's obligations in connection therewith; and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (4)| the Legal Defeasance provisions of the Indenture. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

In addition, the Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to
terminate its obligations under "--Change of Control" and under all of the
covenants that are described in the "--Certain Covenants" (other than the
covenant described in the first paragraph under  "--Merger, Consolidation and
Sale of Assets," except to the extent described below) and the operation of
clause (2)(b), clauses (3) through (6) and clause (8) under "--Events of
Default" and the limitations described in clause (2) of the first paragraph
under the covenant "--Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets" and thereafter
any omission to comply with such obligations shall not constitute a Default
or Event of Default with respect to the Notes (" _Covenant Defeasance_ "). In
the event of Legal Defeasance, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated
because of an Event of Default with respect thereto. In the event Covenant
Defeasance occurs, certain events (other than nonpayment, bankruptcy,
receivership, reorganization and insolvency events) described under "--Events
of Default" will no longer constitute an Event of Default with respect to the
Notes. If the Issuer exercises either its Legal Defeasance or Covenant
Defeasance option, each Subsidiary Guarantor will be released and relieved of
any obligations under its Subsidiary Guarantee.

  



  

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:

  



   | (1)| the Issuer must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, in trust,
for the benefit of the Holders cash in United States dollars, non-callable
United States government obligations, or a combination thereof, in such
amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized
investment bank, appraisal firm or firm of independent public accountants, to
pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes on the
stated date for payment thereof or on the applicable redemption date, as
the case may be; 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

23

 



    



   | (2)| in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuer shall have delivered
to the Trustee an opinion of counsel in the United States reasonably
acceptable to the Trustee confirming that: 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (a)| the Issuer has received from, or there has been published by, the
Internal Revenue Service a ruling; or 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| since the date of the Indenture, there has been a change in the
applicable federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and
based thereon such opinion of counsel shall confirm that, the Holders will not
recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of
such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on the same
amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case
if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (3)| in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuer shall have
delivered to the Trustee an opinion of counsel in the United
States reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that the Holders will
not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a
result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax
on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have
been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (4)| no Default or Event of Default, of which the Trustee is deemed to
have notice, shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such
deposit (other than a Default or Event of Default resulting from the
incurrence of Indebtedness or other borrowing of funds, or the grant of Liens
securing such Indebtedness or other borrowing, all or a portion of which are
to be applied to such deposit); 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (5)| such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in
a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under the Indenture (other
than a Default or Event of Default resulting from the incurrence of
Indebtedness or other borrowing of funds, or the grant of Liens securing such
Indebtedness or other borrowing, all or a portion of which are to be applied
to such deposit) or any other Indebtedness incurred under clause (2) of the
definition of "Permitted Indebtedness"; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (6)| the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an officers'
certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the
intent of preferring the Holders over any other creditors of the Issuer or
with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding any other
creditors of the Issuer or others; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (7)| the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an officers'
certificate stating that all conditions precedent relating to such Legal
Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance, as applicable, have been complied with; and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (8)| the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an opinion of
counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to customary assumptions,
qualifications and exclusions), stating that all conditions precedent relating
to such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance, as applicable, have been
complied with; _provided_ , _however_ , that such counsel may rely, as to
matters of fact, on a certificate or certificates of officers of the Issuer. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Satisfaction and Discharge

  



  

The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect
(except as to surviving rights of registration of transfer or exchange of the
Notes, as expressly provided for in the Indenture) as to all outstanding
Notes when:

  



   | (1)| either:  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (a)| all the Notes theretofore authenticated and delivered (except
lost, stolen or destroyed Notes which have been replaced or paid and Notes
for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust or segregated
and held in trust by the Issuer and thereafter repaid to the Issuer or
discharged from such trust) have been delivered to the Trustee for
cancellation; or 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| all Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for
cancellation have become due and payable or will become due and
payable within one year by reason of the mailing of a notice of redemption or
otherwise and the Issuer has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited
with the Trustee funds (constituting cash in U.S. dollars, non-callable Cash
Equivalents within the meaning of clauses (1) or (2) of the definition
thereof or a combination of cash in U.S. dollars and such non-callable Cash

---|---|--- 
  



  

Modification of the Indenture

  



  

From time to time, the Issuer, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee,
without the consent of the Holders, may amend the Indenture for certain
specified purposes, including curing ambiguities, defects or inconsistencies,
to comply with any requirements of the Commission in order to effect or
maintain the qualification of the Indenture under the TIA, to make any change
that would provide any additional benefit or rights to the Holders or that
does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder, to conform the Indenture
to the Description of the Notes herein or to, in certain circumstances,
comply with the Indenture. In formulating its opinion on such matters, the
Trustee will be entitled to rely on such evidence as it deems appropriate,
including, without limitation, solely on an opinion of counsel; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that in delivering such opinion of counsel, such counsel may rely,
as to matters of fact, on a certificate or certificates of officers of the
Issuer.

  



  

Other modifications and amendments of the Indenture may be made with the
consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes (including any Additional Notes) issued under the Indenture
(including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender or
exchange offer for, Notes), except that, without the consent of each Holder
affected thereby, no amendment may (with respect to Notes held by any non-
consenting Holder):

  



   | (1)| reduce the amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an
amendment; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (2)| reduce the rate of or change or have the effect of changing the
time for payment of interest, including defaulted interest and Special
Interest, on any Notes; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (3)| reduce the principal of or change or have the effect of changing
the fixed maturity of any Notes; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (4)| reduce the amount payable upon the redemption of any Note or
change the time at which any Note may be redeemed as described under "--
Optional Redemption" above; _provided_ , _however_ , that solely for the
avoidance of doubt and without any other implication, redemption shall not be
deemed to include any purchase or repurchase of Notes including as
described above under the captions "--Change of Control" and "--Certain
Covenants--Limitation on Asset Sales"; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (5)| make any Notes payable in money other than that stated in the
Notes; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (6)| make any change in provisions of the Indenture protecting the
right of each Holder to receive payment of principal of and interest on such
Note on or after the due date thereof or to bring suit to enforce such
payment, or permitting Holders of a majority in principal amount of Notes to
waive Defaults or Events of Default in the payment of principal of, premium,
if any, or interest on, the Notes (except (i) a payment required by one of
the covenants described above under the captions "--Change of Control" and "
--Certain Covenants--Limitation on Asset Sales" or (ii) a rescission of
acceleration of the Notes by the holders of a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the then outstanding Notes and a waiver of the payment default
that resulted from such acceleration);

25

 



    



   | (7)| modify or change any provision of the Indenture or the related
definitions affecting the ranking in right of payment of the Notes or any
Subsidiary Guarantee as senior unsecured indebtedness of the Issuer or the
relevant Subsidiary Guarantors, as the case may be, in a manner which
adversely affects the Holders; or 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (8)| release any Subsidiary Guarantor from any of its obligations
under its Subsidiary Guarantee or the Indenture otherwise than in accordance
with the terms of the Indenture. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

The Holders of a majority of the principal amount of the Notes (including any
Additional Notes) then outstanding (including waivers obtained in connection
with a purchase of, or tender or exchange offer for, Notes) may waive
compliance with certain restrictive covenants and provisions of the
Indenture, except in the case of the matters specified in the first paragraph
under this caption "Modification of the Indenture."

  



  

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve
the particular form of any proposed amendment, supplement or waiver. It is
sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment,
supplement or waiver. After an amendment, supplement or waiver under the
Indenture becomes effective, the Issuer is required to mail to the Holders a
notice briefly describing the amendment, supplement or waiver. However, the
failure to give such notice, or any defect in the notice, will not impair or
affect the validity of the amendment, supplement or waiver.

  



  

Governing Law

  



  

The Indenture and the Notes will be governed by, and construed in accordance
with, the laws of the State of New York.

  



  

The Trustee

  



  

The Indenture will provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of
Default, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are specifically set
forth in the Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default, the
Trustee will exercise such rights and powers vested in it by the Indenture,
and use the same degree of care and skill in its exercise thereof as a
prudent man would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of
his own affairs. A successor Trustee may be appointed in accordance with the
terms of the Indenture.

  



  

The Indenture and the provisions of the TIA contain certain limitations on
the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor of the Issuer or a
Subsidiary Guarantor, to obtain payments of claims in certain cases or to
realize on certain property received in respect of any such claim as
security or otherwise. Subject to the TIA, the Trustee will be permitted to
engage in other transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Trustee
acquires any conflicting interest as described in the TIA, it must eliminate
such conflict or resign.

  



  

Book-Entry, Delivery and Form

  



  

We will issue the Notes in the form of global notes (the " _Global Notes_ ").
The Global Notes will be deposited with, or on behalf of, The
Depository Trust Company, or DTC, and registered in the name of the DTC or
its nominee. Except as set forth below, the Global Notes may be transferred,
in whole and not in part, and only to DTC or another nominee of DTC. You may
hold your beneficial interests in the Global Notes directly through DTC if
you have an account with DTC or indirectly through organizations that have
accounts with DTC.

  



  

DTC has advised us that it is:

  



   | *| a limited purpose trust company organized under the laws of the
State of New York; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | *| a "banking organization" within the meaning of the New York State
Banking Law; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | *| a member of the Federal Reserve System; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | *| a "clearing corporation" within the meaning of the Uniform
Commercial Code; and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | *| a "clearing agency" registered under Section 17A of the Exchange
Act. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

26

 



    



  

DTC was created to hold securities for its participants and to facilitate the
clearance and settlement of securities transactions between its participants
through electronic book-entry changes to the accounts of its participants.
DTC's participants include securities brokers and dealers, including the
initial purchasers; banks and trust companies; clearing corporations and other
organizations. Indirect access to DTC's system is also available to others
such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies; these indirect
participants clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a DTC
participant, either directly or indirectly. Investors who are not DTC
participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only
through DTC participants or indirect participants in DTC.

  



  

So long as DTC's nominee is the registered owner of the Global Notes, that
nominee will be considered the sole owner or holder of the Notes represented
by the Global Notes for all purposes under the Indentures. Except as provided
below under " _-- Certificated Notes_," owners of beneficial interests in a
Global Note:

  



   | *| will not be entitled to have Notes represented by the Global Note
registered in their names; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | *| will not receive or be entitled to receive physical, certificated
Notes; and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | *| will not be considered the owners or holders of the Notes under the
Indentures for any purpose, including with respect to the giving of any
direction, instruction or approval to the trustee under the Indentures. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

As a result, each investor who owns a beneficial interest in a Global Note
must rely on the procedures of DTC to exercise any rights of a holder of Notes
under the Indentures (and, if the investor is not a participant or an
indirect participant in DTC, on the procedures of the DTC participant through
which the investor owns its interest). Payments of principal, premium (if
any) and interest with respect to the Notes represented by a Global Note will
be made by the trustee to DTC's nominee as the registered holder of the Global
Note. We understand that under existing industry practice, in the event an
owner of a beneficial interest in a Global Note desires to take any action
that the DTC, as the holder of the Global Note, is entitled to take, the DTC
would authorize the participants to take such action, and the participants
would authorize beneficial owners owning through such participants to take
such action or would otherwise act upon the instructions of beneficial owners
owning through them.

  



  

We will make payments of principal of, premium, if any, and interest on Notes
represented by the Global Notes registered in the name of and held by the DTC
or its nominee to the DTC or its nominee, as the case may be, as the
registered owner and holder of the Global Notes. We expect that the DTC
or its nominee, upon receipt of any payment of principal of, premium, if any,
or interest on the Global Notes will credit participants' accounts with
payments in amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in
the principal amount of the Global Notes as shown on the records of the DTC
or its nominee. We also expect that payments by participants or indirect
participants to owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes held
through such participants or indirect participants will be governed by
standing instructions and customary practices and will be the responsibility
of such participants or indirect participants. We will not have any
responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to, or
payments made on account of, beneficial ownership interests in the Global
Notes for any Note or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records
relating to such beneficial ownership interests or for any other aspect of
the relationship between the DTC and its participants or indirect
participants or the relationship between such participants or indirect
participants and the owners of beneficial interests in the Global
Notes owning through such participants. Transfers between participants in DTC
will be effected under DTC's procedures and will be settled in same-day
funds.

  



  

Although the DTC has agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to
facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants of
the DTC, it is under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such
procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued at any time. Neither the
Trustee nor the Issuer will have any responsibility or liability for the
performance by the DTC or its participants or indirect participants of their
respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their
operations or otherwise.

estimated by independent appraisers, of such other tangible assets of the
Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries ( _provided _ that the Issuer may rely

discretion) such item of Indebtedness or Preferred Stock in any manner
(including by dividing and classifying such item of Indebtedness or
Preferred Stock in more than one type of Indebtedness or Preferred Stock
permitted under such covenant) that complies with that covenant. Indebtedness
or Preferred Stock permitted by such covenant need not be permitted solely by
reference to one provision permitting such Indebtedness or Preferred Stock
but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more
other provisions permitting such Indebtedness or Preferred Stock. The dollar
equivalent principal amount of any Indebtedness denominated in a foreign

exchange rate in effect on the date that such Indebtedness was incurred, in
the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed, in the case of revolving
credit Indebtedness; _provided_ that if such Indebtedness is incurred to
Refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such
Refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. dollar-denominated restriction to
be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on
the date of such Refinancing, such U.S. dollar-denominated restriction shall
be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such
Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of
such Indebtedness being Refinanced (plus the amount of any premium required
to be paid under the terms of the instrument governing such Indebtedness
being Refinanced and plus the amount of reasonable fees and expenses incurred
by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with such
Refinancing). Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant,
the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer and the Restricted
Subsidiaries may incur under such covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded
solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rates of currencies. The
principal amount of any Indebtedness incurred to Refinance other
Indebtedness, if incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness
being Refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate
applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is
denominated that is in effect on the date of such Refinancing.

number of Registrable Securities requested to be included in such Shelf
Underwritten Offering by any other Persons having registration rights with

offering, then the Company shall include in the applicable

the number of shares of Common Stock each requested to be included.

effecting a Shelf Underwritten Offering, (ii) suspend the Holder's use of any

Registration Statement but may settle any then-contracted sales of
Registrable Securities), or (iii) delay a Block Trade, in each case for a
period of up to 60 consecutive days, if the Board determines (A) that such
delay or suspension is in the best interest of the Company and its
stockholders generally due to a pending financing or other transaction
involving the Company, including a proposed sale of Common Stock pursuant to a
Registration Statement, (B) that such registration or offering would render
the Company unable to comply with applicable securities Laws or (C) that such
registration or offering would require disclosure of material information

Underwritten Offering_ "), it will give written notice of such Piggyback
Underwritten Offering to the Holder, which notice shall be held in
strict confidence by the Holder and shall include the anticipated filing date
of the Underwritten Offering Filing and, if known, the number of shares of
Common Stock that are proposed to be included in such Piggyback Underwritten
Offering, and of such Holder's rights under this _Section 2.5(a)_. Such
notice shall be given promptly (and in any event at least five Business Days
before the filing of the Underwritten Offering Filing or two Business Days
before the filing of the Underwritten Offering Filing in connection with a
bought or overnight Underwritten Offering); _provided_ , that if
the Piggyback Underwritten Offering is a bought or overnight Underwritten
Offering and the Managing Underwriter advises the Company that the giving of
notice pursuant to this _Section 2.5(a)_ would adversely affect the offering,
no such notice shall be required (and the Holder shall have no right to
include Registrable Securities in such bought or overnight Underwritten
Offering). If such notice is delivered pursuant to this _Section 2.5(a)_ , the
Holder shall then have four Business Days (or one Business Day in the case of
a bought or overnight Underwritten Offering) after the date on which

inclusion of Registrable Securities in the Piggyback Underwritten Offering
(which request shall specify the maximum number of Registrable Securities
intended to be disposed of by the Holder and such other information as is

Underwritten Offering. Subject to _Section 2.5(c)_ , the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to include in the Piggyback Underwritten
Offering all Registrable Securities that the Company has been so requested to
include by the Holder; _provided, however_ , that if, at any time after giving
written notice of a proposed Piggyback Underwritten Offering pursuant to this
_Section 2.5(a)_ and prior to the execution of an underwriting agreement with
respect thereto, the Company or such other Persons who have or have been
granted registration rights, as applicable, shall determine for any reason
not to proceed with or to delay such Piggyback Underwritten Offering, the
Company shall give written notice of such determination to the Holder (which
the Holder will hold in strict confidence) and (i) in the case of a
determination not to proceed, shall be relieved of its obligation to include
any Registrable Securities in such Piggyback Underwritten Offering (but not
from any obligation of the Company to pay the Registration Expenses in
connection therewith), and (ii) in the case of a determination to delay,
shall be permitted to delay inclusion of any Registrable Securities for the
same period as the delay in including the shares of Common Stock to be sold
for the Company's account or for the account of such other Persons who have
or have been granted registration rights, as applicable.

withdraw. The Holder may deliver written notice (an " _Opt-Out Notice_ ") to
the Company requesting that the Holder not receive notice from the Company of
any proposed Piggyback Underwritten Offering; _provided, however_ , that the

entitled to participate in any Piggyback Underwritten Offering.

Offering shall inform the Company of its belief that the number of
Registrable Securities requested to be included in such Piggyback Underwritten
Offering, when added to the number of shares of Common Stock proposed to be
offered by the Company or such other Persons who have or have been granted
registration rights (and any other shares of Common Stock requested to be
included by any other Persons having registration rights on parity with
the Holder with respect to such offering), would materially adversely affect
such offering, then the Company shall include in such Piggyback Underwritten
Offering, to the extent of the total number of securities which the Company is
so advised can be sold in such offering without so materially adversely
affecting such offering (the " _Section 2.5 Maximum Number of Shares_ "),
shares of Common Stock in the following priority:

  



  

(i)  First, (A) if the Piggyback Underwritten Offering is for
the account of the Company, all shares of Common Stock that the Company
proposes to include for its own account (the " _Company Securities_ ") or,
(B) if the Piggyback Underwritten Offering is for the account of any other
Persons who have or have been granted registration rights, all shares of
Common Stock that such Persons propose to include (the " _Other Securities_
"); and

the account of the Company, to the extent that the number of
Company Securities is less than the Section 2.5 Maximum Number of Shares, the

any other shares of Common Stock requested to be included by Persons having
rights of registration on parity with the Holder with respect to such
offering, _pro rata_ among the Holder and such other holders based on

earnings statement, which earnings statement shall satisfy the provisions of
Section 11(a) of the Securities Act;

  



  

(vii)  provide and cause to be maintained a transfer agent and

expense) all copies, other than permanent file copies, then in the

indemnify and hold harmless the Holder, its officers and directors and each
Person (if any) that controls the Holder within the meaning of either Section
15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act from and against
any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs (including reasonable
costs of preparation and reasonable attorneys' fees and any legal or other
fees or expenses incurred by such Person in connection with any investigation
or Proceeding), expenses, judgments, fines, penalties, charges and amounts
paid in settlement (" _Losses_ ") as incurred, caused by, arising out of or
based upon, resulting from or related to any untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement
or prospectus relating to the Registrable Securities (as amended
or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or
supplements thereto) or any preliminary prospectus, or based on any omission
or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading (in the
case of any prospectus, in the light of the circumstances under which such
statement is made), _provided_ ,  _however_ , that such indemnity shall not
apply to that portion of such Losses caused by, or arising out of, any untrue
statement, or alleged untrue statement or any such omission or alleged
omission, to the extent such statement or omission was made in reliance upon
and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by or
on behalf of the Holder expressly for use therein.

  



  

Section 3.2 _Indemnification by the Holder_. The Holder agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its officers and directors and each
Person (if any) that controls the Company within the meaning of either
Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act from and
against any and all Losses caused by, arising out of, resulting from or
related to any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material
fact contained in any Registration Statement or prospectus relating to
Registrable Securities (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have
furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) or any preliminary
prospectus, or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading (in the case of any prospectus, in the
light of the circumstances under which such statement is made), only to the
extent such statement or omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity
with information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the Holder expressly
for use in such Registration Statement or prospectus relating to the
Registrable Securities, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any
preliminary prospectus.

  



  



   

13

 



 



  

Section 3.3 _Indemnification Procedures_. In case any Proceeding
(including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any
Person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to _Section 3.1_
or _Section 3.2_ , such Person (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall promptly
notify the Person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing (provided that the failure of the
Indemnified Party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this _Article III_ , except to the
extent the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by such failure to give
notice), and the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in such
Proceeding and, unless in the reasonable opinion of outside counsel to the
Indemnified Party a conflict of interest between the Indemnified Party and
Indemnifying Party may exist in respect of such claim, to assume the defense
thereof jointly with any other Indemnifying Party similarly notified, to the
extent that it chooses, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such
Indemnified Party, and after notice from the Indemnifying Party to such
Indemnified Party that it so chooses, the Indemnifying Party shall not be
liable to such Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses subsequently
incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof
other than reasonable costs of investigation; _provided_ , _however_ , that
(i) if the Indemnifying Party fails to assume the defense or employ counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, (ii) if such Indemnified
Party who is a defendant in any action or Proceeding which is also brought
against the Indemnifying Party reasonably shall have concluded that there may
be one or more legal defenses available to such Indemnified Party which are
not available to the Indemnifying Party or (iii) if representation of both
parties by the same counsel is otherwise inappropriate under applicable
standards of professional conduct then, in any such case, the Indemnified
Party shall have the right to assume or continue its own defense as set forth
above (but with no more than one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties
in each jurisdiction, except to the extent any Indemnified Party or
Indemnified Parties reasonably shall have concluded that there may be legal
defenses available to such party or parties which are not available to the
other Indemnified Parties or to the extent representation of all Indemnified
Parties by the same counsel is otherwise inappropriate under applicable
standards of professional conduct) and the Indemnifying Party shall be
liable for any expenses therefor. No Indemnifying Party shall, without the
written consent of the Indemnified Party, effect the settlement or compromise
of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or
threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or
contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the Indemnified Party is
an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement,
compromise or judgment (A) includes an unconditional release of the
Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and
(B) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of,
fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any Indemnified
Party.

  



  

Section 3.4 _Contribution_.

  



  

(a)  If the indemnification provided for in this _Article III_
is unavailable to an Indemnified Party in respect of any Losses in respect of
which indemnity is to be provided hereunder, then each Indemnifying Party, in
lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party, shall to the fullest extent
permitted by Law contribute to the amount paid or payable by such
Indemnified Party as a result of such Losses in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative fault of such party in connection with
the statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses, as well as any other
relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Company (on the
one hand) and the Holder (on the other hand) shall be determined by reference
to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material
fact relates to information supplied by such party and the parties' relative
intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or
prevent such statement or omission.

  



  



   

14

 



 



  

(b)  The Company and the Holder agree that it would not be just
and equitable if contribution pursuant to this _Article III_ were determined
by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take
account of the equitable considerations referred to in _Section 3.4(a)_. The
amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Party as a result of the
losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in _Section 3.4(a)_ shall
be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal
or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection
with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the
provisions of this _Article III_ , the Holder shall not be liable for
indemnification or contribution pursuant to this _Article III_ for any amount
in excess of the net proceeds of the offering received by the Holder, less
the amount of any damages which the Holder has otherwise been required to pay
by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning
of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution
from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

  



  

Article IV 
 RULE 144

Securities without registration, the Company agrees to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to:

available, as those terms are understood and defined in Rule 144 under the
Securities Act, at all times from and after the date hereof;

other documents required of the Company under the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act at all times from and after the date hereof; and

  



  

(c)  so long as the Holder owns any Registrable Securities,
furnish (i) to the extent accurate, forthwith upon request, a written
statement of the Company that it has complied with the reporting requirements
of Rule 144 under the Securities Act and (ii) unless otherwise available via
the Commission's EDGAR filing system, to the Holder forthwith upon request a
copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the Company, and such
other reports and documents so filed as the Holder may reasonably request in
availing itself of any rule or regulation of the Commission allowing the
Holder to sell any such securities without registration.
