prior to the Effective Time, other than any Company Share that is subject to
any Company Award, shall automatically be canceled and converted into and
shall thereafter represent the right to receive an amount in cash equal to
$68.00, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). Subject to
_Section_ __ _ 3.05_, as of the Effective Time, all such Company Shares shall
no longer be issued and outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate that immediately prior
to the Effective Time evidenced any Company Shares (each, a " _Certificate_ ")
or uncertificated Company Shares represented by book-entry immediately prior
to the Effective Time (each, a " _Book-Entry Share_ ") shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pertaining to the Company Shares represented by such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, to be paid in consideration
therefor, in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.02(b)_ without interest.

 



17 (d) _Series A Preferred Shares_. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 3.05_,
each Series A Preferred Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding as a preferred share of the
Surviving Company and shall be entitled to the same dividend and all other
preferences and privileges, voting rights, relative, participating, optional
and other special rights, and qualifications, limitations and restrictions set
forth in the certificate of designations applicable to the Series A Preferred
Shares, which certificate of designations shall remain at and following the
Effective Time in full force and effect as an obligation of the Surviving
Company in accordance with Section 109(2) of the Bermuda Companies Act.

 

(e) _Series B Preferred Shares_. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 3.05_, each Series
B Preferred Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall remain issued and outstanding as a preferred share of the Surviving
Company and shall be entitled to the same dividend and all other preferences

special rights, and qualifications, limitations and restrictions set forth in
the certificate of designations applicable to the Series B Preferred Shares,
which certificate of designations shall remain at and following the Effective
Time in full force and effect as an obligation of the Surviving Company in
accordance with Section 109(2) of the Bermuda Companies Act.

 

Section 3.02 _Exchange Fund_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Not less than five (5) business days prior to the
anticipated Closing Date, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ")
for the payment and delivery of the aggregate Merger Consideration payable to
holders of Company Shares in accordance with this _Article III_ and, in
connection therewith, shall enter into an agreement with the Paying Agent
prior to the Closing Date in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company.
Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited
with the Paying Agent an amount in cash sufficient to pay the aggregate
Merger Consideration payable to holders of Company Shares (such cash, and the
cash referred to in the immediately following sentence, being hereinafter
referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). Pending its disbursement in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 3.02_, the Exchange Fund shall be
invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent in (i) short-term direct
obligations of the United States of America, (ii) short-term obligations for
which the full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to
provide for the payment of principal and interest, (iii) short-term commercial
paper rated the highest quality by either Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and Poors Ratings Services or (iv) certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital
exceeding $5,000,000,000. Any and all interest earned on the Exchange Fund
shall be paid by the Paying Agent to Parent. Parent shall or shall cause the
Surviving Company to promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund
so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level
sufficient for the Paying Agent to make all payments to former holders of
Company Shares of the Merger Consideration. No investment losses resulting
from investment of the funds deposited with the Paying Agent shall diminish
the rights of any former holder of Company Shares to receive the Merger
Consideration. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than
the payment to holders of Company Shares of the Merger Consideration
or payment to the Surviving Company as contemplated in _Section_ __ _
3.01(c)_.

 



18 (b) _Letter of Transmittal; Exchange of Company Shares_. As soon as
practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event later than three (3)
business days after the Effective Time), the Surviving Company or Parent shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate a
form of letter of transmittal (which shall be in such form and have such
other customary provisions as the Surviving Company may specify, subject to
the Companys reasonable approval (to be obtained prior to the Effective
Time)), together with instructions thereto, setting forth,  _inter alia_ ,
the procedures by which holders of Certificates may receive the Merger
Consideration. Upon the completion of such applicable procedures by a holder
and the surrender of such holders Certificates, and without any action
by any holder of record of Book-Entry Shares, the Paying Agent shall deliver
to such holder (other than any holder of Company Shares representing
Dissenting Shares), (A) in the case of Book-Entry Shares, a notice of the
effectiveness of the Merger and (B) cash in an amount equal to the number of
Company Shares represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares
immediately prior to the Effective Time _multiplied by_ the Merger
Consideration, and such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall forthwith be
canceled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person
other than the Person in whose name a Certificate surrendered is registered,
it shall be a condition of payment that (x) the Certificate so surrendered
shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer
and (y) the Person requesting such payment shall have established to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Company that any transfer and other
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder either has been paid or is not
applicable. Until satisfaction of the applicable procedures contemplated by
this  _Section_ __ _ 3.02_ and subject to _Section_ __ _ 3.05_, each
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable
with respect to Company Shares pursuant to this _Article III_.

(c)  _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by the Surviving Company, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Surviving
Company shall cause the Paying Agent to pay, in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. At any time following the two hundred
seventieth (270th) day after the Closing Date, the Surviving Company shall be
entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any portion of the
Exchange Fund (including any interest received with respect thereto) that had
been delivered to the Paying Agent and which has not been disbursed to former
holders of Company Shares, and thereafter such former holders shall be
entitled to look only to Parent and the Surviving Company for, and Parent and
the Surviving Company shall remain liable for, payment of their claims of the
Merger Consideration. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such
time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, the property of Parent or its designee, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



19 (e) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, none of the parties, the Surviving Company or the Paying Agent
shall be liable to any Person for Merger Consideration delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable state, federal or other abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

 

(f) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares_. The
Merger Consideration paid in respect of each Company Share in accordance with
the terms of this _Article III_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Shares previously
represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, subject, however, to 
_Section_ __ _ 3.05_. At the Effective Time, the share transfer books of the
Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration
of transfers on the share transfer books of the Surviving Company of
Company Shares that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Company
Shares formerly represented by Certificates or Book-Entry Shares immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to
such underlying Company Shares, except as otherwise provided for herein or by
applicable Law. Subject to the last sentence of _Section_ __ _ 3.02(d)_, if,
at any time after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are
presented to the Surviving Company for any reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this _Article III_.

 

(g) _Withholding Taxes_. Parent, the Surviving Company and the Paying Agent
(without duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement (including in respect of
Company Awards) such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or under any provision
of other applicable Tax Law. To the extent amounts are so withheld and paid
over to the appropriate Governmental Authority, the withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

Section 3.03 _Company Equity Awards_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any
duly-authorized committee thereof administering the Company Share Plans)
shall adopt such resolutions and take such other actions as may be required to
provide the following, effective upon the Effective Time, subject to _Section_
__ _ 3.02(g)_ and Section 3.03 of the Company Disclosure Letter:

(i) a Pro Rata Portion of each restricted Company Share granted under a
Company Share Plan that is subject solely to service-based vesting
requirements and not performance-based vesting requirements (a " _Company
Restricted Share_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall, to the extent not vested, become fully vested, and shall be
canceled and converted into the right to receive a lump-sum amount in cash,
without interest, equal to the sum of (i) the Merger Consideration and (ii)
any Per Share Accrued Dividends in respect of such Company Restricted Share,
and the Remaining Portion of each Company Restricted Share shall, immediately
prior to the Effective Time, automatically and without any required action on
the part of the holder thereof, cease to represent a Company Restricted Share
and, upon the Effective

 



20  Time, be assumed by Parent and automatically converted into a number of
restricted shares of Parent Common Stock (each, a " _Parent Restricted Share_
") equal to the product of (x) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio and (y) the
number of Company Shares represented by such Remaining Portion of each Company
Restricted Share (with the aggregate number of Parent Restricted Shares
subject to each such assumed Company Award rounded down to the nearest whole
number of shares). Following the Effective Time, each such Parent Restricted
Share shall continue to be governed by the same terms and conditions
(including vesting and any vesting acceleration terms) and any right to
receive Per Share Accrued Dividends in respect of such former Company
Restricted Share as were applicable to that Company Restricted Share
immediately prior to the Effective Time;

 

(ii) a Pro Rata Portion of each restricted Company Share granted under a
Company Share Plan that is subject to performance-based vesting requirements
(a " _Company Performance Share_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall, to the extent not vested, become fully vested, and
shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive a lump-sum amount
in cash, without interest, equal to the sum of (i) the Merger Consideration
and (ii) any Per Share Accrued Dividends in respect of such Company
Performance Share, and the Remaining Portion of each Company Performance
Share shall, immediately prior to the Effective Time, automatically and
without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to
represent a Company Performance Share and upon the Effective Time be assumed
by Parent and automatically converted into a number of Parent Restricted
Shares equal to the product of (x) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio and (y) the
number of Company Shares represented by such Remaining Portion of each
Company Performance Share (with the aggregate number of Parent Restricted
Shares subject to each such assumed Company Award rounded down to the nearest
whole number of shares); _provided_ that for purposes of determining
the number of Company Performance Shares (and the Pro Rata Portion and
Remaining Portion of each Company Performance Share) outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, (1) with respect to any Company Performance Share
with a performance period that has been completed, the number of shares shall
be determined based on the actual level of performance achieved, and (2) with
respect to any Company Performance Share with a performance period that has
not been completed, any applicable performance-based vesting requirements
shall be deemed to be achieved immediately prior to the Effective Time at
target payout levels. Following the Effective Time, each such resulting Parent
Restricted Share shall continue to be subject to the service-vesting
requirements as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, but will no
longer be subject to any further performance-based vesting requirements.
Except as specifically provided above, following the Effective Time,
each such Parent Restricted Share shall continue to be governed by the same
terms and conditions (including vesting and any vesting acceleration terms)
and any right to receive Per Share Accrued Dividends in respect of such former
Company Performance Share as were applicable to that Company Performance
Share immediately prior to the Effective Time; and

(iii) a Pro Rata Portion of each unvested restricted share unit award in
respect of Company Shares granted under a Company Share Plan (a " _Company RSU
Award_ "), all vested but unsettled Company RSU Awards, and all Company RSU
Awards granted 

 



21  to any director of the Company under the Directors Stock Compensation Plan
(each, a " _Director RSU Award_ "), that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall, to the extent not vested, become fully vested, and
shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive a lump-sum amount in
cash, without interest, equal to the Merger Consideration, and the
Remaining Portion of each Company RSU Award (other than any vested but
unsettled Company RSU Award or Director RSU Award) shall, immediately prior to
the Effective Time, automatically and without any required action on the part
of the holder thereof, cease to represent a Company RSU Award and upon the
Effective Time be assumed by Parent and automatically converted into a
restricted stock unit relating to shares of Parent Common Stock (each, a "
_Parent RSU Award_ ") entitling the holder to receive a number of shares of
Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of
Parent Common Stock) equal to the product of (x) the total number of Company
Shares subject to such Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective
Time multiplied by (y) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio. Following the
Effective Time, each such Parent RSU Award shall continue to be governed by
the same terms and conditions (including vesting and any vesting acceleration
terms) as were applicable to that Company RSU Award immediately prior to the
Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt, accelerated vesting under this
_Section_ __ _ 3.03(a)(iii)_ shall not be taken into account for purposes
of determining whether a Company RSU Award is "vested but unsettled" for
purposes of this Agreement.

(b) _Parent Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take
all actions necessary to reserve for issuance a number of shares of Parent
Common Stock in respect of each Parent Restricted Share or Parent RSU Award
granted pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 3.03_. If registration of any
Parent Common Stock issuable in respect of any Parent Restricted Shares or
Parent RSU Awards granted pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 3.03_ is required
under the Securities Act, effective as of the Effective Time, Parent shall
file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other
appropriate form), with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject
to such Parent Restricted Shares or Parent RSU Awards and shall maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and
maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained
therein) for so long as the relevant awards remain outstanding and such
registration of Parent Common Stock issuable thereunder continues to be
required.

 

Section 3.04 _Payments with Respect to Company Equity Awards_. Promptly after
the Effective Time (but in any event, no later than thirty (30) days
following the Effective Time), the Surviving Company shall pay to the holders
of Company Awards, through its payroll systems, any amounts due pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 3.03_ in respect of any then-vested Company Awards;
_provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent any such payment would cause an
impermissible acceleration event under Section 409A of the Code (" _Section_
__ _ 409A_"), such amounts will be paid at the earliest time such payment
would not cause an impermissible acceleration event under Section 409A.

 



22 Section 3.05 _Shares of Dissenting Holders_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares shall automatically be
canceled and, unless otherwise required by applicable Law, converted into the
right to receive, the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.01(c)_ with respect to Company Shares, the preferred shares of the Surviving
Company as described in _Section_ __ _ 3.01(d)_ with respect to Series A
Preferred Shares or the preferred shares of the Surviving Company as described
in _Section_ __ _ 3.01(e)_ with respect to Series B Preferred Shares, and any
holder of Dissenting Shares shall, in the event that the fair value of a
Dissenting Share as appraised by the Supreme Court of Bermuda under Section
106(6) of the Bermuda Companies Act (the " _Appraised Fair Value_ ") is
greater than, the Merger Consideration with respect to Company Shares, the
value of the preferred shares of the Surviving Company as described in
_Section_ __ _ 3.01(d)_ with respect to Series A Preferred Shares or the
value of the preferred shares of the Surviving Company, as described in 
_Section_ __ _ 3.01(e)_ with respect to Series B Preferred Shares, be
entitled to receive such difference from the Surviving Company by payment made
within thirty (30) days after such Appraised Fair Value is finally
determined pursuant to such appraisal procedure.

(b) In the event that a holder fails to perfect, effectively withdraws or
otherwise waives any right to appraisal (each, an " _Appraisal Withdrawal_
"), such holder shall have no other rights with respect to such Dissenting
Shares other than as contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 3.01_.

 

(c) The Company shall give Parent (i) written notice of (A) any demands for
appraisal of Dissenting Shares or Appraisal Withdrawals and any other written
instruments, notices, petitions or other communication received by the Company
in connection with the foregoing and (B) to the extent that the Company has
Knowledge thereof, any applications to the Supreme Court of Bermuda for
appraisal of the fair value of the Dissenting Shares and (ii) to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, the opportunity to participate with the Company
in any settlement negotiations and proceedings with respect to any demands
for appraisal under the Bermuda Companies Act. The Company shall not, without
the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect
to, offer to settle or settle any such demands or applications, or waive any
failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or to timely take
any other action to exercise appraisal rights in accordance with the Bermuda
Companies Act. Payment of any amount payable to holders of Dissenting Shares
shall be the obligation of the Surviving Company.

Section 3.06 _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding any provision of this _Article
III_ to the contrary, if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
Time the issued and outstanding Company Shares shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class by reason of the occurrence or
record date of any share dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination, exchange of shares or similar
transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to
reflect such share dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination, exchange of shares or similar
transaction.

and filing the Merger Application with the Registrar pursuant to the Bermuda

control or similar benefit or otherwise), (ii) cause the Company to transfer
or set aside any assets to fund any benefits under any Company Plan or (iii)
limit or restrict the right to amend, terminate or transfer the assets of any

rise to any payment (or acceleration of vesting) of any amounts of benefits
that will be an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G
of the Code. The Company and its Subsidiaries are not a party to, and are not
otherwise obligated under, any contract, agreement, plan or arrangement that
provides for the gross-up of a Tax, interest or penalties imposed by Section

doubt, all information provided to Parent pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _
6.02_ will be subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

be governed by clause (D)) that has not been withdrawn; _provided_ , that
Parent may make any such request only once in any ten (10) business day
period and only once for each such public Takeover Proposal and once for each
public material amendment to such Takeover Proposal (any prohibited action
described in this clause (x) being referred to as an " _Adverse

_Section_ __ _ 6.02(b)_ (each, a " _Company Acquisition Agreement_ ").
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, prior to the time the Company Shareholder Approval is obtained, the
Company Board may:

 

(i) in response to an Intervening Event, if the Company Board has determined
in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel,
that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, make an Adverse Recommendation Change;
and

 

(ii) in response to a Superior Proposal, if the Company Board has determined
in good faith, after consultation with the Companys financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (A) make an Adverse
Recommendation Change or (B) cause the Company to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.01(d)(ii)_, pay the Company Termination Fee and
enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal;

 

 _provided_ that the Company has given Parent at least four (4) business days
prior written notice (a " _Company Notice_ ") of its intention to make an
Adverse Recommendation Change or cause the Company to terminate the Agreement
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.01(d)(ii)_, which notice (I) in the case of an
Intervening Event, specifies the material changes, developments, effects,
circumstances, states of facts or events comprising such Intervening Event and
(II) in the case of a Superior Proposal, discloses (1) the material terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal and the identity of the Person or group
of Persons making such Superior Proposal and its or their financing sources,
if applicable, and (2) a copy of the most current version of the Company
Acquisition Agreement (if any) with respect to such Superior Proposal and any
agreement in the Companys possession relating to the financing of such
Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _further_ , that, (X) during such four (4)
business day period (it being understood and agreed that any change to
the financial or other material terms and conditions of a Superior Proposal
shall require an additional Company Notice to Parent of two (2) business days
running from the date of such notice), the Company shall have, and shall have
caused its Representatives to, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the
extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such commercially reasonable
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable
the 

 



57  Company Board to no longer make an Adverse Recommendation Change or a
determination that a Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (Y)
the Company Board shall have determined following the end of such four (4)
business day period (as it may be extended pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
6.02(d)_), after considering the results of such negotiations and the revised
proposals made by Parent, if any, after consultation with the Companys
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, (i) that the Superior Proposal
giving rise to such Company Notice continues to be a Superior Proposal or (ii)
that failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change in respect of the
applicable Intervening Event would be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 

(e) Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 6.02_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
prohibit the Company or the Company Board or any committee thereof from (i)
taking and disclosing to shareholders of the Company a position or
communication contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any
disclosure or communication to shareholders of the Company that the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, is required by the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law or otherwise by applicable Law;
_provided_ that, if any such public disclosure by the Company or the Company
Board contemplated by clause (i) or (ii) above relating to a Takeover Proposal
has the substantive effect of withdrawing, withholding or adversely modifying,
qualifying or amending the Company Board Recommendation or approving or
endorsing a Takeover Proposal and meets the requirements set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 6.02(d)_, such disclosure shall be deemed to be an Adverse
Recommendation Change unless the Company Board reaffirms the Company
Board Recommendation in such disclosure (it being understood that any "stop,
look or listen" communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) shall not, in and of
itself, be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change).

(f) As used in this _Section_ __ _ 6.02_, "group" has the meaning ascribed to
it in Rule 13d-5 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 6.03 _Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Shareholders Meeting_.

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution of this
Agreement, the Company (with the assistance and cooperation of Parent as
reasonably requested by the Company) shall prepare the Proxy Statement and
file it with the SEC. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.02_, the Company Board
shall make the Company Board Recommendation to the holders of Company Shares
and shall include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement. Parent shall
provide to the Company all information concerning Parent and Merger Sub as may
be reasonably requested by the Company in connection with the Proxy Statement
and shall otherwise assist and cooperate with the Company in the preparation
of the Proxy Statement and the resolution of any comments thereto received
from the SEC. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly
correct any information provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement if and
to the extent such information shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect. Each of the Company and Parent shall notify the other
promptly in writing after the receipt of any comments from the SEC and of any
request by the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for
additional information and shall supply the other with copies of all written
correspondence between such party or any of its Representatives, on the one
hand, and

 



58  the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement. Each of the
Company and Parent shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to
respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments received from
the SEC concerning the Proxy Statement and to resolve such comments with the
SEC, and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy
Statement to be disseminated to its shareholders as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the resolution of any such comments. Prior to the filing of
the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or any
dissemination thereof to the holders of Company Shares, or responding to any
comments from the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent
with a reasonable opportunity to review and to propose comments on such
document or response, which the Company shall consider in good faith.

 

(b) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.03(a)_, the Company shall take all necessary
actions, including in accordance with applicable Law, the Company
Organizational Documents and the rules of the New York Stock Exchange, to duly
call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders
(including any adjournment, recess, reconvening or postponement thereof,
the " _Company Shareholders Meeting_ ") for the purpose of obtaining approval
of the Company Bye-Law Amendment and the Company Shareholder Approval, as soon
as reasonably practicable after the SEC confirms that it has no further
comments on the Proxy Statement. The Company Bye-Law Amendment proposal shall
appear first on the proxy card in the Proxy Statement ahead of the proposals
to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval. Subject to  _Section_ __ _
6.02_, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain approval of
the Company Bye-Law Amendment and the Company Shareholder Approval, including
engaging a proxy solicitor reasonably acceptable to Parent to assist in the
solicitation of proxies from shareholders relating to the Company Bye-Law
Amendment and the Company Shareholder Approval. The Company
Shareholders Meeting and the record date therefor shall be set in
consultation with Parent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, the Company may (with Parents consent, such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) adjourn, recess, reconvene
or postpone the Company Shareholders Meeting if (x) the Company reasonably
believes that (i) such adjournment, recess, reconvening or postponement is
necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy
Statement is provided to the holders of Company Shares within a reasonable
amount of time in advance of the Company Shareholders Meeting, (ii) after
consultation with Parent, as of the time for which the Company Shareholders
Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement), (A)
there will be an insufficient number of Company Shares present (either in
person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business
of the Company Shareholders Meeting or (B) there will be an insufficient
number of proxies to obtain approval of the Company Bye-Law Amendment or the
Company Shareholder Approval or (iii) such adjournment, recess, reconvening
or postponement is required by Law or a court or other Governmental Authority
of competent jurisdiction in connection with any Actions in connection with
this Agreement or the Transactions or has been requested by the SEC or its
staff or (y) Parent requests such adjournment, recess, reconvention or
postponement. The Company shall keep Parent updated with reasonable frequency
with respect to proxy solicitation results.

 

(c) Notwithstanding any Adverse Recommendation Change, unless this Agreement
has been validly terminated in accordance with _Article VIII_ , (i) the
Company shall hold the Company Shareholders Meeting for the purpose of
obtaining approval of the Company Bye-Law Amendment and obtaining the Company
Shareholder Approval, and nothing contained herein

 



59  shall relieve the Company of such obligation and (ii) the Proxy Statement
and any and all accompanying materials may include appropriate disclosure with
respect to such Adverse Recommendation Change if and to the extent the
Company Board determines after consultation with outside legal counsel that
the failure to include such disclosure would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Laws or otherwise required by applicable
Law.

Section 6.04 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall, and shall cause their

advisable to fulfill all conditions to Closing applicable to such party

additional agreements, documents or instruments necessary, proper or advisable
to consummate the Transactions and to fully carry out the purposes of this
Agreement.

(b) Subject to  _Section_ __ _ 6.04(e)_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.04(f)_, each
party hereto shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use reasonable best
efforts to take any and all actions necessary to avoid each and every
impediment under any applicable Law that may be asserted by, or judgment,
decree and order that may be entered with, any Governmental Authority with
respect to this Agreement, the Merger or any other Transaction contemplated
hereby so as to enable the Closing to occur, in the most expeditious manner
reasonably practicable, including any of the following actions requested by
any Governmental Authority, or necessary, proper or advisable to (i) obtain
all Consents of Governmental Authorities necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the Transactions and secure the expiration or termination of any
applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, (ii) resolve any objections that
may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger or
any other transaction contemplated hereby and (iii) prevent the entry of, and
have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned, any judgment, decree or order of
Governmental Authorities that would prevent, prohibit, restrict or delay
the consummation of the Merger or any other Transaction contemplated hereby.

State of New Hampshire, within thirty (30) days after the date hereof, (ii)
Parent shall file an application with the Bermuda Monetary Authority within

days after the date hereof, (vii) Parent shall file any pre-acquisition
notifications on "Form E" or similar market share notifications to be filed
in each jurisdiction where required by applicable Insurance Laws within thirty
(30) days after the date hereof and (viii) Parent or the Company, as

registrations, filings and notices within sixty (60) days after the date
hereof. All filing fees payable in connection with the foregoing shall be
borne by Parent.

 

(d) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall consult with one another
with respect to the obtaining of all Consents of Governmental Authorities
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Transactions and each of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall keep the others reasonably apprised on a
prompt basis of the status of matters relating to such Consents. Parent and
the Company shall have the right to review in advance and, to the extent
practicable, and subject to any restrictions under applicable Law, each shall
consult the other on, any filing made with, or written materials submitted to,
any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions and each party
agrees to in good faith consider and reasonably accept comments of the other
parties thereon. Parent and the Company shall promptly furnish to each other
copies of all such filings and written materials after their filing or
submission, in each case subject to applicable Laws. Parent and the Company
shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any communication from any
Governmental Authority whose Consent is required to consummate the
Transactions, including promptly furnishing each other copies of any written
or electronic communication, and shall promptly advise each other when any
such communication causes such party to believe that there is a
reasonable likelihood that any such Consent will not be obtained or that the
receipt of any such Consent will be materially delayed or conditioned. Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company shall not, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates not to, permit any of their respective Representatives to
participate in any live or telephonic meeting with any Governmental Authority
(other than routine or ministerial matters) in respect of any filings,
investigation or other inquiry relating to the Transactions, unless it
consults with the other in advance and, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law and by such Governmental Authority, gives the other party the opportunity
to attend and participate in such meeting. Notwithstanding the foregoing
or anything else contained in this Agreement, no party shall be obligated to
provide information to another party if such party determines, in its
reasonable judgment, that (i) doing so would violate applicable Law or a
Contract, agreement or obligation of confidentiality owing to a third party,
jeopardize the protection of an attorney-client privilege or expose such party
to risk of liability for disclosure of sensitive or personal information (it
being understood that the parties shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to enable such information
to be furnished or made available to the requesting party or its
Representatives without so jeopardizing privilege or protection, incurring
liability or contravening applicable Law or Contract, agreement or obligation,
including by entering into a customary joint defense agreement or common
interest agreement with the requesting party to the extent such an agreement
would preserve the applicable privilege or protection) or (ii) such
information is not directly related to the Transactions. For the avoidance of
doubt, this _Section_ __ _ 6.04(d)_ (except for the immediately preceding
sentence) shall not apply with respect to Tax matters.

 



61 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in
no event shall a party or any of its Affiliates be required by a Governmental
Authority to agree to take, or enter into any action, which action is not
conditioned upon the Closing.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in
no event shall Parent or any of its Affiliates be required to (and in no
event shall the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company agree to without the
prior written consent of Parent) take any action, including entering into any
consent decree, hold separate order or other arrangement, that would, or
would reasonably expected to have, a material adverse effect on the business,
operations, results of operations, assets, liabilities or condition (financial
or otherwise) of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (any such
requirement, individually or together with all other such requirements, a "
_Parent Burdensome Condition_ ").

Section 6.05  _Transfer Taxes_. All share transfer, real estate transfer,
documentary, stamp, recording and other similar Taxes (including interest,
penalties and additions to any such Taxes) (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") incurred in
connection with the Transactions shall be paid by Parent or the Surviving
Company, and, prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cooperate with
Parent in preparing, executing and filing any applicable Tax Returns with
respect to such Transfer Taxes.

 

Section 6.06 _Public Announcements_. Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand,
and the Company, on the other hand, shall consult with each other before
issuing, and give each other reasonable opportunity to review and comment
upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to the
Transactions, and shall not (and shall not cause or permit their
respective Subsidiaries or Representatives to) issue any such press release
or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be
required by applicable Law, court process or the rules and regulations of any
national securities exchange or national securities quotation system and
except for as otherwise explicitly provided in _Section_ __ _ 6.02_. The
parties agree that the initial press release to be issued with respect to the
Transactions following execution of this Agreement shall be in the form
heretofore agreed to by the parties. The Company shall not make any internal
announcements or other communications to its employees or other constituents
with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions without Parents prior
written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and the Company may make any
oral or written public or internal announcements, releases or statements
without complying with the foregoing requirements if the substance of such
announcements, releases or statements was publicly or internally disclosed and
previously subject to the foregoing requirements.

 

Section 6.07 _Access to Information_. Subject to applicable Law, upon
reasonable notice, the Company shall afford to Parent and Parents
Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to the
Companys officers, employees, agents, properties, books, Contracts and
records and the Company shall furnish promptly to Parent and
Parents Representatives such information concerning its business, personnel,
assets, liabilities and properties as Parent may reasonably request;
_provided_ that Parent and its Representatives shall conduct any such
activities in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the
business or operations of the Company; _provided_ _further_ , however, that,
notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else contained in this Agreement, no
party shall be obligated to provide information to

 



62  another party if such party determines, in its reasonable judgment, that (i)
doing so would violate applicable Law or a Contract, agreement or obligation
of confidentiality owing to a third party, jeopardize the protection of an
attorney-client privilege or expose such party to risk of liability for
disclosure of sensitive or personal information (it being understood that the
parties shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to enable such information to be furnished or
made available to the requesting party or its Representatives without so
jeopardizing privilege or protection, incurring liability or contravening
applicable Law or Contract, agreement or obligation, including by entering
into a customary joint defense agreement or common interest agreement with the
requesting party to the extent such an agreement would preserve the applicable
privilege or protection) or (ii) such information is not directly related to
the Transactions. All requests for information made pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 6.07_ shall be directed to the Person designated by the Company.

 

Section 6.08 _Confidentiality_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
the Confidentiality Agreement, the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement are
hereby amended such that the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect until the Effective Time or, if this Agreement is earlier
terminated pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.01_, until the Confidentiality
Agreement expires in accordance with its terms and shall apply to any
information provided by any party to another party pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement.

 

Section 6.09 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Company to, (i) indemnify and hold harmless each
individual who at the Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the Effective
Time was, a director or officer of the Company or of a Subsidiary of the
Company (each, together with such Persons heirs, executors
and administrators, an " _Indemnitee_ " and, collectively, the "
_Indemnitees_ ") with respect to all claims, liabilities, losses, damages,
judgments, fines, penalties, costs (including amounts paid in settlement or
compromise) and expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) in
connection with any Action (whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative), whenever asserted, based on or arising out of, in whole or in
part, (A) the fact that an Indemnitee is or was a director or officer of the
Company or such Subsidiary or (B) acts or omissions by an Indemnitee in the
Indemnitees capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company
or such Subsidiary or taken at the request of the Company or such Subsidiary
(including in connection with serving at the request of the Company or such
Subsidiary as a director, officer, employee, agent, trustee or fiduciary of
another Person (including any employee benefit plan)), in each case under
clause (A) or (B), at, or at any time prior to, the Effective Time (including
any Action relating in whole or in part to the Transactions or relating to the
enforcement of this provision or any other indemnification or advancement
right of any Indemnitee), to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law; _provided_ that no Indemnitee shall be indemnified against any liability
which by virtue of any rule of law attaches to such Indemnitee in respect
of any fraud or dishonesty of which such Indemnitee is guilty in relation to
the Company as finally determined by the Supreme Court of Bermuda; and (ii)
assume all obligations of the Company and such Subsidiaries to the Indemnitees
in respect of indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time as provided in the
Company Organizational Documents and the Organizational Documents of such
Subsidiaries as in effect on the date of this Agreement or in any agreement
in existence as of the date of this

 



63  Agreement providing for indemnification between the Company and any
Indemnitee. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent, from and after the
Effective Time, shall cause, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law, the memorandum of association and bye-laws of the Surviving Company to
contain provisions no less favorable to the Indemnitees with respect to
limitation of liabilities of directors and officers and indemnification than
are set forth as of the date of this Agreement in the Company Organizational
Documents, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified in a manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the
Indemnitees. In addition, from the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Company to, advance any expenses (including fees and
expenses of legal counsel) of any Indemnitee under this  _Section_ __ _
6.09_ (including in connection with enforcing the indemnity and other
obligations referred to in this _Section_ __ _ 6.09_) as incurred to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law;  _provided_ that the
individual to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such
advances if it shall be finally determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction that such Person is not entitled to be indemnified pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 6.09(a)_.

(b) None of Parent or the Surviving Company shall settle, compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment in any threatened or actual Action,
litigation, claim or proceeding relating to any acts or omissions covered
under this _Section_ __ _ 6.09_ (each, a " _Claim_ ") for which
indemnification has been sought by an Indemnitee hereunder, unless such
settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such
Indemnitee from all liability arising out of such Claim or such Indemnitee
otherwise consents in writing to such settlement, compromise or consent. Each
of Parent, the Surviving Company and the Indemnitees shall cooperate in the
defense of any Claim and shall provide access to properties and individuals as
reasonably requested and furnish or cause to be furnished records,
information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings,
hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection
therewith.

 

(c) For the six-year period commencing immediately after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Company shall maintain in effect the current directors and
officers liability insurance of the Company and its Subsidiaries covering
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time with respect to
those individuals who are currently (and any additional individuals who prior
to the Effective Time become) covered by the directors and officers
liability insurance policies of the Company and its Subsidiaries on terms and
scope with respect to such coverage, and in amount, no less favorable to such
individuals than those of such policies in effect on the date of this
Agreement (or Parent may substitute therefor policies, issued by reputable
insurers, of at least the same coverage with respect to matters existing or
occurring prior to the Effective Time, including a "tail" policy); _provided_
, _however_ , that, if the annual premium for such insurance shall exceed 300%
of the current annual premium (such 300% threshold, the " _Maximum Premium_
"), then Parent shall provide or cause to be provided a policy for the
applicable individuals with the best coverage as shall then be available at an
annual premium not in excess of the Maximum Premium. The Company may prior to
the Effective Time purchase, for an aggregate amount not to exceed the
aggregate Maximum Premium for six (6) years, a six-year prepaid "tail" policy
on terms and conditions providing at least substantially equivalent benefits
as the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance
maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters
existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time, including the
Transactions. If such prepaid "tail" policy has been obtained by the Company,
it shall be deemed to satisfy all obligations to obtain insurance pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 6.09(c)_ and the Surviving Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause such policy to be maintained in full force
and effect, for its full term, and to honor all of its obligations thereunder.

 



64 (d) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.09_ are (i) intended to be
for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her
heirs and his or her Representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such individual may have under the Company Organizational Documents, by
Contract or otherwise. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Company
under this _Section_ __ _ 6.09_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a
manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee to whom this
_Section_ __ _ 6.09_ applies unless (x) such termination or modification is
required by applicable Law or (y) the affected Indemnitee shall have consented
in writing to such termination or modification (it being expressly agreed
that the Indemnitees to whom this _Section_ __ _ 6.09_ applies shall be third
party beneficiaries of this _Section_ __ _ 6.09_).

 

(e) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates or amalgamates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving company or entity of such
consolidation, amalgamation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Company shall assume all of the obligations
thereof set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.09_.

 

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that
the indemnification provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 6.09_ is not prior
to or in substitution for any such claims under such policies.

 

Section 6.10 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and Parent
shall take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable to cause
dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities)
and acquisitions of Parent equity securities (including derivative securities)
pursuant to the Transactions by each individual who is a director or officer
of the Company subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act to be exempt under

Section 6.11 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time through the end of the calendar year
following the year in which the Effective Time occurs (the " _Continuation
Period_ "), Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Company to
provide, each individual who is employed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a " _Company
Employee_ ") with (i) a base salary or wage rate that is no less than that
provided to such Company Employee by the Company and any of its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) target annual plus target long-
term incentive compensation opportunity that is substantially similar, in the
aggregate, to the target annual incentive compensation plus target

 



65  long-term incentive compensation opportunity (excluding any "Partners
Plan", special, one-time or transaction-based compensation opportunities)
provided to such Company Employee by the Company and any of its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time, it being understood that the form of
such incentives shall be in Parents discretion, and (iii) other compensation
and employee benefits (excluding long-term incentive, special, one-time or
transaction-based compensation and benefits) that are (A) during the calendar
year in which the Effective Time occurs, no less favorable, in the aggregate,
than those provided to such Company Employee by the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) for the remainder
of the Continuation Period, substantially comparable in the aggregate to
either, at Parents election, (x) those provided to such Company Employee by
the Company and any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective
Time or (y) those provided by Parent to its similarly situated employees.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall provide, or
shall cause the Surviving Company to provide, each Company Employee (other
than each Company Employee listed in Section 6.11(a)(i) or (ii) of the
Company Disclosure Letter) who experiences a termination of employment from
Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective Affiliates during the
Continuation Period with severance benefits that are no less favorable
than those provided to similarly situated Parent employees under Parents
severance plans.

(b) Without limiting the generality of  _Section_ __ _ 6.11(a)_, from and
after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company
to honor and continue all of the Companys employment, severance, retention,
termination and change-in-control plans, policies, programs, agreements and
arrangements maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as set forth
in Section 6.11(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, in each case, as in
effect at the Effective Time, including with respect to any payments, benefits
or rights arising as a result of the Transactions (either alone or in
combination with any other event), subject, in each case, to the terms and
conditions of such arrangements.

(c) With respect to all employee benefit plans of Parent, the Surviving
Company and its Subsidiaries, including any "employee benefit plan" (as
defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) (including any paid time off and severance
plans) in which Company Employees are eligible to participate following the
Effective Time (the " _New Benefit Plans_ "), for purposes of determining
eligibility to participate, level of benefits and vesting, each Company
Employees service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as well as
service with any predecessor employer of the Company or any such Subsidiary,
to the extent service with the predecessor employer was recognized by the
Company or such Subsidiary) shall be treated as service with Parent, the
Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or in the case of a transfer of
all or substantially all the assets and business of the Surviving Company, its
successors and assigns); _provided_ , _however_ , that for the avoidance of
doubt such service need not be recognized for purposes of any retiree health
or welfare arrangements, any frozen benefit plan, benefit accrual under any
defined benefit pension plan or to the extent that such recognition would
result in any duplication of benefits for the same period of service.

(d) Without limiting the generality of _Section_ __ _ 6.11(a)_, Parent shall,
or shall cause the Surviving Company to, waive, or cause to be waived, any
pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements
and waiting periods under any New Benefit Plan that is a welfare benefit plan
in which Company Employees (and their eligible dependents) will be

 



66  eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time, except to the
extent that such pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-
work requirements and waiting periods would not have been satisfied or waived
under the comparable Company Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time.
With respect to such New Benefit Plans, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Company to, recognize the dollar amount of all co-payments,
deductibles and similar expenses incurred by each Company Employee (and his
or her eligible dependents) prior to the Effective Time during the calendar
year in which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of satisfying such years
deductible and co-payment limitations under the relevant welfare benefit
plans in which they will be eligible to participate from and after the
Effective Time.

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of any Company Plan containing a
definition of "change in control" or "change of control" (or term of similar
import) that relates to the Company, the occurrence of the Closing shall be
deemed to constitute a "change in control" or "change of control" (or such
term of similar import) of the Company under such Company Plan.

 

(f) If requested by Parent at least ten (10) business days prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall terminate any and all Company Plans
intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code or listed in Section
6.11(f) of the Company Disclosure Letter, effective not later than the
business day immediately preceding the Effective Time. In the event that
Parent requests that such 401(k) plan(s) or other Company Plans be
terminated, the Company shall provide Parent with the evidence that such
401(k) plan(s) or other Company Plans have been terminated pursuant to
resolution of the Company Board (the form and substance of which shall be
subject to review by Parent) not later than five (5) business day(s)
immediately preceding the Effective Time. Such resolutions shall provide for
the immediate vesting of any accrued but unvested benefits under
the terminated 401(k) plan(s) and the payment of any then unpaid employer
matching contributions under the terminated 401(k) plan(s) in respect of the
year in which the Effective Time occurs.

 

(g) As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, Parent shall permit
each Company Employee who is a participant in any terminated 401(k) plan(s)
to roll over his or her account balance(s) and outstanding loan balance(s), if
any, thereunder into a plan maintained by Parent that is intended to qualify
under Section 401(k) of the Code.

 

(h) With respect to any Company Employee whose principal place of employment
is outside of the United States, Parents obligations under this _Section_ __
_ 6.11_ shall be modified to the extent necessary to comply with applicable
Law of the foreign countries and political subdivisions thereof in which such
Company Employee primarily performs his duties.

 

(i) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ are solely for the benefit of
the parties to this Agreement, and no provision of this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_
is intended to, or shall, constitute the establishment or adoption of or an
amendment to any employee benefit plan for purposes of ERISA or otherwise and,
except as otherwise explicitly provided for in this Agreement, no current or
former employee or any other individual associated therewith shall be regarded
for any purpose as a third party beneficiary of this Agreement or have the
right to enforce the provisions hereof. Nothing contained in this agreement
is intended to prevent Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their
Affiliates from, after the Effective Time, (i) amending or terminating any of
their benefit plans in accordance with their terms or (ii) terminating
the employment of any Company Employee.

 



67 Section 6.12 _Notification of Certain Matters; Shareholder Litigation_. During
the period from the date of this Agreement through the earlier of the Closing
and the termination of this Agreement, Parent shall give prompt notice to the
Company, and the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, of any Actions
commenced or, to such partys Knowledge, threatened against such party which
relates to this Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement or the Transactions.
Subject to applicable Law, each party shall give the other party the
opportunity to participate, at such other partys sole cost and expense, in
the defense and settlement of any litigation by any shareholder of the Company
against the first party or its directors relating to this Agreement, the
Statutory Merger Agreement or the Transactions, and no such settlement shall
be agreed to without such other partys prior written consent (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

Section 6.13 _Merger Sub Shareholder Approval_. Immediately following the
execution of this Agreement, Parent shall execute and deliver, in accordance
with Section 106 of the Bermuda Companies Act and in its capacity as the sole
shareholder of Merger Sub, a written consent approving this Agreement, the
Statutory Merger Agreement and the Merger (the " _Merger Sub Shareholder
Approval_ ").

Section 6.14 _Tax Matters_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
reasonably consult with Parent regarding any material transactions of the
Company or its Subsidiaries that the Company intends to enter into (other than
transactions expressly contemplated by this Agreement), including making any
election under Section 953(d) of the Code, if such material transactions are
being undertaken for the purposes of complying with or minimizing the adverse
Tax impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, P.L. 115-97, and shall not enter into
any such material transaction without the consent of Parent, such consent not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

Section 6.15  _Client Consents_. The Company shall, or shall cause the
applicable IA Subsidiary to, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
consent (which consent may take the form of negative consent to the extent
written consent is not required by such Clients Advisory Contract or, if the
Client is a Private Fund, the Private Funds Organizational Documents) of each
Client to the assignment or deemed assignment of such Clients Advisory
Contract in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (the "
_Advisory Client Consents_ "). In connection with obtaining the Advisory
Client Consents, (a) the Company shall take reasonable steps to keep Parent
reasonably informed of the status of obtaining such Advisory Client Consents
and such other actions and, upon Parents request, make available to Parent
copies of all such executed Advisory Client Consents and other records
relating to the Advisory Client Consent process and (b) Parent shall have the
right to review in advance of distribution the general forms of any notices or
other materials to be distributed by any IA Subsidiary to Clients (or, if the
Client is a Private Fund, any limited partner, member or beneficial owner of
the Private Fund) and shall have the right to have its reasonable comments
considered by the Company in a commercially reasonable manner prior to
distribution.

 



68 Section 6.16 _Existing Indebtedness_. If requested by Parent, the Company
shall provide commercially reasonable cooperation to Parent and Merger Sub in
taking such actions as are necessary under the indentures listed in item (iii)
of Section 4.16 of the Company Disclosure Letter (collectively, " _Existing
Debt Documents_ ") in respect of the Transactions, including delivering or
causing a Subsidiary to deliver any such notices, agreements, documents or
instruments necessary, proper or advisable to comply with the terms thereof,
including the delivery of officer certificates and opinions of counsel
required to be delivered thereunder in connection with the Transactions. If
requested by Parent, the Company shall provide commercially reasonable
cooperation to Parent and Merger Sub in either (a) arranging for the
termination of Existing Debt Documents (or redemption of the relevant notes or
debentures) at the closing (or such other date thereafter selected by Parent)
and the procurement of customary payoff letters and other customary release
documentation in connection therewith or (b) obtaining any consents required
under the credit agreements listed in Section 4.03(c) of the Company
Disclosure Letter to permit the consummation of the Transactions thereunder.
In furtherance of the foregoing, if requested by Parent, the Company shall and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to execute and deliver such customary notices,
agreements, documents or instruments necessary to either terminate the
Existing Debt Documents or redeem the relevant notes or debentures, in each
case effective as of the Closing (or such other date thereafter selected by
the Parent) or to obtain the consents required under the credit agreements
listed in Section 4.03(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter, as determined by
Parent in its sole discretion. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section_ __ _
6.16_ to the contrary, in no event shall the Company be required in connection
with its obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 6.16_ to (i) incur or agree
to incur any out-of-pocket expenses unless they are promptly reimbursed by
Parent, (ii) incur or agree to incur any consent, amendment or similar fee
unless Parent provides the funding to the Company therefor (iii) incur any
liability in connection therewith prior to the Closing Date unless contingent
upon the occurrence of the Closing, (iv) unreasonably interfere with the
normal operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (v) include any actions
that the Company reasonably believes could (w) violate its certificate of
incorporation or bylaws (or comparable documents), (x) violate any applicable
law, (y) constitute a default or violation under, or give rise to any right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration of any right or obligation of such
Person or to a loss of any benefit to which such Person is entitled under any
provision of, any agreement or other instrument binding upon such Person or to
which such Person is a party, or (z) result in the creation or imposition of
any lien on any asset of such Person, (vi) to waive or amend any terms of
this Agreement or (vii) result in any of the Companys or any of its
Subsidiaries Representatives incurring any personal liability with respect to
any matters relating to the this  _Section_ __ _ 6.16_. Parent shall defend,
indemnify and hold harmless any the Company, its Subsidiaries and any of their
Representatives from, against and in respect of any and all claims,
liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties, costs and expenses
resulting from or incurred in connection with the cooperation hereunder.
Notwithstanding this _Section_ __ _ 6.16_ or anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, each of the parties hereto agrees that it is not a condition to
the Closing that the payoff letters, consents, amendments or other similar
actions described in this section be obtained.

ARTICLE IX

 

MISCELLANEOUS

 

Section 9.01 _No Survival of Representations and Warranties_. This _Article
IX_ and the agreements of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub contained in
_Article III_ , _Section_ __ _ 6.09_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ shall survive
the Effective Time. No other representations, warranties, obligations or
agreements in this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time.

Section 9.02 _Amendment or Supplement_. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, this Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and all respects,
whether before or after receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, by
written agreement of the parties, by action taken by the Parent Board and the
Company Board; _provided_ , _however_ , that following receipt of the Company
Shareholder Approval, there shall be no amendment or change to the provisions
hereof which by applicable Law would require further approval by the
shareholders of the Company without such approval.

 

Section 9.03 _Extension of Time, Waiver, Etc._ At any time prior to the
Effective Time, Parent and the Company may, subject to applicable Law, (a)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other
party, (b) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
acts of the other party or (c) subject to the requirements of applicable Law,
waive compliance by the other party with any of the agreements contained
herein or, except as otherwise provided herein, waive any of such partys
conditions (it being understood that Parent and Merger Sub shall be deemed
a single party for purposes of the foregoing). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
no failure or delay by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub in exercising any
right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a
party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

 



75 Section 9.04 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the parties without the prior written
consent of the other parties. No assignment by any party shall relieve such
party of any of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the immediately
preceding two sentences, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors
and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment not permitted under this
_Section_ __ _ 9.04_ shall be null and void.

Section 9.05 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts (including by facsimile or electronic mail), each of which shall
be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute
one and the same agreement, and shall become effective when one or more
counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the
other parties.

Section 9.06  _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement,
and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and
oral, among the parties and their Affiliates, or any of them, with respect to
the subject matter hereof. This Agreement is not intended to and shall not
confer upon any Person other than the parties any rights or remedies hereunder
except for (i) if the Effective Time occurs, the right of the holders of
Company Shares to receive the Merger Consideration payable in accordance with
_Article III_ and (ii) the provisions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.09_ of
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall have the
right to recover, through an Action brought by the Company, damages from
Parent in the event of a breach of this Agreement by Parent, in which event
the damages recoverable by the Company for itself and on behalf of the
holders of Company Shares shall be determined by reference to the total amount
that would have been recoverable under the circumstances of such breach by
such holders if all such holders brought an action against Parent and
were recognized as third party beneficiaries hereunder. Persons other than
the parties may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this
Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date
of this Agreement or as of any other date.

Section 9.07 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts executed in and to be
performed entirely within that state, regardless of the laws that might
otherwise govern under any applicable conflict of laws principles, except to
the extent the provisions of the laws of Bermuda are mandatorily applicable to
the Merger.

(b) All Actions brought by one party to this Agreement against another party
to this Agreement arising out of or relating to the interpretation and
enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and in respect of the
Transactions (except to the extent any such proceeding mandatorily must be
brought in Bermuda) shall be heard and determined in the Delaware Court of
Chancery, or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal court within the State of
Delaware, or, if both the Delaware Court of Chancery and the federal courts
within the State of Delaware decline to accept jurisdiction over a particular
matter, any other state court within the State of Delaware, and, in each case,
any appellate court therefrom. The parties hereby irrevocably submit to the
exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts in any such Actions and
irrevocably waive the defense of an inconvenient forum or lack of jurisdiction
to the maintenance of any such Action. The consents

 



76  to jurisdiction and venue set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 9.07(b)_ shall
not constitute general consents to service of process in the State of Delaware
and shall have no effect for any purpose except as provided in this paragraph
and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than the parties.
Each party agrees that service of process upon such party in any Action
arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be effective if notice is
given by overnight courier at the address set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.10_
of this Agreement. The parties agree that a final judgment in any such Action
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing contained in the foregoing shall restrict any partys
rights to seek any post-judgment relief regarding, or any appeal from, a
final trial court judgment.

Section 9.08 _Specific Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable
damage for which monetary relief, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy, would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement is not
performed in accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise
breached, including if the parties fail to take any action required of them
hereunder to consummate this Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement. The parties acknowledge and agree that (a) the parties shall
be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, the right of the Company to cause the Merger to be consummated on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement) in the courts
described in _Section_ __ _ 9.07(b)_ without proof of damages or otherwise,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under
this Agreement and (b) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part
of the Transactions and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent
would have entered into this Agreement. The parties agree not to assert that
a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or
inequitable for any reason, and not to assert that a remedy of monetary
damages would provide an adequate remedy or that the parties otherwise have
an adequate remedy at law. The parties acknowledge and agree that any party
seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in
accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 9.08_ shall not be required to provide
any bond or other security in connection with any such order or injunction.
If, prior to the Walk-Away Date, any party brings any action, in each case, in
accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 9.08_, to enforce specifically the
performance of the terms and provisions hereof by any other party, the Walk-
Away Date shall automatically be extended (x) for the period during which such
action is pending,  _plus_ ten (10) business days or (y) by such other time
period established by the court presiding over such action, as the case may
be.

 

Section 9.09 _WAIVER_ _OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT
ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY
RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY

 



77  OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER,
(B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER, (C) IT
MAKES SUCH WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS
_SECTION_ __ _ 9.09_. 

Section 9.10 _Notices_. All notices, requests and other communications to any
party hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if delivered

shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party or such party waives its rights under this _Section_ __
_ 9.11_ with respect thereto. Upon such determination that any term,
condition or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the parties shall negotiate to attempt to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end
that the Transactions are fulfilled to the extent possible.

incur such fees or expenses, except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement.

 

Section 9.13 _Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any
and all remedies expressly conferred upon a party shall be cumulative with,
and not exclusive of, any other remedy contained in this Agreement, at law or
in equity. The exercise by a party of any one remedy shall not preclude the
exercise by it of any other remedy.
