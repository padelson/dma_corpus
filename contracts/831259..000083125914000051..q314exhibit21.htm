Tag-Along Sellers agree to cause the Tag-Along Subsidiary Sellers to sell to
Buyers, and Buyers agree to purchase from the Tag-Along Subsidiary Sellers,
the SMMA Subject Shares, at the Closing, for an aggregate purchase price equal
to the Purchase Price. For the avoidance of doubt, if the SMMA Participant
exercises the SMMA Candelaria Tag-Along Right and the SMMA Ojos Tag-Along
Right, notwithstanding any failure of either of Sumitomo Corporation or

Tag-Along Seller prior to the Closing Date (as determined in accordance with

Price shall be paid as provided in Section 2.02 and Section 2.04 (as
applicable). The Purchase Price shall be allocated to the Subject Shares as
set forth in the statement attached hereto as Schedule 2.01.

the Subject Shares hereunder shall take place at the offices of Bofill Mir and

entitled to the benefit of the conditions set forth in Article 9 (other than
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permissible, waiver of those
conditions at the Closing), or at such other time or place as Buyers and
Sellers may agree; provided that the Closing shall not take place prior to (x)
five Business Days following the date of written notice from Freeport to
Buyers stating (i) that the notice periods required under Section 9.5 of the
Candelaria Shareholders' Agreement and Section 9.5 of the Ojos Shareholders'
Agreement have expired, (ii) that the SMMA Participant shall have confirmed in
writing that it wishes to exercise either or both of the SMMA Candelaria Tag-
Along Right and the SMMA Ojos Tag-Along Right (it being understood that if the

SMMA Ojos Tag-Along Right or if the SMMA Participant exercises the SMMA Ojos
Tag-Along Right but not the SMMA Candelaria Tag-Along Right the provisions of
Section 6.07(c) shall apply) or (iii) that the SMMA Participant shall have
confirmed in writing that it does not wish to

Along Right, (y) except as Freeport and Lundin may otherwise agree, 30 days

date of receipt by Freeport of a ruling, resolution or other legally binding
written confirmation issued by the Servicio de Impuestos Internos in form and
substance satisfactory to Freeport confirming the tax applicable to gains
realized by the Freeport Subsidiary Sellers on the sale of the Freeport
Subject Shares. At the Closing:

(a) Buyers shall deliver:

(i) to Freeport in respect of the Freeport Subject Shares owned by the
Freeport Subsidiary Sellers, an amount equal to (A) its Allocable Share of the
Base Purchase Price (calculated as set forth on Schedule 2.03(b)), net of

positive or negative number) as set forth in the notice delivered by Freeport
pursuant to Section 2.03, net of Chilean withholding tax in accordance with
Applicable Law, minus (C) 80% of the amount of Notified Leakage that is of the
type set forth in clause (E) of the definition of Leakage plus, without
duplication, 100% of the amount of all other Notified Leakage paid to or of

the notice delivered by Freeport pursuant to Section 2.03, net of Chilean
withholding tax in accordance with Applicable Law, in immediately available
funds by wire transfer to one or more bank accounts, which bank accounts shall
be designated by the Tag-Along Sellers by notice to Buyers not later than two
Business Days prior to the Closing Date;

For the avoidance of doubt, any amounts required to be added to or subtracted
from the Base Purchase Price pursuant to this Section 2.02(a) (other than

required to be deducted or withheld by Applicable Law) shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for Chilean tax law purposes.

Ojos Shareholders' Agreement, as applicable, in accordance with its respective
terms or (B) if the SMMA Participant exercises the SMMA Candelaria Tag-Along
Right and the SMMA Ojos Tag-Along Right, the Candelaria Shareholders'
Agreement and the Ojos Shareholders' Agreement shall be terminated;

(j) Each Seller shall cause each of its Subsidiary Sellers to deliver an
irrevocable direction to the Buyers agreeing that payment in respect of such

in clause (E) of the definition of Leakage and, if the SMMA Participant has
exercised the SMMA Candelaria Tag-Along Right and/or the SMMA Ojos Tag-Along
Right, for any other amounts of Notified Leakage, whether such amounts were
paid to or otherwise for the benefit of Freeport or its Affiliates, on the one
hand, or the Tag-Along Sellers or their Affiliates, on the other hand, in each
case, together with reasonable supporting documentation.

(b) If the Buyers disagree with any of Freeport\'s calculations of the Cash
Adjustment Amount, the Permitted Leakage, or the Notified Leakage set forth in
the notice delivered pursuant to Section 2.03(a) or Freeport's calculations of

after the Closing Date, deliver a notice to the Sellers disagreeing with such
calculation(s) and, which specifies the Buyers' calculation(s) of such
amount(s) and, in reasonable detail, the Buyers' grounds for such
disagreement. Any such notice of disagreement shall specify those items or
amounts as to which the Buyers disagree and the Buyers shall be deemed to have
agreed with all other items and amounts forming a part of the Cash Adjustment
Amount, the Permitted Leakage, the Notified Leakage, the Accrued Preferred
Dividend Amount, Working Capital, Cash and/or the Base Purchase Price, as
applicable.

(c) If a notice of disagreement shall be duly delivered pursuant to Section

Preferred Dividend Amount, Working Capital, Cash 

and/or the Base Purchase Price, as the case may be. If the Buyers and Sellers
are unable to reach such agreement during such period, they shall thereafter

Adjustment Amount, the Permitted Leakage, the Notified Leakage, the Accrued
Preferred Dividend Amount, Working Capital, Cash and/or the Base Purchase
Price, as the case maybe, and resolving the items or amounts in dispute. In

those items or amounts in the Cash Adjustment Amount, the Permitted Leakage,
the Notified Leakage, the Accrued Preferred Dividend Amount, Working Capital,
Cash and/or the Base Purchase Price, as the case may be, as to which the
Buyers have disagreed. Such independent accountant shall deliver to the Buyers
and Sellers, as promptly as practicable, a report setting forth such
calculation(s). Such report shall be final and binding upon the Buyers and
Sellers. The cost of such review and report shall be borne equally by the
Buyers, on the one hand, and Sellers (in accordance with their respective
Allocable Shares), on the other hand.

(d) The Buyers and Sellers agree that they will, and agree to cause their
respective independent accountants and the Companies to, cooperate and assist
in the calculation of the Cash Adjustment Amount, the Permitted Leakage, the
Notified Leakage, the Accrued Preferred Dividend Amount, Working Capital, Cash
and/or the Base Purchase Price, and in the resolution of any amounts or items
of dispute and the conduct of the audits and reviews referred to in this
Section 2.03, including the making available to the extent necessary of books,
records, work papers and personnel.

(e) If as a result of settlement between the Buyers and Sellers, or as
determined by the said independent accountants, it shall be determined that
the Buyers have made an overpayment to Sellers on Closing, then the amount of
such overpayment shall forthwith be due and owing by the applicable Sellers to
the Buyers or, alternatively, if it shall be determined that the Buyers have
underpaid Sellers on Closing, then the amount of such underpayment shall
forthwith be due and owing by Buyers to the applicable Sellers, subject to
withholding in accordance with Applicable Law.

Section 2.04. Earn-out Payments. As promptly as practicable, and in no event
later than 10 Business Days, after it has been determined that any Earn-out

Companies. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyers shall not (i) have access to

confidence, and will cause its Affiliates and its and their respective
representatives to maintain in confidence all material written, oral, or other

Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, except to the extent that

nonconfidential basis by such Seller, (ii) in the public domain through no

Section 6.02. Access; Seller Confidentiality. Buyers will cause the Companies,
on and after the Closing Date for a period of six years to afford promptly to
each Seller and its agents reasonable access to their properties, books,
records, employees and auditors to the extent necessary to permit such Seller
to determine any matter relating to its rights and obligations hereunder or to
any period ending on or before the Closing Date; provided that any such access
by such Seller shall not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the
business of Buyers or the Companies. In addition, Buyers will cause the
Companies after the Closing Date to provide financial information to each
Seller with respect to the fiscal quarter and month or portions thereof ending
on or prior to the Closing Date, in a manner and within a time period
consistent with the Companies' past practice, in order to enable such Seller
to satisfy its financial reporting obligations with respect to such pre-
Closing periods. Each Seller will hold, and will use its best efforts to cause
its officers, directors, employees, accountants, counsel, consultants,
advisors and agents to hold, in confidence, unless compelled to disclose by

director of any of them or either Company (any such Person, a "Designated
Person") in any matter involving the Transaction Agreements or any other
agreements or transactions contemplated thereby, by any legal counsel
currently representing any Seller, Subsidiary Sellers or the Companies in
connection with the Transaction Agreements or any other agreements or
transactions contemplated thereby (the "Current Representation").

(b) Each Buyer waives and will not assert, and agrees to cause the Companies
to waive and to not assert, any attorney-client privilege with respect to any
communication between any legal counsel and any Designated Person occurring
during the Current Representation in connection with any Post-Closing

following the Closing, with the Companies, it being the intention of the
parties hereto that all such rights to such attorney-client privilege and to
control such attorney-client privilege shall be retained by the applicable
Seller; provided that the foregoing waiver and acknowledgement of retention
shall not extend to any communication not involving the Transaction Agreements
or any other agreements or transactions contemplated thereby, or to
communications with any Person other than the Designated Persons and their
advisers.

certificates, agreements and other writings (including notarial deeds for the
assignment to the Buyers of each of the Foreign Investment Contracts in the

Buyers shall provide or cause to be provided to any Governmental Authority

Authority, including by (i) filing any notification and report form and
related material required under any Antitrust Law with respect to the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements as promptly as

Candelaria Tag-Along Right and the SMMA Ojos Tag-Along Right (in which case,
as applicable, the Candelaria Shareholders' Agreement and/or the Ojos
Shareholders' Agreement shall be terminated in accordance with Section

Ltd. shall execute a counterpart to this Agreement and shall become a party
hereto in its capacity as a Tag-Along Seller on or before the fifth Business
Day prior to the Closing Date (as determined in accordance with Section 2.02);
provided, however, notwithstanding any failure of either Sumitomo Corporation
or Sumitomo Metal Mining Co., Ltd. (or, at the option of Buyers, another SMMA
Participant) to become a party hereto in its capacity as a Tag-Along Seller,
all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement as between Freeport and
Buyers shall remain in full force and effect, the closing of the purchase and
sale of the Freeport Subject Shares shall occur in accordance with the terms

not the SMMA Ojos Tag-Along Right or if the SMMA Participant exercises the
SMMA Ojos Tag-Along Right but not the SMMA Candelaria Tag-Along Right,
Freeport and Buyers agree to negotiate in good faith to (i) amend this
Agreement to provide for the purchase by Buyers of the applicable SMMA Subject
Shares with respect to which the 

SMMA Candelaria Tag-Along Right or the SMMA Ojos Tag-Along Right was exercised
and otherwise modify this Agreement such that the terms and conditions of this
Agreement as so modified reflect as nearly as practicable the original intent
of Freeport and Buyers (including as evidenced by the amount of the Purchase

Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and the Companies to, use good
faith efforts to settle on or prior to the Closing Date, all such Intercompany
Accounts (other than Intercompany Accounts arising as a result of concentrate

Companies to, use good faith efforts to settle any such Intercompany Accounts
(other than Intercompany Accounts arising as a result of concentrate sales)
that are not settled as of the Closing Date and each Buyer shall provide its

Seller and its Affiliates, on the one hand, or the Companies, on the other

TAX MATTERS



Section 7.01. Tax Indemnification.

(a) Indemnification by Freeport. From and after the Closing Date, each Seller
shall, severally and not jointly, indemnify Buyers, the Companies and their
Affiliates (each a "Tax Indemnified Buyer Party" and collectively, the "Tax
Indemnified Buyer Parties") against and hold them harmless from any and all
liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards,
judgments and penalties (including without limitation, reasonable fees for
both in-house and outside counsel, accountants and other outside consultants)
suffered or incurred (each a "Tax Loss" and collectively, the "Tax Losses")
arising out of (i) Taxes of the Companies for Pre-Balance Sheet Taxes; or (ii)
without duplication, Pre-Balance Sheet Taxes imposed on a Tax Indemnified
Buyer Party as a result of (1) a breach of a representation or warranty set
forth in Section 3.24 of this Agreement or (2) a breach of a covenant or
agreement set forth in Section 5.05 of this Agreement; provided that neither
Freeport nor the Tag-Along Sellers shall have an obligation or liability to
indemnify any Tax Indemnified Buyer Party pursuant to this Section 7.01 for
the amount of any Tax Loss reflected as a liability in the relevant Balance
Sheet; provided further, that in the case of Tax Losses suffered or incurred
by the Companies, the amounts recoverable by any Tax Indemnified Buyer Party
in respect of such Tax Losses shall be limited to 80% of the amount of such
Tax Losses, unless the SMMA Participant exercises the SMMA Candelaria Tag-
Along Right or the SMMA Ojos Tag-Along Right.

(b) Indemnification by Buyer. From and after the Closing Date, Buyers shall
indemnify each Seller and its Affiliates (each, a "Tax Indemnified Seller
Party" and collectively, the "Tax Indemnified Seller Parties") against and
hold them harmless from any and all Tax Losses arising out of Taxes of the
Companies for periods or portions thereof beginning after the Balance Sheet
Date ("Post-Balance Sheet Taxes") other than amounts for which a Tax
Indemnified Buyer Party is indemnified by a Seller under Section 7.01(a).

Section 7.02. Tax Indemnification Procedures. (a) After the Closing, each
party to this Agreement (whether Buyers or any Seller, as the case may be)
shall promptly notify the other party in writing of any demand, claim or
notice of the commencement of an audit received by such party from any Taxing
Authority or any other Person with respect to Taxes for which such other party
is liable pursuant to Section 7.01; provided, however, that a failure to give
such notice will not affect such other party's rights to indemnification under
this Article 7, except to the extent that such party is actually prejudiced
thereby. Such notice shall contain factual information (to the extent known)
describing the asserted Tax liability and shall include copies of the relevant
portion of 

any notice or other document received from any Taxing Authority or any other
Person in respect of any such asserted Tax liability.

(b) Payment by an indemnitor of any amount due to an indemnitee under Article
7 of this Agreement shall be made within ten days following written notice by

applicable third party. In the case of a Tax that is contested in accordance
with the provisions of Section 7.05, payment of such contested Tax will not be
considered due earlier than the date a Final Determination to such effect is
made by such Taxing Authority or a court. For this purpose, a "Final
Determination" shall mean a settlement, compromise, or other binding
agreement, such as a closing agreement or other comparable agreement, with the
relevant Taxing Authority, a deficiency notice with respect to which the
period for filing a petition, claim or remedy with the relevant state, local
or foreign tribunal has expired or a final decision of any court of competent
jurisdiction that is not subject to any appeal or remedy or as to which the
time for appeal has expired.

(c) All amounts required to be paid pursuant to this Article 7 shall be paid
promptly in immediately available funds by wire transfer to a bank account
designated by the indemnified party.

permit the Companies or any Affiliate of either Buyer:

(a) to take any action on the Closing Date other than in the Ordinary Course
of Business, including but not limited to the distribution of any dividend or
the effectuation of any redemption that could give rise to any Tax liability
or reduce any Tax Asset of the Subsidiary Sellers or give rise to any loss of
the Subsidiary Sellers under this Agreement; or

(b) without the prior written consent of each of the Sellers (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld) (i) to make or change any Tax election; (ii) to
amend, or request or permit the amendment of, or make or lodge any objection
or appeal in relation to any Tax Returns contemplated in Section 7.05(d);
(iii) apply to any Tax Authority for any binding or non-binding opinion,
ruling or other determination in relation to any act, matter or transaction
covered by any such Tax Returns or to any act, matter or transaction occurring
on or before the Balance Sheet Date; or (iv) furnish to any Tax Authority any
information (in writing or otherwise) in relation to any such Tax Returns or
to any act, matter or transaction occurring on or before the Balance Sheet
Date.

Without limitation on the foregoing, for the period after Closing and through
the close of each such Company's then current taxable year (as defined in the

following prohibited transactions: 

(i) declare or pay a dividend unless required by the terms of the Candelaria
Shareholders' Agreement or the Ojos Shareholders' Agreement;

meaning of Section 956 of the Code; or

(iii) conduct business outside the Ordinary Course of Business or engage in
any transaction outside the Ordinary Course of Business (in either case based
upon the Company's historic activities) if such business or activities would
reasonably be expected to impact (1) the amount or character of the Subsidiary

Sellers' gross income reportable under Section 1248 of the Code; (2) the
amount of the Subsidiary Sellers' associated deemed-paid foreign taxes within
the meaning of Section 902 of the Code that are associated with the Section
1248 inclusion; or (3) the amount of Subsidiary Sellers' subpart F income

any extension of a required filing date), all Tax Returns with respect to the
Companies that are required to be filed on or prior to the Closing Date and
timely cause the Companies to pay all Taxes shown as due on such Tax Returns.
With respect to Tax Returns that relate to the Post-Balance Sheet Tax Period,
any Tax Return shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practice and
without a change of any election or any accounting method (unless otherwise
required by applicable law). Such Tax Returns shall be submitted by Freeport
to Buyers (together with schedules, statements and, to the extent reasonably
requested by Buyers, supporting documentation) at least 30 days prior to the

Tax Returns that relate to the Post-Balance Sheet Tax Period, Buyers shall
have the right to review and comment on such Tax Returns, and such returns
shall reflect Buyers\' reasonable comments.

authority by either of the Companies after the Closing Date with respect to a
Pre-Balance Sheet Tax Period or a Straddle Tax Period (each a "Buyer-Filed

manner consistent with past practice and without a change of any election or
any accounting method (unless otherwise required by applicable law). Buyer-
Filed Income Tax Returns shall be submitted by Buyers to Freeport (together

Freeport, supporting documentation) at least 30 days prior to the due date
(including any applicable extension) of such return. Freeport shall have the
right to review and comment on such Buyer-Filed Income Tax Return, which shall
not be filed without Freeport's consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. 

(c) If Freeport, within ten Business Days after receipt of any such Buyer-
Filed Income Tax Return, notifies Buyers in writing that it objects to any
items in such return, the disputed item shall be resolved in a manner mutually
agreeable to both parties, and if not so resolved, then by a jointly retained
nationally recognized accounting firm, who shall not have any material
relationship with Buyers, Sellers, Subsidiary Sellers or their Affiliates (an
"Accounting Referee") within a reasonable time, taking into account the
deadline for filing such return. Upon resolution of all such items, the
relevant Buyer-Filed Income Tax Return shall be adjusted to reflect such
resolution and shall be binding upon the parties without further adjustment.
The costs, fees and expenses of such Accounting Referee shall be borne equally
by Buyers, on the one hand, and Freeport, on the other hand. Neither Company
shall amend any Tax Return with respect to Income Tax for a Pre-Balance Sheet
Tax Period or a Straddle Tax Period without the prior written consent of
Freeport, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.

(d) Buyers shall pay or cause to be paid to the appropriate Taxing Authority
all Taxes with respect to any Buyer-Filed Income Tax Return filed under this
Article in accordance with Applicable Law. To the extent the amount of any
Pre-Balance Sheet Taxes shown as due and payable on any Buyer-Filed Income Tax
Return prepared in compliance with this Article, exceeds the amount, if any,
of such Taxes reflected as a liability in the relevant Balance Sheet, (i)
Freeport shall pay to the applicable Buyer(s), without set-off or deduction,
an amount equal to 80% of such excess within ten days after request therefore
by the Buyers by submission of an invoice to Freeport evidencing such payment
and a statement showing the allocation to Pre-Balance Sheet Taxes and (ii) if
the SMMA Participant has exercised the Candelaria Tag-Along Right and the Ojos
Tag-Along Right, the Tag-Along Sellers shall pay to the applicable Buyer(s),
without set-off or deduction, an amount equal to 20% of such excess within ten
days after request therefore by the Buyers by submission of an invoice to the
Tag-Along Sellers evidencing such payment and a statement showing the
allocation to Pre-Balance Sheet Taxes.

(e) The parties hereto will, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, elect
with the relevant Taxing Authority to treat a portion of any Straddle Tax
Period as a short taxable period ending as of the close of business on the
Closing Date.

(f) Except as provided in this Section, Freeport will be entitled to 80%, and,
if the SMMA Participant has exercised the Candelaria Tag-Along Right and the
Ojos Tag-Along Right, the Tag-Along Sellers shall be entitled to 20%, of any
refunds (including interest received thereon) in respect of any Pre-Balance
Sheet Tax Period net of any income taxes imposed thereon, except to the extent
any such refund was taken into account as a current asset in the relevant
Balance Sheet. Nothing in this Section will preclude the Companies from making
an election under Section 172(h) of the Code or any comparable provision of
Tax law or regulations for any taxable year beginning after the Closing Date.

(g) Buyers shall pay to each Seller any refund to which it is entitled
pursuant to paragraph (f) of this Section no later than ten days following
receipt of such refund, net of any income taxes imposed thereon. If any Pre-
Balance Sheet Income Tax paid by any Seller, the Companies, Subsidiary Sellers
or any predecessor or Affiliate thereof has the 

effect of reducing any Tax liability with respect to a Post-Balance Sheet Tax
Period, Buyers or the Companies shall promptly pay or cause to be paid to
Freeport 80%, and, if the SMMA Participant has exercised the Candelaria Tag-
Along Right and the Ojos Tag-Along Right, to the Tag-Along Sellers 20%, of the
amount of such reduction in Tax liability when either Buyer, any Affiliate of
either Buyer or the Companies are entitled thereto, net of any income taxes
imposed thereon, except to the extent any such credit or reduction in Tax
liability was taken into account as a current asset in the relevant Balance
Sheet. Unless such treatment is contrary to Applicable Law, the parties agree
that any amounts paid to either of the Sellers pursuant to paragraphs (f) and
(g) of this Section will be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for
Chilean tax law purposes.

(h) If Buyers notify Sellers in writing that the Companies have become
entitled to a refund of Taxes described above, and such refund (or any portion
thereof) is attributable solely to the carryback of losses, credits or similar
items of the Companies, as the case may be, from a Post-Balance Sheet Tax
Period, the Companies will file a claim for a refund with respect to such
losses, credits or similar items and the Companies will be entitled to retain
the amount of any such refund received (together with interest thereon).

(i) Except as provided in paragraphs (f) and (g) of this Section 7.04, the
Companies will be entitled to any refunds (including any interest received
thereon), in respect of any federal, state, local or foreign Tax liability of
the Companies.

(j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all Transfer
Taxes incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be borne by Buyers. Buyers will, at their own expense, file
all necessary Tax Returns with respect to all such Transfer Taxes, and, if
required by Applicable Law, each Seller will join in the execution of any such
Tax Returns.

Section 7.05. Cooperation on Tax and Accounting Matters.

(a) In the case of any audit, claim for refund, or administrative or judicial
proceeding involving any asserted Tax liability or refund with respect to the
Companies (any such audit, claim for refund, or proceeding relating to an
asserted Tax liability referred to herein as a "Contest") after the Closing
Date that relates solely to Pre-Balance Sheet Taxes, Freeport shall control
the conduct of such Contest, but Buyers shall have the right to participate in
such Contest at Buyers' own expense, and Freeport shall not be able to settle,
compromise and/or concede any portion of such Contest that is reasonably
likely to affect the Tax liability of the Companies for any taxable year (or
portion thereof) beginning after the Balance Sheet Date without the consent of
Buyers, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned; provided, that, with respect to any such Contest, if Freeport
notifies Buyers that it does not intend to pursue the Contest following the
receipt by Freeport of notice of such Contest, Buyers shall have the right to
assume control of such Contest and shall be able to settle, compromise and/or
concede such Contest in Buyers' sole discretion. 

(b) In the case of a Contest after the Closing Date that relates to a Straddle
Tax Period Buyers shall control the conduct of such Contest, but Freeport
shall have the right to participate in such Contest at its own expense, and
Buyers shall not settle, compromise and/or concede such Contest without the
consent of Freeport, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned.

(c) Buyers and each Seller agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to each
other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information and
assistance relating to the Companies (including access to books and records)
as is reasonably necessary for the filing of all Tax Returns (including any
report required pursuant to Section 6043A of the Code and all Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder), the making of any election relating to
Taxes, the preparation for any Contest, and the prosecution or defense of any
claim, suit or proceeding relating to any Tax. Buyers and each Seller shall
reasonably cooperate with each other in the conduct of any Contest or other
proceeding involving or otherwise relating to the Companies (or their income
or assets) with respect to any tax and each shall execute and deliver such
powers of attorney and other documents as are necessary to carry out the
intent of this Section 7.05(c). Any information obtained under this Section
7.05(d) shall be kept confidential, except as may be otherwise necessary in
connection with the filing of Tax Returns or in the conduct of a Contest or
other Tax proceeding.

(d) Buyers and each Seller shall (i) retain all books and records with respect
to Taxes pertaining to the Companies for a period of at least six years
following the Closing Date and abide by all record retention agreements
entered into with any Taxing Authority for all periods required by such Taxing
Authority; and (ii) provide the other party with at least 30 days' prior
written notice before destroying any such books and records, during which
period the party receiving the notice can elect to take possession, at its own
expense, of such books and records.

ARTICLE 8 
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

Section 8.01. Continuing Employees. (a) Prior to the Closing, the Buyers
shall, or shall cause a Company to, make an offer of employment to each
Specified Service Provider on terms consistent with those provided under this
Section 8.01. In addition, as of the Closing Date, Buyers shall cause the
Companies to continue the employment of all Company Employees provided that it
is understood that the foregoing statement does not constitute a guarantee of
continued employment. As of the Closing, or such other later date as set forth
in the Transition Services Agreement, the Company Employees who are employed
by the Companies and the Specified Service Providers who have accepted
employment with a Company (the "Continuing Employees") shall cease to be
covered by the employee benefit plans of Freeport and its Affiliates (which,
for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include the Companies from and after the
Closing) and instead shall be covered by the employee benefit plans of a Buyer
or its Affiliates, including, commencing on the Closing Date, the Companies,
as applicable. In addition to any obligation either Buyer or its Affiliates
may have under Applicable Law, for the period 

beginning on the Closing Date and continuing through the first anniversary of
the Closing Date, Buyers shall, or shall cause the Companies to, provide the
Continuing Employees, to the extent that the Continuing Employees remain so
employed, with (i) fixed cash compensation that is no less favorable than the
compensation of each such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing
Date, (ii) incentive compensation opportunities comparable to those provided
to each such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date and
(iii) benefits (including severance) substantially comparable in the aggregate
to the benefits (including severance) provided by the Companies to each such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date.

(b) Prior to the Closing, each Company shall assume all liabilities related to
Company Employees and Specified Service Providers set forth opposite such
Company's name in Section 8.01(b) of the Companies Disclosure Schedule.

Section 8.02. Buyer Plans. In addition to any obligation either Buyer or its
Affiliates may have under Applicable Law:

(a) With respect to any employee benefit plan maintained by either Buyer or
its Affiliates in which any Continuing Employee becomes a participant, for
purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting and benefit
accrual (other than benefit accrual under a defined benefit pension plan of
such Buyer or its Affiliates), each Continuing Employee's service with
Freeport, the Companies and any of their respective Affiliates (as well as
service with any predecessor employer, to the extent service with the
predecessor employer is so recognized) shall be treated as service with such
Buyer and its Affiliates; provided, however, that such service need not be
recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication
of benefits.

(b) Each Buyer shall waive, or shall cause its Affiliates to waive, unless
legally unable to do so, any preexisting conditions, limitations, exclusions,
actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods under any welfare benefit
plan maintained by such Buyer or any of its Affiliates in which Continuing
Employees (and their eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate from
and after the Closing Date. Each Buyer shall recognize, or shall cause its
Affiliates to recognize, all co-payments, deductibles and similar expenses and
out-of-pocket maximums incurred by each Continuing Employee (and his or her
eligible dependents) prior to the Closing Date for purposes of satisfying any
analogous deductible and co-payment limitations and out-of-pocket requirements
under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which such Continuing Employee
(and his or her eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate from and
after the Closing Date.

Section 8.03. No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Without limiting the generality of
Section 12.09, no provision of this Article 8, express or implied: (a) is
intended to confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities
hereunder upon any Person (including, without limitation, any Continuing
Employees and any dependent or beneficiary thereof) other than the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, (b) shall
constitute an amendment of, or an undertaking to amend, any Employee Benefit
Plan or any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement 

maintained by Freeport, Buyers or any of their respective Affiliates or (c) is
intended to prevent either Buyer or its Affiliates from amending or
terminating any Employee Benefit Plan in accordance with its terms.

explicitly specified therein, except that for such covenants and agreements
that survive for such shorter period, breaches thereof shall survive
indefinitely or until the latest date permitted by law; provided that the
covenants and agreements of Freeport in Sections 2.03 and 5.02, including
breaches thereof, shall survive the Closing for a period of 90 days.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any breach of representation, warranty,

Agreement shall survive the time at which it would otherwise terminate

giving rise to such right of indemnity shall have been given to the party
against whom such indemnity may be sought prior to such time.

Section 10.02. Indemnification. (a) Effective at and after the Closing, each
Seller hereby, severally and not jointly, indemnifies Buyers and their
Affiliates (including, following the Closing, the Companies) against and
agrees to hold each of them harmless from (x) any and all damage, loss and
expense (including reasonable expenses of investigation and reasonable
attorneys' fees and expenses in connection with any action, 

suit or proceeding) ("Damages") actually suffered by Buyers or any of their
Affiliates arising out of the failure of any representation or warranty made
by such Seller in this Agreement to be true and correct on and as of the date
hereof or, in the case of the Closing Date Representations only, the Closing
Date (or with respect to any representation or warranty that is made as of a
specific date, the failure of such representation or warranty to be true and
correct as of such date) (each such failure, a "Seller Warranty Breach") or
breach of covenant or agreement made or to be performed by such Seller
pursuant to this Agreement, other than any Damages arising out of any
Specified Matter (as defined in Schedule 10.02), and (y) Specified Matter
Indemnifiable Costs (as defined in Schedule 10.02); provided that with respect
to indemnification by any Seller for Seller Warranty Breaches pursuant to
clause (x) of this Section 10.02(a) (other than Seller Warranty Breaches in
respect of the Seller Fundamental Representations), (i) no Seller shall be
liable with respect to any individual claim unless the Damages with respect to
the underlying Seller Warranty Breach (or series of related Seller Warranty
Breaches) exceeds US$200,000, (ii) no Seller shall be liable unless the
aggregate amount of Damages with respect to all Seller Warranty Breaches,
disregarding any Damages for which no Seller is liable pursuant to clause (i),
exceeds (A) if the SMMA Participant does not exercise the SMMA Candelaria Tag-
Along Right and does not exercise the SMMA Ojos Tag-Along Right, US$18,000,000
or (B) if the SMMA Participant exercises the SMMA Candelaria Tag-Along Right
and the SMMA Ojos Tag-Along Right, US$22,500,000, and then only to the extent
of such excess and (iii) Sellers' maximum liability for all such Seller
Warranty Breaches shall not exceed (A) if the SMMA Participant does not

Ojos Tag-Along Right, US$270,000,000 or (B) if the SMMA Participant exercises
the SMMA Candelaria Tag-Along Right and the SMMA Ojos Tag-Along Right,
US$337,500,000; provided, further, that each Seller's maximum liability for
all such Seller Warranty Breaches (including in respect of the Seller
Fundamental Representations) and for all Specified Matter Indemnifiable Costs,
shall not exceed such Seller's Allocable Share of the Base Purchase Price.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the sole remedy for any Seller Warranty
Breach of Section 3.12 or any breach of Section 2.03 or Section 5.02 shall be
as set forth in Section 2.03, and neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates
shall be entitled to indemnification therefor and (ii) neither Seller shall
have any indemnification obligation with respect to any Seller Warranty Breach
of any representation or warranty in respect of, or any breach of any covenant
or agreement of, the other Seller or such other Seller's Subsidiary Sellers,
and each Seller's indemnification liability with respect to any Seller
Warranty Breach of any representation or warranty in respect of the Companies
and with respect to any Specified Matter Indemnifiable Costs shall be limited
to such Seller's Allocable Share of the Damages or Specified Matter
Indemnifiable Costs for which indemnification is owed in accordance with this

Agreement to be true and correct on and as of the 

date hereof or the Closing Date (or with respect to any representation or
warranty that is made as of a specific date, the failure of such
representation or warranty to be true and correct as of such date) (each such
failure, a "Buyer Warranty Breach") or breach of covenant or agreement made or
to be performed by either Buyer pursuant to this Agreement; provided that with
respect to indemnification by Buyers for Buyer Warranty Breaches pursuant to
this Section (other than Buyer Warranty Breaches in respect of the Buyer

Warranty Breach (or series of related Buyer Warranty Breaches) exceeds
$200,000, (ii) Buyers shall not be liable unless the aggregate amount of
Damages with respect to such Buyer Warranty Breaches, disregarding any Damages
for which Buyers are not liable pursuant to clause (i), exceeds (A) if the
SMMA Participant does not exercise the SMMA Candelaria Tag-Along Right and
does not exercise the SMMA Ojos Tag-Along Right, US$18,000,000 or (B) if the
SMMA Participant exercises the SMMA Candelaria Tag-Along Right and the SMMA

excess and (iii) Buyers' maximum liability for all such Buyer Warranty
Breaches shall not exceed (A) if the SMMA Participant does not exercise the
SMMA Candelaria Tag-Along Right and does not exercise the SMMA Ojos Tag-Along
Right, US$270,000,000 or (B) if the SMMA Participant exercises the SMMA
Candelaria Tag-Along Right and the SMMA Ojos Tag-Along Right, US$337,500,000;
provided, further, that Buyers' maximum liability for all such Buyer Warranty
Breaches (including in respect of the Buyer Fundamental Representations) shall
not exceed the Base Purchase Price paid by Buyers.

Section 10.03. Third Party Claim Procedures. (a) The party seeking
indemnification under Section 10.02 (the "Indemnified Party") agrees to give
prompt notice in writing to the party against whom indemnity is to be sought
(the "Indemnifying Party") of the assertion of any claim or the commencement
of any suit, action or proceeding by any third party (a "Third Party Claim")
in respect of which indemnity may be sought under such Section. Such notice
shall set forth in reasonable detail such Third Party Claim and the basis for
indemnification (taking into account the information then available to the
Indemnified Party). The failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the
extent such failure shall have actually prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of
any Third Party Claim and, subject to the limitations set forth in this
Section, shall be entitled to control and appoint lead counsel for such
defense, in each case at its own expense (it being understood that Freeport
shall be entitled to control the defense of any Third Party Claims with
respect to which indemnification is sought from all Sellers). Notwithstanding
the foregoing sentence, Buyers and their Affiliates shall control and appoint
lead counsel for the defense of any Specified Matter subject to Section 10.06
below.

(c) If the Indemnifying Party shall assume the control of the defense of any
Third Party Claim in accordance with the provisions of this Section 10.03, (i)
the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (which 

shall not be unreasonably withheld) before entering into any settlement of
such Third Party Claim, if the settlement does not fully and unconditionally
release the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates from all liabilities and
obligations with respect to such Third Party Claim or the settlement imposes
injunctive or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party or any of
its Affiliates and (ii) the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate
in the defense of any Third Party Claim and to employ separate counsel of its
choice for such purpose. The fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall
be paid by the Indemnified Party.

(d) Each party shall cooperate, and cause their respective Affiliates to
cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim and shall
furnish or cause to be furnished such records, information and testimony, and
attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals,
as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

Section 10.04. Direct Claim Procedures. In the event an Indemnified Party has
a claim for indemnity under Section 10.02 against an Indemnifying Party that
does not involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party agrees to give
prompt notice in writing of such claim to the Indemnifying Party. Such notice
shall set forth in reasonable detail such claim and the basis for
indemnification (taking into account the information then available to the
Indemnified Party). The failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the
extent such failure shall have actually prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.

Section 10.05. Calculation of Damages. (a) The amount of any Damages payable
under Section 10.02 by the Indemnifying Party shall be net of any (i) amounts
actually recovered by the Indemnified Party under applicable insurance
policies or from any other Person alleged to be responsible therefor, and (ii)
Tax benefit actually realized by the Indemnified Party arising from the
incurrence or payment of any such Damages. Each Indemnified Party shall use
reasonable best efforts to collect any amounts available under insurance
coverage, or from any other Person alleged to be responsible, for any Damages
payable under Section 10.02. If the Indemnified Party receives any amounts
under applicable insurance policies, or from any other Person alleged to be
responsible for any Damages, subsequent to an indemnification payment by the
Indemnifying Party, then such Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the
Indemnifying Party for any payment made or expense incurred by such
Indemnifying Party in connection with providing such indemnification payment
up to the amount received by the Indemnified Party, net of any expenses
incurred by such Indemnified Party in collecting such amount, and without
interest.

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under Section 10.02 for (i) any
Damages reflected as a liability in the relevant Balance Sheet other than with
respect to Specified Matters, (ii) any matter that is the subject of Section
2.03, (iii) any consequential, special, indirect or punitive Damages (except
for punitive Damages awarded against an Indemnified Party in a Third Party
Claim or consequential, special or indirect damages with respect to Specified
Matters), or (iv) Damages for lost profits. 

(c) In the case of any Damages suffered or incurred by the Companies
(including with respect to Specified Matters), the amounts recoverable by any
Indemnified Party in respect of such Damages shall be limited to 80% of the
amount of such Damages, unless the SMMA Participant exercises either the SMMA
Candelaria Tag-Along Right or the SMMA Ojos Tag-Along Right.

(d) Each Indemnified Party must use commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate in accordance with Applicable Law any loss for which such Indemnified
Party seeks indemnification under this Agreement. If such Indemnified Party
mitigates its loss after the Indemnifying Party has paid the Indemnified Party
under any indemnification provision of this Agreement in respect of that loss,
the Indemnified Party must notify the Indemnifying Party and promptly pay to
the Indemnifying Party the extent of the value of the benefit to the
Indemnified Party of that mitigation (less the Indemnified Party's reasonable
costs of mitigation) and without interest.

Section 10.06. Environmental Procedures. (a) Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, no Seller shall be liable under
this Agreement for, and neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall be
indemnified for, any Damages relating to Environmental Matters to the extent
such Damages: (i) arise out of any sampling, testing or other invasive
investigation of the air, soil, soil gas, surface water, groundwater, building
materials or other environmental media, or any disclosure, report or
communication relating to any Environmental Matter to any Governmental
Authority or other third Person, unless such sampling, testing, investigation,
disclosure, report or communication is required by Applicable Law or is
necessary to respond to any Third Party Claim against any of Buyers or their
Affiliates; (ii) result from any material construction, renovation, expansion,
demolition, shutdown or closure of any asset, facility or real property
following the Closing; or (iii) exceed those Damages that must be incurred to
satisfy, in a reasonably cost-effective manner, the minimum requirements of a
Governmental Authority pursuant to applicable Environmental Law using where
possible risk-based standards, engineering, use or institutional controls or
deed or other restrictions.

(b) Other than with respect to any Specified Matter (control of which is
addressed in Section 10.03(b)), as between Sellers and any of Buyers or their
Affiliates, Freeport shall have the right at its option to control, or cause
its Affiliates to control, any Environmental Matter that is subject to
indemnification under this Agreement, including the disclosure, investigation,
negotiation, performance, remediation, monitoring, settlement and resolution
of such matter. With respect to any Environmental Matter (including any
Specified Matter) subject to indemnification under this Agreement, (i) the
controlling party shall keep the other party reasonably informed and (ii) to
the extent Freeport or any of its Affiliates is the controlling party, each
Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, cooperate with Freeport and
its Affiliates and representatives, provide to Freeport and its Affiliates and
representatives reasonable access to properties, facilities, information and
documents and reasonably promptly provide to Freeport and its Affiliates and
representatives copies of all communications received from or delivered to any
other Person. With respect to any Specified Matter, (A) Buyers shall and shall
cause their Affiliates to keep Freeport and its Affiliates and representatives
reasonably 

informed, provide to Freeport and its Affiliates and representatives such
other information and documents as they may reasonably request and provide to
Freeport and its Affiliates and representatives copies of all communications
received from or delivered to any other Person, (B) Freeport shall be entitled
to participate in the defense of such Specified Matter and to employ, at
Freeport's expense, separate counsel of its choice for such purpose and (C)
the Buyers shall obtain prior written consent of Freeport (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld) before entering into any settlement of such Specified
Matter if the settlement does not fully and unconditionally release Freeport
and its Affiliates from all liabilities and obligations with respect to such
Specified Matter or the settlement imposes injunctive or other equitable
relief against Freeport or its Affiliates.

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, no
Seller shall have any liability for, and neither Buyer nor any of its
Affiliates shall be indemnified for any Damages relating to or arising out of
any Specified Matter, except to the extent Specified Matter Indemnifiable
Costs are payable pursuant to clause (y) of Section 10.02(a). For the
avoidance of doubt, Specified Matter Indemnifiable Costs shall not include,
and no Seller shall have any liability for, (i) any attorneys' or other legal
fees, or expenses of investigation, arising out of or relating to any
Specified Matter; or (ii) any expenses, costs or liabilities to the extent
relating to factual allegations or claims not alleged in the Original Matter
(as defined in Schedule 10.02) or which otherwise relate to conditions first
existing after the Closing Date.

Section 10.07. Assignment of Claims. If the Indemnified Party receives any
payment from an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Damages or Specified
Matter Indemnifiable Costs pursuant to Section 10.02 and the Indemnified Party
could have recovered all or a part of such Damages or Specified Matter
Indemnifiable Costs from a third party (a "Potential Contributor") based on
the underlying Claim asserted against the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified
Party shall assign such of its rights to proceed against the Potential
Contributor as are necessary to permit the Indemnifying Party to recover from
the Potential Contributor the amount of such payment.

Section 10.08. Exclusivity. Except as specifically set forth in this
Agreement, effective as of the Closing Date, each Buyer, on behalf of itself
and its Affiliates, waives any rights and claims such Buyer or its Affiliates
may have against each Seller or its Affiliates, whether in law or in equity,
relating to the Company or the Subject Shares or the transactions contemplated
hereby, including with respect to any Specified Matter. The rights and claims
waived by Buyers include claims for contribution or other rights of recovery
arising out of or relating to any Environmental Law (whether now or
hereinafter in effect), claims for breach of contract, breach of
representation or warranty, negligent misrepresentation and all other claims
for breach of duty. After the Closing, Section 10.02 will provide the
exclusive remedy for any misrepresentation, breach of warranty, covenant or
other agreement or other claim arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 10.09. Adjustment to the Purchase Price. Unless such treatment is
contrary to Applicable Law, any amount paid by Sellers or Buyers under this
Article 10, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, will be
treated as an adjustment 

to the Purchase Price, with the applicable withholding to be made with respect
to any such payments in accordance with Applicable Law. It is the intention of
the parties to treat any amount paid by Sellers or Buyers under this Article
10 as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for all federal, state, local and
foreign Tax purposes, and the parties agree to file their Tax Returns
accordingly, except as otherwise required by a change in Applicable Law or a
final determination.

ARTICLE 11 
TERMINATION

Section 11.01. Grounds for Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at
any time prior to the Closing:

(a) by mutual written agreement of Sellers and Buyers;

(b) by any party if the Closing shall not have been consummated on or before
December 26, 2014;

provided that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
shall not be available to any party whose breach of any representation or
warranty, or failure to perform any covenant or obligation under this
Agreement, shall have been the cause of the failure of the Closing to occur
prior to such date; or

(c) by any party if consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby would
violate any non-appealable final order, decree or judgment of any Governmental
Authority having competent jurisdiction.

The party(ies) desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
11.01(a) or Section 11.01(b) shall give notice of such termination to the
other party(ies).

Section 11.02. Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated as
permitted by Section 11.01, such termination shall be without liability of any
party (or any stockholder, director, officer, employee, agent, consultant or
representative of such party) to the other party to this Agreement; provided
that if such termination shall result from the willful (i) failure of any
party to fulfill a condition to the performance of the obligations of the
other party, (ii) failure to perform a covenant of this Agreement or (iii)
breach by any party hereto of any representation or warranty or agreement
contained herein, such party shall be fully liable for any and all Damages
incurred or suffered by the other party as a result of such failure or breach.
The provisions of Sections 6.01, 12.03, 12.05, 12.06 and 12.07 shall survive
any termination hereof pursuant to Section 11.01.

long as one of such courts shall have subject matter jurisdiction over such

State of New York, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably consents to the
jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts
therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or

EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE FOREGOING WAIVER IS INTENDED TO BE IRREVOCABLE
UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF MICHIGAN AND OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

Section 12.08. Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

Section 12.09. Counterparts; Effectiveness; Third Party Beneficiaries. This
Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, by original
telefacsimile or electronic signature, with the same effect as if the
signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement
shall become effective as to each party relative to the other party(ies)
hereto when such party shall have signed a counterpart hereof and shall have
received a counterpart hereof signed by such other party(ies) hereto. Until
and unless a party has received a counterpart hereof signed by any other
party(ies), this Agreement shall have no effect with respect to such other
party(ies) and such other party(ies) shall not have any right or obligation
hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other

Person other than the parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns.

Section 12.10. Entire Agreement. The Transaction Agreements and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the parties
with 

respect to the subject matter thereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both oral and written, between the parties with respect to the
subject matter thereof.

Section 12.11. Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

Section 12.12. Disclosure Schedules. Freeport has set forth information on the
Companies Disclosure Schedule in a section thereof that corresponds to the
section of this Agreement to which it relates. A matter set forth in one
section of the Companies Disclosure Schedules need not be set forth in any
other section so long as its relevance to such other section of the Companies
Disclosure Schedule or section of the Agreement is reasonably apparent on the
face of the information disclosed therein to the Person to which such
disclosure is being made. The parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the
Companies Disclosure Schedule to this Agreement may include certain items and
information solely for informational purposes for the convenience of Buyers
and (ii) the disclosure of any matter in the Companies Disclosure Schedule
shall not be deemed to constitute an acknowledgment by any Seller that the
matter is required to be disclosed by the terms of this Agreement or that the
matter is material.

Section 12.13. Specific Performance. The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce

States District Court for the Southern District of New York or any New York
State court sitting in New York City, in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled at law or in equity.

EXECUTION VERSION



AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

AMENDMENT No. 1 (this "Amendment") dated as of October 29, 2014 to the Stock
Purchase Agreement, dated as of October 6, 2014 (the "Purchase Agreement")
among LMC Candelaria SpA, a Chilean corporation and LMC Ojos del Salado SpA, a
Chilean corporation (each, a "Buyer" and collectively, "Buyers") and Freeport
Minerals Corporation (formerly known as Freeport-McMoRan Corporation), a
Delaware corporation ("Freeport") by and among the parties hereto.

WHEREAS, the Buyers and Freeport desire to amend the Purchase Agreement as
provided herein.

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows:

SECTION 1. Definitions. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined
herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Purchase Agreement.

SECTION 2. Amendments. The Purchase Agreement is hereby amended as follows:

(a)The following definition of "Azul" is hereby added to Section 1.01 of the
Purchase Agreement after the definition of "Aurex" and before the definition
of "Balance Sheets":

"Azul" means Azul SpA, a Chilean corporation.

(b) The definition of "Transaction Agreements" in Section 1.01 of the Purchase
Agreement is hereby amended by replacing the reference to "Section 2.02(c)" to
"Section 2.02(d)".

(c) The definition of "Transition Services Agreement" in Section 1.01 of the
Purchase Agreement is hereby amended by replacing the reference to "Lundin
Mining Chile SpA" with a reference to "Azul".

(d) Section 2.02(d) of the Purchase Agreement is hereby amended by replacing
the words "a Buyer or its Affiliate" with the word "Azul".

(e) Sections 2.02(g) and 5.03(a)(i) of the Purchase Agreement are hereby
amended by replacing each reference to "Lundin Mining Chile SpA" with a
reference to "Azul".

(f) Section 2.02 of the Purchase Agreement is hereby amended by adding the
following language as paragraph (m):

(m) An Affiliate of Lundin and Minera Freeport McMoRan South America Limitada
shall enter into a stock purchase agreement, substantially in the form
attached as Exhibit D. 

(g) Section 8.01(a) of the Purchase Agreement is hereby amended and restated
in its entirety as set forth below:

"(a) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates
to, transfer to Azul the employment of each Specified Service Provider who is
listed in Item 16 of Section 1.01 of the Companies Disclosure Schedule and is
employed by Seller or one of its Affiliates as of immediately prior to
Closing. As soon as practicable after Closing on a date or dates to be
mutually agreed between Freeport and Buyer, but in no event later than
December 31, 2014, (1) Seller shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to,
terminate each Specified Service Provider (other than those that have been
transferred to Azul prior to Closing or those that have resigned) and (2) the
Buyers shall, or shall cause a Company to, make an offer of employment to each
Specified Service Provider (other than those that have been transferred to
Azul prior to Closing) on terms consistent with those provided under this
Section 8.01. In addition, as of the Closing Date, the Buyers shall cause the
Companies to continue the employment of all Company Employees provided that it
is understood that the foregoing statement does not constitute a guarantee of
continued employment. As of the Closing, or such other later date as set forth
in the Transition Services Agreement, the Company Employees who are employed
by the Companies, the Specified Service Providers who are employed by Azul,
and the Specified Service Providers who have accepted employment with a
Company, Azul or an Affiliate of the Buyer (the "Continuing Employees") shall
cease to be covered by the employee benefit plans of Freeport and its
Affiliates (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include the Companies
or Azul from and after the Closing) and instead shall be covered by the
employee benefit plans of a Buyer or its Affiliates, including, commencing on
the Closing Date, the Companies and Azul, as applicable. In addition to any
obligation either Buyer or its Affiliates may have under Applicable Law, for
the period beginning on the Closing Date and continuing through the first
anniversary of the Closing Date, the Buyers shall, or shall cause the
Companies, Azul or Affiliates of the Buyer to, provide the Continuing
Employees, to the extent that the Continuing Employees remain so employed,
with (i) fixed cash compensation that is no less favorable than the
compensation of each such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing
Date, (ii) incentive compensation opportunities comparable to those provided
to each such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date and
(iii) benefits (including severance) substantially comparable in the aggregate
to the benefits (including severance) provided by the Companies to each such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date."

(h) Schedule 2.01 to the Purchase Agreement is hereby amended and restated in
its entirety as set forth in Annex 1 to this Amendment. 

(i) Exhibit A to the Purchase Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its
entirety as set forth in Annex 2 to this Amendment.

modified or amended by the terms and conditions of this Amendment, the
Purchase Agreement remains in full force and effect in accordance with its
terms.
