("</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>PacWest</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") (collectively hereinafter referred to as the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Parties</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"). </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State
of Delaware (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>DGCL</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), CapitalSource will merge with and into PacWest (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Merger</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), with PacWest as
the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes referred to in such capacity as the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Surviving Corporation</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"); and </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the respective boards of directors of each of CapitalSource and PacWest have determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby are advisable and in the
best interests of CapitalSource and PacWest, as applicable, and their respective stockholders, and have approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and, in
the case of PacWest, the PacWest Certificate of Incorporation Amendment, all upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; and </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
immediately after the Merger, CapitalSource Bank, a California state-chartered industrial bank and a wholly-owned subsidiary of CapitalSource
("</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>CapitalSource Bank</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), will merge with and into Pacific Western Bank, a California state-chartered bank and wholly-owned subsidiary of PacWest

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
for United States federal income tax purposes (and, where applicable, state and local income tax purposes), the Parties intend that the Merger will qualify as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section&nbsp;368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Code</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"); and </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
as an inducement for each Party to enter into this Agreement, certain stockholders of each of CapitalSource and PacWest have simultaneously herewith entered into a Voting
Agreement (each a "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Voting Agreement</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>" and collectively, the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Voting Agreements</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") in connection with the
Merger; and </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, (i)&nbsp;as a condition and inducement to PacWest's willingness to enter into this Agreement, CapitalSource is
entering into a stock option agreement, dated as of the date hereof, with PacWest, granting to PacWest an option to purchase Shares of CapitalSource Common Stock (the
"</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>CapitalSource Stock Option Agreement</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") and (ii)&nbsp;as a condition and inducement to CapitalSource's willingness to enter into this Agreement,
PacWest is entering into a stock option agreement, dated as of the date hereof, with CapitalSource, granting to CapitalSource an option to purchase shares of PacWest Common Stock (the
"</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>PacWest Stock Option Agreement</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"); and </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Parties desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain conditions to the Merger. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW,
