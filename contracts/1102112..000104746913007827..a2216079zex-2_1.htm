CapitalSource shall notify PacWest in writing prior to the Effective Time of the number of Shares and Excluded Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

  

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within five (5) Business Days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares (other than holders of Excluded Shares) notice advising 

  

      

  

such holders of the effectiveness of the Merger, including appropriate
transmittal materials specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof, as provided in Section
3.03(f)) and instructions for surrendering the Certificates (or affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent (such materials and instructions
to include customary provisions with respect to delivery of an
"agent\'s message" with respect to Book-Entry Shares and to be in such form
and have such provisions as PacWest and CapitalSource may reasonably agree).
Upon the surrender of a Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in Section 3.03(f)) or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent in
accordance with the terms of such transmittal materials, the holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor (x) a certificate representing that number of whole shares of PacWest
Common Stock that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this Article
III and (y) a check in the amount (after giving effect to any required tax
withholdings as provided in Section 3.03(g)) equal to the Cash
Consideration multiplied by the number of Shares held by such holder plus any
cash in lieu of fractional shares, and the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued
on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not
registered in the transfer records of CapitalSource, a certificate
representing the proper number of shares of PacWest Common Stock, together
with a check for any cash to be paid upon due surrender of the Certificate,
may be issued and/or paid to such a transferee if the Exchange Agent is
presented with the Certificate formerly representing such Shares and/or all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that
any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

  

 (c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares; Voting_. All shares of PacWest Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be deemed issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and if ever a dividend or other distribution is declared by PacWest in respect of the PacWest Common Stock, the record date for which is at or after the Effective Time, that declaration shall include dividends or other distributions in respect of all shares issuable pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends or other distributions in respect of the PacWest Common Stock shall be paid to any holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Shares until such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 3.03(f)) or Book-Entry Shares are surrendered for exchange in accordance with this Article III. Subject to the effect of applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 3.03(f)) or Book-Entry Shares, there shall be issued and/or paid to the holder of the certificates representing whole shares of PacWest Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (A) at the time of such surrender, the dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to such whole shares of PacWest Common Stock and not paid and (B) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such whole shares of PacWest Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to surrender. 

  

 (d) _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no fractional shares of PacWest Common Stock will be issued and any holder of Shares entitled to receive a fractional share of PacWest Common Stock but for this Section 3.03(d) shall be entitled to receive a cash payment in lieu thereof (rounded to the nearest cent), which payment shall be determined by multiplying (i) the PacWest Average Closing Price by (ii) the fraction of the share (rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of PacWest Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 3.01(a). 

   

 (e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Fund shall be administered by the Exchange Agent until such time as any unclaimed portion thereof is delivered to a public official 

  

      

  

pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. None of
the Surviving Corporation, PacWest, the Exchange Agent or any other Person
shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws.

   

 (f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by PacWest, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of PacWest Common Stock and any cash, unpaid dividends or other distributions that would be payable or deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement had such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate been surrendered. 

  

 (g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of PacWest and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or PacWest, as the case may be, such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by PacWest or the Surviving Corporation to the applicable Governmental Authority, and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or PacWest, as the case may be. 

  

 (h) _Dissenting Shares_. No Person who has perfected a demand for appraisal rights pursuant to § 262 of the DGCL shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration or any dividends or other distributions pursuant to this Article III unless and until the holder thereof shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such holder\'s right to appraisal under the DGCL, and any Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to receive only the payment provided by § 262 of the DGCL with respect to Shares owned by such Dissenting Stockholder. If any Dissenting Stockholder shall have effectively withdrawn or lost the right to dissent with respect to any Shares, such Shares shall thereupon be treated as though such Shares had been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.01 of this Agreement. CapitalSource shall give PacWest prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to applicable Law received by CapitalSource relating to stockholders\' rights of appraisal, and CapitalSource and PacWest shall consult and mutually agree on the strategy for any negotiations and proceedings with respect to demand for appraisal under the DGCL. CapitalSource shall not, except with the prior written consent of PacWest, or as required by Law, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisals, offer to settle or settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands. 

  

 (i) _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the issued and outstanding Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for Shares or the issued and outstanding shares of PacWest Common Stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of PacWest Common Stock, shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, redenomination, merger, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, then the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted and as so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event, be the Merger Consideration for purposes of this Agreement.

 (e) Each party agrees that it will, and will cause its representatives to, hold any information obtained pursuant to this Section 5.05 in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of May 5, 2013 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), between the Parties. 

  

 (f) No investigation by either Party of the business and affairs of the other Party shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement, or the conditions to such Party\'s obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the CapitalSource Stock Option Agreement and the PacWest Stock Option Agreement. 

  

  

    
 5.06 _ Acquisition Proposals. _ Each Party agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective officers, directors and employees shall, and that it shall direct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries\' agents and representatives (including any financial advisor, attorney or accountant retained by it or acting on its behalf) not to, directly or indirectly, initiate, solicit, encourage or otherwise facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer with respect to an Acquisition Proposal. Each Party further agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective officers, directors and employees shall, and that it shall direct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its agents and representatives (including any financial advisor, attorney or accountant retained by it or acting on its behalf) not to, directly or indirectly, engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential information or data to, or have any discussions with, any Person relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or otherwise facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement an Acquisition Proposal; _provided, however_ , that nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent CapitalSource, the CapitalSource Board, PacWest or the PacWest Board from (A) complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that such rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such rules would otherwise have under this Agreement; (B) at any time prior, but not after the CapitalSource Meeting or the PacWest Meeting, as applicable, is convened, providing information in response to a request therefor by a Person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal if such Party receives from the Person so requesting such information an executed confidentiality agreement on terms not less restrictive in the aggregate to the other party than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement; or (C) engaging in any negotiations or discussions with any Person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal if and only to the extent that, (i) in each such case referred to in clause (B) or (C) above, such Party\'s board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would 

        

reasonably be expected to violate the directors\' respective fiduciary duties
under applicable Law. Each Party agrees that it will immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations
with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition
Proposals. Each Party agrees that it will take the necessary steps to promptly
inform the individuals referred to in the first sentence hereof of the
obligations undertaken in this Section 5.06. Each Party agrees that it will
notify the other Party promptly, but in no event later than the
next succeeding Business Day, if any such inquiries, proposals or offers are
received by, any such information is requested from, or any such discussions
or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, any of its
representatives, indicating, in connection with such notice, the name of such
Person and the material terms and conditions of any proposal or offer and
thereafter shall keep such other Party informed, on a current basis, of the
status and terms of any such proposals or offers and the status of any such
discussions or negotiations. As used in this Agreement, (i) " _Acquisition
Proposal_ " means (A) any proposal, offer or inquiry with respect to a merger,
joint venture, partnership, consolidation, dissolution, liquidation, tender
offer, recapitalization, reorganization, share exchange, business combination
or similar transaction involving such Party or any of its Subsidiaries that
if consummated, would result in any Person (or the stockholders of any
Person) owning 15% or more of the total voting power of such Party or the
surviving entity in a merger involving such party or the resulting parent
company of such surviving entity and (B) any proposal or offer to acquire in
any manner, directly or indirectly, 15% or more of the total voting power of

Subsidiaries or 15% or more of such Party\'s consolidated total assets
(including, without limitation, equity securities of its Subsidiaries), in
each case other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

    
 5.07 _ Certain Policies. _ Immediately prior to the Effective Time and provided that each Party has confirmed in writing that all conditions to its obligations to effect the Merger have been satisfied or waived and that it is prepared to effect the Merger, CapitalSource shall, consistent with GAAP, the rules and regulations of the SEC and the rules and regulations of the CDBO and applicable banking Law, modify or change its loan, other real estate owned, accrual, reserve, Tax, litigation and real estate valuation policies and practices (including loan classifications and levels of reserves) so as to be applied on a basis that is consistent with that of PacWest; _provided, however,_ that unless the modification or changes would otherwise be necessary to be consistent with applicable Law or with regulatory accounting principles and GAAP, no such modification or change shall constitute or be deemed to be a breach, violation of or failure to satisfy any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement, condition or other provision of this Agreement or otherwise be considered in determining whether any such breach, violation or failure to satisfy shall have occurred, or as an admission or acknowledgement by CapitalSource that any such modification or change is appropriate or required or that any financial statement or information previously provided by CapitalSource was incorrect in any respect. 

  

    
 5.08 _ Regulatory Applications. _ (a) Each of PacWest and CapitalSource shall cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts to prepare and file, or in the case of PacWest cause to be filed, all documentation to effect all necessary notices, reports and other filings and to obtain all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third parties and/or Governmental Authorities in order to consummate the Merger, the Bank Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby; and any initial filings with Governmental Authorities (other than the SEC) shall be made by PacWest as soon as reasonably practicable after the execution hereof and in any event within forty-five (45) days of the date hereof. Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, each of PacWest and CapitalSource shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable, each shall consult with the other on, all written information submitted to any third party and/or any Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of such Parties agrees to act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Each Party hereto agrees that it shall consult with the other Party hereto with respect to the obtaining of all permits, 

        

consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and/or
Governmental Authorities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the CapitalSource Stock Option Agreement and
the PacWest Stock Option Agreement, and each Party shall keep the other Party
apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby (including promptly furnishing the other with copies of
the non-confidential portions of notices or other communications received by
PacWest or CapitalSource, as the case may be, from any third party and/or
Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger, the Bank Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the CapitalSource Stock
Option Agreement and the PacWest Stock Option Agreement, and, to the extent
permitted by Law, providing descriptions of any oral communications from such
Persons). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall
be deemed to require CapitalSource or PacWest to take any action, or commit
to take any action, or agree to any condition or restriction, in connection
with obtaining the foregoing permits, consents, approvals and authorizations
of Governmental Authorities that would reasonably be likely, in each case
following the Effective Time (but regardless when the action, condition or
restriction is to be taken or implemented), to (i) have a Material Adverse
Effect with respect to the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole or (ii) require PacWest, Pacific Western Bank, the Surviving
Corporation or the surviving bank in the Bank Merger to raise additional
capital in an amount that would materially reduce the economic benefits of the
Merger to the holders of PacWest Common Stock (including the CapitalSource
stockholders in respect of the shares of PacWest Common Stock received by them
in the Merger) (a " _Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition_ ").

  

  

 (b) Each Party agrees, upon request, to furnish the other Party with all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders, as applicable, and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with any filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of such other Party to any third party and/or Governmental Authority. 

  

  

    
 5.09 _ Indemnification; Director\'s and Officer\'s Insurance. _ (a) From and after the Effective Time, PacWest and the Surviving Corporation agree that they will indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and officer of CapitalSource (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ " and, collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against all costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including, without limitation, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) (each a " _Claim_ "), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law (and PacWest or the Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification). Further, the Surviving Corporation shall assume, perform and observe the obligations of CapitalSource under any agreements in effect as of the date of this Agreement to indemnify those Persons who are or have at any time been directors and officers of CapitalSource for their acts and omissions occurring prior to the Closing Date in their capacity as officers or directors. 

  

  

 (b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph (a) of this Section 5.09, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify PacWest or the Surviving Corporation thereof, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve PacWest or the Surviving Corporation of any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party if such failure does not materially prejudice PacWest or the Surviving Corporation. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) PacWest or the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and PacWest and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable to such Indemnified 

  

      

  

Party for any legal expenses or other counsel or any other expenses
subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with the defense
thereof; _provided, however_ , that none of PacWest or the Surviving
Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment
in any Claim for which indemnification has been sought by an Indemnified
Party hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out
of such Claim or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents in writing to such
settlement, compromise or consent, (ii) the Indemnified Party will cooperate
in the defense of any such matter and (iii) PacWest and the Surviving Party
shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written
consent; _provided, however,_ that PacWest and the Surviving Corporation
shall not have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party if and when a
court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such
determination shall have become final, that the indemnification of such
Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by
applicable Law.

  

 (c) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall provide that portion of director\'s and officer\'s liability insurance (" _D andO Insurance_") that serves to reimburse the present and former officers and directors (determined as of the Effective Time) of CapitalSource (as opposed to the portion that serves to reimburse CapitalSource) with respect to claims against such directors and officers arising from facts or events which occurred before the Effective Time, which DandO Insurance shall contain at least the same coverage and amounts, and contain terms and conditions no less advantageous, as that coverage currently provided by CapitalSource; _provided, however,_  that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in the aggregate for such six (6)-year period more than 300% of the current amount expended on an annual basis by CapitalSource to maintain or procure such DandO Insurance; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the Surviving Corporation is unable to maintain or obtain the DandO Insurance called for by this Section 5.09, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain as much comparable insurance as is available at a cost in the aggregate for such six (6)-year period up to 300% of the current annual premium; _provided, further,_ that officers and directors of CapitalSource may be required to make application and provide customary representations and warranties to the Surviving Corporation\'s insurance carrier for the purpose of obtaining such DandO Insurance. In lieu of the foregoing, either Party may, with the approval of the other Party, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, purchase, at or prior to the Effective Time, a six-year prepaid "tail" policy on terms and conditions providing substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of the directors\' and officers\' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by CapitalSource and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or prior to the Effective Time, covering without limitation the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, at an aggregate cost up to but not exceeding 300% of the current annual premium for such insurance. If such prepaid "tail" policy has been obtained prior to the Effective Time, PacWest shall cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation, and no other party shall have any further obligation to purchase or pay for insurance pursuant to this Section 5.09(c). 

  

 (d) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any other Person, then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.09. 

  

      

                                    

    

    
 5.10 _ Benefit Plans. _ (a) From the Effective Time through the first anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Continuation Period_ "), PacWest shall provide, or cause to be provided to any employee of CapitalSource or any of its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (such employees " _Continuing Employees_ ") while employed by PacWest or its Subsidiaries base salary, incentive compensation opportunities and benefits (other than severance benefits) that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the base salary, incentive compensation opportunities and benefits provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time. After the Continuation Period, Continuing Employees will be paid base salary and be eligible to participate in the employee benefit and compensation plans, programs, policies and arrangements of PacWest and its Subsidiaries on the same basis and terms and conditions as apply to similarly situated employees of PacWest and its Subsidiaries. With respect to severance benefits, Continuing Employees shall be eligible for severance benefits on the terms and conditions set forth on Section 5.10(a) of the CapitalSource Disclosure Schedule. PacWest will cause each of its employee benefit and compensation plans (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Executive Severance Pay Plan, as in effect from time to time, and, after the Continuation Period the Employee Severance Pay Plan) to take into account, for purposes of eligibility, vesting, levels of benefits and benefit accrual thereunder, the service of the Continuing Employees with CapitalSource and its Affiliates (including without limitation any predecessor entities) as if such service were with PacWest, to the same extent that such service was credited under a comparable plan of CapitalSource or any of its Subsidiaries (except to the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits for the same period of service and other than for benefit accrual purposes under any defined benefit pension plan of PacWest or its Subsidiaries). 

  

  

 (b) If any of the Continuing Employees (and their beneficiaries) become eligible to participate in a disability medical, dental or health plan of PacWest, PacWest shall cause each such plan to (i) waive any preexisting condition limitations to the extent such conditions were covered under the applicable disability medical, dental or health plans of CapitalSource or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) honor under such plans any deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such Continuing Employees and their beneficiaries during the portion of the calendar year prior to commencement of participation in such PacWest plan and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation, evidence of insurability requirement or actively-at-work requirement which would otherwise be applicable to such employee and their beneficiaries on or after the Effective Time to the extent such employee or beneficiary had satisfied any similar limitation or requirement under an analogous plan prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (c) Effective as of no later than the day immediately preceding the Effective Time, CapitalSource shall provide PacWest with a copy of a resolution or plan amendment evidencing that CapitalSource\'s 401(k) Plan is in the process of being terminated effective as of no later than the day immediately preceding the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that the effectiveness of such termination may be conditioned on the consummation of the Merger. The form and substance of such resolutions or plan amendment shall be subject to the review and reasonable and timely approval of PacWest. CapitalSource also may take such other actions in furtherance of terminating CapitalSource\'s 401(k) Plan as it determined to be reasonably appropriate; _provided_ , _however_ , that the effectiveness of any such actions may be conditioned on the consummation of the Merger. PacWest shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, designate a tax-qualified defined contribution plan of PacWest or one of its Affiliates which provides benefits substantially similar to those provided under the CapitalSource 401(k) Plan (such plan(s), the " _PacWest 401(k) Savings Plan_ ") that either (i) currently provides for the receipt from Continuing Employees of "eligible rollover distributions" (as such term is defined under Section 402 of the Code), including loans, or (ii) shall be amended prior to the Effective Time to provide for the receipt from the Continuing Employees of eligible rollover distributions, including loans. Each Continuing Employee who is a participant in CapitalSource\'s 401(k) Plan shall be immediately eligible to commence participation in the PacWest 401(k) Savings Plan as of the Closing Date and given the opportunity to receive a 

  

      

  

distribution of his or her account balance under the CapitalSource 401(k)
Plan and shall be given the opportunity to elect to "roll over" such account
balance (including any outstanding loan) to the PacWest 401(k) Savings Plan.
Prior to the Effective Time, PacWest will provide to CapitalSource evidence
(including without limitation resolutions of the Board of Directors and
amendments to the PacWest 401(k) Savings Plan, as applicable) that the
PacWest 401(k) Savings Plan shall accept such rollovers; _provided_ , that any
resolutions or amendments effectuating such rollover shall be subject to the
review and reasonable and timely approval of CapitalSource.

  

 (d) PacWest and CapitalSource hereby acknowledge that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall constitute a "change in control" (or term or concept of similar import) of (i) CapitalSource and its Subsidiaries under the terms of the CapitalSource Benefit Plans listed in Section 5.10(d) of the CapitalSource Disclosure Schedule and (ii) PacWest and its Subsidiaries under the terms of the PacWest Benefit Plans listed in Section 5.10(d) of the PacWest Disclosure Schedule, in each case, whether reference in any such plan to a "change in control" (or term or concept of similar import) is with respect to a transaction involving CapitalSource or any of its Subsidiaries or PacWest or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable. From and after the Effective Time, PacWest shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor all obligations and rights under the CapitalSource Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms; _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of clarity and notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the transactions contemplated by this Agreement constitute a "change in control" (or term or concept of similar import) for purposes of the payment or settlement (but not the vesting or any other right that is not the payment or settlement) of any awards or payments under CapitalSource Benefit Plans that constitute deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code that would otherwise be paid or settled upon a change in control unless the transactions contemplated by this Agreement constitute a "change in control event" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code. 

  

 (e) Nothing herein shall (i) be treated as an amendment to any particular Benefit Plan, (ii) limit the ability of PacWest to amend or terminate any of the Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms at any time, (iii) limit the ability of PacWest to retain or terminate the employment of any particular Continuing Employee or (iv) create any third-party beneficiary rights in any employee of CapitalSource or any of its Subsidiaries, any beneficiary or dependent thereof, or any collective bargaining representative thereof, with respect to the compensation, terms and conditions of employment and/or benefits that may be provided to any Continuing Employee by PacWest or its Subsidiaries or under any benefit plan which Parent or its Subsidiaries may maintain. 

  

  

    
 5.11 _ Notification of Certain Matters. _ Each of CapitalSource and PacWest shall give prompt notice to the other of any fact, event or circumstance known to it that (i) is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all other facts, events and circumstances known to it, to result in a Material Adverse Effect or to prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of CapitalSource or PacWest, as the case may be, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) would cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein. 

  

    
 5.12 _ Covenant Relating to the Tax Status of the Agreement. _ Neither PacWest nor CapitalSource shall take or cause to be taken any action that prevents or impedes, or could reasonably be expected to prevent or impede, the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. 

   

    
 5.13 _ Third-Party Agreements. _ (a) The Parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain (i) the consents or waivers required to be obtained from any third parties in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and the CapitalSource Stock Option Agreement and the PacWest Stock Option Agreement (in such form and content as mutually 

        

agreed by the Parties) promptly after the date of this Agreement and (ii) the
cooperation of such third parties to effect a smooth transition in accordance
with the Parties\' timetable at or after the Effective Time. The Parties
shall cooperate in minimizing the extent to which any Contracts will continue
in effect following the Effective Time, in addition to complying with
the prohibitions in Section 5.01(l).

  

  

 (b) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.13(a), each of the Parties shall use all reasonable efforts to provide data processing, item processing and other processing support or outside contractors to assist in performing all tasks reasonably required to result in a successful conversion of the data and other files and records of CapitalSource and its Subsidiaries to PacWest\'s production environment, in such a manner sufficient to ensure that a successful conversion will occur at the time (on or after the Effective Time) mutually agreed by the Parties, subject to any applicable Laws, including Laws regarding the exchange of information and other Laws regarding competition. The Parties agree that they shall cause appropriate representatives to meet at least once per week or as otherwise agreed by such representatives commencing on the date hereof to plan for such conversion. In an effort to ensure that conversion will be effected at the time mutually agreed by the Parties, both Parties agree to reasonably cooperate to identify duplicate deposit and loan accounts and close and reopen such accounts with unique account numbers thirty (30) to sixty (60) days prior to the Closing Date. Subject to applicable Laws, the Parties shall cooperate to cause all customer notices to be mailed prior to the Closing Date. 

  

  

    
 5.14 _ CapitalSource Stock Options; CapitalSource RSUs; CapitalSource Restricted Shares; CapitalSource Deferred Units. _ (a) As of the Effective Time, each option to acquire Shares (a " _CapitalSource Stock Option_ ") granted under the CapitalSource Second Amended and Restated 2000 Equity Incentive Plan or the CapitalSource Third Amended and Restated Equity Incentive Plan (the " _CapitalSource Stock Plans_ ") that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time and that has an exercise price per Share that is less than the sum of (i) the Cash Consideration and (ii) the product of the (x) Exchange Ratio multiplied by (y) the PacWest Average Closing Price (the sum of (i) plus (ii), the " _Option Payment Amount_ "), shall vest as of the Effective Time to the extent unvested and shall be cancelled and converted into only the right to receive that number of shares of PacWest Common Stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (1) the product of (x) the number of Shares subject to such CapitalSource Stock Option multiplied by (y) the excess of the Option Payment Amount over the exercise price per Share of such CapitalSource Stock Option by (2) the PacWest Average Closing Price, which number of shares of PacWest Common Stock shall be delivered to the holder of such CapitalSource Stock Option as soon as reasonably practicable (but no later than five (5) Business Days) following the Closing Date by the Surviving Corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the holder of any such CapitalSource Stock Option shall be entitled to receive a cash payment in lieu of any fractional shares of PacWest Common Stock that become issuable to the holder pursuant to the preceding sentence, which payment shall be determined by multiplying (1) the PacWest Average Closing Price by (2) the fraction of the share (rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of PacWest Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive, and shall be paid to the holder (less applicable Taxes required to be withheld) as soon as reasonably practicable (but no later than five (5) Business Days) following the Closing Date by the Surviving Corporation (the " _Fractional Share Payment_ "). As of the Effective Time, each CapitalSource Stock Option granted under the CapitalSource Stock Plans that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time and that has an exercise price per Share that is equal to or greater than the Option Payment Amount shall be cancelled for no consideration and shall cease to exist. 

  

  

 (b) As of the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit award granted under the CapitalSource Stock Plans (excluding any award deferred under the CapitalSource Amended and Restated Deferred Compensation Plan) (each, a " _CapitalSource RSU_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not vested, shall vest in full and be cancelled 

  

      

  

and shall only entitle the holder of such CapitalSource RSU to receive, as
soon as administratively practicable, but in no event more than five (5)
Business Days, after the Closing Date, a number of shares of PacWest Common
Stock equal to the product of (i) the number of Shares underlying such
CapitalSource RSU multiplied by (ii) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio, plus
any accrued but unpaid dividend equivalents in respect of such CapitalSource
RSUs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the holder of any such CapitalSource RSU
shall be entitled to receive a Fractional Share Payment in lieu of any
fractional shares of PacWest Common Stock that become issuable to the holder
pursuant to the preceding sentence. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Stock
Award Exchange Ratio_ " means the sum of the Exchange Ratio and the Cash
Portion Exchange Ratio. The " _Cash Portion Exchange Ratio_ " means the
quotient obtained by dividing (1) the Cash Consideration by (2) an amount
equal to the PacWest Average Closing Price. To the extent that any such
cancelled CapitalSource RSU constitutes "deferred compensation" under Section
409A of the Code, then distribution of the number of shares of PacWest Common
Stock and any Fractional Share Payment provided for in this Section 5.14(b) in
respect of such CapitalSource RSU shall occur on the date that settlement of
such CapitalSource RSU would occur under the applicable award agreement
absent the application of this Section 5.14(b) and, until such settlement
date, such CapitalSource RSU shall be credited to an account under the
CapitalSource Amended and Restated Deferred Compensation Plan in the award
holder\'s name and be credited with earnings and dividends in respect of
PacWest Common Stock following the Effective Time.

  

 (c) As of the Effective Time, each restricted stock award granted under the CapitalSource Stock Plans (each, a " _CapitalSource Restricted Share_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not vested, shall vest in full and be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder of such CapitalSource Restricted Share to receive, as soon as administratively practicable, but in no event more than five (5) Business Days, after the Closing Date, a number of shares of PacWest Common Stock equal to the product of (i) the number of Shares underlying such CapitalSource Restricted Share multiplied by (ii) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio, plus any accrued but unpaid dividend equivalents in respect of such CapitalSource Restricted Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the holder of any such CapitalSource Restricted Share shall be entitled to receive a Fractional Share Payment in lieu of any fractional shares of PacWest Common Stock that become issuable to the holder pursuant to the preceding sentence. 

  

 (d) As of the Effective Time, each right to receive a share of CapitalSource Common Stock or payment measured by the value of a share of CapitalSource Common Stock (each, a " _CapitalSource Deferred Unit_ ") held in an account under the CapitalSource Amended and Restated Deferred Compensation Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not vested, shall vest in full and be converted into the right to receive a number of shares of PacWest Common Stock (including credit for any fractional shares of Pacinco Common Stock) equal to the product of (i) the number of Shares underlying such CapitalSource Deferred Unit multiplied by (ii) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio, plus any accrued but unpaid dividend equivalents in respect of such CapitalSource Deferred Unit, and, until the applicable settlement date under the CapitalSource Amended and Restated Deferred Compensation Plan, such CapitalSource Deferred Unit shall be credited with earnings and dividends in respect of PacWest Common Stock following the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the holder of any CapitalSource Deferred Units shall be entitled to receive a cash payment in lieu of any fractional shares of PacWest Common Stock that become issuable to the holder at the time that such CapitalSource Deferred Units are settled in accordance with the CapitalSource Amended and Restated Deferred Compensation Plan and such holder\'s distribution elections. 

   

 (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the number of shares of PacWest Common Stock otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Section 5.14 to holders of CapitalSource Stock Options, CapitalSource RSUs, CapitalSource Restricted Shares and CapitalSource Deferred Units, and any 

  

      

  

Fractional Share Payments payable to the holder of any such awards, shall be
reduced by applicable Taxes required to be withheld (in the case of
CapitalSource RSUs that are deferred compensation and CapitalSource Deferred
Units, at the time of settlement of such rights). For purposes of the
satisfaction of any Tax withholding that is satisfied at the Effective Time
through a reduction in the number of shares of PacWest Common Stock otherwise
deliverable to the holder of CapitalSource Stock Options, CapitalSource RSUs,
CapitalSource Restricted Shares and CapitalSource Deferred Units under this
Section 5.14, (i) the value of the shares of PacWest Common Stock so withheld
shall be based on the average of the high and low sales prices of a share of
PacWest Common Stock on the NASDAQ Stock Market on the Closing Date, and (ii)
cash equal to the amount required to be withheld shall be remitted by PacWest
or the Surviving Corporation to the applicable Governmental Authority and for
all purposes of this Agreement such amount shall be treated as having been
paid to the holder of the CapitalSource Options, CapitalSource RSUs,
CapitalSource Restricted Shares or CapitalSource Deferred Units in respect of
which such Tax withholding was made.

  

 (f) At or prior to the Effective Time, CapitalSource, the CapitalSource Board or the compensation committee of the CapitalSource Board, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions which are, in CapitalSource\'s reasonable determination, necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Section 5.14.

Such financial statements shall be accompanied by a certificate of such Party\'s chief financial officer, 

        

dated as of the Effective Time, to the effect that such financial statements
continue to reflect accurately, as of the date of the certificate, the
financial condition of such Party in all material respects. Such Closing
Financial Statements shall also reflect accruals for all Professional Fees

financial officer, dated as of the Effective Time, to the effect that such
financial statements meet the requirements of this Section 5.17.

  

    
 5.17 _ Exchange Matters. _ Prior to the Closing Date, CapitalSource shall cooperate with PacWest and use reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules and policies of the NYSE to enable the delisting of the shares of CapitalSource Common Stock from the NYSE and the deregistration of the shares of CapitalSource Common Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time. Prior to the Closing Date, PacWest shall file with NASDAQ any required notices or forms with respect to the shares of PacWest Common Stock to be issued in the Merger.

transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the CapitalSource Stock Option
Agreement and the PacWest Stock Option Agreement, including the Merger, may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and
thereby and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Takeover Statute on
this Agreement, the CapitalSource Stock Option Agreement, the PacWest Stock
Option Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,

 8.03 _ Counterparts. _ This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts (including by facsimile), each of which shall be deemed to constitute an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

 8.08 _ Entire Understanding; No Third Party Beneficiaries. _ This Agreement (including the CapitalSource Disclosure Schedule and PacWest Disclosure Schedule attached hereto and incorporated herein), the Voting Agreements, the CapitalSource Stock Option Agreement, the PacWest Stock Option Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the Parties hereto and thereto with reference to the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and supersede all other prior agreements, understandings, representations and warranties, both written and oral, between the Parties or their officers, directors, agents, employees or representatives, with respect to the subject matter hereof. Except for Section 5.09, nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any Person, other than the Parties hereto or their respective successors, any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement. 

  

    
 8.09 _ Effect. _ No provision of this Agreement shall be construed to require CapitalSource or PacWest or any Affiliates or directors of any of them to take any action or omit to take any action which action or omission would violate any applicable Law (whether statutory or common Law), rule or regulation. 

  

    
 8.10 _ Severability. _ Except to the extent that application of this Section 8.10 would have a Material Adverse Effect on CapitalSource or PacWest or would prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of CapitalSource or PacWest to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable. 

  

    
 8.11 _ Enforcement of the Agreement. _ The Parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically 

        

the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any
state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled at law or in equity.

  

    
 8.12 _ Interpretation. _ When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections or Schedules, such reference shall be to a Section of, or Schedule to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation". 

  

    
 8.13 _ Assignment. _ This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation of law or otherwise. 

       

                                    

  

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be executed in counterparts by their duly authorized officers, all as of the day and year first above written.
