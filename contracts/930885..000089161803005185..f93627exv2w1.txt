ARTICLE II   CONVERSION AND EXCHANGE OF SECURITIES   Section 2.1
Conversion of Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of any holder of any shares of common
stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock") or
any capital stock of Merger Sub:   (a) Company Common Stock. Subject to this
Article II, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be cancelled in
accordance with Section 2.1(b)), together with each associated "Right" (as
defined in the Rights Agreement, dated as of February 3, 1999, between the
Company and BankBoston, N.A., as rights agent (the "Company Rights
Agreement")), shall be converted into the right to receive 2.175 (the
"Exchange Ratio") shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Parent ("Parent Common Stock"), payable upon the surrender of the
Certificates (as defined in Section 2.2(b)). All such shares of Company
Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a Certificate representing any such shares shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the shares of
Parent Common Stock pursuant to this Section 2.1(a), any dividends or
other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c) and any cash in lieu
of fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.2(d), all to be issued or
paid in consideration therefor upon the surrender of such Certificates in
accordance with Section 2.2, without interest (collectively, the "Merger
Consideration"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Exchange Ratio shall be
appropriately adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any stock split,
reverse split, reclassification, stock dividend (including any dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into Parent Common Stock or Company
Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with
respect to Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock occurring (or having a
record date) after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective
Time.   (b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock.
All shares of Company Common Stock, together with each associated "Right,"
that are (i) held by the Company as treasury shares or (ii) owned by Parent
or any wholly owned Subsidiary (as defined below) of Parent shall be
cancelled and retired and cease to exist, and no securities of Parent or
other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. As used in this
Agreement, the word "Subsidiary" means, with respect to any party, any
corporation or other organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated, of
which (A) such party or any other Subsidiary of such party is a general
partner (excluding partnerships, the general partnership interests of which
held by such party or any Subsidiary of such party do not have a majority of
the voting interest in such partnership), (B) such party or any Subsidiary of
such party owns in excess of a majority of the outstanding equity or voting
securities or interests or (C) such party or any Subsidiary of such party has
the right to elect at least a    3  majority of the board of directors or
others performing similar functions with respect to such corporation or other
organization.   (c) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub ("Merger Sub Common Stock")
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.   (d) Stock
Options. Outstanding options to purchase shares of Company Common Stock shall
be treated in the manner set forth in Sections 5.4 and 6.10 hereof.   (e)
Company Convertible Debt. The outstanding debt of the Company convertible
into shares of the Company\'s Common Stock (the "Company Convertible Debt")
pursuant to the terms of the Indenture dated as of April 5, 2002 between the
Company and Wilmington Trust Company (the "Indenture") shall become
convertible into that number of shares of Parent Common Stock that would have
been issued if the Company Convertible Debt had been converted into
Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent and the
Company shall use all reasonable efforts to take all such actions required
under the Indenture, in each case as may be necessary to comply with all of
the terms and conditions of the Indenture.   Section 2.2 Exchange of
Certificates.   (a) Exchange Agent. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent
shall designate a bank or trust company to act as Exchange Agent hereunder
(the "Exchange Agent"). As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit with or for the account of the Exchange Agent, for the
benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock, stock certificates
representing the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to
Section 2.1(a) in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock,
which shares of Parent Common Stock shall be deemed to have been issued at
the Effective Time. From time to time, Parent shall make available to the
Exchange Agent sufficient cash to make all cash payments in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.2(d).   (b) Exchange Procedures. As
soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent will instruct the
Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or
certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the "Certificates") that were
converted pursuant to Section 2.1(a) into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall
be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably
specify that are not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement), and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such letter of   
4  transmittal, duly executed, and such other customary documents as may
be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) certificates evidencing
that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock which such holder has the
right to receive in accordance with Section 2.1(a) in respect of the shares
of Company Common Stock formerly evidenced by such Certificate, (B) any
dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.2(c), and (C) any cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(d),
after giving effect to any tax withholdings required by applicable law, and
the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of
a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock which is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company as of the Effective Time, a
certificate representing the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock
may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate evidencing such Company
Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents
required to evidence and effect such transfer pursuant to this Section 2.2(b)
and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.
Until so surrendered, each outstanding Certificate that, prior to the
Effective Time, represented shares of Company Common Stock will be deemed,
from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to represent
only the right to receive upon surrender a certificate representing shares of
Parent Common Stock, any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to
Section 2.2(c) and any cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock payable pursuant to Section 2.2(d), in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement.   (c) Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Parent
Shares. No dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Parent
Common Stock for which the record date is after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the
shares of Parent Common Stock such holder is entitled to receive until such
holder surrenders such Certificate. Subject to applicable law, following
surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder
of the certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued
in exchange therefor, without interest, at the time of such surrender, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such shares of Parent Common
Stock.   (d) No Fractional Shares. No certificate or scrip
representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon
the surrender for exchange of Certificates, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights
of a stockholder of Parent. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock converted pursuant
to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of
a share of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates
delivered by such holder and the aggregate number of shares of Company Common
Stock represented thereby) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without
interest) in an amount equal to such fractional part of a share of Parent
Common Stock multiplied by the average of the last reported sales prices of
Parent Common Stock at the 4:00 p.m., New York City time, end of regular
trading hours on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") during the
five consecutive trading days ending on the    5  last trading day prior
to the Effective Time.   (e) Transfers of Ownership. If any certificate for
shares of Parent Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in
which the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will
be a condition to the issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered
will be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that
the person requesting such exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent
designated by it any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
issuance of a certificate for shares of Parent Common Stock in any name other
than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or have
established to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it that
such tax has been paid or is not payable.   (f) Termination of Exchange
Fund; No Liability. At any time following the first anniversary of the
Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to
deliver to it any shares of Parent Common Stock which had been made available
to the Exchange Agent and which have not been disbursed to holders of
Certificates, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to
Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar law) with
respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock upon due surrender of their
Certificates, without any interest thereon. Neither Parent, Merger Sub nor
the Company shall be liable to any holder of Company Common Stock or Parent
Common Stock, as the case may be, for such shares (or dividends
or distributions with respect thereto) delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or other similar law
following the passage of time specified therein.   (g) Withholding Rights.
Parent or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
person who was a holder of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time such amounts as Parent or the Exchange Agent is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Exchange Agent, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of the shares of Parent Common Stock in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by Parent or the Exchange Agent.  
(h) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock. At the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Company or the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common
Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to such time. If, after such
time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason,
they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.   (i)
Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Certificates shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in   
6  exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making
of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such shares of Parent
Common Stock as may be required pursuant to Section 2.1(a) as well as the
other Merger Consideration as provided in this Article II; provided, however,
that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the
issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates to deliver an agreement of indemnification in form satisfactory
to Parent, or a bond in such sum as Parent may reasonably direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against Parent or the Exchange Agent with
respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed.   Section 2.3 Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action. Each of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will take all such reasonable and lawful
action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to effectuate the Merger
in accordance with this Agreement as promptly as possible. If, at any time
after the Effective Time, any such further action is necessary or desirable
to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving
Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets, property,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company or Merger Sub, the
officers and directors of the Company and Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time are fully authorized in the name of their respective
corporations or otherwise to take, and will take, all such lawful and
necessary action.   Section 2.4 Material Adverse Effect.   (a) The term
"Company Material Adverse Effect" means any change, effect or circumstance
that, individually or when taken together with all other such similar or
related changes, effects or circumstances that have occurred prior to the
date of determination of the occurrence of the Company Material Adverse
Effect, (i) is materially adverse to the business, assets (including
intangible assets), liabilities, capitalization, financial condition or

market, economic or political conditions affecting the industries in which
the Company participates, provided that such change, effect or circumstance
does not have a substantially disproportionate adverse impact on the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (B) compliance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or the pendency or announcement of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; (C) any litigation brought or threatened by
stockholders of the Company (whether on behalf of the Company or otherwise)
arising out of or in connection with the announcement of this Agreement or
the consummation of the Merger; (D) any decrease in the market price or

its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii) materially adversely affects the
ability of Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby;
provided, however, that no change, effect or circumstance resulting solely
from any of the following shall be deemed to constitute, in and of itself, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect, nor shall it be taken into consideration when
determining whether there has occurred a Parent Material Adverse Effect: (A)
general market, economic or political conditions affecting the industries in
which Parent participates, provided that such change, effect or circumstance
does not have a substantially disproportionate impact on Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (B) compliance with the terms and conditions

circumstances under which they were and will be made, not misleading. None of
the Company\'s Subsidiaries is required to file any forms, reports,
schedules, statements or other documents with the SEC.   (b) Each of the

involved and fairly presented in all material respects or will fairly present
in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company
and its Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and the consolidated
results of its operations and cash flows for the periods indicated, except
that any unaudited interim financial statements are subject to normal

and regulations promulgated by the SEC, and the statements contained in any
such certifications are complete and correct; and the Company is otherwise in
compliance with all applicable effective provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
and the applicable listing and corporate governance rules of The Nasdaq
National Market.   Section 3.10 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Since
the date of the Company Balance Sheet, the Company has conducted its business
in the ordinary course consistent with past practice and, since such date,
there has not occurred: (i) any change, development, event or other

a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (b) Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any commitment to become a party to, any
joint venture, partnership agreement or any similar contract (including any
contract relating to any transaction, arrangement or relationship between or
among the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any
unconsolidated affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose
or limited purpose entity or person, on the other hand) where the purpose or
intended effect of such arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any material
transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the
Company\'s consolidated financial statements.   (c) Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any commitment to become a
party to, any tax shelter arrangement as described in Internal Revenue

Investigations. Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Reports filed and
publicly available on the SEC\'s EDGAR database prior to the date of this
Agreement (the "Filed Company SEC Documents"), there are no claims, actions,
suits, proceedings or, to the knowledge of the Company, governmental
investigations, inquiries or subpoenas (other than any actions, suits,
proceedings, investigations, inquiries or subpoenas challenging or otherwise
arising from or relating to the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) (a) pending against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any properties or assets of the Company or of any of its
Subsidiaries or (b) to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any properties or assets of the
Company or of any of its Subsidiaries, or (c) whether filed or threatened,

the three years prior to the date of this Agreement and at the time of such
settlement or compromise were material, other than in the case of (a) through
(c) above, such claims, actions, suits, proceedings,
investigations, inquiries or subpoenas that would not be reasonably likely to
have, in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company is subject to any outstanding
order, writ, injunction or decree that would reasonably be expected to
be    18  material or would reasonably be expected to prevent or delay
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. There
has not been since January 1, 2000 nor are there currently any internal
investigations or inquiries being conducted by the Company, its Board of
Directors (or any committee thereof) or any third party at the request of any

interest, self-dealing, fraudulent or deceptive conduct or other misfeasance
or malfeasance issues.   Section 3.13 Employee Benefit Plans, Options and
Employment Agreements.   (a) Section 3.13(a) of the Disclosure Schedule

maintained, or contributed to, by the Company, any of the Company\'s
Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA Affiliates or to which the Company, any of
the Company\'s Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates is
obligated to contribute, or under which any of them has or may have any
liability for premiums or benefits (collectively, the "Company Employee
Plans"). For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the
following meanings: (i) "Employee Benefit Plan" means any "employee pension
benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA), any "employee welfare
benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), and any other written or
oral plan, agreement or arrangement involving material compensation,

benefit of, or relating to, any current or former employee, officer or
director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate;
(ii) "ERISA" means the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as

applicable time was, a member of (A) a controlled group of corporations (as
defined in Section 414(b) of the Code), (B) a group of trades or businesses
under common control (as defined in Section 414(c) of the Code) or (C) an
affiliated service group (as defined under Section 414(m) of the Code or the
regulations under Section 414(o) of the Code), any of which includes or
included the Company or a Subsidiary.   (b) With respect to each Company
Employee Plan, the Company has made available to Parent complete and accurate
copies of (i) such Company Employee Plan (or a written summary of any
unwritten plan) together with all amendments, (ii) in the case of any plan
for which Forms 5500 are required to be filed, the most recent annual report
(Form 5500) with schedules attached, (iii) in the case of any plan that is
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, the most recent
determination letter from the IRS, (iv) each trust agreement, group annuity
contract, administration and similar material agreements, investment
management or investment advisory agreements, (v) the most recent summary
plan descriptions and employee handbook, or other similar material employee
communications, (vi) all personnel, payroll and employment manuals and
policies, and (vii) the most recent financial statements for each Company
Employee Plan that is funded.    19   (c) Each Company Employee Plan has
been administered in all material respects in accordance with ERISA, the Code
and all other applicable laws and the regulations thereunder and materially
in accordance with its terms and each of the Company, the Company\'s
Subsidiaries and their ERISA Affiliates have in all material respects met
their obligations with respect to each Company Employee Plan and have timely
made (or timely will make) all required contributions thereto. All material
filings and reports as to each Company Employee Plan required to have been
submitted to the Internal Revenue Service or to the United States Department
of Labor have been timely submitted. With respect to the Company Employee
Plans, no event has occurred, and, to the knowledge of the Company, there
exists no condition or set of circumstances in connection with which Parent,
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any plan participant could be
subject to any material liability (including penalties or taxes) under ERISA,
the Code or any other applicable law, nor will the negotiation or
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement give rise to
any such material liability.   (d) With respect to the Company Employee
Plans, there are no material benefit obligations for which contributions have
not been made or properly accrued and there are no benefit obligations which
have not been accounted for by reserves, or otherwise properly footnoted in
accordance with the requirements of GAAP, on the financial statements of the
Company. The assets of each Company Employee Plan which is funded are
reported at their fair market value on the books and records of such Employee
Benefit Plan.   (e) No Company Employee Plan has assets that
include securities issued by the Company, any of the Company\'s Subsidiaries
or any of their ERISA Affiliates.   (f) All the Company Employee Plans that
are intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code (each, a
"Qualified Plan") have received determination, opinion or advisory letters
from the Internal Revenue Service to the effect that such Company Employee
Plans are qualified and the plans and trusts related thereto are exempt from
federal income taxes under Sections 401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the
Code, or the Company has remaining a period of time under applicable U.S.
Department of the Treasury regulations or IRS pronouncements in which to
apply for such a letter and to make any amendments necessary to obtain a
favorable determination as to the qualified status of each such Qualified
Plan. To the Company\'s knowledge, no such determination, opinion or advisory
letter has been revoked and revocation has not been threatened, and no such
Employee Benefit Plan has been amended or operated since the date of its most
recent determination letter or application therefor in any respect, and no
act or omission has occurred, that would adversely affect its qualification
or materially increase its cost. There has been no termination, partial
termination or discontinuance of contributions to any Qualified Plan that
will result in material liability to the Company. Each Company Employee Plan
which is required to satisfy Section 401(k)(3) or Section 401(m)(2) of the
Code has been tested for compliance with, and satisfies in all material
respects the requirements of Section 401(k)(3) and Section 401(m)(2) of the
Code, as the case may be, for each plan year ending prior to the Closing Date
for which testing is required to be completed.    20   (g) Neither the
Company, any of the Company\'s Subsidiaries nor any of their ERISA Affiliates
has (i) ever maintained a Company Employee Plan which was ever subject to
Section 412 of the Code or Title IV of ERISA or (ii) ever been obligated to
contribute to a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of
ERISA). No Company Employee Plan is funded by, associated with or related to
a "voluntary employees\' beneficiary association" within the meaning of
Section 501(c)(9) of the Code.   (h) To the extent permitted by applicable
law, each Company Employee Plan (other than the Company Stock Plans or an
employment, severance, change in control or similar agreement with an
individual) is amendable and terminable unilaterally by the Company and any
of the Company\'s Subsidiaries party thereto or covered thereby at any time
without material liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a
result thereof, other than for benefits accrued as of the date of such
amendment or termination and routine administrative costs.   (i) Other than
as required under Section 601 et seq. of ERISA, none of the Company Employee
Plans promises or provides health or other welfare benefits (excluding normal
claims for benefits under the Company\'s group life insurance, accidental
death and dismemberment insurance and disability plans and policies) or
coverage to any person following retirement or other termination
of employment. Section 3.13(i) of the Disclosure Schedule lists each
Company Employee Plan which provides benefits after termination of employment
(other than medical benefits required to be continued under Section 4980B of
the Code and part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA) and the amount, if
any, by which the present value of benefits accrued under each such Company
Employee Plan exceeds the fair market value of the assets of each such
Company Employee Plan.   (j) There is no action, suit, proceeding, claim,
arbitration, audit or investigation pending or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened, with respect to any Company Employee Plan, other than
claims for benefits in the ordinary course. No Company Employee Plan is or
within the last three calendar years has been the subject of, or has received
notice that it is the subject of, examination by a government agency or a
participant in a government sponsored amnesty, voluntary compliance or
similar program.   (k) To the knowledge of the Company, each individual who
has received compensation for the performance of services on behalf of the
Company, any of the Company\'s Subsidiaries or its ERISA Affiliates has been
properly classified as an employee or independent contractor in accordance
with applicable law.   (l) Each Company Employee Plan maintained or
covering employees outside the United States, and the books and records
thereof, is in material compliance with all applicable laws, rules and
regulations of each applicable jurisdiction. Section 3.13(l) of the
Disclosure Schedule lists each country in which the Company or any of its
affiliates has operations and the number of employees in each such
country.   (m) Section 3.13(m) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth
a true, complete and correct list of (i) all employment agreements with
employees of the Company    21  or any of its Subsidiaries obligating
(or potentially obligating) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to make
annual cash payments in an amount equal to or exceeding $50,000; (ii) all
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who have executed a non-

and other arrangements of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to
which payments (or acceleration of benefits or vesting of options or lapse of
repurchase rights) may be required upon, or may become payable directly or
indirectly as a result of or in connection with, the negotiation or
consummation of the transactions contemplated by, or the execution of, this
Agreement. True, complete and correct copies of each of the foregoing
agreements to which any employee of the Company is a party have been made
available to Parent.   (n) All contributions required to be made with
respect to any Company Employee Plan on or prior to the Effective Time have
been or will be timely made or are reflected on the Company\'s balance sheet.
There are no pending, threatened or reasonably anticipated claims by or on
behalf of any Plan, by any employee or beneficiary covered under any such
Company Employee Plan, or otherwise involving any such Plan (other than
routine claims for benefits).   (o) The negotiation or consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, either alone or in
combination with another event, (i) entitle any current or former employee or
officer of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company to severance pay, or
any other payment from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii)
accelerate the time of payment or vesting, a lapse of repurchase rights or
increase the amount of compensation due any such employee or officer. There
is no Company Employee Plan or other contract, agreement, plan or arrangement
that, individually or collectively, could give rise to the payment of any
amount that would not be deductible pursuant to Sections 280G (determined
without regard to Section 280G(b)(4) of the Code) or 162(m) of the Code.  
Section 3.14 Labor Matters. (a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries are
in compliance in all material respects with all applicable laws respecting
employment, employment practices and occupational safety and health, terms
and conditions of employment and wages and hours, and are not engaged in any
unfair labor practices; (b) there are no actions, suits, claims or grievances
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
threatened, between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of their
respective employees, consultants or independent contractors, which actions,
suits, claims or grievances have or would reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect; (c) neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries is a party to any collective bargaining agreement or other
labor union contract applicable to persons employed by the Company or
its Subsidiaries, nor does the Company or any of its Subsidiaries know of
any activities or proceedings of any labor union to organize any such
employees; and (d) to the knowledge of the Company, there are no labor
disputes, strikes,    22  slowdowns, work stoppages, lockouts, or threats
thereof, by or with respect to any employees of, or consultants or
independent contractors to, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. No
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (i) to the Company\'s
knowledge is in violation of any term of any patent disclosure agreement,
non-competition agreement, or any restrictive covenant to a former employer
relating to the right of any such employee to be employed by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries because of the nature of the business conducted or
presently proposed to be conducted by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or to the use of trade secrets or proprietary information of others, or (ii)
in the case of any key employee or group of key employees, has given notice
as of the date of this Agreement to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
that such employee or any employee in a group of key employees intends to
terminate his or her employment with the Company. Neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries has any material liability for (i) a plant closing, as
defined in the Worker Adjustment and Retaining Notification Act of 1988,
as amended ( the "WARN Act"), or (ii) a mass layoff, as defined in the WARN
Act. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is currently engaged in
any layoffs or employment terminations sufficient in number to trigger
application of any similar state, local or foreign law.   Section 3.15
Properties; Encumbrances. Each of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries
has good and valid title to, or a valid leasehold interest in, all the
properties and assets which it purports to own or lease (real, tangible,
personal and mixed), including all the properties and assets reflected in the
Company Balance Sheet (except for personal property sold since the date of
the Company Balance Sheet in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice). All properties and assets reflected in the Company
Balance Sheet are free and clear of all Liens, except for Liens reflected on
the Company Balance Sheet and Liens for current taxes not yet due and other
Liens that do not materially detract from the value or impair the use of the
property or assets subject thereto. Section 3.15 of the Disclosure Schedule
sets forth a true, complete and correct list of all real property owned,
leased, subleased or licensed by the Company and the location of such
premises. Each of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries is and has been in
material compliance with the provisions of each lease or sublease for the
real property which is set forth in Section 3.15 of the Disclosure
Schedule.   Section 3.16 Taxes.   (a) For purposes of this Agreement,
"Tax" or "Taxes" shall mean taxes, fees, assessments, liabilities, levies,
duties, tariffs, imposts and governmental impositions or charges of any kind
in the nature of (or similar to) taxes, payable to any federal, state, local
or foreign taxing authority, or any agency or subdivision thereof, including
(i) income, franchise, profits, gross receipts, ad valorem, net worth, value
added, sales, use, service, real or personal property, special assessments,
capital stock, license, payroll, withholding, employment, social security,
workers\' compensation, unemployment compensation, utility, severance,
production, excise, stamp, occupation, premiums, windfall profits, transfer
and gains taxes, and (ii) interest, penalties, fines, additional taxes and
additions to tax imposed with respect thereto; and "Tax Returns" shall mean
returns, reports and information statements with respect to Taxes required to
be filed with a taxing authority,    23  domestic or foreign, including,
consolidated, combined or unitary tax returns and any amendments to any of
the foregoing.   (b) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have filed
with the appropriate taxing authorities all Tax Returns required to be filed
by them, except to the extent that the failure to file would not reasonably
be likely to have, in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, and
all such Tax Returns were true, complete and correct. All Taxes shown to be
due on such Tax Returns have been timely paid. There are no Tax Liens on any
assets of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof other than liens relating to
Taxes not yet due and payable. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has granted any outstanding waiver of any statute of limitations
with respect to, or any outstanding extension of a period for the assessment
of, any Tax. The accruals and reserves for Taxes (exclusive of any accruals
for "deferred taxes" or similar items that reflect timing differences between
tax and financial accounting principles) reflected in the Company Balance
Sheet are adequate to cover all Taxes accruable through the date thereof
(including interest and penalties, if any, thereon and Taxes being contested)
in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis with the Company
Balance Sheet. All liabilities for Taxes attributable to the period
commencing on the date following the date of the Company Balance Sheet were
incurred in the ordinary course of business and are consistent in type and
amount with Taxes attributable to similar prior periods.   (c) The Company
and each of its Subsidiaries have timely withheld with respect to its
employees all federal and state Taxes required to be withheld, except to the
extent that the failure to withhold would not reasonably be likely to have,
in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice of any Tax deficiency
outstanding, proposed or assessed against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received
any written notice of any audit examination, deficiency, refund litigation,
proposed adjustment or matter in controversy with respect to any Tax Return
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has filed any consent under Section 341(f) of the Code or agreed
to have Section 341(f)(2) of the Code apply to any disposition of a
subsection (f) asset (as defined in Section 341(f)(4) of the Code) owned by
the Company. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or
bound by any tax indemnity, tax sharing or tax allocation agreements with any
entity not included in the Company\'s consolidated financial statements most
recently filed by the Company with the SEC. Except for the group of which the
Company and its Subsidiaries are now currently members, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has ever been a member of an affiliated
group of corporations within the meaning of Section 1504 of the Code. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is liable for the Taxes of any person
under Treasury Regulation 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local
or foreign law) as a transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise.  
(d) The Company made available to Parent (i) complete and correct copies of
all income Tax Returns, examination reports and statements of deficiencies
assessed against or agreed to by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with
respect to all taxable years for which the statutes of limitation have not
expired.    24   (e) None of the assets of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries: (i) is property that is required to be treated as being
owned by any other person pursuant to the provisions of former Section
168(f)(8) of the Code; (ii) is "tax-exempt use of property" within the
meaning of Section 168(h) of the Code; or (iii) directly or indirectly
secures any debt the interest on which is tax exempt under Section 103(a) of
the Code.   (f) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
agreed nor is it required to make any material adjustment under Section 481
of the Code by reason of a change in accounting method or otherwise prior to
the Effective Time.   (g) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
is, or has been, a United States real property holding corporation (as
defined in Section 897(c)(2) of the Code) during the applicable period
specified in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code.   (h) Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has constituted either a "distributing
corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the meaning of Section
355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of stock qualifying for tax-free
treatment under Section 355 of the Code (A) in the two years prior to the
date of this Agreement or (B) in a distribution which could otherwise
constitute part of a "plan" or "series of related transactions" (within the
meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code) in connection with the Merger.   (i)
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action or knows
of any fact, agreement, plan or other circumstance that is reasonably likely
to prevent the Merger as qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code.   Section 3.17 Environmental Matters.   (a)
Except as set forth in Section 3.17 of the Disclosure Schedule (i) the
Company and its Subsidiaries are and have been in material compliance with
all Environmental Laws (as defined below); (ii) there has been no release or
threatened release of any pollutant, contaminant or toxic or hazardous
material, substance or waste, or petroleum or any fraction thereof (each a
"Hazardous Substance") on, upon, into or from any site currently
or heretofore owned, leased or otherwise used by the Company or its
Subsidiaries, except for such releases that would not reasonably be likely to
have, in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect; (iii) there have
been no Hazardous Substances generated by the Company or its Subsidiaries
that have been disposed of or come to rest at any site that has been included
in any published U.S. federal, state or local "superfund" site list or any
other similar list of hazardous or toxic waste sites published by any
Governmental Entity within or outside the United States, except as would not
reasonably be likely to have, in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect; and (iv) there are no underground storage tanks located on, no
polychlorinated biphenyls ("PCBs") or PCB-containing equipment used or stored
on, and no hazardous waste as defined by the Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act, as amended, stored on, any site owned or operated by the
Company or its Subsidiaries, except for the storage of hazardous waste in
compliance with    25  Environmental Law and except for such storage that
would not reasonably be likely to have, in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect. The Company and its Subsidiaries have made available to
Parent true and correct copies of all material environmental records,
reports, notifications, certificates of need, permits, pending permit
applications, correspondence, engineering studies, and environmental studies
or assessments relating to the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries
or any of their respective properties and assets.   (b) For purposes of this
Section 3.17, "Environmental Laws" means any law, regulation, or other
applicable requirement (whether domestic or foreign) relating to (i) releases
or threatened release of any Hazardous Substance; (ii) pollution or
protection of employee health or safety, public health or the environment; or
(iii) the manufacture, handling, transport, use, treatment, storage, or

applications owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the date
of this Agreement; and (iii) copyright registrations and pending copyright
applications owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the date
of this Agreement (collectively the "Registered Intellectual Property"). All
of the Registered Intellectual Property is owned solely by the Company or one
of its Subsidiaries.   (b) The Company or one or more of its Subsidiaries
owns, or has a valid right to use all of the Intellectual Property (as
defined below) that is used in the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as currently conducted.   (c) The Registered Intellectual
Property that is used in the business of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as currently conducted, is, to the Company\'s knowledge,
subsisting (except with respect to applications), and has not expired or been
cancelled, or abandoned.   (d) There is no pending or, to the Company\'s
knowledge, threatened (and at no time within the two years prior to the date
of this Agreement has there been pending any) material suit, arbitration or
other adversarial proceeding before any court, government agency or arbitral
tribunal or in any jurisdiction alleging that any activities or conduct of
the Company\'s or any of its Subsidiaries\' business infringes or will
infringe upon, violate or constitute the unauthorized use of the intellectual
property rights of any third party or challenging the ownership, validity,
enforceability or registerability of any Intellectual Property owned by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company is not party to any
settlements, covenants not to sue, consents, decrees, stipulations,
judgments, or orders resulting from suits, actions or similar legal
proceedings which (i) materially restrict the Company\'s or any of its
Subsidiaries\' rights to use any Intellectual Property owned by and   
26  material to the business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as
currently conducted, (ii) materially restrict the conduct of the business of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as currently conducted in order to
accommodate any third party\'s intellectual property rights, or (iii) permit
third parties to use any Intellectual Property owned by and material to the
business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as currently
conducted.   (e) The conduct of the business of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as currently conducted does not infringe upon any
intellectual property rights owned by any third party. The Company and its
Subsidiaries have taken reasonable measures to protect the proprietary nature
of the Intellectual Property owned by the Company or such Subsidiary that is
material to the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as currently
conducted (other than trade secrets with respect to which the Company
knowingly made a reasonable judgment to not keep such trade secrets
confidential and other than intellectual property rights that the Company
knowingly made a reasonable judgment not to seek to secure registration of
the applicable rights). To the Company\'s knowledge, no third party is
misappropriating, infringing, diluting or violating any intellectual property
owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is material to the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted, and no
intellectual property misappropriation, infringement dilution or violation
suits, arbitrations or other adversarial proceedings have been brought before
any court, government agency or arbitral tribunal against any third party by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which remain unresolved.   (f) The
Company and each of its operating Subsidiaries has, and uses reasonable
efforts to enforce, a policy of requiring each relevant employee who
participates in the development of Intellectual Property to execute a
confidentiality and assignment of proprietary rights agreement
substantially in the Company\'s standard form as set forth in Section 3.18(f)
of the Disclosure Schedule, and, except (i) as may be made under
nondisclosure agreements or other agreements containing nondisclosure
obligations, and (ii) for confidential information or trade secrets that the
Company knowingly made a reasonable judgment not to keep such confidential
information and trade secrets confidential, there has been no disclosure to
any third party by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of material
confidential information or material trade secrets of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries related to any material proprietary product currently being
marketed, sold, licensed or developed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (each such product owned by the Company or its Subsidiaries, a
"Proprietary Product"). All employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who
have made material contributions to the development of any Proprietary
Product (including all employees who have designed, written, tested or worked
on any software code contained in any Proprietary Product) have
signed confidentiality and assignment of proprietary rights agreements
substantially in one of the forms attached to Section 3.18(b) of the
Disclosure Schedule. All consultants and independent contractors who have
made material contributions to the development of any Proprietary Product
(including all consultants and independent contractors who have designed,
written, tested or worked on any software code contained in any Proprietary
Product) have assigned to the Company or one or more of its Subsidiaries (or
a third party that has assigned its rights in such Proprietary Product to the
Company or one or more of its Subsidiaries) all of their right, title and
interest (other than moral rights, if any) in and to the portions of such
Proprietary    27  Product developed by them in the course of their work
for the Company or one or more of its Subsidiaries (or applicable third
party). Assignments of the patents and patent applications listed in Section
3.18(a) of the Disclosure Schedule to the Company or one or more of its
Subsidiaries have been duly executed and filed with the United States Patent
and Trademark Office.   (g) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has (i) granted or is obligated to grant access to any of its source code
contained in any Proprietary Product, (ii) made its source code contained in
any Proprietary Product subject to any open source license, or (iii) licensed
or has the right to obtain any source code, object code or any open license
of any third party contained in any Proprietary Product (including in any
such case any conditional right to access or under which the Company has
established any escrow arrangement for the storage and conditional release of
any source code, object code or open license).   (h) None of the
Proprietary Products contains any third party software code that is, in whole
or in part, subject to the provisions of any open source or quasi-open source
license agreement under which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
obligated to make the source code for such Proprietary Product generally
available to the public.   (i) The Company does not have any obligation to
pay any third party any royalties or other fees in excess of $250,000 in the
aggregate in calendar year 2002 or in the period from January 1, 2003 through
September 30, 2003 for the use of Intellectual Property and no obligation to
pay such royalties or other fees will result from the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (j) Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of any material license, sublicense,
agreement or instrument to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
party or otherwise bound under which the Company or its Subsidiaries derive
rights to Intellectual Property that is material to the Company\'s or its
Subsidiaries\' business as currently conducted, nor will the consummation by
the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby result in any loss or
impairment of ownership by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of, or the
right of any of them to use, any Intellectual Property that is material to
the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted, nor,
to the Company\'s knowledge, require the consent of any Governmental Entity
or third party with respect to any such Intellectual Property. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any agreement under which a
third party would be entitled to receive or expand a license or any other
right to any intellectual property of Parent or any of Parent\'s affiliates
as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   (k) For purposes of this Agreement, "Intellectual
Property" shall mean trademarks, service marks, trade names, and internet
domain names, together with all goodwill, registrations and applications
related to the foregoing; patents and industrial design registrations or
applications (including any continuations, divisionals, continuations-   
28  in-part, renewals, reissues, re-examinations and applications for any of
the foregoing); works of authorship protected by copyright for E.U.
design registrations; copyrights (including any registrations and
applications for any of the foregoing); mask works rights and trade secrets
and other confidential information, know-how, proprietary processes,
formulae, algorithms, models, and methodologies; in each case used in or
necessary for the conduct of the business of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries, as currently conducted.   Section 3.19 Insurance. All fire and
casualty, general liability, business interruption, product liability,
sprinkler and water damage insurance policies and other forms of insurance
maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries have been made available
to Parent. Each such policy is in full force and effect and all premiums due
thereon have been paid in full. None of such policies shall terminate or
lapse (or be affected in any other materially adverse manner) by reason of
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  
Section 3.20 Rights Agreement. The Company has taken all action necessary to
ensure that so long as this Agreement shall not have been terminated pursuant
to Article VIII, (i) neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall, by virtue of the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, be deemed an "Acquiring Person" (as
that term is defined in the Company Rights Agreement), (ii) no "Rights" (as
that term is defined in the Company Rights Agreement) are issued or required
to be issued to the stockholders of the Company by virtue of the execution
and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and (iii) neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement nor the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated in this Agreement will trigger any other provisions of the
Company Rights Agreement, including giving rise to a Distribution Date or a
Shares Acquisition Date (each as defined in the Company Rights Agreement).
Except as permitted by Section 6.6 hereof, the Company has not amended the
Company Rights Agreement, redeemed the Rights thereunder or taken any other
action to make the Company Rights Agreement or the Rights thereunder
inapplicable, in each case, with respect to (a) any person or entity other
than Parent or Merger Sub or (b) any Acquisition Proposal (as defined in
Section 6.2(a)).   Section 3.21 Restrictions on Business. Except for this
Agreement, there is no agreement (other than agreements disclosed in response
to Section 3.6(h)), judgment, injunction, order or decree binding upon the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries which has or could reasonably be expected
to have the effect of prohibiting or impairing in any material respect any
business practice of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, acquisition of
property by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the conduct of business
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as currently conducted.   Section
3.22 Registration Statement; Proxy Statement/Prospectus. The information

amendment thereof or supplement thereto) is first mailed to stockholders or
at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting or at the time any
Regulation M-A Filing is filed with the SEC or as of the Effective Time,

material fact necessary to correct any statement in any earlier communication

standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation and has the
requisite corporate power and authority necessary to own, lease and operate
the properties it purports to own, lease or operate and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted or presently proposed to be conducted.
Each of Parent and Merger Sub is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign
corporation to do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction
where the character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the
nature of its activities makes such qualification or licensing necessary,
except for such failures to be so duly qualified or licensed and in good
standing that could not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.   Section 4.2 Capitalization.   (a) The authorized capital
stock of Parent consists of 6,000,000,000 shares of Parent Common Stock and
25,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Parent
Preferred Stock"). As of October 9, 2003, 2,184,705,255 shares of Parent
Common Stock are issued and outstanding.   (b) All of the outstanding shares
of Parent Common Stock as well as all shares of Parent Common Stock to be

to shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger, will be, when
issued in accordance with this Agreement, validly issued, fully paid and

dissolution or similar transaction involving the acquisition of 25% or more
of any class of equity securities or assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  
(b) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof
shall:   (i) except as set forth in this Section 6.2, withdraw,  amend or
modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a  manner adverse to
Parent or Merger Sub, the approval or  recommendation by the Company\'s Board
of Directors or any such  committee of this Agreement or the Merger (any such
withdrawal,  amendment, modification or proposal, a "Change of
Recommendation");   (ii) cause or permit the Company to enter into any 
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in  principle,
acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar  agreement constituting or
relating to any Acquisition Proposal  (other than a confidentiality agreement
referred to in Section  6.2(a) entered into in the circumstances referred to
in and  consistent with the provisions of Section 6.2(a)); or   (iii)
except as set forth in this Section 6.2 adopt,  approve or recommend to its
stockholders that they accept, or  propose publicly to adopt, approve or
recommend, any Acquisition  Proposal other than the Merger.  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of the Company  may, in
response to a Superior Proposal that did not result from a  breach by the
Company of this Section 6.2, effect a Change of  Recommendation or in the
case of a tender or exchange offer made  directly to its stockholders,
recommend that its stockholders    42    accept the tender or exchange
offer, if (A) the Superior Proposal  has been made and has not been withdrawn
and continues to be a  Superior Proposal; (B) the Company\'s Board of
Directors determines  in good faith, after receiving the advice of outside
counsel, that  it is necessary to do so in order to comply with its
fiduciary  obligations to the Company\'s stockholders under applicable law,
but  only at a time that is prior to the adoption of this Agreement at  the
Company Stockholders Meeting and is after the third business day  following
Parent\'s receipt of written notice advising Parent that  the Company\'s
Board of Directors desires to withdraw or modify the  recommendation due to
the existence of a Superior Proposal,  specifying the material terms and
conditions of such Superior  Proposal and identifying the person making such
Superior Proposal;  or (C) the Company shall have complied with this Section
6.2 and  shall not have breached in any material respect of the provisions 
set forth in Sections 6.3, 6.4 or 6.5. Nothing in this Section 6.2  shall be
deemed to (A) permit the Company to take any action  described in clauses
(ii) or (iii) (provided, that in the case of a  tender or exchange offer made
directly to its stockholders the  Company may recommend that its stockholders
accept the tender or  exchange offer) of the first sentence of this Section
6.2(b), or (B)  affect any obligation of the Company under this Agreement or
(C)  limit the Company\'s obligation to call, give notice of, convene and 
hold the Company Stockholders Meeting, regardless of whether the  Company\'s
Board of Directors has effected a Change of  Recommendation.   If Parent
makes a counterproposal to a Superior  Proposal, the Company shall consider
and cause its financial and  legal advisors to negotiate on its behalf in
good faith with respect  to the terms of such counterproposal. For purposes
of this  Agreement, a "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide, written 
proposal made by a third party to acquire, directly or indirectly,  including
pursuant to a tender offer, exchange offer, merger,  consolidation, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation,  dissolution or similar
transaction, for consideration consisting of  cash and/or securities, more
than 50% of the combined voting power  of the shares of Company Common Stock
then outstanding or all or  substantially all the assets of the Company and
otherwise on terms  which the Board of Directors of the Company determines in
its good  faith judgment (after receiving the advice of an independent 
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation), taking into  account
all of the terms and conditions of such proposal and this  Agreement
(including any proposal by Parent to amend the terms of  this Agreement) to
be more favorable to the Company\'s stockholders  than the Merger, to have a
reasonable likelihood of closing, and for  which financing, to the extent
required, is then committed or which,  in the good faith judgment of the
Board of Directors of the Company,  is reasonably capable of being, and
likely to be, obtained on the  proposed terms by such third party.   (c)
The Company agrees that as of the date of this Agreement, it shall cause and
it shall cause its Subsidiaries and affiliates (and shall direct its and
their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives and agents)
to immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
activities, discussions or negotiations with any person (other than Parent or
its representatives) conducted heretofore with respect to any   
43   Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall notify Parent promptly after
receipt by the Company (or its advisors) of any Acquisition Proposal or any
request for nonpublic information in connection with an Acquisition Proposal
or for access to the properties, books or records of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries by any person or entity that informs the Company that it is
considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal. Such notice to
Parent shall be made orally and in writing and shall indicate in reasonable
detail the identity of the offeror and the terms and conditions of such
proposal, inquiry or contact. The Company shall inform Parent promptly (and
in any event within 24 hours) of all material developments and the status of
any Acquisition Proposal, any negotiations or discussions with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic information in connection
with any Acquisition Proposal or for access to the properties, books or
records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any person or entity
that, to the Company\'s knowledge, is considering making, or has made, an
Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall provide Parent with copies of all
documents received from (to the extent such documentation sets forth the
terms or conditions of such Acquisition Proposal) or delivered or sent to any
person or entity that is considering making or has made an Acquisition
Proposal. The Company will promptly provide to Parent any non-public
information concerning the Company provided to any other party in connection
with an Acquisition Proposal which was not previously provided to Parent.  
(d) Nothing contained in this Section 6.2 shall prohibit the Company from
taking any action or disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from
making any disclosure to the Company\'s stockholders if the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after receiving the advice
of outside counsel, that it is necessary to do so under applicable law;
provided, however, that except as specifically permitted in this Section 6.2,
neither the Company nor its Board of Directors nor any committee thereof
shall withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, its
position with respect to this Agreement or the Merger or approve or
recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, an Acquisition
Proposal.   Section 6.3 Proxy Statement/Prospectus; Registration
Statement.   (a) As promptly as practicable after execution of this
Agreement, Parent and the Company shall in consultation with each other
prepare the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Registration Statement, and
the Company shall file with the SEC the Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Parent
shall file with the SEC the Registration Statement. The Company and Parent
shall use all reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement to
become effective as soon thereafter as practicable.   (b) The Company shall
use all reasonable efforts to mail the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to the
stockholders of the Company as soon as practicable after the Registration
Statement is declared effective by the SEC. Subject to the right of the
Company\'s Board of Directors to withdraw or modify its recommendation
pursuant to Section 6.2(b), the Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall include the
recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Company in favor of the
Merger.   44    (c) The Company shall furnish Parent with all information
concerning the Company and the holders of its capital stock and shall take
such other action as Parent may reasonably request in connection with the
Registration Statement and the issuance of the shares of Parent Common Stock.
If at any time prior to the Effective Time any event or circumstance relating
to the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries, affiliates,
officers or directors should be discovered by such party which should be set
forth in an amendment or a supplement to the Registration Statement or
Proxy Statement/Prospectus, such party shall promptly inform the other
thereof and take appropriate action in respect thereof.   (d) The Company
and Parent shall make any necessary filing with respect to the Merger under
the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder.   Section 6.4 Company Stockholders Meeting.   (a) The Company,
acting through its Board of Directors, shall take all actions in accordance
with applicable law, the Company Charter, the Company By-Laws and the rules
of The Nasdaq National Market to promptly and duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold as promptly as practicable, and in any event within sixty
(60) days after the declaration of effectiveness of the Registration
Statement, the Company Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of considering
and voting upon the approval of this Agreement and the Merger. Subject to
Section 6.2(b), to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, (i) the
Company\'s Board of Directors shall recommend adoption and approval of this
Agreement and the Merger by the stockholders of the Company and include such
recommendation in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and (ii) neither
the Company\'s Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall effect a
Change of Recommendation. Unless the Company\'s Board of Directors or any
committee thereof shall effect a Change of Recommendation of accordance with
Section 6.2(b), the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit
from its stockholders proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt and approve
this Agreement and the Merger and to secure the vote or consent of the
stockholders of the Company that are required by the rules of The Nasdaq
National Market or the GCL. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the Company, after consultation with Parent, may
adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting to the extent necessary
to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus is provided to the Company\'s stockholders or, if as of
the time for which the Company Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled
(as set forth in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus), there are insufficient
shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company
Stockholders Meeting.   (b) The Company shall call, give notice of, convene
and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting in accordance with this Section 6.4
and shall submit the proposal to adopt and approve this Agreement and the
Merger to its stockholders for the purpose of acting upon such proposal
whether or not (i) the Company\'s Board of Directors at any time subsequent
to the date of this Agreement determines, in the manner permitted by   
45   Section 6.2(b), that the proposal is no longer advisable or recommends
that the stockholders of the Company reject such proposal, or (ii) any
actual, potential or purported Acquisition Proposal or Superior Proposal has
been commenced, disclosed, announced or submitted to the Company. The Company
shall use reasonable efforts to ensure that all proxies solicited by the
Company in connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting are solicited, in
compliance with the GCL, the Company Charter, the Company By-Laws, the rules
of The Nasdaq National Market and all other applicable legal
requirements.   (c) Following the Company Stockholders Meeting and at or
prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Parent a certificate of
its Corporate Secretary setting forth the voting results from the Company
Stockholders Meeting.   Section 6.5 Legal Conditions to Merger. Each of
Parent and, subject to Section 6.2, the Company will use its reasonable best
efforts to comply promptly with all legal requirements which may be imposed
with respect to the Merger (which efforts shall include furnishing all
information required under the HSR Act and in connection with approvals of or
filings with any other Governmental Entity) and will promptly cooperate with
and furnish information to each other in connection with any such
requirements imposed upon any of them or any of their Subsidiaries in
connection with the Merger. Each of Parent and the Company will, and will
cause its Subsidiaries to, take all reasonable actions necessary to obtain
(and will cooperate with each other in obtaining) any consent, authorization,
order or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity required
to be obtained or made by Parent, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries in
connection with the Merger or the taking of any action contemplated thereby
or by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor any
of its affiliates shall be required to (i) sell or dispose of or hold
separately (through a trust or otherwise) any assets or businesses or
interests in any assets or businesses of Parent, the Company or their
respective affiliates or make any other change in any portion of
the Company\'s or its business or incur any other limitation on the conduct
of the Company\'s or its business to obtain such consents, authorizations,
orders, approvals and exemptions or agree to do, or submit to orders
providing for, any of the foregoing, in each case whether before or after the
Effective Time, except in each case for any such action that would not
reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or a
Parent Material Adverse Effect or (ii) if any governmental body that has the
authority to enforce any Antitrust Law seeks, or authorizes its staff to
seek, a preliminary injunction or restraining order to enjoin consummation of
the Merger, take any action which Parent reasonably believes would be
prohibited or restricted under such preliminary injunction or restraining
order.   Section 6.6 Company Rights Agreement. Prior to the Effective Time
and for so long as this Agreement shall not have been terminated pursuant to
Article VIII, the Company shall not, directly or indirectly, in connection
with the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (i) take any action to deem Parent or Merger
Sub to be an "Acquiring Person," (ii) issue or cause to be issued any
"Rights" to stockholders of the Company or (iii) trigger any other provisions
of the Company Rights Agreement, including giving rise to a "Distribution
Date" or a "Shares Acquisition Date." Prior to the Effective Time and for so
long as this Agreement shall not    46   have been terminated pursuant
to Article VIII, the Company shall not amend, modify (other than to delay any
"Distribution Date" therein or to render the "Rights" inapplicable to the
Merger or any action permitted under this Agreement) or terminate the Company
Rights Agreement unless (i) required to do so by order of a court of
competent jurisdiction or (ii) the Company\'s Board of Directors has
concluded in good faith, after receiving the advice of outside counsel, that,
in light of a Superior Proposal with respect to it, such amendment,
modification or termination is necessary in order to comply with the Board of
Directors\' fiduciary obligations to its stockholders under
applicable law.   Section 6.7 Public Announcements.   (a) Parent and the
Company shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or
making any public statement with respect to the Merger or this Agreement and
shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement
without the prior written consent of the other party, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided, however, that a party may,
without the prior consent of the other party, issue such press release or
make such public statement as may upon the written advice of counsel be
required by law or the rules and regulations of the NYSE or The
Nasdaq National Market if it has used all reasonable efforts to consult with
the other party prior thereto and provided, further, that, following a Change
of Recommendation, no such consultation or agreement shall be required.  
(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or
the Confidentiality Agreement, the parties (and each employee, representative
or other agent of the parties) may disclose to any and all persons, without
limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and any facts that may be relevant
to the tax structure of the transactions contemplated hereby beginning on the
earliest of (i) the date of the public announcement by the parties of
discussions relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) the date
of public announcement by the parties of the transactions contemplated hereby
or (iii) the date of the execution of this Agreement; provided, however, that
nothing in this Section 6.7(b) shall permit either party (or any
employee, representative or agent thereof) to disclose (A) any information
that is not necessary to understand the tax treatment and tax structure of
such transactions (including the identity of the parties and any information
that could lead another to determine the identity of the parties), or (B) any
other information to the extent that such disclosure could result in a
violation of any applicable law.   Section 6.8 Listing of Parent Shares.
Parent shall use all reasonable efforts to have authorized for listing on the
NYSE, upon official notice of issuance, the shares of Parent Common Stock to
be issued in the Merger.   Section 6.9 Employee Benefits; 401(k) Plan.  
(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the
Surviving Corporation to, recognize the prior service with the Company or its
Subsidiaries of each employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries as of
the Effective Time (the "Company Employees") in connection with all employee
benefit plans, programs or policies    47   (including vacation) of
Parent or its affiliates in which Company Employees are eligible to
participate following the Effective Time, for purposes of eligibility,
vesting and levels of benefits (but not for purposes of benefit accruals or
benefit amounts under any defined benefit pension plan or to the extent that
such recognition would result in duplication of benefits). From and after the
Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall provide Company
Employees for so long as such Company Employees remain so employed, health
and welfare benefits (i) pursuant to the Company\'s or its
Subsidiaries\' employee benefit plans, programs, policies and arrangements as
provided to such employees immediately prior to the Effective Time or (ii)
pursuant to employee benefit plans, programs, policies or arrangements
maintained by Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent providing coverage and
benefits which (in the case of this clause (ii)) are no less favorable than
those provided to employees of Parent in positions comparable to positions
held by Company Employees with Parent or its Subsidiaries from time to time
after the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, Parent will, or
will cause the Surviving Corporation to (i) cause any pre-existing conditions
or limitations and eligibility waiting periods (to the extent that such
waiting periods would be inapplicable, taking into account service with the
Company) under any group health plans of Parent or its affiliates to be
waived with respect to Company Employees and their eligible dependents and
(ii) give each Company Employee credit for the plan year in which the
Effective Time occurs towards applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket
limits for expenses incurred prior to the Effective Time for which evidence
of payment is provided to Parent. From and after the Effective Time, Parent
will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide the
benefits described in Section 6.9 of the Disclosure Schedule to the Company
Employees, in each instance in accordance with Section 6.9 of the Disclosure
Schedule.   (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such
actions as Parent may reasonably request so as to enable the Surviving
Corporation to effect such actions relating to the Documentum, Inc. 401(k)
Plan (the "401(k) Plan") as Parent may deem necessary or appropriate (after
reasonable consultation with the Company), including terminating the 401(k)
Plan prior to the Effective Time, subject to the terms of the 401(k) Plan and
applicable law and provided that such action does not preclude the immediate
participation of the Company Employees in any successor plan.   (c) As
promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any event
within five days thereof (to the extent Parent has received copies of the
relevant Company Stock Plans within a reasonable time period prior thereto),
Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form
S-8 covering the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to
the outstanding Company Stock Options assumed under Section 6.10(a). Parent
shall maintain such Form S-8 registration statement (and maintain the current
status of the prospectuses contained therein) in effect for as long as all
the Company Stock Options remain outstanding.   (d) As of the Effective
Time, Parent shall assume and continue in full force and effect the
Company\'s Change of Control Retention Plan.   48    Section 6.10 Stock
Plans.   (a) At the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option which
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then
vested or exercisable, shall be assumed by Parent and converted in accordance
with its terms into an option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions
(including as to vesting and exercisability) as were applicable under the
Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock determined by multiplying (i) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time by (ii) the Exchange Ratio (rounded
down to the nearest whole number), at a price per share equal to the exercise
price per share of Company Common Stock subject to the Company Stock Option
divided by (ii) the Exchange Ratio (with the result rounded up to the nearest
whole cent). It is the intention of the parties that the Company Stock
Options which qualify as incentive stock options (as defined in Section 422
of the Code) continue to so qualify, to the maximum extent permissible,
following the Effective Time. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time
(but in no event later than ten business days thereafter), Parent will
deliver to the holders of Company Stock Options appropriate notices regarding
options held under Company Option Plans and the effect of this
Section 6.10.   (b) If and to the extent necessary or required by the terms
of any Company Stock Plan or any Company Stock Option, the Company shall,
prior to the Effective Time, (i) obtain any consents from holders of Company
Stock Options and (ii) amend the terms of its equity incentive plans or
arrangements, to give effect to the provisions of Section 6.10(a).   (c) If
the Closing Date occurs on or after January 1, 2004 but prior to March 1,
2004, Parent will use all reasonable efforts to create a special offering
period under the Parent\'s Employee Stock Purchase Plan so that the Company
Employees who become employees of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
can participate in such plan within ten business days from the Closing
Date.   Section 6.11 Consents. The Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain all necessary consents, waivers and approvals under
any of the Company\'s material agreements, contracts, licenses or leases in
connection with the Merger required to prevent the occurrence of an event
that could reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect
or a Parent Material Adverse Effect prior to the Effective Time or after the
Effective Time.   Section 6.12 Indemnification and Insurance.   (a) For
six years after the Effective Time, the Parent shall, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable law, indemnify and hold harmless each person who
is now or has been prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the
Effective Time an officer or director of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses
(including reasonable counsel fees and expenses), amounts paid in   
49   settlement (provided that any such settlement is effected with the
written consent of Parent) or liabilities arising out of acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether or not asserted or
claimed prior to or at or after the Effective Time, that are based in whole
or in part on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such person
is or was an officer or director of the Company or any Subsidiary. This
Section 6.12(a) shall not limit or otherwise adversely affect any rights any
Indemnified Person may have under any agreement with the Company or under the
Company\'s Charters or By-Laws as presently in effect.   (b) From and after
the Effective Time, Parent shall, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable law, cause the Surviving Corporation to assume the obligations of
the Company pursuant to any indemnification agreements between the Company
and its directors and officers in effect prior to the date of this Agreement
(or indemnification agreements in the Company\'s customary form as of the
date hereof for directors joining the Company\'s Board of Directors prior to
the Effective Time) and any indemnification provisions under the Company\'s
Charter or By-Laws as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.  
(c) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to
be maintained in effect, subject to the terms described on Schedule 6.12(c)
of the Disclosure Schedule, the current policies of directors\'
and officers\' and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company
(provided that Parent may substitute therefor policies of at least the same
coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less
advantageous to former officers and directors of the Company) only with
respect to claims arising from facts or events which occurred at or before
the Effective Time.   Section 6.13 Reasonable Best Efforts. Subject to the
other terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to
use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   Section 6.14 Notification of
Certain Matters. Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, and the
Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, upon any director or officer of
Parent or the Company (as applicable) becoming aware of the occurrence, or
failure to occur, of any event, which occurrence or failure to occur would be
reasonably likely to cause any of the conditions set forth in Article VII not
to be satisfied. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6.14, the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.14 will not limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such
notice or the conditions to such party\'s obligation to consummate the
Merger.   Section 6.15 Takeover Statutes. Notwithstanding any other
provision in this Agreement, in no event shall the approval of the Merger and
this Agreement by the Board of Directors of the Company under Section 203 of
the GCL be withdrawn, revoked or modified by the Board of Directors of the
Company. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable to the Merger or
any of the other transactions contemplated by this    50   Agreement,
the Company and the Company\'s Board of Directors shall promptly grant such
approvals and take such lawful actions as are necessary so that
such transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms contemplated by this Agreement or the Merger, as the case may be, and
otherwise take such lawful actions to eliminate or minimize the effects of
such statute, and any regulations promulgated thereunder, on such
transactions.   Section 6.16 Section 16 Matters.   (a) The Board of
Directors of Parent, or a committee thereof consisting of non-employee
directors (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the
Exchange Act), shall adopt a resolution in advance of the Effective Time
providing that the receipt by the Company Insiders of Parent Common Stock in
exchange for shares of Company Common Stock, and of options to purchase
Parent Common Stock upon assumption and conversion of Company Stock Options,
in each case pursuant to the transactions contemplated hereby and to the
extent such securities are listed in the Section 16 Information (as
defined below), is intended to be exempt pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the
Exchange Act. In addition, the Board of Directors of the Company, or a
committee thereof consisting of non-employee directors (as such term is
defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall adopt a
resolution in advance of the Effective Time providing that the disposition by
the Company Insiders of the Company Common Stock in exchange for shares of
Parent Common Stock, and the disposition of their Company Stock Options which
will be deemed to occur upon the assumption of those options and their
resulting conversion into options to purchase Parent Common Stock, in each
case pursuant to the transactions contemplated hereby and to the extent such
securities are listed in the Section 16 Information, are also intended to be
exempt pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.   (b) For purposes of
this Agreement, "Section 16 Information" means information regarding the
Company Insiders and (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock or
other Company equity securities deemed to be beneficially owned by each such
Company Insider and expected to be exchanged for Parent Common Stock and (ii)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock, together with the applicable
exercise price per share, subject to each Company Stock Option held by the
Company Insider which is to be assumed and converted into options to purchase
Parent Common Stock, in each case, in connection with the Merger, which shall
be provided by the Company to the Parent within 10 business days after the
date of this Agreement.   (c) For purposes of this Agreement, "Company
Insiders" means those officers and directors of the Company who are subject
to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act as listed
in the Section 16 Information.   Section 6.17 Tax-Free Reorganization
Treatment. Parent and the Company intend that the Merger will qualify as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and each
shall, and shall cause their respective subsidiaries to, use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Merger to so qualify. Neither Parent nor the
Company shall knowingly take any action, or knowingly fail to take any
action, that would    51   be reasonably likely to jeopardize the
qualification of the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code.   ARTICLE VII   CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER   Section
7.1 Conditions to Obligation of Each Party to Effect the Merger. The
respective obligations of each party to effect the Merger shall be subject to

shall have approved, cleared or decided neither to initiate proceedings or
otherwise intervene in respect of the Merger.   (d) No Injunctions or
Restraints; Illegality. No temporary restraining order, preliminary or
permanent injunction or other order issued by any court of competent
jurisdiction or other legal restraint or prohibition preventing the

brought by any administrative agency or commission or other Governmental
Entity seeking any of the foregoing be pending; and there shall not be any
action taken, or any statute, rule, regulation or order enacted,
entered, enforced or deemed applicable to the Merger which makes the
consummation of the Merger illegal.   (e) Governmental Actions. There shall
not be pending or threatened any action or proceeding (or any investigation
or other inquiry that would reasonably be expected to result in such an
action or proceeding) by any Governmental Entity or administrative agency
before any Governmental Entity, administrative agency or court of competent

Parent of all or a material portion of the business or assets of Parent, or
seeking to compel Parent to dispose of or hold separate all or any material
portion of the business or assets of Parent or the Surviving Corporation (or
any of their Subsidiaries), as a result of the Merger or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except in each case for any such action,

not be satisfied and which breach or failure, if capable of being cured,
shall not have been cured within 20 business days following receipt by the
Company of written notice of such breach or failure from Parent;   (f) by

failure, if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured within 20
business days following receipt by Parent of written notice of such

liability on the part of any party hereto or any of its affiliates,
directors, officers or stockholders except (i) that the provisions of
Sections 3.26, 4.9, 8.3, this Section 8.2 and Article IX hereof shall survive
termination and (ii) nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability
for any willful breach of this Agreement. The Confidentiality Agreement shall
survive termination of this Agreement as provided therein.   Section 8.3
Fees and Expenses.   (a) Except as set forth in this Section 8.3, all fees
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses,
whether or not the Merger is consummated; provided, however, that Parent and
the Company shall share equally all fees and expenses (but not including
attorneys\' fees and expenses) incurred in connection with the printing and
filing of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (including any preliminary materials
related thereto), the Registration Statement (including financial statements
and exhibits) and any amendments or supplements thereto and filings by Parent
and the Company under the HSR Act, the EC Merger Regulation or any similar
filing requirement of any Governmental Entity applicable to the Merger or

financial advisors), upon the termination of this Agreement (x) by Parent
pursuant to Section 8.1(e) or 8.1(g) or (y) by Parent or the Company pursuant
to Section 8.1(b) if the failure to satisfy the conditions set forth in
Section 7.2(a) or 7.2(b) by the Outside Date shall have resulted in the
Closing not occurring; and (ii) Parent shall reimburse the Company for up to
a maximum of $2.5 million of its reasonable costs and expenses of the Company
actually incurred relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including reasonable fees and expenses of the Company\'s counsel,
accountants and financial advisors), upon the termination of this Agreement
(x) by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(f) or (y) by Parent or the Company
pursuant to Section 8.1(b) if the failure to satisfy the conditions set forth
in Section 7.3(a) or 7.3(b) by the Outside Date shall have resulted in the
Closing not occurring.   56    (c) The Company shall pay Parent a
termination fee of $55 million upon the earliest to occur of the following
events (each, a "Termination Event"):   (i) the entry by the Company into
an agreement with  respect to, or the consummation of, any Acquisition
Proposal (for  purposes of this Section 8.3(c), substituting 40% for 25%
everywhere  it otherwise appears in the definition of Acquisition Proposal)
in  any such case within 270 days of the termination of this Agreement 
pursuant to Sections 8.1(b), 8.1(d) or 8.1(e) if prior to such  termination
an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly  announced or otherwise
become publicly known or any person shall  have publicly announced an
intention (whether or not conditional) to  make an Acquisition Proposal;
or   (ii) the termination of this Agreement by Parent  pursuant to Section
8.1(g).   (d) In the case of fees payable pursuant to Section 8.3(c)(i),
25% of such fees shall be paid promptly upon termination of this Agreement,
but in no event later than two business days after the date of the first to
occur of the events described in Section 8.3(c)(i), and the remaining 75% of
such fees shall be paid prior to the consummation of the Acquisition Proposal
or other acquisition referred to therein. The fees payable pursuant to
Section 8.3(c)(ii) shall be paid promptly upon termination of this Agreement,
but in no event later than two business days after the date of the first to
occur of the events described in Section 8.3(c)(ii). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in no event shall the Company be required to pay the fees and
expenses of Parent if, immediately prior to the termination of this
Agreement, Parent was in material breach of its obligations under this
Agreement. The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in Section
8.3(c) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into
this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay the amount
due pursuant to Section 8.3(c), and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent
commences a suit which results in a judgment against the Company for the fee
set forth in Section 8.3(c), the Company shall pay to Parent its costs and
expenses (including attorneys\' fees and expenses) actually incurred in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the fee at
the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was
required to be made.     57    ARTICLE IX   GENERAL PROVISIONS
