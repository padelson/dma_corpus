effecting the surrender of Certificates, if any (which will be in customary form and shall specify
that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only upon
delivery of such Certificates to the Paying Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the
delivery of such Certificates, if any, for payment of the Merger Consideration therefor. Upon
delivery of a Certificate, if any, for cancellation to the Paying Agent, and such letter of
transmittal, duly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as
may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the Paying Agent will pay from the Payment Fund to
the holder of such Common Stock, or as otherwise directed in the letter of transmittal, the Merger

the Closing Date, the Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominee on the Closing Date an
amount in cash in immediately available funds equal to the number of shares of Common Stock held of
record by DTC or such nominee immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Merger
Consideration (such amount, the &#147;<U>DTC Payment</U>&#148;), and (y)&nbsp;if the Closing occurs after 11:30

disbursed to holders of Common Stock (including all interest and other
income received by the Paying Agent in respect of all funds made available to it), and thereafter
such holders who have not received the Merger Consideration therefor may deliver such Common Stock
