NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, the Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as
follows: 

  

ARTICLE I 
 THE MERGER 

   

1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, and in accordance with the Cayman Companies Law, at the
Effective Time, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company and the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease. The Company
shall continue its corporate existence under the Cayman Companies Law as the
surviving company (within the meaning of the Cayman Companies Law) in the
Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and shall succeed to and assume all
the undertakings, property, assets, rights, privileges, immunities, powers,
franchises, debts, liabilities, duties and obligations of Merger Sub in
accordance with the Cayman Companies Law. The Surviving Corporation shall be
liable for and subject, in the same manner as Merger Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time, to all credit agreements, mortgages, charges or security
interests and all contracts, obligations, claims, debts and liabilities of
Merger Sub. 

  

1.2 _Closing_. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions in
Article VI, the consummation of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take
place at the offices of Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP, 2550 Hanover Street,
Palo Alto, California, at 10:00 a.m. New York City time, on the later of (a)
on the second Business Day immediately following the satisfaction or waiver
of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than any conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) and (b) the earlier of (i) a
date during the Marketing Period to be specified by the Parent on no fewer
than two Business Days notice to the Company and (ii) the final day of the
Marketing Period, or such other place and time or on such other date as
the Parent and the Company may mutually determine (the date on which the
Closing actually occurs is referred to as the " _Closing Date_ "). 

  

1.3 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, on or prior
to the Closing Date, the Company will duly execute and file a plan of merger,
in the form attached as  _Exhibit A_ hereto (the " _Cayman Plan of Merger_
") and other documents required to effect the Merger by the Cayman Companies
Law with the Registrar of Companies of the Cayman Islands as provided in
Section 233 of the Cayman Companies Law (together, the " _Merger Documents_
"). The Merger will become effective when the Merger Documents have been duly
filed with the Registrar of Companies of the Cayman Islands or on such
subsequent date as Merger Sub and the Company shall agree and specify in the
Merger Documents in accordance with the Cayman Companies Law (the date
and time the Merger becomes effective, the " _Effective Time_ "). 

  

1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger will have the effects set forth in
this Agreement and the Cayman Companies Law. 

  

1.5 _The Memorandum and Articles of Association_. At the Effective Time, the
memorandum and articles of association of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended and restated to be in the form set forth on _Exhibit B_ hereto (the
" _Memorandum and Articles of Associations_ "). 

  

1.6 _Directors_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the directors of
the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors have been duly
elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation
or removal, in accordance with the Surviving Corporations memorandum
and articles of association. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

1.7 _Officers_. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, continue to be the officers of
the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors have been duly
elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation
or removal, in accordance with the Surviving Corporations memorandum and
articles of association. 

  

ARTICLE II 
 EFFECT OF MERGER ON SHARE CAPITAL 

   

2.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the Company, the Parent, Merger Sub,
any holder of any shares in the share capital of the Company or any other
Person: 

  

(a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each ordinary share, par value
US$0.00016667 per share, of the Company (" _Common Stock_ ") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded
Shares and Dissenting Shares) will be converted into and exchanged for the
right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to $9.25 (the "
_Merger Consideration_ "), whereupon such Common Stock will be cancelled and
will cease to exist and no longer be outstanding and the Register of Members
of the Company shall be updated accordingly, and each holder thereof will
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive
the Merger Consideration, without interest, upon delivery of share
certificates (if any) representing the Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ ")
in accordance with Section 2.4. 

  

(b) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each ordinary share, par value
US$0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time will be converted into one fully paid and non-assessable
ordinary share, US$0.01 par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation and
the Register of Members of the Company shall be updated to reflect such
issuance of ordinary shares of the Surviving Corporation to each holder of
shares of Merger Sub. 

  

(c) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each share of Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (i) that is owned by the
Company as a treasury share (if applicable) or (ii) that is owned by the
Parent or Merger Sub (collectively, the " _Excluded Shares_ ") shall be
surrendered and cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor. Each
share of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that is owned by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company
will be converted into and exchanged for one fully paid and non-assessable
ordinary share, US$0.01 par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation and
the Register of Members of the Company shall be updated to reflect such
issuance of ordinary shares of the Surviving Corporation. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(d) _Company Stock Options; Company Restricted Stock Awards_. As soon as
practicable following the date hereof, the Board of Directors (or, if
appropriate, any committee thereof administering the Company Equity Incentive
Plan), in consultation with Parent, shall adopt such resolutions and take
such other actions (including adopting any plan amendments) as are required
to provide that, except as set forth on _Section 2.1(d)(i) of the
Disclosure Schedules_ or as otherwise expressly agreed between the Parent and
any holder thereof: (i) with the exception of those Unvested Company Stock
Options set forth on _Section 2.1(d)(ii) of the Disclosure Schedules_ that
are subject to clause (ii) of this Section 2.1(d), each then outstanding
Company Stock Option that is unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time
(an " _Unvested Company Stock Option_ ") shall cease to represent a right to
purchase shares of Common Stock and shall be converted into an option (a "
_Parent Option_ ") to purchase, on substantially the same terms and
conditions applicable to each such Unvested Company Stock Option, immediately
prior to the Effective Time (including the same vesting conditions and
transfer restrictions), the number of whole ordinary shares of Parent,
rounded down to the nearest whole share, that is equal to the product of (A)
the number of shares of Common Stock subject to such Unvested Company Stock
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, _multiplied_   _by_ (B) a
fraction the numerator of which shall be the Merger Consideration and
the denominator of which shall be the fair market value of an ordinary share
of Parent at the Effective Time as determined in good faith by the board of
directors of Parent in a manner which complies with Section 409A of the Code
(such fraction, the " _Option Exchange Ratio_ "), at an exercise price per
ordinary share of Parent (rounded up to the nearest whole penny) equal to (x)
the exercise price for each such share of Common Stock subject to such
Unvested Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
_divided_ _by_ (y) the Option Exchange Ratio; (ii) each then-outstanding
Company Stock Option granted under the Company Equity Incentive Plan that is
vested and exercisable as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and each
outstanding Unvested Company Stock Option that is set forth on _Section
2.1(d)(ii) of the Disclosure Schedules_, shall be cancelled immediately prior
to the Effective Time in exchange for payment of an amount in cash equal to
the product of (A) the number of shares of Common Stock subject to such
Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (B) the
excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the per share exercise price
of such Company Stock Option (for the avoidance of doubt, each holder of a
Company Stock Option with a per share exercise price that is equal to or
greater than the Merger Consideration shall not be entitled to receive any
payment in exchange for the cancellation of such Company Stock Options); and
(iii) each then-outstanding Company Restricted Stock Award granted under the
Company Equity Incentive Plan shall be cancelled immediately prior to the
Effective Time in exchange for payment of an amount in cash equal to
the product of (A) the number of shares of Common Stock subject to such
Company Restricted Stock Award immediately prior to the Effective Time;
_provided_ that the number of shares of Common Stock subject to Company
Restricted Stock Awards that are subject to issuance or vesting based
on performance (the " _Performance Awards_ ") shall be determined in
accordance with either (x) the methodology set forth in Section 3.02 in each
of the Severance and Change of Control Agreements, in the case of Performance
Awards granted to persons who have entered into a Severance and Change of
Control Agreement, or (y) the terms of the Company Equity Incentive Plan
and applicable award agreement(s), in the case of Performance Awards granted
to all other persons, and (B) the Merger Consideration (all such cash
payments to be paid pursuant to the immediately preceding clauses (ii) and
(iii) shall be referred to herein as the " _Equity Incentive Amounts_ "). The
Parent shall take all actions necessary so that, within 15 days of
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall pay or cause to be paid
to each holder of Company Restricted Stock or Company Stock Options
granted under the Company Equity Incentive Plan the Equity Incentive Amounts
to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Section 2.1(d) through the
Surviving Corporations or its applicable Subsidiaries payroll. The
conversion and assumption of the Unvested Company Stock Options is intended
to comply with the regulations and other binding guidance under Section 409A
of the Code and such converted Parent Options shall be subject to the same
terms and conditions (including vesting schedule, expiration date, exercise
provisions and transfer restrictions) as were applicable to the corresponding
Unvested Company Stock Options immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

2.2 _Dissenters  Rights_. No shareholder who has validly exercised their
appraisal and dissention rights pursuant to Section 238 of the Cayman
Companies Law shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration as
provided for in Section 2.1 with respect to the shares of Common Stock owned
by such shareholder (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") unless and until such
shareholder shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such shareholders
appraisal and dissention rights under the Cayman Companies Law. Any such
shareholder shall instead be entitled to receive only the payment resulting
from the procedure in Section 238 of the Cayman Companies Law with respect to
such shareholders Dissenting Shares and such Dissenting Shares shall be
cancelled at the Effective Time. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt
notice of any written demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such
demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to applicable Law that are
received by the Company relating to Company shareholders rights of appraisal
and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to demand for appraisal under the Cayman Companies Law. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of the Parent, voluntarily
make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal, offer to settle
or settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, all Dissenting Shares held by any shareholder
who shall have failed to validly exercise their appraisal and dissention
rights, withdrawn or lost such shareholders rights to appraisal of such
Dissenting Shares under Section 238 of the Cayman Companies Law shall
thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become exchanged
for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration
in the manner provided in Section 2.1. 

  

2.3 _Withholding Rights_. The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, the
Parent and the Paying Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such
amounts as the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, the Parent or the
Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax
Law, and pay such withholding amount over to the appropriate taxing
authority. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by the
Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, the Parent or the Paying Agent,
such withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, Parent
or the Paying Agent (as applicable). 

 

    ##### 

  

  

2.4 _Exchange of Certificates_. 

  

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Parent will designate a
bank or trust company (which bank or trust company will be reasonably
acceptable to the Company) to act as agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") to
receive the funds to which shareholders of the Company will become entitled
pursuant to Section 2.1(a), and the Parent will enter into a paying agent
agreement with the Paying Agent, in form and substance reasonably acceptable
to the Company and the Parent, for the payment of the Merger Consideration.
At or prior to the Effective Time, the Parent shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, with the Paying Agent for the benefit of the shareholders of the
Company an amount of cash equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) and (ii) the Merger Consideration (the
" _Payment Fund_ "). The Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose
except as set forth herein. The Payment Fund will be invested by the Paying
Agent as directed by the Parent; _provided_ that the Parent shall not direct
the Paying Agent to make any such investments that are speculative in nature.
No such investment or losses thereon will affect the Merger Consideration
payable under this Agreement, and the Parent will promptly provide, or will
cause the Surviving Corporation promptly to provide, additional funds to the
Paying Agent for the benefit of the former shareholders of the Company in the
amount of any such losses. 

  

(b) _Exchange Procedure_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (but in any event no later than three Business Days after the
Closing Date), the Surviving Corporation will cause the Paying Agent to mail
to each holder of Common Stock as recorded in the Register of Members of the
Company as of the Effective Time a form of letter of transmittal for use
in effecting the surrender of Certificates, if any (which will be in
customary form and shall specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of such
Certificates to the Paying Agent) and instructions for use in effecting
the delivery of such Certificates, if any, for payment of the Merger
Consideration therefor. Upon delivery of a Certificate, if any, for
cancellation to the Paying Agent, and such letter of transmittal, duly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents
as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the Paying Agent will pay
from the Payment Fund to the holder of such Common Stock, or as otherwise
directed in the letter of transmittal, the Merger Consideration for each
share of Common Stock represented by any such Certificate, and
such Certificate will forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or will
accrue on the Merger Consideration payable in respect of any Common Stock. 

  

(c) _DTC Procedures_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Parent and the Company
shall cooperate to establish procedures with the Paying Agent and the
Depository Trust Company (" _DTC_ ") to ensure that (x) if the Closing occurs
at or prior to 11:30 am (New York time) on the Closing Date, the Paying Agent
will transmit to DTC or its nominee on the Closing Date an amount in cash in
immediately available funds equal to the number of shares of Common Stock held
of record by DTC or such nominee immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by the Merger Consideration (such amount, the " _DTC Payment_ "),
and (y) if the Closing occurs after 11:30 am (New York time) on the Closing
Date, the Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominee on the first
Business Day after the Closing Date an amount in cash in immediately available
funds equal to the DTC Payment. 

  

(d) _Termination of Payment Fund_. At any time following the date that is one
year after the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation will be entitled to
require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds in the Payment Fund which
had been made available to the Paying Agent and not disbursed to holders of
Common Stock (including all interest and other income received by the Paying
Agent in respect of all funds made available to it), and thereafter such
holders who have not received the Merger Consideration therefor may deliver
such Common Stock to the Surviving Corporation and, subject to applicable
abandoned property, escheat and other similar Laws, receive in consideration
therefor the aggregate Merger Consideration that may be payable upon delivery
of the Certificates (if any) and such shares of Common Stock held by
them, without interest or dividends thereon. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(e) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares_. The Merger Consideration
paid upon the delivery of a Certificate (if any) in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to the shares of Common Stock formerly represented by
such Certificate (if any). At the Effective Time, there will be no
further registration of transfers on the Register of Members of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates (if
any) whose holder is recorded as a holder of Common Stock in the Register of
Members at the Effective Time are presented to the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent for transfer or any other reason, they will be canceled and
exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided in this Article II. 

  

(f) _No Liability_. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, none
of the Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent will be liable to any shareholders of the Company or other
Person in respect of any cash properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. Any
portion of the Payment Fund remaining unclaimed by shareholders of the
Company as of a date that is immediately prior to such time as such amounts
would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity
will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of
the Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto. 

  

(g) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Surviving Corporation or
Paying Agent will, upon (i) the receipt of an affidavit of that fact by the
holder thereof in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving
Corporation or Paying Agent, as the case may be, and (ii) the posting of a
bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
whose holder is recorded as a holder of Common Stock in the Register
of Members of the Company at the Effective Time the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of the shares of Common Stock represented by such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate.

of the representations and warranties made in Section 3.2), other than

any disclosure of risks included in any "forward-looking statements"
disclaimer or any other statements that are similarly predictive or forward-
looking in nature or (ii) in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company

or subsection of Article III of the Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed
disclosure in all other sections or subsections if the relevance of such item
to such sections or subsections is reasonably apparent on its face, the
Company represents and warrants to the Parent and Merger Sub as follows: 

  

3.1 _Qualification, Organization and Subsidiaries_. 

  

(a) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organized,

Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries (i) has all requisite corporate or
similar power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted and (ii) is
qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation (or
other applicable entity) in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or
operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its business

in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made available
to the Parent prior to the date hereof complete and correct copies of the
memorandum and articles of association (or equivalent organizational and
governing documents) of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries.

interests) of such Subsidiaries held by the Company or by any other
Subsidiary have been duly and validly authorized and are validly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable and were not issued in violation of any

which have the right to vote (or that are convertible into or exercisable for

any matter. 

  

(d) There are no voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the voting,

Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives shall have the right,
directly or indirectly, to: (i) initiate, solicit and encourage, whether
publicly or otherwise, any inquiry or the making of any proposals or offers
that could constitute Alternative Proposals, including by way of providing
access to non-public information to any Person pursuant to a confidentiality
agreement on customary terms not materially more favorable to such Person
than those contained in the Non-Disclosure Agreement (an " _Acceptable

simultaneously make available to the Parent any information concerning
the Company or its Subsidiaries that the Company provides to any Person given
such access that was not previously made available to the Parent, and (ii)
engage or enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations with any Person or "group" (within the meaning of Section

inquiries, proposals, discussions or negotiations or any effort or attempt to
make any Alternative Proposals. 

  

(b) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.3 and except as may relate
to any Excluded Party (for as long as such Person or group is an Excluded
Party), the Company and its Subsidiaries shall, and the Company shall
instruct and cause its and its Subsidiaries Representatives to, at 12:00
a.m. on the forty sixth (46th) calendar day after the date of this Agreement

offer for, in a single transaction or series of related transactions, (A) any
merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination,
recapitalization, joint venture, liquidation, dissolution or similar

Subsidiaries (any such proposal or offer, an " _Alternative Proposal_ "),
or (ii) engage or participate in any discussions (other than to state only
that they are not permitted to have discussions and to refer to this
Agreement) or negotiations (including by way of furnishing information
regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) in connection with, or which

facilitating, any Alternative Proposal. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(d) Following the No-Shop Period Start Date and prior to the Shareholder
Approval being obtained (but not after), if the Board of Directors (or any
committee thereof) receives a bona fide written Alternative Proposal and if
the receipt of such Alternative Proposal did not result from a material
breach of this Section 5.3, the Company or its Representatives may, if the
Board of Directors, upon recommendation thereof by the Special Committee, or
the Special Committee determines in good faith (after consultation with its
outside counsel and financial advisor) that the Alternative Proposal is, or
is reasonably expected to result in, a Superior Proposal, (A) furnish
information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person
making such Alternative Proposal and (B) engage or participate in discussions
or negotiations regarding such Alternative Proposal if, but only if, (x) in
the case of either of the immediately preceding clauses (A) or (B), the Board
of Directors, upon the recommendation of the Special Committee determines in
good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to take
such action would be materially inconsistent with the directors fiduciary
duties under applicable Law and (y) the Company receives from such Person an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement;  _provided_ that the Company shall
immediately make available to the Parent any information concerning the
Company or its Subsidiaries that the Company provides to any Person given
such access that was not previously made available to the Parent. 

  

(e) No later than two (2) Business Days after the No-Shop Period Start Date,
the Company shall notify the Parent in writing of the identity of each
Excluded Party and provide to the Parent (x) a copy of any Alternative
Proposal made in writing and other written terms or proposals
provided (including financing commitments) to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and (y) a written summary of the material terms of any
Alternative Proposal not made in writing (including any terms proposed orally
or supplementally). Following the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company
shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours after receipt), notify the
Parent both orally and in writing of the receipt of any Alternative Proposal,
any inquiries that could reasonably be expected to result in an Alternative
Proposal, or any request for information from, or any negotiations sought to
be initiated or continued with, either the Company or its Representatives
concerning an Alternative Proposal, which notice shall include (i) a copy of
any Alternative Proposal (including any financing commitments) made in
writing and other written terms or proposals provided to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries and (ii) a written summary of the material terms of
any Alternative Proposal not made in writing or any such inquiry or request.
Following the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall keep the Parent
reasonably informed on a prompt basis (and in any event within 24 hours) of
the status of any Alternative Proposal (including any made by an Excluded
Party), inquiry that could reasonably be expected to result in an Alternative
Proposal, or request and the status of any discussions or negotiations with
respect thereto. None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall, after
the date of this Agreement, enter into any agreement that would prohibit them
from providing such information to the Parent. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(f) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.3, the Board of Directors
(or any committee thereof) shall not (1) (A) change, qualify, withdraw or
modify, or publicly propose to change, withdraw, modify or qualify, in a
manner adverse to the Parent, the Board Recommendation, (B) approve or
recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend to the shareholders of
the Company, an Alternative Proposal, (C) if a tender offer or exchange offer
for shares in the capital of the Company that constitutes an Alternative
Proposal is commenced, fail to recommend against acceptance of such tender
offer or exchange offer by the Company shareholders (including, for
these purposes, by taking no position with respect to the acceptance of such
tender offer or exchange offer by its shareholders, which shall constitute a
failure to recommend against acceptance of such tender offer or exchange
offer, _provided_ that a customary "stop, look and listen" communication by
the Board of Directors pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act shall not
be prohibited), within ten (10) Business Days after commencement or (D)
terminate, amend, waive or exempt any Person or group from the restrictions
contained in any standstill agreements or any Takeover Laws or otherwise
cause any such restrictions therein not to apply (other than any amendments,
waivers or exemptions to allow a proposal to be made on a non-public basis
in compliance with this Section 5.3 that do not in the aggregate result in
terms materially more favorable to such Person than those contained in the
Non-Disclosure Agreement) (each of the foregoing, a " _Company Adverse
Recommendation Change_ "), (2) approve, authorize or permit or allow the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, merger
or acquisition agreement or any similar agreement or understanding with
respect to any Alternative Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement as expressly permitted hereunder) (each of the foregoing, an "
_Alternative Proposal Agreement_ ") or (3) resolve, propose or agree to any
of the foregoing; _provided_ , _however_ , prior to the Shareholder
Approval being obtained (but not after), if (x) the Board of Directors
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and upon
recommendation thereof by the Special Committee) that the failure to take any
of the following actions would be materially inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (y) (i) the Special Committee
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and its
financial advisors) that a bona fide written Alternative Proposal received by
the Company in compliance with this Section 5.3 constitutes a Superior
Proposal (including any Superior Proposal made by an Excluded Party) or (ii) a
material development or change in circumstances occurs or arises after the
date hereof not relating to any Alternative Proposal and that was not known
to, or reasonably foreseeable by, the Company or the Board of Directors (or
any committee thereof) as of or prior to the date hereof (such development or
change in circumstances, an " _Intervening Event_ "), it being understood
that, for the avoidance of doubt, an Intervening Event shall not include any
development or change set forth in  _Section 5.3(f) of the Disclosure
Schedule_, and (z) the Company and its Subsidiaries have complied in all
material respects with this Section 5.3, then the Special Committee or the
Board of Directors may (I) effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or
(II) only in the case of the foregoing clause (y)(i), allow the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any Alternative Proposal Agreement with
respect to such Superior Proposal and effect any transaction contemplated by
such Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that the Board
of Directors may only take the actions described in (1) clause (II) if the
Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(e) concurrently
with entering into such Alternative Proposal Agreement and pays the
Company Termination Fee in compliance with Section 7.2 and (2) clauses (I) or
(II) if: 

  

(i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to the Parent and
Merger Sub, of its or the Board of Directors intention to take such actions
at least four (4) calendar days in advance of taking such action, which
notice shall specify, as applicable, the details of such Intervening Event or
the material terms of the Alternative Proposal received by the Company
that constitutes a Superior Proposal, including a copy of the relevant
proposed transaction agreements with, and the identity of, the party making
the Alternative Proposal and other material documents (including any
financing commitments with respect to such Alternative Proposal); 

  

    ##### 

  

   

(ii) after providing such notice and prior to taking such actions, the Company
shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, negotiate with the Parent and
Merger Sub in good faith (to the extent the Parent and Merger Sub desire to
negotiate) during such four-day period to make such adjustments in the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and the Financing Commitments as
would permit the Company, the Special Committee or the Board of Directors not
to take such actions; and 

  

(iii) the Special Committee and the Board of Directors shall have considered
in good faith any changes to this Agreement and the Financing Commitments or
other arrangements that may be offered in writing by the Parent by 5:00 PM
Pacific Time on the fourth day of such four-day period and shall have
determined in good faith (x) with respect to the actions described in clause
(II), after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisors that
the Alternative Proposal received by the Company would continue to constitute
a Superior Proposal and (y) with respect to the actions described in clauses
(I) or (II), after consultation with outside counsel, that it would
continue to be materially inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties
under applicable Law not to effect the Company Adverse Recommendation Change,
in each case, if such changes offered in writing by the Parent were given
effect. 

  

In the event of any material revisions to the Superior Proposal (it being
agreed that material revisions shall include any favorable change in the
purchase price, form of consideration, transaction timing or transaction
financing for such Superior Proposal), the Company shall be required to
deliver a new written notice to the Parent pursuant to the foregoing clause
(i) and to comply again with the requirements of this Section 5.3(f) with
respect to such new written notice, except the notice period shall be at
least two days (rather than the four days contemplated by Section 5.3(f)(i)
above). Nothing contained in this Section 5.3 or elsewhere in this
Agreement will prohibit the Company, the Board of Directors or the Special
Committee from taking and disclosing to the shareholders of the Company a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange
Act (or any similar communication to shareholders in connection with the
making or amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer) or otherwise
complying with the provisions of Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange
Act or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or making such other disclosure as
required by applicable Law if, in each such case in the good faith judgment
of the Board of Directors or the Special Committee, failure to make such
disclosure would be materially inconsistent with its obligations under
applicable Law; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that neither the Board of Directors
nor any committee thereof shall recommend that the shareholders of the
Company tender their shares in connection with any tender or exchange offer
(or otherwise approve or recommend any Alternative Proposal) or effect a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change, unless in each case, the applicable
requirements of this Section 5.3 shall have been satisfied. 

  

    ##### 

  

     

(g) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean a bona fide
written Alternative Proposal that the Board of Directors (which may be
determined acting through the Special Committee) determines in good faith,
after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation and the Companys outside counsel, is reasonably likely to
be consummated in accordance with its terms, taking into account all legal,
financial (including the financing terms thereof), regulatory, timing and
other aspects of such Alternative Proposal, and, if consummated, would be
more favorable to the shareholders of the Company from a financial point of
view than the Merger, taking into account all of the terms and conditions of
such Alternative Proposal (including the likelihood and timing of
consummation thereof) and this Agreement (including any changes to the terms
of this Agreement committed to by the Parent to the Company in writing in
response to such Alternative Proposal under the provisions of Section 5.3(f)
or otherwise); _provided_ that for purposes of the definition of "Superior
Proposal", the references to "20%" in the definition of Alternative Proposal
shall be deemed to be references to "50%". 

  

5.4 _Regulatory Matters and Approvals; Further Action_. 

  

(a) Each of the Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall, as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the execution of this Agreement and before
the expiration of any relevant legal deadline, make or cause to be made

States Department of Justice, the notification and report form required under
the HSR Act (which form shall be filed no later than ten (10) Business Days

deadline), and (ii) to the appropriate Governmental Entities listed on
_Section 5.4 of the Disclosure Schedule_ (the " _International Filings_ "),
the notification and report form filings required under the antitrust and
competition Laws and foreign investment Laws of such jurisdictions (which
filings shall be made as reasonably promptly as practicable after the date

International Filings for the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement including (A) defending against the entry of any Order
under any applicable antitrust or competition Law of the United States or
under the Laws set forth on _Section 5.4 of the Disclosure Schedule_,

defending any Actions asserted by a Governmental Entity challenging this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby thereunder under the
applicable antitrust or competition Laws of the United States or the Laws set
forth on _Section 5.4 of the Disclosure Schedule_, and using its reasonable
best efforts to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any Order under
any applicable antitrust or competition Law of the United States or under the
Laws set forth on _Section 5.4 of the Disclosure Schedule_, whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits,
prevents or restricts consummation of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby and (B) to the extent permitted by Law, keeping each
other apprised of the status of any communications with, and any inquiries or
requests for additional information, from any Governmental Entity. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(b) Each of the Parent and the Company agrees to instruct its respective
counsel to cooperate with each other and shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to the extent permitted by Law to (i) furnish to each
others counsel such reasonably necessary information and
reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection with its
preparation of any filing or submission under the HSR Act and the
International Filings and (ii) permit the other partys counsel to review and
incorporate such other partys counsels reasonable comments in any filings or
other communication given by it to any Governmental Entity or in connection
with any proceeding by a private party related to antitrust or competition
Laws with any other Person. None of the Parent, the Company nor any of their
respective counsel shall independently contact any Governmental Entity or
participate in any meeting or discussion (or any other communication by any
means) with any Governmental Entity in respect of any such filings,
applications, investigation or other inquiry without giving, in the case of
the Parent, the Company, and in the case of the Company, the Parent, in
either case, where reasonably practicable, prior reasonable notice of the
meeting or discussion, the opportunity to confer with each other regarding
appropriate contacts with and responses to personnel of said Governmental
Entity, the opportunity to review and comment on the contents of
any representations (oral or otherwise) expected to be communicated at the

Governmental Entity, the opportunity to attend and participate at the meeting
or discussion (which, at the request of the Parent or the Company,
as applicable, shall be limited to outside antitrust counsel only). 

  

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties
hereto shall use their reasonable best efforts to effectuate the Merger in
accordance with this Agreement as promptly as practicable, including using
their reasonable best efforts (i) to request and obtain all necessary or
appropriate consents, waivers and approvals under any Contracts to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party in connection with this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby so as
to maintain and preserve the benefits under such Contracts following the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; provided that (x) no
party shall be obligated to pay any consideration to any third party from whom
such consent, waiver or approval is requested and (y) the consent of the
Parent shall be required with respect to any amendment or modification to any
Contract in connection with obtaining any such consent, waiver or approval
that is adverse in any material respect to the Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and (ii) to execute or deliver any
additional instruments reasonably necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement. 

  

5.5 _Press Releases and Public Announcement_. None of the Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company or their respective Representatives will issue any press release
or make any public announcement or disclosure relating to this Agreement, the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the
prior written approval of, in the case of the Parent and Merger Sub,
the Company, and in the case of the Company, the Parent; provided that each
party may issue any such press release or make such public announcement it
believes in good faith is required to be made by applicable Law or any
applicable rule or regulation promulgated by any applicable
securities exchange after consultation with legal counsel, in which case the
disclosing party will use its commercially reasonable efforts to advise and
consult with the other parties regarding any such press release or other
announcement prior to making any such disclosure. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

5.6 _Access to Information; Shareholder Litigation_. 

  

(a) Subject to applicable Law, during the period commencing on the date hereof
and ending at the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1, the Company will, and will cause
each of its Subsidiaries to, upon reasonable prior written notice of the
Parent, permit the Parent and its Representatives and Financing Sources to
have (at the Parents expense) reasonable access at all reasonable times, and
in a manner so as not to interfere with the normal business operations of the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries, to (i) the officers and senior
management, the premises, employees, agents, books, records, and Contracts of
or pertaining to the Company and any of its Subsidiaries and (ii) subject to
the prior consent of the Company (which consent is not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), the customers and suppliers of the Company
and any of its Subsidiaries, in each case, as the Parent may reasonably
request in writing. 

  

(b) The Company will give prompt written notice to the Parent of any event
that would reasonably be expected to give rise to, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. The Parent and Merger Sub will give
prompt written notice to the Company of any event that would reasonably be
expected to, individually or in the aggregate, prevent or materially delay
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of
the Company, the Parent and Merger Sub will give prompt written notice to the
other parties of (i) any facts relating to such party which would make it
necessary or advisable to amend the Proxy Statement or the Schedule 13E-3 in
order to make the statements therein not misleading or to comply with
applicable Law and (ii) any notice or other communication received by such
party from any Governmental Entity or other Person in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby or from any Person alleging that the consent
of such Person is or may be required in connection with the transaction
contemplated hereby. The Company shall (w) promptly advise the Parent of any

their own behalf or on behalf of the Company) relating to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby, (x) keep the Parent reasonably informed
regarding any such Action, (y) give the Parent the opportunity to participate

_provided_ that (A) any settlement agreed to in writing by the Companys
insurance carriers and the Company pursuant to which the Companys insurance
carriers expressly agree to directly cover the entire costs of
such settlement and all related litigation costs of the Company and (B) such
settlement is solely for monetary relief, then such settlement shall be
deemed reasonable and shall not require any further Parent consent). The
delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.6(b) will not limit,
expand or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder (if any) to the
party receiving such notice. 

  

(c) Each of the Parent and Merger Sub will, and will cause their respective
Representatives to, hold and treat and will cause its officers, employees,
auditors and other authorized representatives to hold and treat in confidence

(a) Until the twelve month anniversary of the Effective Time (the " _Benefits
Continuation Period_ "), the Parent shall provide, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to provide, for
those employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who are employed
immediately prior to the Effective Time and who continue as employees of the
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries
during the Benefits Continuation Period (the " _Company Employees_ "), (i) at
least the same level of base salary or wages (as applicable) and (ii)
employee benefits and aggregate annual cash incentive opportunities that
are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided as of the
date hereof by the Company or the applicable Subsidiary to such Company
Employees pursuant to the Company Plans (excluding, for purposes of currently
provided benefits, any equity or equity-based compensation, defined
benefit pension benefits, retiree medical benefits or transaction or
retention bonuses). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Subsidiaries to provide, severance and any similar benefits
to Company Employees that are substantially similar to the severance and
similar benefits currently provided under the Company Plans for the Benefit
Continuation Period, including by recognizing all service recognized for such
purposes under the applicable Company Plan. 

  

(b) For purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting and
entitlement to benefits, where length of service is relevant under any
benefit plan or arrangement of the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
of their respective Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employee
after the Effective Time (collectively, the "New Plans"), the Company
Employees shall receive service credit for service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries (and any respective predecessors) to the same extent such
service credit was granted under the Company Plans, except to the extent any
such service credit would result in the duplication of benefits. In addition
and without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) each Company
Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting
time or satisfaction of any other eligibility requirements, in any and all
New Plans to the extent that (A) coverage under such New Plan
replaces coverage under a Company Plan in which such Company Employee
participated immediately before the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Old
Plans_ ") and (B) such Company Employee has satisfied all waiting time and
other eligibility requirements under the Old Plan being replaced by the
New Plan; and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee, the Parent
shall cause (x) all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively at work
requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Company Employee and his
or her covered dependents to the extent such conditions were inapplicable
or waived under the comparable Old Plan and (y) any expenses incurred by any
Company Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the
plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such Company Employees
participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into
account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Company
Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if
such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended (i) to require the Parent,
the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates
to establish or maintain any specific Company Plan or other employee benefit
plan or arrangement for any length of time; or (ii) to create or amend any
Company Plan or other employee benefit plan or arrangement. This Section 5.7
is included for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
transferees and permitted assigns and does not and shall not create any right
in any Person, including any Company Employee, or any other participant in or
beneficiary under any Company Plan or other employee benefit plan or
arrangement that may be established or maintained by the Parent, the Company,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates following the
Merger, or any beneficiary or trustee thereof. Furthermore, nothing contained
in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any Person,
any right to employment or continued employment for any period of time, or
any right to a particular term or condition of employment. 

  

5.8 _Indemnification and Insurance_. 

  

(a) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, the memorandum and
articles of association of the Surviving Corporation, subject to compliance
with applicable Law, shall contain provisions with respect to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable to
the directors or officers of the Company as those contained in the
memorandum and articles of association in effect immediately as of the date
hereof. From and after the Effective Time, each of the Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall (i) be jointly and severally liable to pay and
perform in a timely manner such indemnification, advancement and
exculpation obligations, and (ii), to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds in respect of
each of the foregoing, following receipt of any undertakings required by
applicable Law), to the same extent that such persons are entitled
to indemnification or advancement pursuant to the memorandum and articles of
association of the Company as in effect as of the date hereof, each current
and former director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(each, together with such persons heirs, executors or administrators, an "
_Indemnified Party_ ") against any costs or expenses (including
advancing attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of
any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the
fullest extent permitted by Law and following receipt of any undertaking
required by applicable Law), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any
actual or threatened Actions, arising out of, relating to or in connection
with any action or omission occurring or alleged to have occurred (x) in such
Indemnified Partys capacity as a director or officer of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or (y) in such Indemnified Partys capacity as a director,
officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise at
the request or for the benefit of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries,
before the Effective Time (including acts or omissions in connection with
such persons serving as an officer, director or other fiduciary in any entity
if such service was at the request or for the benefit of the Company or one
of its Subsidiaries), including, for the avoidance of doubt, in connection
with (i) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) actions to
enforce this provision or any other indemnification or advancement right of
any Indemnified Party. In the event of any such Action, the Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnified Party
in the defense of any such Action. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(b) For the six (6) year period commencing immediately after the Effective
Time (the " _D andO Tail Period_"), the Parent shall maintain in effect the
Companys current directors and officers liability insurance covering acts
or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time with respect to
those persons who are currently (and any additional persons who prior to
the Effective Time become) covered by the Companys directors and officers
liability insurance policy on terms and scope with respect to such coverage,
and in amount, not less favorable in any material respects to such
individuals than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof (or the
Parent may substitute therefor policies, issued by reputable insurers, of at
least the same coverage with respect to matters existing or occurring prior
to the Effective Time, including a fully-paid "tail" policy for the DandO Tail
Period); _provided_ , _however_ , that, if the aggregate annual premium for
such insurance shall exceed 300% of the current annual premium, then the
Parent shall provide or cause to be provided a policy for the applicable
individuals with the best coverage as shall then be available at an aggregate
premium of 300% of the current annual premium;  _provided_ , _further_ ,
_however_ , that any such replacement or substitution of insurance policies
shall not result in gaps in coverage. Subject to the prior consent of
the Parent, the Company shall have the right prior to the Effective Time to
purchase, for an aggregate amount not to exceed 300% of the current annual
premium, a fully-paid "tail" policy for the DandO Tail Period on terms and
scope with respect to such coverage, and in amount, not less (but not more)
favorable in any material respect to such individuals than the directors and
officers liability insurance policy in effect on the date hereof (including
Side A coverage) with respect to matters existing or occurring prior to the
Effective Time. If such fully-paid "tail" policy has been obtained by the
Company prior to the Effective Time, it shall be deemed to satisfy
all obligations to obtain insurance pursuant to this Section 5.8(b) and the
Surviving Corporation shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such
policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and to
honor all of its obligations thereunder. 

  

(c) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to,
and not in limitation of, any other rights such person may have under the
memorandum and articles of association or other organization documents of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation, any other
indemnification arrangement, the Cayman Companies Law, directors and
officers insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence
with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries or otherwise. Parent and
Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification by the Company now
existing in favor of each Indemnified Party pursuant to any of the agreements
set forth on _Section 5.8(c) of the Disclosure Schedule_, including
provisions relating to the advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of
any action or suit, shall survive the Merger and shall remain in full force
and effect. The provisions of this Section 5.8 shall survive the consummation
of the Merger and expressly are intended to benefit, and are enforceable by,
each of the Indemnified Parties and his or her heirs, each of whom is an
intended third-party beneficiary of this Section 5.8, and shall not be
terminated or modified in a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any
Indemnified Parties. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(d) In the event the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any person, in each case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 5.8. 

  

5.9 _Takeover Laws_. Without prejudice to Section 3.20, if any "moratorium",
"control share", "fair price", "affiliate transaction", "business
combination" or other anti-takeover laws and regulations of any Governmental
Entity (" _Takeover Laws_ ") is or may become applicable to the Merger, the
parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (a) take such actions as
are reasonably necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereunder may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby
and (b) otherwise take all such actions as are reasonably necessary to
eliminate or minimize the effects of any such Takeover Law on
the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

5.10 _Financing_. 

  

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent and
Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that Parents and Merger Subs obligations
to consummate the Merger are not conditioned upon Parents or Merger Subs
obtaining any financing. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledge and agree that the existence of any conditions contained in
the Financing Commitments or any commitment letter for any alternative
financing or any agreement relating thereto shall not constitute, nor be
construed to constitute, a condition to the consummation of the Merger
hereunder. 

  

(b) Each of the Parent and Merger Sub shall not permit any amendment or
modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under,
or replace, the Financing Commitments if such amendment, modification, waiver
or replacement (x) reduces the aggregate amount of the Financing (including
by increasing the amount of fees to be paid to the Financing Sources
or original issue discount), unless the Debt Financing or the Equity
Financing is increased by a corresponding amount or (y) imposes new or
additional conditions or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any of the
conditions to the receipt of the Financing in a manner that would reasonably
be expected to (I) materially delay or prevent the Closing Date, (II)
materially delay, prevent or otherwise make materially less likely to occur
the funding of the Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining
the Financing) or (III) adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub,
as applicable, to enforce its rights against other parties to the Financing
Letters or the definitive agreements with respect thereto in any material
respect, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the Financing on the terms and
conditions (including the flex provisions) described in the Financing
Commitments ( _provided_ that the Parent and Merger Sub may amend or replace
the Debt Financing Commitment to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed the
Debt Financing Commitment as of the date hereof), including using its
reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Financing Commitments,
(ii) satisfy on a timely basis (taking into account the expected timing of
the Marketing Period) all conditions applicable to the Parent and Merger
Sub to obtaining the Debt Financing at the Closing set forth therein that are
within its control, (iii) enter into definitive agreements with respect
thereto on the terms and

  

    ##### 

  

    

conditions (including the flex provisions) contemplated by the Debt
Financing Commitment (and provide copies thereof to the Company), (iv)
consummate the Financing in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
Debt Financing Commitment at or prior to the Closing, (v) cause the Financing
Sources providing Debt Financing to fund on the Closing Date the Debt
Financing required to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Debt
Financing Commitment. In the event any portion of the Debt Financing becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt Financing
Commitment, the Parent shall promptly notify the Company and shall use
its reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain alternative debt financing
from alternative debt sources on terms and conditions no less favorable to
the Parent and Merger Sub (in the reasonable judgment of the Parent) and in
an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
promptly following the occurrence of such event. For the avoidance of doubt,
in no event shall any Guarantor be required to provide any financing other
than equity financing, which equity shall in no event be required to exceed
the respective amounts set forth in the Equity Financing Commitment, and in
no event shall the Parent or Merger Sub be required to seek or obtain
equity financing other than the Equity Financing. The Parent shall promptly
deliver to the Company true and complete copies of all agreements pursuant to
which any such alternative source shall have committed to provide the Parent
and Merger Sub with any portion of the Financing. For purposes of this
Section 5.10 and Section 4.4, references to "Financing" and "Debt Financing"
shall include the financing contemplated by the Financing Commitments as
permitted by this Section 5.10 to be amended, modified or replaced and
references to "Financing Commitments" and "Debt Financing Commitment" shall
include such documents as permitted by this Section 5.10 to be amended,
modified or replaced, in each case from and after such amendment,
modification or replacement. 

  

(c) Prior to the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall provide to
the Parent and Merger Sub, and shall use their reasonable best efforts to
cause the officers, employees, advisors and other Representatives of the
Company and its Subsidiaries to provide to the Parent and Merger Sub, all
cooperation that is reasonably requested by the Parent in connection with the
Financing (provided that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably
interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries),
including: (i) participating in a reasonable number of meetings,
presentations, road shows, drafting sessions, due diligence sessions
and sessions with prospective Financing Sources, investors and ratings
agencies, and reasonably cooperating with the marketing efforts of the Parent

the Financing; (ii) furnishing the Parent, Merger Sub and their Financing
Sources as promptly as practicable with financial and other pertinent

(including pro forma financial information), and other documents
reasonably requested by the Financing Sources to consummate the Financings at
the time the Financings are to be consummated, including all information and
data necessary to satisfy the conditions set forth in paragraphs 5 and 6 of
Exhibit C of the Debt Financing Commitment; _provided_ that the Company shall
only be required to furnish pro forma information relating to the Merger
incorporating proposed debt and equity capitalization if Parent has provided
the Company with the assumptions for such pro forma preparation at least ten
days prior to the date such pro forma information is required to be delivered
(information and data required to be delivered pursuant to this clause (ii)
being referred to as the " _Required Information_ ");

  

    ##### 

  

    

(iii) assisting with the preparation of materials for rating agency
presentations, offering documents, private placement memoranda, bank
information memoranda (including, to the extent necessary, a bank information
memorandum that does not include material non-public information),
prospectuses and similar documents required in connection with the Financing;
(iv) executing and delivering any pledge and security documents and
otherwise reasonably facilitating the granting of a security interest (and
perfection thereof) in collateral, guarantees, mortgages, other definitive
financing documents or other certificates or documents (subject to the
occurrence of the Closing) as may reasonably be requested by the Parent;
(v) obtaining a certificate of the chief financial officer of the Company
with respect to solvency matters in the form attached as Annex I to Exhibit C
to the Debt Financing Commitment to the extent reasonably required by the
Financing Sources in customary form, customary authorization letters with
respect to the bank information memoranda from a senior officer of the Company
and consents of accountants for use of their reports in any materials
relating to the Debt Financing; (vi) using reasonable best efforts to obtain
accountants comfort letters, legal opinions, surveys and title insurance at
the expense of and as reasonably requested by the Parent on behalf of the

occurrence of the Closing, necessary to permit the consummation of such Debt
Financing and to permit the proceeds thereof to be made available to the
Company, including entering into one or more credit agreements, indentures
and/or other instruments on terms satisfactory to the Parent in connection
with such Debt Financing immediately prior to (and conditioned upon the
occurrence of) the Effective Time to the extent direct borrowings or debt
incurrence by the Company is contemplated in the Debt Financing Commitment;
(viii) at least five days prior to the Closing, providing all documentation
and other information about the Company and each of its Subsidiaries as is

regulations including the USA PATRIOT Act; and (ix) providing unaudited
consolidated quarterly and monthly financial statements of the Company
(excluding footnotes) consisting of a balance sheet, income statement and
statement of cash flows to the extent, in the case of monthly statements, the
Company customarily prepares such financial statements; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall not be required to enter into or perform
under any agreement with respect to the Financing that is not contingent upon
the Closing or that would be effective prior to the Closing. The Company
shall not be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or make any
other payment (other than reasonable out-of-pocket costs) or incur any other
liability or provide or agree to provide any indemnity in connection with the
Financing or any of the foregoing prior to the Effective Time. The Parent
shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Representatives from
and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses,
interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them in
connection with the arrangement of the Financing and any information (other
than information furnished by or on behalf of the Company of its
Subsidiaries) utilized in connection therewith. The Parent shall, promptly
upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all documented and
reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company in connection with
such cooperation. Without granting any ownership or other rights, the Company
hereby consents to the reasonable and customary use of its and
its Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Debt Financing contemplated by
the Debt Financing Commitment; provided, that such logos are used solely in a
manner that is not intended to nor reasonably likely to harm or disparage the
Company or its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or
its Subsidiaries. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(d) Without prejudice to Section 5.13, to the extent permitted by Law, the
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and their respective

reorganization of the Companys Subsidiaries, employees, assets or
liabilities and, if directed by Parent, to cause any such internal
structuring or reorganization to be effectuated at or immediately prior to the
Closing ( _provided_ that the formation or incorporation of new wholly-owned
Subsidiaries may occur upon Parents reasonable request at any time following
the date hereof); _provided_ that such cooperation will not unreasonably
interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company.

Company) at or prior to the Effective Time of the following conditions: 

  

(a) The representations and warranties of each of the Parent and Merger Sub
set forth in this Agreement will be true and correct as of the Effective Time
(except to the extent such representations and warranties speak as of another
time, in which case such representations and warranties will be true and
correct as of such other time), except where the failure of
such representations and warranties to be so true and correct does not
prevent, materially delay or otherwise materially and adversely affect the
ability of the Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

(b) The Parent and Merger Sub shall have performed in all material respects
all of the covenants required to be performed by them under this Agreement at
or prior to the Closing Date. 

  

(c) The Parent shall have delivered to the Company a certificate, dated as of

authorized officer of the Parent, certifying to the effect that the
conditions set forth in Sections 6.3(a) and 6.3(b) have been satisfied.

such Order or other action will have become final and nonappealable;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this Section 7.1(b) shall not be available to the party seeking to

terminate if the failure of such party (or in the case of Merger Sub,

terminate this Agreement pursuant to this 7.1(d) shall not be available to

cured) from Merger Sub of such breach or failure;  _provided_ that Merger Sub
shall not have a right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section

    ##### 

  

  

(g) by the Company, if the Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached or failed

agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform
(i) would result in a failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.1 or 6.3
and (ii) (x) cannot be cured by the End Date or (y) if capable of being
cured, shall not have been cured within 30 days following receipt of written
notice (which notice shall specify in reasonable detail the nature of such
breach or failure and the Companys intention to terminate this Agreement if
such breach or failure is not cured) from the Company of such breach; 
_provided_ that the Company shall not have a right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 7.1(g) if it is then in breach of any
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this
Agreement that would result in a failure of a condition set forth in Section
6.1 or 6.2; 

  

(h) by the Company, if (i) all of the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and

conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the
Closing) or will be waived by the Company and (y) it is prepared to
consummate the Closing and (iv) the Company stood ready, willing and able to
consummate the Closing, during such period; or 

  

(i) by Merger Sub, at any time prior to the Shareholder Approval being

Written notice of termination other than pursuant to Section 7.1(a) shall be
given to the other party or parties, specifying the provisions hereof
pursuant to which such termination is being made. 

  

7.2 _Certain Remedies_. 

  

(a) _Company Termination Fee_. 

  

(i) If (A) (i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(d), (ii)
any Person shall have publicly disclosed a bona fide Alternative Proposal on
or after the date hereof but prior to the Company Shareholder Meeting and
such Alternative Proposal shall not have been withdrawn at least three
Business Days prior to the Company Shareholder Meeting, and (iii) within 12
months after the Termination Date, the Company or any of its Affiliates (x)
consummates an Alternative Proposal or (y) enters into a definitive agreement
with respect to an Alternative Proposal and ultimately consummates an
Alternative Proposal (in each case whether or not the Alternative Proposal
was the same Alternative Proposal referred to in clause (ii)), or (B) (i) this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(c), or 7.1(f), (ii) any
Person shall have made a bona fide Alternative Proposal on or after the date
hereof but prior to the date that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 7.1, and (iii) within 12 months after the Termination Date, the
Company or any of its Affiliates (x) consummates an Alternative Proposal
or (y) enters into a definitive agreement with respect to an Alternative
Proposal and ultimately consummates an Alternative Proposal (in each case
whether or not the Alternative Proposal was the same Alternative Proposal
referred to in clause (ii)), then the Company will pay the Parents designees
an aggregate amount equal to the Company Termination Fee, less any Parent
Expenses paid by the Company pursuant to Section 7.2(c). 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(ii) If this Agreement is terminated (x) by the Company pursuant to Section
7.1(e) or (y) by Merger Sub pursuant to Section 7.1(i), then the Company will
pay the Parents designees an aggregate amount equal to the Company
Termination Fee. 

  

(iii) For the purpose of this Section 7.2(a), all references in the term
Alternative Proposal to "20% or more" will be deemed to be references to
"more than 50%". 

  

(iv) The Company Termination Fee will be paid in the aggregate to the Parents
designees by the Company in immediately available funds (x) in the case of
Section 7.2(a)(i) or 7.2(a)(ii)(y), within two (2) Business Days after the
date of the event giving rise to the obligation to make such payment and (y)
in the case of Section 7.2(a)(ii)(x), prior to or contemporaneously with
such termination of this Agreement (and any purported termination pursuant to
Section 7.1(e) shall be void and of no force or effect unless the Company
shall have made such payment). 

  

(v) As used in this Agreement, " _Company Termination Fee_ " means (A) an
amount equal to Twelve Million Nine Hundred Thousand Dollars ($12,900,000) if
the Company Termination Fee becomes payable pursuant to Sections 7.1(e) or
7.1(i) in connection with the Company entering into an Alternative Proposal
Agreement in compliance with Section 5.3 that reflects a Superior
Proposal with an Excluded Party, and (B) an amount equal to Nineteen Million
Four Hundred Thousand Dollars ($19,400,000) in all other circumstances. 

  

(b) _Parent Termination Fee._  

  

(i) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to (x) Section
7.1(g), and at such time the conditions set forth in Sections 6.1 and 6.2
have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing and those conditions that the
Parents or Merger Subs breach of this Agreement have caused not to
be satisfied), or (y) Section 7.1(h), then the Parent will pay the Company an
amount equal to Fifty Eight Million One Hundred Thousand Dollars
($58,100,000) (the " _Parent Termination Fee_ "). Solely for purposes of
establishing the basis for the amount thereof, and without in any
way increasing the amount of the Parent Termination Fee or expanding the
circumstances in which the Parent Termination Fee is to be paid, it is agreed
that the Parent Termination Fee is liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount
will compensate the Company in the circumstances in which the Parent
Termination Fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate
with precision and not a penalty, and the payment of the Parent Termination
Fee in the circumstances specified herein is supported by due and sufficient
consideration. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(ii) In the event the Parent Termination Fee is payable, such fee will be paid
to the Company by the Parent in immediately available funds within two (2)
Business Days after the date of the event giving rise to the obligation to
make such payment. 

  

(c) _Reimbursement of Expenses_. Without limiting or otherwise affecting in
any way the other remedies available to the Parent or Merger Sub, in the
event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d), then the
Company shall promptly, but in no event later than two (2) Business Days
after the Termination Date, pay the Parents designee 50% of the
documented out-of-pocket Expenses incurred by the Parent, Merger Sub and
their respective Affiliates in connection with the preparation, execution and
performance of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (the "
_Parent Expenses_ ") up to a maximum amount of Five Million
Dollars ($5,000,000),by wire transfer of same day funds. 

  

(d) Each of the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the agreements
contained in this Section 7.2 are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and that without these agreements, the other party would
not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company or Parent or
Merger Sub, as the case may be, fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to
this Section 7.2, and in order to obtain payment, Parent and Merger Sub or
the Company, as the case may be, commence an Action which results in a
judgment in favor of Parent and/or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the
Company, on the other hand, then the non-prevailing party or parties (as the
case may be) shall pay each of the other party or parties, as applicable, its
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees) in connection with such Action, together with
interest on such payment at the prime rate as published in the Wall
Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made
through the date such payment was actually made. 

  

7.3 _Effect of Termination_. 

  

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either the Company or
Merger Sub as provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement will forthwith become
void and have no further force or effect, without any Liability (other than
as set forth, and subject to the limitations included, in Section 7.2 or this
Section 7.3) on the part of the Parent, Merger Sub or the Company (or
any Representative of any such party); _provided_ , _however_ , that the
provisions of Sections 5.6(c), 7.2, 7.3, 7.4 and Article VIII and, subject to
the terms and conditions set forth therein, the Non-Disclosure Agreement and
the Limited Guarantees will survive any termination hereof; _provided_ ,
_further_ , _however_ , that subject to the terms of this Section 7.3,
nothing in this Section 7.3(a) shall relieve any party of any Liability for
any material breach by such party of this Agreement prior to the Effective
Time. 

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event
that the Company Termination Fee is paid to the Parent (or its designees),
payment of the Company Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
of the Parent, Merger Sub and each of their respective Affiliates against the
Company and any of its former, current and future Affiliates, and each
of their respective directors, officers, employees, shareholders,
controlling Persons or Representatives for any loss or damage based upon,
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or
performance hereof or the transactions contemplated hereby; and in no event
shall the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than
one occasion. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the Parent
and Merger Sub fail to effect the Closing when required by Section 1.2 for
any or no reason or otherwise breach this Agreement (whether willfully,
intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise) or fail to perform hereunder
(whether willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise), then, (i)
the Companys and its Affiliates sole and exclusive remedy (whether at law,
in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against the Parent, Merger Sub,
the Guarantors and any of their respective former, current and future direct
or indirect equityholders, controlling persons, shareholders,
directors, officers, employees, agents, Affiliates, members, managers,
general or limited partners, Financing Sources or assignees (each a "
_Related Party_ " and collectively, the " _Related Parties_ ") or any Related
Party of any Related Party for any breach, loss or damage shall be
to terminate this Agreement and receive payment of the Parent Termination Fee
and any amounts due pursuant to Section 7.2(d), in each case, only to the
extent provided by Sections 7.2(b) or 7.2(d) or pursuant to the Limited
Guarantees, as applicable, and (ii) except as provided in the immediately
foregoing clause (i), none of the Related Parties or any Related Party of a
Related Party will have any Liability to the Company or any of its Affiliates
relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Limited Guarantees (except,
for the avoidance of doubt, for the Guarantors obligation under their
respective Limited Guarantees, subject to the limitations contained therein),
the Financing Commitments or in respect of any other document or theory of law
or equity or in respect of any representations made or alleged to be made in
connection herewith or therewith, whether at law or equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise. The parties acknowledge and agree that in no event will
the Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than one
occasion. Upon payment of the Parent Termination Fee and any amounts due
pursuant to Section 7.2(d), none of the Related Parties or any Related Party
of any Related Party shall have any further Liability to the Company or any
of its Affiliates relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Limited
Guarantees, the Financing Commitments or in respect of any other document
or theory of law or equity or in respect of any representations made or
alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith, whether at law or
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and none of the Related Parties or
any Related Party of any Related Party shall have any further Liability to
the Company or any of its Affiliates relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

7.4 _Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed by
the Company in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached by the Company and that money damages may not be an adequate remedy
therefor. It is accordingly agreed that the Parent and Merger Sub shall
be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement by the Company and to seek to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement against the Company without bond or other
security being required, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, the parties further agree that the Company shall not be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement by the Parent or Merger Sub, to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement against the Parent or Merger Sub or otherwise to
obtain any equitable relief or remedy against the Parent or Merger Sub and
that the Companys sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any such breach
shall be the remedy available to the Company set forth in Sections 7.2(b) and
7.3(c).
