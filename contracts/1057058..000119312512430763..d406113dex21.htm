-11-  ARTICLE II

THE SALE AND PURCHASE

2.1 _Sale and Purchase of Securities_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the closing of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Closing_ "), each Seller shall
transfer, convey, assign and deliver to Purchaser and/or its designees, and
Purchaser and/or its designees shall purchase and acquire from each Seller,
all of such Sellers right, title and interest in and to the Securities (the "
_Sale_ ").

 

2.2 _Purchase Price; Assumption of Liabilities_. In consideration for the
Securities, at the Closing, (a) Purchaser shall (or shall cause Waste
Connections or one of its wholly owned Subsidiaries to) pay to Sellers (or to
an Affiliate designated by Sellers) (i) (x) an aggregate of $1,316,000,000 in
cash, _plus_ (y) an amount in cash equal to interest that would accrue
on $1,094,571,000, starting on and including June 30, 2012 through and
including the Closing Date at a rate of 4% per annum (based on a 365-day year)
(the aggregate amount described in this clause (i) being the " _Aggregate
Value Amount_ "), _plus_ (ii) the Adjustment Amount (if the Adjustment Amount
is positive), _less_ (iii) the absolute value of the Adjustment Amount (if the
Adjustment Amount is negative) (the result of such calculation of clauses
(i), (ii) and (iii), the " _As-Adjusted Amount_ )", _less_ (iv) the Credit
Agreement Payoff Amount, _less_ (v) the aggregate outstanding principal and
accrued but unpaid interest and any other amounts payable under the Prairie
Note and any other Debt as of the Closing Date (the result of such
calculation of clauses (i) through (v), the " _Purchase Price_ ") and (b)
Purchaser shall assume and be responsible for all the Assumed Liabilities.

 

2.3 _Closing Adjustment_ _._ (a) Not less than five Business Days prior to the
anticipated Closing Date, Sellers shall provide Purchaser with a statement
(the " _Closing Statement_ ") of the estimated Adjustment Amount and the
calculation thereof in reasonable detail. The Adjustment Amount for purposes
of the Closing shall be as set forth on the Closing Statement.

 



-12-  (b) If Purchaser objects to the Closing Statement, Purchaser shall deliver to
Sellers a statement reflecting its calculation of the Adjustment Amount (the
"Dispute Statement") within 21 days after the Closing Date. Sellers shall
consider such objections in good faith and may make changes to the Closing
Statement in response thereto; _provided_ , that if Purchaser continues to
object to the Closing Statement, then Sellers and Purchaser shall submit all
objections that remain outstanding to the Independent Accounting Firm, along
with a copy of the Closing Statement (as used at the Closing) marked to
indicate any line items that are not in dispute. The Parties shall instruct
the Independent Accounting Firm to make, within 45 days after the submission
of the objections to the Independent Accounting Firm, a final determination,
binding on the Parties, of the appropriate amount of each of the line items in
the Closing Statement which remain in dispute. The Independent Accounting
Firm, based solely on the written submissions of Sellers, on the one hand,
and Purchaser, on the other hand, and not by independent investigation, and
in accordance with the standards and definitions in this Agreement (including
the principles and policies set forth on _Schedule III_ ), shall select either
the Adjustment Amount as calculated by Sellers in the Closing Statement (as
used at the Closing) or by Purchaser in the Dispute Statement, which selected
amount shall be the final Adjustment Amount binding on the Parties (the "
_Final Adjustment Amount_ "). Each of Purchaser and Sellers will be afforded
the opportunity to present to the Independent Accounting Firm any information
or documents such Party deems relevant to the determination of the Final
Adjustment Amount. All fees and expenses relating to the work, if any, to be
performed by the Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne by Sellers if the
Independent Accounting Firm selects the Adjustment Amount calculated by
Purchaser, and shall be borne by Purchaser if the Independent Accounting Firm
selects the Adjustment Amount calculated by Sellers.

(c) If the Independent Accounting Firm selects the Adjustment Amount
calculated by Purchaser, then Sellers shall pay to Purchaser an amount equal
to the excess of the Adjustment Amount as determined at Closing over the Final
Adjustment Amount, together with interest on such excess at the rate of 4.0%
per annum from (and including) the Closing Date to (but excluding) the date of
such payment, and the As-Adjusted Amount shall be reduced by the amount of
such excess. Any payment made pursuant to this _Section 2.3(c)_ shall be
made within five Business Days of the determination by the Independent
Accounting Firm, by wire transfer, to an account or accounts designated by
Purchaser, in immediately available funds.

 

2.4 _Closing_. (a) The Closing shall take place at the offices of Baker Botts
L.L.P., 32nd Floor, 910 Louisiana, Houston, Texas at 9:00 a.m., Houston time,
on the third Business Day after all of the conditions set forth in _Article
VIII_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or
waived at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those
conditions) are satisfied or waived, or at such other place, time or date as
may be mutually agreed upon in writing by each Seller and Purchaser (the "
_Closing Date_ ").

 

(b) At the Closing:

(i) Sellers shall:

(A) deliver to Purchaser certificates evidencing the Securities to the extent
that such Securities are in certificate form, duly endorsed in blank or with
stock powers duly executed in proper form for transfer, and with any required
stock transfer stamps affixed thereto, or confirmations of book-entry
transfer with respect to the Securities;

(B) deliver to Purchaser the certificate required to be delivered pursuant to
_Section 8.2(c)_; and

(C) deliver to Purchaser an executed counterpart to the Assignment and
Assumption Agreement in the form attached as _Exhibit A_ ; and

 



-13-  (D) deliver to Purchaser from each Seller, a properly completed and executed
certification of non-foreign status satisfying the requirements of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1445-2(b) and in a form reasonably acceptable to
Purchaser; provided that Paine and Partners Capital Fund III AIV II B, L.P.
shall instead deliver to Purchaser a duly executed and acknowledged affidavit
of each Blocker, in accordance with Treasury Regulation Sections
1.1445-2(c)(3) and 1.897-2(h), certifying that each "interest" (within the
meaning of Section 897(c)(1) of the Code) in such Blocker is not a "United
States real property interest" within the meaning of Section 897(c) of the
Code;

 

(E) deliver to Purchaser a payoff letter for the Credit Agreement; and

 

(ii) Purchaser shall:

(A) pay to Sellers, by wire transfer, to an account or accounts designated by
Sellers at least three Business Days prior to the Closing, in immediately
available funds, an aggregate amount in cash equal to the Purchase Price;

(B) pay to the administrative agent under the Credit Agreement, by wire
transfer, to the account or accounts specified in the payoff letter with
respect to the Credit Agreement, in immediately available funds, an aggregate
amount equal to the sum of (1) the Credit Agreement Payoff Amount and (2) an
amount sufficient to cash collateralize, in accordance with the provisions of
the Credit Agreement, each letter of credit issued and outstanding pursuant to
the Credit Agreement that was either (x) listed in _Section 3.2(c)_ of the
Seller Disclosure Letter or (y) issued in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice after the date of this Agreement, and (in the
case of either (x) or (y)) with respect to which the Purchaser has not either
(I) provided a backstop letter of credit satisfactory to the Issuing Bank (as
defined in the Credit Agreement) of such letter of credit or (II) in
accordance with _Section 5.7(b)_, caused itself to be substituted for each
Seller and its Affiliates (other than the members of the Transferred Group)
and caused each Seller and its Affiliates (other than the members of the
Transferred Group) to be released;

(C) deliver to Sellers an executed counterpart to the Assignment and
Assumption Agreement in the form attached as _Exhibit A_ ; and

 

(D) deliver to Sellers the certificate required to be delivered pursuant to
_Section 8.3(c)_.

 



-14-  2.5 _Purchase Price Allocations_. As promptly as practicable following the
date hereof, Sellers and Purchaser shall jointly engage the Valuation Firm to
determine, and shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Valuation
Firm to determine prior to the Closing Date, the amount of the anticipated As-
Adjusted Amount that would be allocated to the equity interests of Prairie
LLC and any assets owned thereby (the " _Prairie Allocation Amount_ "), which
Prairie Allocation Amount shall not exceed $430,000,000. Following the
determination of the Prairie Allocation Amount by the Valuation Firm, Sellers
may amend the Reorganization Plan with respect to the pre-Closing transactions
involving Prairie LLC; _provided_ that such amendment shall not cause the
Sellers to hold collectively less than all of the equity interests of Prairie
LLC and shall not adversely affect the Purchaser and its Subsidiaries
(including by decreasing Purchasers tax basis in Prairie LLC or any assets
owned by Prairie LLC), as of immediately following the Closing. Within 120
days after Closing, Purchaser shall engage the Valuation Firm to prepare an
allocation of the As-Adjusted Amount and any assumed liabilities, for tax
purposes, among the Securities and the assets of the Transferred Group (the "
_Allocation Schedule_ ") and shall deliver such Allocation Schedule to
Sellers; _provided_ that the aggregate amount allocated to the equity
interests of Prairie LLC and any assets owned thereby shall be the Prairie
Allocation Amount. Sellers shall have the opportunity to review and comment
upon the Allocation Schedule, and Sellers and Purchaser will attempt in good
faith to agree upon the Allocation Schedule within 90 days of the delivery of
the Allocation Schedule. If Sellers and Purchaser are unable to agree on the
Allocation Schedule within such 90-day period, they shall promptly thereafter
cause the Independent Accounting Firm to resolve any remaining disputes. All
fees and expenses relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the
Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne equally by Sellers on the one hand,
and Purchaser on the other hand. The Allocation Schedule, as agreed by the
Parties or determined by the Independent Accounting Firm, as applicable (the "
_Final Allocation Schedule_ "), shall be conclusive and binding on all
Parties. The Final Allocation Schedule shall be adjusted, as necessary, to
reflect any subsequent adjustments to the As-Adjusted Amount. Any such
adjustment shall be allocated to the asset or assets (if any) to which such
adjustment is attributable; _provided_ that, to the extent there are no such
assets, such adjustment shall be allocated pro rata among the Securities, with
any amount allocated to the equity interests of NewCo and Prairie LLC being
further allocated pro rata among all of the assets of the Transferred Group.
Except as provided in this _Section 2.5_, Sellers and Purchaser agree (and
agree to cause their respective Affiliates) to prepare and file all relevant
federal, state, local and foreign Tax Returns in accordance with the Final
Allocation Schedule, if any. None of Sellers, Purchaser or any of their
respective Affiliates shall take any position inconsistent with the
Final Allocation Schedule, if any, on any Tax Return or in any Tax
Proceeding, in each case, except to the extent otherwise required pursuant to
a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code (or any
similar provision of state, local or foreign Law).

insurance policies held in respect of the Business or otherwise maintained by
or for the Transferred Group (the " _Transferred Group Insurance Policies_ ")

ARTICLE IV

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

 

OF PURCHASER

Except as set forth in the corresponding section of the disclosure schedule
delivered by Purchaser to Sellers concurrently with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement (the " _Purchaser Disclosure Schedule_ "), it being
understood that any disclosure set forth in the applicable paragraph or
section of the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be disclosed
for any other section or paragraph of the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule or for
any portion of this Agreement to which the relevance of such disclosure is
reasonably apparent from the context of such disclosure, Purchaser represents
and warrants to Purchaser as follows:

4.1 _Organization and Qualification_. Purchaser is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of Delaware,
and has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate
its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now being conducted
and is qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign Person in
each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties
or assets or conduct of its business requires such qualification.

4.2 _Authority Relative to this Agreement_. Purchaser has all necessary power
and authority to execute, deliver and perform this Agreement and to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement. The execution, delivery and performance by Purchaser of
this Agreement and the consummations of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary action on the
part of Purchaser and no other proceedings on the part of Purchaser
are necessary to authorize the execution and delivery and performance of this
Agreement. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by
Purchaser and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Sellers, constitutes a valid, legal and binding agreement of
Purchaser, enforceable against Purchaser in accordance with its terms, subject
to the effect of any applicable Laws relating to bankruptcy, reorganization,
insolvency, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or preferential transfers, or
similar Laws relating to or affecting creditors rights generally and subject,
as to enforceability, to the effect of general principles of equity
(regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding at
equity or at Law).

 



-30-  4.3 _Consents and Approvals; No Violations_. No filing with or notice to, and
no permit, authorization, registration, consent or approval of, any
Governmental Entity is required on the part of Purchaser for the execution,
delivery and performance by Purchaser of this Agreement or the consummation by
Purchaser of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except
compliance with the applicable requirements of the HSR Act. Assuming
compliance with the items described in the immediately preceding sentence, and
except as would not impair in any material respect the ability of Sellers or
Purchaser, as the case may be, to perform their respective obligations under
this Agreement or prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Sale,
neither the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Purchaser
nor the consummation by Purchaser of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will (A) conflict with or result in any breach, violation or
infringement of any provision of the Charter Documents of Purchaser or any of
its Subsidiaries, (B) result in a breach, violation or infringement of, or
constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of time or both) a default
under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any Contract to which
Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them or
any of their properties or assets may be bound or (C) violate or infringe any
Law applicable to Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective properties or assets.

 

4.4 _Availability of Funds_. Purchaser will have available on the Closing Date
funds sufficient to pay the Aggregate Value Amount and expenses and will be
able to pay or otherwise perform the obligations of Purchaser under this
Agreement. In no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or
financing by Purchaser or any Affiliate or any other financing or
other transactions be a condition to any of Purchasers obligations
hereunder.

4.5 _Solvency_. Assuming (a) the satisfaction of the conditions to
Purchasers obligation to effect the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or waiver of such conditions and (b) the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of Sellers contained herein and compliance in
all material respects by Sellers with the covenants contained herein,
immediately after giving effect to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, Purchaser will be Solvent. For purposes of
this  _Section 4.5_, " _Solvent_ " shall mean, with respect to any Person,
that:

(i) the fair saleable value (determined on a going concern basis) of the
assets of such Person shall be greater than the total amount of such Persons
Liabilities (including all Liabilities, whether or not reflected in a balance
sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP, and whether direct or indirect, fixed
or contingent, secured or unsecured, disputed or undisputed);

 

(ii) such Person shall be able to pay its debts and obligations in the
ordinary course of business as they become due; and 

(iii) such Person shall have adequate capital to carry on its businesses and
all businesses in which it is about to engage.

 



-31-  4.6 _Litigation_. As of the date of this Agreement, (i) there is no
civil, criminal or administrative Action pending, or to the Knowledge of
Purchaser, threatened, against Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries that would
reasonably be expected to prevent, hinder or delay any of the transactions
contemplated hereby and (ii) neither Purchaser nor any Subsidiary thereof is
subject to any outstanding Order, writ, or injunction that would reasonably be
expected to prevent, hinder or delay any of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 

4.7 _Broker s Fees_. Except for the Persons set forth in _Section 4.7_ of
the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule, whose fees with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will be borne by Purchaser, no
broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to any brokerage, finders or
other fee or commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Purchaser.

4.8 _Acquisition of Securities for Investment_. Purchaser has such knowledge
and experience in financial and business matters as is required for evaluating
the merits and risks of its purchase of the Securities and is capable of such
evaluation. Purchaser confirms that Sellers have made available to Purchaser
and Purchasers agents the opportunity to ask questions of the officers and
management employees of Sellers and of the Transferred Group as well as access
to the documents, information and records of Sellers and the Transferred
Group and to acquire additional information about the business and financial
condition of the Business, and Purchaser confirms that it has made an
independent investigation, analysis and evaluation of the Transferred Group
and its properties, assets, business, financial condition, prospects,
documents, information and records. Purchaser is acquiring the Securities for
the purpose of investment and not with a view toward or for resale in
connection with any distribution thereof, or with any present intention of
distributing or selling the Securities. Purchaser acknowledges that the
Securities have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state
securities Laws and agrees that the Securities may not be sold, transferred,
offered for sale, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of without
registration under the Securities Act, except pursuant to an exemption from
such registration available under the Securities Act, and without compliance
with foreign securities Laws, in each case, to the extent applicable.
Purchaser represents that it is an "accredited investor" as that term is
defined in rule 501 of Regulation D of the Securities Act.

 

4.9 _Inspections; Limitation of Sellers  Warranties_. Purchaser acknowledges
and agrees that it has conducted its own independent review and analysis of,
and, based thereon and on the representations and warranties contained in
_Article III_ , has formed an independent judgment concerning, the business,
assets, condition, operations and prospects of the Transferred Group. In
entering into this Agreement, Purchaser has relied solely upon its own
investigation and analysis and the representations and warranties contained in
_Article III_. Except for the representations and warranties contained in
_Article III_ , Purchaser acknowledges that neither Sellers nor any other
Person or entity on behalf of Sellers has made, and Purchaser has not relied
upon, any representation or warranty, whether express or implied, with respect
to Sellers, the Transferred Group or their respective businesses, affairs,
assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of operations, future
operating or financial results, estimates, projections, forecasts, plans or
prospects (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such
estimates, projections, forecasts, plans or prospects) or with respect to the
accuracy or completeness of any other information provided or made available
to Purchaser or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents,
representatives, lenders, Affiliates or any other Person acting on its behalf
by or on behalf of Sellers officers, directors, employees, agents,
representatives, lenders or Affiliates.

 



-32-  4.10 _No Regulatory Impediment_. To the Knowledge of Purchaser, there is no
material fact relating to Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries respective
businesses, operations, financial condition or legal status that would
reasonably be expected to materially impair the ability of the Parties to this
Agreement to obtain, on a timely basis, any authorization, consent, Order,
declaration or approval of, or ability to contract with, any Governmental
Entity necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

ARTICLE V

 

COVENANTS

5.1  _Access and Reports_. Except with respect to matters relating to Taxes
(which shall be governed by _Article VII_ ), the Parties agree as follows.

(a) After the date of this Agreement until the Closing Date (or the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms), Sellers shall
afford to representatives of Purchaser and its lenders or other financing
sources reasonable access to the employees, properties, facilities, contracts
and books and records of Sellers and the Transferred Group during normal
business hours in a manner that does not contravene any applicable Law,
upon reasonable notice; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) none of Sellers or
any member of the Transferred Group shall be required to violate any
obligation of confidentiality to which a Seller, the Transferred Group or any

pursuant to the access granted under  _Section 5.1(a)_ shall be conducted in
such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the operation of the
Business by Sellers or the Transferred Group. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, neither Sellers nor the Transferred Group shall
be required to provide access to or disclose information where, upon the
advice of counsel, such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-
client privilege of such Persons or contravene any applicable Law (it being
understood that the Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts (which
efforts shall not require waiver of attorney-client privilege) to implement
substitute arrangements in such circumstances).

 



-33-  (c) From the date of this Agreement until the Closing Date (or the termination
of this Agreement in accordance with its terms), Sellers will furnish to
Purchaser promptly after becoming available, monthly financial statements
including an unaudited balance sheet (the " _Monthly Balance Sheet_ "), income

may prepare for the internal use by the management of the Business consistent
with the past accounting practices and policies of the Business, with respect
to the Business.

(d) At and after the Closing, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries (including the Transferred Group) to, afford to Sellers and their
respective representatives, during normal business hours, in a manner that

books, records, properties and employees of the Transferred Group to the
extent that such access may be reasonably requested by Sellers, including in
connection with financial statements, proceedings before the Independent
Accounting Firm, taxes and regulatory obligations. At and after the Closing,
Sellers shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, afford to
Purchaser and its representatives, during normal business hours, in a manner

to the books, records, properties and employees of the Sellers to the extent
that such access may be reasonably requested by Purchaser, including in
connection with financial statements, proceedings before the Independent
Accounting Firm, taxes and regulatory obligations. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, neither Purchaser, Seller nor any member of
the Transferred Group or Seller Group shall be required to provide access to
or disclose information where, upon the advice of counsel, such access or
disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of such Person or
contravene any applicable Law. Nothing in this Agreement shall limit Sellers
or Purchasers rights of discovery under applicable Law.

5.2 _Confidentiality_. (a) The terms of the Confidentiality Agreement
are incorporated into this Agreement by reference and shall be applicable to
Purchaser to the same extent as they are applicable to Waste Connections;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the Confidentiality Agreement shall not
expire as a result of the parties thereto entering into this Agreement and
shall instead continue in full force and effect until the earlier of the
Closing or the date specified in clause (iii) of this sentence, (ii) upon
Closing, Purchasers and Waste Connections confidentiality obligations shall
terminate in respect of that portion of the Confidential Information (as
defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) relating to the Business (except to
the extent relating to the Seller Group) and shall otherwise continue in full
force and effect until the second anniversary of the Closing Date, and (iii)
if, for any reason, this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms
prior to the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full

herein or as necessary to enforce any of its rights hereunder or defend any
Action hereunder, the Sellers shall (i) treat and hold, and shall cause its
Affiliates (for all purposes under this _Section 5.2(b)_, including
investment funds that are Affiliates of such Seller and controlled Affiliates
of such funds, but excluding any Entities that are portfolio companies of such
investment funds as of the date hereof) to treat and hold, and not disclose
(or permit to disclose) to any Person (including any portfolio companies of
investment funds that are Affiliates of such Seller) any Business Confidential
Information of any of the members of the Transferred Group relating to the
Business and (ii) refrain, and shall cause its Affiliates to refrain, from
using any of such Business Confidential Information except in connection with
this Agreement; provided, however, that Sellers may disclose or use such
Business Confidential Information to comply with any applicable Law or Order,
provided that, to the extent permitted by applicable Law or Order, prior to
making any such disclosure, the disclosing Person shall (A) provide written
notification to Purchaser of any Action, of which it is aware, which may
result in disclosure, the nature of such information to be disclosed, and a
description of the Law or Order requiring such disclosure and (B) use
reasonable best efforts to prevent or limit such disclosure to that portion
of the Business Confidential Information that is legally required to be
disclosed.

5.3 _Efforts_. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided

reasonable best efforts to promptly take, or cause to be taken, all actions

under this Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate and make effective as
promptly as practicable after the date hereof the transactions contemplated

") and (ii) as promptly as practicable taking all steps as may be necessary to
obtain all such Governmental Approvals. In furtherance and not in limitation
of the foregoing, each Party hereto agrees to (A) make an appropriate and
complete filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby within ten (10) Business Days
of the date of this Agreement, and (B) not extend any waiting period under
the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law, nor enter into any agreement with the
United States Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") or the United States
Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") or any other Governmental Entity not to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except with the
prior written consent of the other Party (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). Each Party shall supply as promptly as
practicable any additional information or documentation that may be requested
pursuant to the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law and, subject to the terms
and conditions herein provided (including paragraph (c) below), use its
reasonable best efforts to take all other actions necessary, proper or
advisable to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting
periods under the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Law as soon as possible.

Antitrust Law, (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection

party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby,
unless any such Governmental Entity restricts the provision of such
information to the other Party; (iii) consult with each other in advance of
any meeting or conference with the FTC, the DOJ or any other
Governmental Entity or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party,
with any other person, and to the extent permitted by the FTC, the DOJ or such
other Governmental Entity or other person, give the other party and/or its
counsel the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and
conferences; and (iv) permit the other party and/or its counsel to review in
advance any submission, filing or communication (and documents submitted
therewith) intended to be given by it to the FTC, the DOJ or any other
Governmental Entity; _provided_ that materials may be redacted to remove
references concerning the valuation of the businesses of Sellers or Purchaser.
Purchaser and Sellers, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably
designate any competitively sensitive material to be provided to the other
under this _Section 5.3(b)_ as "Antitrust Counsel Only Material." Such
materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to the
outside antitrust counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such
outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless
express permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials
(Purchaser or Sellers, as the case may be) or its legal counsel.

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the
Parties contained in _Sections 5.3(a)_ and _5.3(b)_ , Purchaser shall use its
reasonable best efforts to: (i) avoid the entry of, or to have vacated,
lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other
order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that would restrain,
prevent or delay the Closing on or before the Outside Date, including
defending through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in any court
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the FTC,
the DOJ or any other applicable Governmental Entity or any private party; and
(ii) avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any Antitrust Law so
as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as possible (and in any event no
later than the Outside Date). Without limiting the immediately preceding
sentence, the obligations set forth in the immediately preceding sentence to
use reasonable best efforts shall require Purchaser to (x) propose,
negotiate, commit to and effect, by consent decree, hold separate order, or
otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of any of the businesses,
product lines or assets of Waste Connections or its Subsidiaries or the
Transferred Group (collectively, the " _Subject Assets_ "), (y) otherwise
take or commit to take actions that after the Closing would limit Purchasers
and/or its Subsidiaries freedom of action with respect to, or its or their
ability to operate and/or retain, one or more of the Subject Assets, and (z)
agree to divest, sell, dispose of, hold separate, or otherwise take or commit
to take any action that limits its freedom of action with respect to, or
Purchasers or its Subsidiaries freedom of action with respect to, or its or
their ability to operate or retain, any of the Subject Assets; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any action contemplated by clauses (x), (y) and (z) may be
conditioned upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. It shall not be deemed a failure to satisfy the conditions
specified in _Section 8.1(a)_ if, as a result of any suit brought by any
Person or Governmental Authority challenging the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement as violating any Antitrust Law, a court enters or the
applicable Governmental Authority makes an order or decree permitting the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, but requiring that any of
the Subject Assets be divested or held separate by Purchaser, or that would
otherwise limit Purchasers freedom of action with respect to, or its ability
to operate and retain, the Subject Assets.

 



-36-  (d) Without limiting any other obligation under this Agreement, during the
period from the date of this Agreement until the Closing Date, each of
Purchaser and Sellers shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and
controlled Affiliates to not, take or agree to take any action that would
reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the Parties from
obtaining any Governmental Approval in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or to prevent or materially delay or impede
the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein.

 

(e) Purchaser agrees to provide such security and assurances as to financial
capability, resources and creditworthiness as may be reasonably requested by
any Governmental Entity or other third party whose consent or approval is
sought in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. Whether or not
the Sale is consummated, Purchaser shall be responsible for all filing fees
and payments to any Governmental Entity in order to obtain any consents,
approvals or waivers pursuant to this _Section 5.3_.

(f) Sellers shall give prompt notice to Purchaser of any Action commenced or,
to the Knowledge of Sellers, threatened against, relating to or otherwise
affecting Sellers or any member of the Transferred Group arising out of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Purchaser shall give prompt
notice to Sellers of any Action commenced or, to the Knowledge of Purchaser,
threatened against, relating to or otherwise affecting Purchaser arising out
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

5.4 _Conduct of Business_. (a) During the period from the date of this
Agreement to the Closing Date, except (i) as set forth in _Section 5.4_ of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule, (ii) as expressly contemplated by this
Agreement or (iii) as Purchaser shall otherwise consent in writing (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Sellers
agree that they will, and will cause the Transferred Group and its Affiliates
(in respect of the Business) to, (x) conduct the Business in all
material respects in the ordinary course consistent with past practice, (y)
comply in all material respects with all applicable Laws, Orders and Permits,
and (z) use their commercially reasonable efforts to preserve intact the
Business in all material respects and to cause the Transferred Group to
retain the Business Employees and maintain the relationships of the Business
with customers, suppliers, subcontractors, licensors, licensees and others
having business relations with it. 

(b) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Closing Date,
except (A) as set forth in  _Section 5.4(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, (B) as Purchaser shall otherwise consent in writing (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), (C) as expressly
contemplated by this Agreement, (D) except with respect to clause (iii)
below, for actions between a member of the Transferred Group on the one hand
and another member of the Transferred Group on the other hand and (E) as
required by applicable Law, Sellers covenant and agree that they shall not,
and shall cause the members of the Transferred Group and their respective
Affiliates not to, take any of the following actions (with respect to Sellers
and their Affiliates other than the Transferred Group, solely with respect to
the Securities and the Business):

 



-37-  (i) (1) amend their respective Charter Documents, (2) split, combine or
reclassify their outstanding capital stock or other equity interests, or (3)

members of the Transferred Group or any debt or equity securities which are
convertible into or exchangeable for such capital stock or other
equity interests;

(iii) effect any steps in connection with the Reorganization, including any
mergers, consolidations, contributions, distributions, issuances,
liquidations, dissolutions, combinations, sales, transfers, conveyances,
assumptions, assignments, novations or similar actions in connection
therewith, except as set forth in the Reorganization Plan (as it may be
amended in accordance with _Section 2.5_);

(iv) engage in any practice (including (A) waiving rights or claims of the
Business in exchange for cash or other current assets, or (B) practices that
would have the effect of accelerating recognition of accounts receivable or

payable or other current liabilities to later periods, in each case outside
the ordinary course consistent with past practice) the primary purpose of
which is to artificially inflate the Adjustment Amount;

(v) incur any Indebtedness; _provided_ that members of the Transferred Group
may incur Indebtedness to the extent that such Indebtedness will be repaid at
or prior to the Closing;

(vi) except as may be required by the Credit Agreement, make any acquisition
of any assets or businesses, other than purchases in the ordinary course of

business and consistent with past practice;

 



-38-  (xi) increase or agree to increase the compensation or severance payable

practice;

 

(xii) (A) adopt, establish, amend or terminate any Benefit Plan or (B) take

Plan or (2) increase the Liabilities or obligations under any Benefit Plan;

 

(xiii) enter into, amend or extend any collective bargaining or other labor

-39-  (c) At or prior to the Closing, Sellers shall, subject to _Section 5.5_,
assign, transfer and convey to Purchaser or one or more members of the
Transferred Group all of their (and any of their Subsidiaries) right, title
and interest in the agreements and Intellectual Property set forth on _Section
5.4(c)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, and Purchaser or such member(s) of
the Transferred Group shall assume the obligations thereunder in accordance
with the terms thereof. If Sellers are unable to obtain one or more required
consents prior to the Closing from the applicable third party or Governmental
Entity to transfer one or more of the agreements and Intellectual Property set
forth in _Section 5.4(c)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, then Sellers
shall pass through to Purchaser or the Transferred Companies (and any of
their Subsidiaries), and the Transferred Companies shall accept and assume,
the benefits and burdens of such agreements and Intellectual Property and
shall continue to reasonably cooperate with Purchaser and the Transferred
Group to obtain such consents after the Closing.

(d) At or prior to the Closing, Sellers shall, subject to  _Section 5.5_,
assign, transfer and convey to Purchaser or one or more members of the
Transferred Group all of their right, title and interest in (i) the Permits
set forth in _Section 5.4(d)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule and (ii)
performance bonds and leases associated therewith, and Purchaser or such
member(s) of the Transferred Group shall assume the obligations thereunder in
accordance with the terms thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, the treatment
of any leases and Indemnified Guarantees related to the Permits set forth in
_Section 5.4(d)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule shall be governed by
_Section 5.7_. If Sellers are unable to obtain one or more required consents
prior to the Closing from the applicable Governmental Entity to transfer one
or more of the permits set forth in _Section 5.4(d)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, then Sellers shall pass through to Purchaser or the
Transferred Companies (and any of their Subsidiaries), and the Transferred
Companies shall accept and assume, the benefits and burdens of such Permits
and shall continue to reasonably cooperate with Purchaser and the Transferred
Group to obtain such consents after the Closing.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section 5.4_ shall
prohibit or otherwise restrict in any way the operation of the business of
Sellers and their Affiliates except solely with respect to the conduct of the
Business.

5.5 _Consents_. From the date of this Agreement until the Closing Date (or the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms), Sellers shall,
and shall cause the Transferred Group to, reasonably cooperate with Purchaser
to obtain any consents required from third parties in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_
that Sellers shall not be responsible for payment of any consent fee (or
other payment to a counterparty) in connection with seeking such consents. For
the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Sellers have any Liability for the
failure to obtain any consent or to assign, convey or transfer any
Permit, agreement, Intellectual Property or other asset (including the
Permits, agreements, Intellectual Property and assets listed on _Sections
5.4(c)_ and _5.4(d)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule), nor shall such
failure be deemed to be a default or breach of any covenant, representation
or warranty of Sellers (it being understood that any action or omission by
Sellers other than any such failure shall not be prevented by this sentence
from being deemed a breach of _Sections 3.4_ , _3.13_ , _3.16_ , or _5.4_ ,
this _Section 5.5_ and _Section 5.15_) or failure to satisfy any condition
to any of Purchasers obligations hereunder.

 



-40-  5.6 _Public Announcements_. Prior to the Closing, no Party or any Affiliate
or representative of any Party shall issue or cause the publication of the
initial press release or public announcement in respect of this Agreement or
make any other public communication (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall
not include any communication to limited partners or other investors in any
investment fund directly or indirectly invested in the Transferred Group)
regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior
written consent of the other Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as may be required by applicable Law
or stock exchange rules, in which case the Party required to publish such
press release or public announcement or make such other communication shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the other Party a reasonable
opportunity to comment on such press release or public announcement in advance
of such publication or such other communication in advance of the time it is
made.

5.7 _Guarantees; Commitments_. (a) From and after the Closing, Purchaser and
the Transferred Group, jointly and severally, shall indemnify and hold
harmless each Seller and each of their respective Affiliates, directors,
officers, employees, representatives, attorneys, accountants, advisors, agents
and equity holders against any post-Closing Losses that Sellers and their
respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, representatives,
attorneys, accountants, advisors, agents and equity holders suffer, incur or
are liable for by reason of or arising out of or in consequence of: (i) any
of Sellers and their respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees,
representatives, attorneys, accountants, advisors, agents and equity holders
issuing, making payment under, being required to pay or reimburse the issuer
of, or being party to, any guarantee, indemnity, surety bond, letter of
credit, bank guarantee, keepwell agreement, consumer financing arrangements,
or other similar commitment, understanding, agreement or obligation relating
to the Business listed in  _Section 5.7(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule and the Substituted Guarantees (collectively, the " _Indemnified
Guarantees_ "); (ii) any claim or demand for payment made on Sellers or any of
their respective Affiliates with respect to any of the Indemnified
Guarantees; or (iii) any Action, claim or proceeding by any Person who is or
claims to be entitled to the benefit of or claims to be entitled to payment,
reimbursement or indemnity with respect to any Indemnified Guarantees.

(b) Prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause itself to be substituted in all respects for each Seller and its
Affiliates (other than the members of the Transferred Group), and for each
Seller and its Affiliates (other than the members of the Transferred Group) to
be released, in each case effective as of the Closing or (if such
substitution and release cannot be effected as of the Closing) as soon as
possible after the Closing, in respect of all obligations of each Seller and
any of its Affiliates (other than the members of the Transferred Group) under
each of the guarantees, indemnities, surety bonds, letters of credit, bank
guarantee, keepwell agreements, consumer financing arrangements and other
similar commitments, understandings, agreements and other obligations of such
Persons related to the Business listed on _Section 5.7(b)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule (collectively, the " _Substituted Guarantees_ "). In
furtherance and not in limitation of the preceding sentence, at Sellers
request, Purchaser will, and will cause the Transferred Group to, assign or
cause to be assigned, any lease underlying a Substituted Guarantee to an
Affiliate of Purchaser meeting the applicable net worth and other requirements
in such lease to give effect to the provisions of the preceding sentence. For
any Substituted Guarantees for which Purchaser or the Transferred Group, as
applicable, is not substituted in all respects for each Seller and its
Affiliates (or for which each Seller and its Affiliates are not released)
effective as of the Closing, Purchaser shall continue to use reasonable best
efforts and shall cause the Transferred Group to use reasonable best efforts
to effect such substitution and release after the Closing. For each letter
of credit issued pursuant to the Credit Agreement for which Purchaser is not
substituted in all respects for each Seller and its Affiliates (or for which
each Seller and its Affiliates are not released) effective as of the Closing,
Purchaser shall either (x) cash collateralize such letter of credit in
accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement or (y) provide a
backstop letter of credit satisfactory to the Issuing Bank (as defined in the
Credit Agreement) of such letter of credit.

 



-41-  5.8 _Insurance_. From and after the Closing Date, the Transferred Group shall
cease to be insured under the insurance policies or self-insured programs of
the Sellers and the Seller Group, and neither Purchaser nor its Subsidiaries
shall have any access, right, title or interest to or in any such insurance
policies (including to all claims and rights to make claims and all rights to
proceeds) to cover any assets of the Transferred Group or any Liability
arising from the operation of the Business on or after the Closing; _provided_
, _however_ , that Seller shall, upon Purchasers request, make claims under
insurance policies of the Sellers with respect to claims accruing before the
Closing Date to the extent insurance coverage in respect of such claims is
available (it being understood that Sellers shall have no obligation to
continue, extend or renew any such policies or programs), and the Sellers
shall take such actions as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser in
connection with the tendering of such claims to the applicable insurers under
such policies and shall provide Purchaser with the net proceeds they realize
with respect to such claims; provided, further, that (a) Purchaser shall be
liable for all uninsured or self-insured amounts in respect of such claims
and (b) Purchaser agrees to reimburse, upon the request of Sellers, the
Sellers for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by any member of the
Seller Group associated with Purchaser-initiated claims, including costs of
filing a claim, arbitration costs, any deductibles and premium increases
under such insurance policies to the extent resulting from such claims. Each
Seller may, to be effective as of the Closing, amend any insurance policies in
the manner it deems appropriate to give effect to this _Section 5.8_. From
and after the Closing, Purchaser shall be responsible for securing all
insurance it considers appropriate for its operation of the Transferred Group
and the Business. Purchaser further covenants and agrees not to seek to
assert or to exercise any rights or claims of any member of the Transferred
Group or the Business under or in respect of any past or current insurance
policy under which any member of the Transferred Group or Affiliate
thereof or the Business is an additional insured except in accordance with
this _Section 5.8_.

5.9 _Litigation Support_. After the Closing, in the event and for so long as
any Seller or its Affiliates is actively prosecuting, contesting or defending
any Action by a third party (other than Purchaser, any member of the
Transferred Group or any of their respective Affiliates) in connection with
(a) any transactions contemplated under this Agreement, or (b) any fact,
situation, circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice, plan,
occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to act, or transaction relating
to, in connection with or arising from the Business or the ownership of the
Transferred Group prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall cause the members of
the Transferred Group to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide (i)
(at the cost and expense of the such Seller or Affiliate) reasonable
cooperation to such Seller or Affiliate and its counsel in such prosecution,
contest or defenses, including making available its personnel, and (ii)
provide such testimony and access to its books and records as shall be
reasonably necessary in connection with such prosecution, contest or defense;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Agreement shall require
Purchaser to cause any member of the Transferred Group to provide any
assistance, support, access or testimony to or for the benefit of any Seller
or any of its Affiliates where, upon the advice of counsel, such assistance or
support would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of such Persons or
contravene any applicable Law.

 



-42-  5.10 _Directors and Officers_. (a) If the Closing occurs, until no earlier
than the sixth anniversary of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall and shall
cause the Transferred Group to take any necessary actions to provide that all
rights to indemnification and all limitations on liability existing in favor
of any current or former officers, directors, partners, members, managers or
employees of the Transferred Group (or their respective predecessors)
(collectively, the " _Seller Indemnitees_ "), as provided in (i) the
organizational documents of the Transferred Group in effect on the date of
this Agreement or (ii) any agreement providing for indemnification by the
Transferred Group of any of the Seller Indemnitees in effect on the date of
this Agreement and set forth in  _Section 5.10_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule are not amended or modified in a manner adverse to the Seller
Indemnitees with retroactive effect with respect to periods prior to the
Closing Date.

 

(b) In the event that the Transferred Group, Purchaser or any of their
respective successors or assigns (A) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (B) transfers or conveys all or a
majority of their respective properties and assets to any Person, then, and
in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Transferred Group or Purchaser, as the case may be, shall
succeed to the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.10_.

 

(c) The obligations of Purchaser under this _Section 5.10_ shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee
to whom this _Section 5.10_ applies without the express written consent of
such affected indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the indemnitees to
whom this _Section 5.10_ applies shall be third-party beneficiaries of this
_Section 5.10_).

(d) From the date of this Agreement until the Closing Date (or
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms), Sellers
shall reasonably cooperate with Purchaser in its efforts to obtain, from each
officer and director of each of the Transferred Companies, a notice of
resignation from their respective positions as officers or directors, as
applicable.

5.11 _Real Estate Matters_ . From the date of this Agreement until the
Closing Date (or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms), Sellers shall reasonably cooperate with Purchasers efforts to obtain,
at Purchasers sole cost and expense, (a) current title commitments from a
nationally recognized title insurance company to issue one or more owners
title policies with respect to the Owned Real Property and Leased Real
Property, so long as neither Sellers nor representatives thereof shall
be required to provide any indemnities, or any owners affidavits or other
documents which (i) expand or increase any of the covenants, representations
or warranties of Seller herein, (ii) are given by an individual in an
individual capacity, or (iii) are given other than to the best of Sellers
knowledge; (b) updates to surveys of the Owned Real Property and Leased Real
Property to the extent necessary to permit issuance of the relevant title
policy, and (c) landlord estoppel letters in customary form, reasonably
approved in advance by Sellers, with respect to the Leased Real Property (
_provided_ that Purchaser shall not contact any landlord with respect to the
Leased Real Property without the consent of Sellers), in each case, as
Purchaser may reasonably request. For the avoidance of doubt, the failure to
obtain any of the materials referred to in the preceding sentence shall in no
event be a condition to the Closing.

 



-43-  5.12 _Post-Closing Restrictions on Sellers_. (a) Each Seller agrees, severally
and not jointly with any other Seller, that it will not and will cause its
Affiliates (for all purposes under this _Section 5.12_, including investment
funds that are Affiliates of such Seller and controlled Affiliates of such
funds, but excluding any Entities that are portfolio companies of such
investment funds as of the date hereof) not to, during the period beginning on
the date hereof and ending on the second anniversary of the Closing Date,
directly or indirectly, for any reason, without the prior written consent of
Purchaser:

(i) hire any person who is at or prior to Closing employed by any member of
the Transferred Group, including any of the Business Employees, or call on or
otherwise solicit any such person with the purpose or intent of attracting
that person from such employment; provided that each Seller and
its Affiliates may make general solicitations not specifically targeted at
persons employed by Purchaser or its Subsidiaries, or hire any person
responding to such solicitation;

 

(ii) engage in the business of solid and non-injectable liquid waste disposal
of exempt and non-exempt oilfield wastes derived from the exploration and
production of hydrocarbons, as conducted by the Transferred Group, viewed as a
single enterprise, as of the Closing Date, in the United States; _provided_
that this _Section 5.12(a)(ii)_ will not prohibit (A) the acquisition or
ownership of any securities constituting less than 10% of the equity of any
Entity or (B) the acquisition and resulting ownership of any Entity for which
the revenues derived from such business constitute less than 10% of the
consolidated revenues of such Entity and its Subsidiaries; or

(iii) call on or otherwise solicit any Business Acquisition Candidate or any
owner of any Business Acquisition Candidate, for the purpose of acquiring such
Business Acquisition Candidate or arranging the acquisition of such Business
Acquisition Candidate by any Person other than Purchaser or one of its
Subsidiaries.

(b) The Parties each acknowledge and agree that: (i) the provisions of this 
_Section 5.12_ impose reasonable restraints on Sellers in light of the
activities and business of the members of the Transferred Group on the date
hereof and the current business plans of Purchaser; (ii) the covenants in
this  _Section 5.12_ are intended by each Party to, and will, be construed
as an agreement independent of any other provision in this Agreement and will
not be affected by any breach of any other provision hereof by any Party, and
the existence of any claim or cause of action of any Seller against
Purchaser, whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, will not
constitute a defense to the enforcement by Purchaser of any of the covenants
in this _Section 5.12_; (iii) this _Section 5.12_ is a material and
substantial part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (iv)
the provisions of _Section 10.12_ shall be applicable to the enforcement of
Purchasers rights under this _Section 5.12_.

 



-44-  (c) It is the intention of each of the Parties that if any of the restrictions
or covenants contained in _Section 5.12(a)(ii)_ is held by a court of
competent jurisdiction to cover a geographic area or to be for a length of
time that is not permitted by Law, or is in any way construed by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be too broad or to any extent invalid, such
provision shall not be construed to be null, void and of no effect, but to the
extent such provision would be valid or enforceable under Law, a court of
competent jurisdiction shall construe and interpret or reform such _Section
5.12(a)(ii)_ to provide for a covenant having the maximum enforceable
geographic area, time period and other provisions (not greater than those
contained in _Section 5.12(a)(ii)_) as shall be valid and enforceable under
such Law. Each Seller acknowledges that any breach of the terms, conditions or
covenants set forth in _Section 5.12(a)(ii)_ shall be competitively unfair
and may cause irreparable damage to Purchaser and the Transferred Group.

5.13 _Cease of Use of R360 Name_. Within twenty Business Days following the
Closing (during which period the Sellers shall not sell (or otherwise
provide) goods or services using the terms described below), R360 Operating
Partners, L.P. and any other Seller that has the term "R360" or any similar
term in its name shall change its name to delete any reference to "R360" or
any similar term and shall take such actions as are necessary to consummate
such name change, including the making of any filings with any appropriate
Governmental Entity as shall be necessary to amend its Charter Documents or
amend any of its qualifications in all applicable jurisdictions to reflect its
change of name.

5.14  _Release of Claims_. Except for claims or payments arising under this
Agreement, as of the Closing, each of the Sellers hereby agrees to forever
waive, release and discharge any and all rights such Seller may have, whether
known or unknown, to make a claim against or otherwise demand or receive
payment from (a) the current and former officers, directors, employees and
agents of any of the members of the Transferred Group, to the extent relating
to or arising out of any act or omission of any such Person prior to the
Closing in such Persons role as an officer, director, employee or agent of
any member of the Transferred Group, and (b) any member of the Transferred
Group, to the extent relating to or arising out of any dealings,
relationships or transactions prior to the Closing by and between such Seller
and any member of the Transferred Group other than this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

5.15 _Further Assurances_. At any time and from time to time after the
Closing, each of the Sellers shall, at the request of Purchaser and without
further consideration and to the extent permitted by applicable Law, execute

-45-  ARTICLE VI

EMPLOYEE MATTERS

6.1 _Treatment of Business Employees_. (a) At or prior to the Closing,
Sellers shall (or shall cause their applicable Affiliates to) use their
reasonable best efforts to transfer the employment of each Business Employee
who is not employed by a member of the Transferred Group to a member of
the Transferred Group (it being understood that any resignation, death or
disability of a Business Employee shall not be deemed to be a breach of this
sentence). For a period of one year following the Closing, Purchaser shall
provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each Business Employee who remains
employed in the Business (i) base compensation and target bonus opportunities
that, in each case, are no less favorable than were provided to the Business
Employee immediately before Closing and (ii) all other benefits that are no
less favorable in the aggregate than were provided to the Business Employee
immediately before the Closing. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary: (i) Purchaser shall or shall cause the Transferred
Group to provide to each Business Employee whose employment terminates during
the one-year period following the Closing severance benefits at least equal to
the severance benefits for which other similarly situated employees of
Purchaser are eligible from time to time, and (ii) during such one-year period
following the Closing, severance benefits offered to each Business Employee
shall be determined without taking into account any reduction after
the Closing in compensation paid to such Business Employee.

(b) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility
to participate and level of benefits) under the employee benefit plans of
Purchaser and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Business Employees
after the Closing (the " _New Plans_ "), each Business Employee shall be
credited with his or her years of service with Sellers and their Subsidiaries
and their respective predecessors before the Closing, to the same extent as
such Business Employee was entitled, before the Closing, to credit for such
service under any similar Benefit Plan in which such Business Employee
participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Closing
(except that no such credit shall be provided for benefit accrual purposes
under any defined benefit plan); _provided_ that the foregoing shall not
apply to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of
benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
(i) each Business Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent
coverage under such New Plan is comparable to a Benefit Plan in which such
Business Employee participated immediately before the Closing (such plans,
collectively, the " _Old Plans_ ") and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any
Business Employee, Purchaser shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions
and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such
employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not
have been waived under the comparable plans of Sellers or their Subsidiaries
in which such employee participated immediately prior to the Closing, and
Purchaser shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his
or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plans
ending on the date such employees participation in the corresponding New
Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the
applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such
New Plan.

 



-46-  6.2 _Transfer of Benefit Plans_. On and after the Closing, Purchaser shall
cause one or more member(s) of the Transferred Group to assume and be
responsible for all Liabilities under the Benefit Plans described in _Section
6.2_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (the " _Transferred Benefit Plans_ ")
and Sellers shall have no further Liability with respect to such Transferred
Benefit Plans. At or prior to the Closing, Sellers shall (or shall cause their
applicable Affiliates to) use their reasonable best efforts to assign,
transfer and convey each Transferred Benefit Plan (together with the
corresponding Liabilities under the Transferred Benefit Plans), which is not
sponsored or maintained by a Transferred Company as of the date of this
Agreement, to one or more members(s) of the Transferred Group, and such
member(s) of the Transferred Group shall assume such Liabilities. For the
avoidance of doubt, no member of the Transferred Group shall have any
Liability with respect to the Incentive Units (any such Liability shall be
fully performed or discharged by Sellers).

6.3 _Unused Vacation, Sick Leave and Personal Time_. Purchaser shall cause
the members of the Transferred Group to honor all unused vacation, sick leave
and other personal time off of each Business Employee during the calendar year
in which the Closing occurs. Thereafter, the Business Employees shall be
subject to, and commence to accrue benefits under, the vacation, sick leave
and other personal time off policies of Purchaser applicable to the respective
Business Employee, consistent with _Section 6.1_ of this Agreement.

 

6.4 _WARN and Corresponding State Laws_. Purchaser shall cause the applicable
members of the Transferred Group to be responsible for any post-Closing
Liability relating to Business Employees and Former Business Employees under
WARN that may otherwise be imposed on Sellers.

6.5 _Workers  Compensation_. Purchaser shall cause the applicable members of
the Transferred Group to be responsible for any workers compensation claims
as of the Closing Date or arising thereafter relating to their respective
Business Employees and Former Business Employees that may otherwise be imposed
on Sellers.

6.6 _COBRA_. Purchaser shall cause the applicable members of the Transferred
Group to be responsible for all Liabilities as of the Closing Date or arising
thereafter with respect to Business Employees and Former Business Employees
and their respective eligible dependents in respect of health insurance
coverage under the Consolidated Budget Reconciliation Action of 1985, as
amended.

 

6.7 _2012 Annual Bonuses_. No later than February 15, 2013, Purchaser shall
pay, or shall cause to be paid, to each Business Employee who is employed by
a Transferred Company immediately prior to the Closing Date and who
participates in an annual bonus or incentive plan of the Business in respect
of calendar year 2012, such Business Employees annual bonus in respect of
calendar year 2012, with such bonus determined in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice and in good faith consultation with Mr.
Troy Thacker (other than with respect to Mr. Thackers bonus); _provided_ , 
_however_ , that, with respect to any Business Employee whose employment with
Purchaser and its Subsidiaries (including the Transferred Companies)
terminates prior to December 31, 2012, such 2012 annual bonus may be reduced
on a pro-rata basis to reflect the portion of calendar year 2012 following
such termination of employment.

6.8 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is solely for the benefit
of the Parties and is not intended to confer upon any other Persons any rights
or remedies hereunder. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, nothing
in this Agreement shall preclude Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, at any
time after the Closing, from amending, merging, modifying, terminating,
eliminating, reducing or otherwise altering in any respect any Benefit Plan,
any benefit under any Benefit Plan or any trust, insurance policy or funding
vehicle related to any Benefit Plan. No provision of this Agreement is or is
intended to be an amendment to or establishment of any employee benefit plan,
program, practice or procedure.

days after the receipt of a reasonable request from Sellers, Purchaser shall,

Sellers to enable Sellers to prepare and file all Tax Returns required to be
prepared and filed by Sellers with respect to the Transferred Group. Purchaser
shall prepare such package completely and accurately, in good faith and in
a manner consistent with Sellers past practice.

(b) Each Party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, provide to the other
Party to this Agreement such cooperation, documentation and information as
either of them reasonably may request in (i) filing any Tax Return, amended
Tax Return or claim for refund related to the Transferred Group, (ii)
determining a Liability for Taxes or an indemnity obligation under this
_Article VII_ or a right to refund of Taxes, or (iii) conducting any Tax
Proceeding. Such cooperation and information shall include providing necessary
powers of attorney, copies of all relevant portions of relevant Tax Returns,
together with all relevant portions of relevant accompanying schedules and
relevant work papers, relevant documents relating to rulings or other
determinations by taxing authorities and relevant records concerning the
ownership and Tax basis of property and other information, which any such
Party may possess. Each Party shall make its employees reasonably available on
a mutually convenient basis at its cost to provide an explanation of
any documents or information so provided.

(c) Each Party shall retain all Tax Returns, schedules and work papers, and
all material records and other documents relating to Tax matters, of the
Transferred Group for their respective Tax periods ending on or prior to the
Closing Date until the later of (i) the expiration of the statute of
limitations for the Tax periods to which the Tax Returns and other documents
relate or (ii) eight (8) years following the due date (without extension) for
such Tax Returns. Thereafter, the Party holding such Tax Returns or other
documents may dispose of them after offering the other Party reasonable
notice and opportunity to take possession of such Tax Returns and other
documents at such other Partys own expense.

7.2 _Tax Sharing Agreements_. To the extent relating to the Transferred Group,
Sellers shall terminate or cause to be terminated, on or before the Closing
Date, all Tax sharing, Tax allocation, Tax indemnification or similar
agreements or arrangements, if any, to which any member of the Transferred
Group, on the one hand, and any member of the Seller Group, on the other hand,
are parties, and neither Sellers nor any of their respective Affiliates nor
any member of the Transferred Group shall have any rights or obligations
thereunder after the Closing.

 



-48-  7.3 _Certain Tax Elections_. Except as provided in this _Section
7.3_, Purchaser shall not make, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the
Transferred Group) not to make, any Tax election with respect to the
Transferred Group (including any election pursuant to Treasury Regulation
Section 301.7701-3), which election would be effective on or prior to the
Closing Date. Purchaser shall cause NewCo to make a timely election under
Section 754 of the Code for the year that ends on the Closing Date.

 

7.4 _Transfer Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, Purchaser shall pay, when due, and be responsible for, any sales,
use, transfer, documentary, stamp, value added or similar Taxes and related
fees imposed on or payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (" _Transfer Taxes_ "). The Party responsible under applicable
Law for filing the Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer Taxes shall
prepare and timely file such Tax Returns and promptly provide a copy of such
Tax Return to the other Party. Sellers and Purchaser shall, and shall cause

for exemption or exclusion from the application or imposition of any Transfer
Taxes.

10.9 _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the Parties to this Agreement and their respective
successors and assigns; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Party to this
Agreement may directly or indirectly assign any or all of its rights or
delegate any or all of its obligations under this Agreement without the
express prior written consent of each other Party to this Agreement, except
that either Party may assign its rights and benefits under this Agreement to
any Affiliate of such Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such assignment
shall release, limit or otherwise affect such assigning Partys obligations
hereunder. Any attempted assignment in violation of this _Section 10.9_ shall
be void.

 

10.10 _Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement may not be modified or amended
except by an instrument or instruments in writing signed by all of the
Parties hereto. Either Party to this Agreement may, only by an instrument in
writing, waive compliance by the other Party to this Agreement with any term
or provision of this Agreement on the part of such other Party to
this Agreement to be performed or complied with. The waiver by any Party to
this Agreement of a breach of any term or provision of this Agreement shall
not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach. At any time prior to
the Closing, either Sellers or Purchaser may (a) extend the time for
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Party, (b)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c)
waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained in this
Agreement. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed by the Party granting such extension or waiver.

 



-56-  10.11 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this
Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to
be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions,
covenants and restrictions of this Agreement (or portions thereof) shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
Party hereto. If any provision of this Agreement (or any portion thereof)
shall be held to be so broad as to be unenforceable, such provision shall be
interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable. Upon a determination that
any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is
invalid, void or unenforceable, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to
the fullest extent possible.

10.12 _Specific Performance_. The Parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage, for which monetary damages (even if available) would not be an
adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the Parties hereto do not
perform any provision of this Agreement in accordance with its specified terms
or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the Parties acknowledge and
agree that, to prevent breaches or threatened breaches by the Parties of any
of their respective covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, the
Parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled in law or in equity. Each of the Parties agrees
that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance
and other equitable relief on the basis that any other Party has an adequate
remedy at law or that any award of specific performance is not an appropriate
remedy for any reason at law or in equity. Any Party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide
any bond or other security in connection with such order or injunction (and
the other Parties hereby waive any such requirement). The foregoing is in
addition to any other remedy to which any party is entitled at law, in equity
or otherwise. The Parties further agree that nothing set forth in this
_Section 10.12_ shall require any party hereto to institute any Action for
(or limit any partys right to institute any Action for) specific performance
under this _Section 10.12_ prior or as a condition to exercising any
termination right under _Article IX_ (and pursuing damages after such
termination). If any party brings any action to enforce specifically the
performance of the terms and provisions hereof by any other party, the Outside
Date shall automatically be extended by (x) the amount of time during which
such action is pending, plus 20 Business Days or (y) such other time period
established by the court presiding over such action. The Parties hereto agree
that, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Sellers shall be
entitled to specific performance (or any other equitable relief) to cause
Purchaser to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance
with the terms hereof. In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction
fails to grant specific performance or other injunctive relief to Sellers as
a remedy for any failure to perform or breach hereunder, or in any
circumstance in which damages are recoverable by Sellers hereunder, the
Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that Sellers shall be entitled to receive
benefit of the bargain and lost profits damages as redress for such failure
to perform or breach. In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction
fails to grant specific performance or other injunctive relief to Purchaser as
a remedy for any failure to perform or breach hereunder, or in any
circumstance in which damages are recoverable by Purchaser hereunder, the
Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that Purchaser shall be entitled to
receive benefit of the bargain and lost profits damages as redress for such
failure to perform or breach.

 



-57-  10.13 _No Admission_. Nothing herein shall be deemed an admission by Sellers
or any of its respective Affiliates, in any Action or proceeding involving a
third party, that such third party is or is not in breach or violation of, or
in default in, the performance or observance of any term or provision of any
contract.

 

10.14 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, and by either of the Parties in separate counterparts, each of
which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile shall be as
effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement. If
this Agreement is translated into another language, the English language text
shall in any event prevail.

 

10.15 _Relationship Among Sellers_. (a) Each Seller hereby irrevocably
appoints R360 Environmental Solutions, Inc. (the " _Sellers 
Representative_") as the sole representative of Sellers to act as the agent
and on behalf of such Sellers regarding any matter relating to or under this
Agreement, including for the purposes of (i) making decisions with respect to
the determination of the Purchase Price (and the components thereof) and any
other amounts due under _Article II_ ; (ii) determining whether the conditions
to closing in _Article VIII_ have been satisfied and supervising the Closing,
including waiving any condition, as determined by the Sellers Representative,
in its sole discretion; (iii) paying or accepting any funds due to or from
Sellers; (iv) taking any action that may be necessary or desirable, as
determined by the Sellers Representative, in its sole discretion, in
connection with the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article
IX_ ; (v) taking any and all actions that may be necessary or desirable, as
determined by the Sellers Representative, in its sole discretion, in
connection with the amendment of this Agreement in accordance with _Section
10.10_; (vi) accepting notices on behalf of Sellers in accordance with
_Section 10.8_; (vii) delivering or causing to be delivered to Purchaser at
the Closing certificates representing the Securities to be sold by Sellers
hereunder or instructions as to the payment and allocation of the
Purchase Price therefor; (viii) executing and delivering, on behalf of
Sellers, any and all notices, documents or certificates to be executed by
Sellers, in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby and (ix) granting any consent or approval on behalf of Sellers under
this Agreement. As the representative of Sellers under this Agreement, the
Sellers Representative shall act as the agent for Sellers, shall have
authority to bind Sellers in accordance with this Agreement, and Purchaser
may rely on such appointment and authority until the receipt of notice of the
appointment of a successor upon two Business Days prior written notice to
Purchaser. Purchaser may conclusively rely upon, without independent
verification or investigation, all decisions made by the Sellers
Representative in connection with this Agreement in writing and signed by an
officer of the general partner of the Sellers Representative.

 



-58-  (b) Each Seller hereby appoints the Sellers Representative as such Sellers
true and lawful attorney-in-fact and agent, with full powers of substitution
and resubstitution, in such Sellers name, place and stead, in any and all
capacities, in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, granting unto said attorney-in-fact and agent, full power and
authority to do and perform each and every act and thing requisite and
necessary to be done in connection with the sale of such Sellers Securities
as fully to all intents and purposes as such Seller might or could do in
person.

(c) The Sellers Representative, in its capacity as such, shall have no
liability to Purchaser for any default under this Agreement by any other
Seller. Except for fraud or willful misconduct on its part, the Sellers
Representative shall have no liability to any Seller under this Agreement for
any action or omission by the Sellers Representative on behalf of Sellers.

(d) All of the immunities and powers granted to the Sellers Representative
under this Agreement shall survive the Closing Date and/or any termination of
this Agreement. The grant of authority provided for herein (i) is coupled with
an interest and shall be irrevocable and survive the bankruptcy, dissolution,
winding up or liquidation of any of Sellers and (ii) shall survive the
Closing.

This ASSIGNMENT AND ASSUMPTION AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is entered
into as of [], [] by and among WCI Holdings Co., Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" _Purchaser_ ") and the Sellers named on Schedule I hereto ("
_Sellers_ ").

Agreement to effectuate and evidence (i) the sale, transfer and assignment by
Sellers to Purchaser of the Securities and other assets set forth on Schedule
II hereto and (ii) the assumption by Purchaser of the Assumed Liabilities.

NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration paid or payable to Sellers
