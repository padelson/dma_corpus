and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party hereto. If any provision of this Agreement (or

otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the Parties acknowledge and agree that, to prevent breaches or threatened breaches by the Parties of any of their respective covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions
hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled in law or in equity. Each of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that any other
Party has an adequate remedy at law or that any award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity. Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with such order or injunction (and the other Parties hereby waive any such requirement). The foregoing is in addition
to any other remedy to which any party is entitled at law, in equity or otherwise. The Parties further agree that nothing set forth in this <U>Section&nbsp;10.12</U> shall require any party hereto to institute any Action for (or limit any
party&#146;s right to institute any Action for) specific performance under this <U>Section&nbsp;10.12</U> prior or as a condition to exercising any termination right under <U>Article IX</U> (and pursuing damages after such termination). If any party
brings any action to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof by any other party, the Outside Date shall automatically be extended by (x)&nbsp;the amount of time during which such action is pending, plus
20&nbsp;Business Days or (y)&nbsp;such other time period established by the court presiding over such action. The Parties hereto agree that, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Sellers shall be entitled to specific performance (or any
other equitable relief) to cause Purchaser to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms hereof. In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction fails to grant specific performance or other injunctive relief to
Sellers as a remedy for any failure to perform or breach hereunder, or in any circumstance in which damages are recoverable by Sellers hereunder, the Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that Sellers shall be entitled to receive benefit of the
bargain and lost profits damages as redress for such failure to perform or breach. In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction fails to grant specific performance or other injunctive relief to Purchaser as a remedy for any failure to perform
or breach hereunder, or in any circumstance in which damages are recoverable by Purchaser hereunder, the Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that Purchaser shall be entitled to receive benefit of the bargain and lost profits damages as redress for
