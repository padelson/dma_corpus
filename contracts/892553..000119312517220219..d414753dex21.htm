become the right to receive the applicable portion of the Merger
Consideration, as determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.1(e_). All such
Preferred Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each certificate previously

the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration. 

(b) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further

applicable portion thereof) is an In the Money Option, canceled and converted
into and become the right to receive the applicable portion of the Merger
Consideration, as determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.1(e_), and (II) if
such Option (or the applicable portion thereof) is not an In the Money Option,

on the part of Buyer or Merger Sub, each share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Merger Sub shall be converted into one share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(d) Subject to the adjustments set forth in _Section 3.4_, the "
_Merger Consideration_ " shall consist of $410,000,000 in cash, plus (i) the
Estimated Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount, _less_ (ii) the Estimated
Closing Date Funded Debt, _plus_ (iii) the Estimated Closing Date Cash, 
_less_ (iv) the Estimated Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses, _plus_ (v) the
Transaction Tax Benefit Amount _less_ (vi) the amount of Holder Representative
Expenses.

 

(e) The Merger Consideration shall be allocated among the Pre-Closing
Holders as set forth below in this _Section_ __ _ 3.1(_ _e_ ), and payable in
accordance with this Agreement, including _Sections 3.2_ and _3.4_.

 

(i) Each Pre-Closing Holder of Preferred Shares shall be entitled to
receive in respect of each Preferred Share held by such holder immediately
prior to the Effective Time a portion of the Merger Consideration equal to the
greater of (A) (x) the Series A Original Issue Price (as defined in
the Company Certificate of Incorporation) plus, (y) any unpaid Accruing
Dividends (as defined in the Company Certificate of Incorporation) thereon
(the sum of clauses (x) and (y), " _Series_ __ _ A Liquidation
Preference Consideration_") and (B) (x) the Cash Per Fully-Diluted Common
Share, multiplied by (y) the number of shares of Common Stock that would be
issuable upon the conversion (immediately prior to the Effective Time) of such
Preferred Shares (the " _Series_ __ _ A As-Converted Consideration_").

 

(ii) Each Pre-Closing Holder of Common Shares shall be entitled to receive
in respect of the Common Shares held by such holder immediately prior to the
Effective Time a portion of the Merger Consideration equal to (x) the Cash Per
Fully-Diluted Common Share, multiplied by (y) the number of Common Shares
held by such holder immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(iii) Each Pre-Closing Holder of In the Money Options shall be entitled to
receive in respect of the In the Money Options held by such holder immediately
prior to the Effective Time a portion of the Merger Consideration equal to
(i) the product of (x) the Cash Per Fully-Diluted Common Share, multiplied by
(y) the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise in
full of all In the Money Options held by such holder immediately prior to the
Effective Time, minus (ii) the aggregate cash exercise price payable upon
exercise of all In the Money Options held by such holder immediately prior to
the Effective Time.

 



20 (iv) For purposes of the foregoing, the " _Cash Per Fully-Diluted Common
Share_ " shall mean (i) the sum of (A) the Merger Consideration, plus (B) the
Aggregate Option Exercise Price, minus (C) in the event that the Pre-
Closing Holders of Preferred Shares receive the Series A Liquidation
Preference Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.1(e)(i_) hereof, the
aggregate of the Series A Liquidation Preference Consideration payable in
respect of all Preferred Shares, divided by (ii) the Aggregate Fully-Diluted
Common Shares.

(f) From and after the Effective Time, holders of Certificates shall cease
to have any rights as stockholders of the Company. All consideration paid
pursuant to this _Article III_ upon the surrender of Certificates in
accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Preferred Shares or Common
Shares, as applicable, subject to the continuing rights of the Pre-Closing
Holders under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. At the Effective Time,
the transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer of Preferred
Shares or Common Shares shall be made thereafter. If, between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, the shares of Preferred Stock or Common
Stock are changed into a different number or class of shares by means of any
stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock
split, consolidation of shares, reclassification or other similar
transaction, then the Cash Per Fully-Diluted Common Share shall be
appropriately adjusted; _provided_ that nothing in this _Section_ __ _
3.1(f_) will be construed to permit the Company to take any action
with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that in no event shall any such stock
split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split,
consolidation of shares, reclassification or other similar transaction in
respect of any securities of the Company or its Subsidiaries increase the
aggregate amount of the Merger Consideration payable by Buyer pursuant to this
Agreement.

 

3.2 _Payment and Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Buyer shall pay to an exchange
agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") selected by the Company and reasonably
acceptable to Buyer, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an
amount (the " _Funding Amount_ ") equal to (i) the Merger Consideration
(determined before giving effect to the adjustments provided for in _Section
3.4_), minus (ii) the product of (A) the number of Dissenting Shares (with
respect to Dissenting Preferred Shares, determined as if such Dissenting
Preferred Shares had been converted into shares of Common Stock) and (B) the
Cash Per Fully-Diluted Common Share (determined before giving effect to the
adjustments provided for in _Section 3.4_), minus (iii) the Escrow Amount;
_provided_ that Buyer will promptly thereafter pay to the Exchange Agent any
amounts by which the Funding Amount increases due to any Dissenting Shares
becoming Preferred Shares or Common Shares, as applicable, in accordance with
_Section 3.8_; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that the Funding Amount shall be
reduced by the amount to be paid by Buyer with respect to In the Money Options
which shall be paid by Buyer to the Company and the Company shall pay such
amount (reduced by the amount of any Taxes required to be withheld under
applicable Law with respect to such payments, which amounts, so withheld,
shall be disbursed by the Company to the applicable taxing authority) to the
Pre-Closing Holder thereof. The fees

 



21  and expenses of the Exchange Agent shall be paid one-half by Buyer and one-
half by the Company as a Company Transaction Expense. Upon payment by Buyer
of (w) the Funding Amount in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 3.2(a)_, (x)
the amounts required to be paid pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.2(b)_, (y) the
amounts required to be paid to the parties to Long-Term Incentive Agreements
pursuant to the Closing Distribution Schedule and (z) any amounts that may be
provided for in _Section_ __ _ 3.4_ and _Section_ __ _ 3.5_, the Merger
Consideration shall be deemed to have been paid in full by Buyer in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement.

 

(b) After the Effective Time, (x) each Pre-Closing Holder of an
outstanding certificate or certificates for Preferred Shares or Common Shares
(collectively, the " _Certificates_ "), upon surrender of such Certificates
and a completed and duly executed letter of transmittal in substantially
the form attached hereto as Annex C (a " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") to the
Exchange Agent, and (y) each Pre-Closing Holder of In the Money Options shall
be entitled to receive from the Exchange Agent, subject to the provisions of
_Section 3.4_, such portion of the Merger Consideration into which such
holders Preferred Shares, Common Shares and/or In the Money Options shall
have been converted as a result of the Merger;  _provided_ , _however_ , that
any payment with respect to In the Money Options shall be paid to the Company
and the Company shall pay such amount (reduced by the amount of any Taxes
required to be withheld under applicable Law with respect to such payments,
which amounts, so withheld, shall be disbursed by the Company to the
applicable taxing authority) to the Pre-Closing Holder thereof; and _provided_
, _further_ , that a portion of the Merger Consideration otherwise payable to
each Pre-Closing Holder equal to the product of the Escrow Amount multiplied
by such holders Escrow Percentage shall be held in escrow in accordance
with  _Section_ __ _ 3.4(d_), and the terms and conditions of the Escrow
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any Pre-Closing
Holder delivers the Certificate(s) representing such Preferred Shares or
Common Shares, as applicable, to Buyer at least three (3) Business Days prior
to the Closing, Buyer shall pay the amount which such holder is entitled in
consideration therefor directly to such holder at the Closing by wire
transfer of immediately available funds and the Funding Amount payable to the
Exchange Agent shall be reduced by such amounts (subject to withholding for
Taxes, which amounts shall be paid to the Company for disbursement to the
applicable taxing authority). Pending such surrender and exchange of a Pre-
Closing Holders Certificate(s), a holders Certificate(s) shall be deemed, at
and after the Effective Time, for all purposes to evidence such holders
right to receive the portion of the Merger Consideration, without interest,
into which such Preferred Shares or Common Shares, as applicable, shall have
been converted by the Merger.

 

(c) At the Closing, (i) Buyer shall pay a portion of the Merger
Consideration equal to the Escrow Amount to Wilmington Trust, N.A., as escrow
agent of the parties hereto (the " _Escrow Agent_ "), to be held in escrow;
_provided_ that Buyer will promptly thereafter pay to the Escrow Agent any
amounts by which the Escrow Amount increases due to any Dissenting Shares
becoming Preferred Shares or Common Shares in accordance with _Section 3.8_,
(ii) Buyer shall, or shall cause Merger Sub to, pay to the intended
beneficiaries thereof (as identified in writing by the Company to Buyer prior
to the Closing) the Funded Debt of the Company as set forth in the Debt-Payoff
Letters and (iii) Buyer shall pay the intended beneficiaries thereof (as
identified in writing by the Company to Buyer prior to the Closing) the
Estimated Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses, _provided_ that any such
Company Transaction Expenses that are due to an employee of the Company or any
Subsidiary shall be paid to the Company and the 

 



22  Company shall pay such amounts (reduced by the amount of any Taxes required
to be withheld under applicable Law with respect to such payments, which
amounts, so withheld, shall be disbursed by the Company to the applicable
taxing authority) to the intended beneficiary thereof within five (5) Business
Days after the Closing.

 

3.3 _Estimated Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount; Estimated Closing
Date Funded Debt; Estimated Closing Date Cash_ _; Estimated Unpaid Company
Transaction Expenses_. Not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date and in no event more than ten (10) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Buyer a written statement setting
forth (a) its good faith estimate of (i) Closing Date Net Working Capital ("
_Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital_ "), (ii) Closing Date Funded Debt
(" _Estimated Closing Date Funded Debt_ "), (iii) Closing Date Cash ("
_Estimated Closing Date Cash_ ") and (iv) Closing Date Unpaid Company
Transaction Expenses (" _Estimated Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses_ "),
and (b) the Companys calculation of the Estimated Net Working Capital
Adjustment Amount. The Company shall also deliver to Buyer, together with such
statement, a schedule (the " _Closing Distribution Schedule_ "), prepared on
the basis of the Merger Consideration and consistent with the terms of this
Agreement, that accurately and completely sets forth a list of the Pre-Closing
Holders and the manner in which the Merger Consideration is to be allocated
among and paid to each Pre-Closing Holder (along with the amount of
withholding in respect of each holder of Options) and any parties to the Long-
Term Incentive Agreements and, to the extent applicable, copies of invoices
or other documentation that evidences the amount of the Estimated Unpaid
Company Transaction Expenses. Buyer shall be entitled to rely on the Closing
Distribution Schedule. The Company shall provide Buyer with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such statement (including the components
thereof) described in this _Section_ __ _ 3.3_ and the Closing Distribution
Schedule, as applicable, and shall consider in good faith any revisions
proposed by Buyer; _provided_ that no such comment (or failure to consent)
shall prevent or delay the Closing or prejudice or limit Buyers rights
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.4_.

 

3.4 _Adjustment Amount_.

 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, and in
any event within sixty (60) days thereof, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to
the Holder Representative (i) an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ "), (ii) a
calculation of Net Working Capital (" _Closing Date Net Working Capital_ "),
(iii) a calculation of the aggregate amount of all Funded Debt of the Company
(" _Closing Date Funded Debt_ "), (iv) a calculation of Cash of the Company
and its Subsidiaries (" _Closing Date Cash_ ") and (v) a calculation of
Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses (" _Closing Date Unpaid Company
Transaction Expenses_ "), in each case, (except as set forth in the
proviso below) (x) calculated as of 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on the Closing
Date in accordance with the Closing Balance Sheet Principles and (y) without
giving effect to the consummation of the Merger, including any payments of
cash in respect of the Merger Consideration, any repayment of Funded Debt of
the Company after the Effective Time or any financing transactions in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or, after the Effective
Time, any other action or omission by Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any
of its Subsidiaries that is not in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice; _provided_ ,

 



23   _however_ , that (I) the Closing Balance Sheet shall reflect no changes in
reserves (regardless of whether any such reserve is recorded as an offset to a
current assets carrying value or is included as an accrued liability in the
Closing Balance Sheet) from amounts contained in the Reference Balance Sheet,
other than changes therein attributable to changes in facts and circumstances
occurring after the date of the Reference Balance Sheet, (II) the Tax assets
and liabilities included in the Closing Balance Sheet and Closing Date Net
Working Capital shall give effect to and take into account the consummation of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
(III) the Closing Balance Sheet shall not reflect any expense or liability for
which Buyer is responsible under this Agreement. Following the Closing, Buyer
shall provide the Holder Representative and its representatives access to the
records, properties, personnel and (subject to the execution of customary work
paper access letters if requested) auditors of the Company and its
Subsidiaries relating to the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet and
shall cause the personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries to cooperate
with the Holder Representative in connection with its review of the Closing
Balance Sheet.

 

(b) If the Holder Representative shall disagree with the calculation of
Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing Date Funded Debt, Closing Date Cash
and/or Closing Date Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses, it shall notify Buyer
of such disagreement in writing, setting forth in reasonable detail the
particulars of such disagreement, within forty-five (45) days after its
receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet. In the event that the Holder
Representative does not provide such a notice of disagreement within such
forty-five (45)-day period, the Holder Representative shall be deemed to have
agreed to the Closing Balance Sheet and the calculation of Closing Date Net
Working Capital, Closing Date Funded Debt, Closing Date Cash, and Closing Date
Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses delivered by Buyer, which shall be final,
binding and conclusive for all purposes hereunder. In the event any such
notice of disagreement is timely provided, Buyer and the Holder Representative
shall use reasonable best efforts for a period of twenty (20) days (or such
longer period as they may mutually agree) to resolve any disagreements with
respect to the calculations of Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing Date
Funded Debt, Closing Date Cash and/or the Closing Date Unpaid
Company Transaction Expenses. If, at the end of such period, they are unable
to resolve such disagreements, then any such remaining disagreements shall be
resolved by KPMG US LLP (or such independent accounting or financial
consulting firm of recognized national standing as may be mutually selected
by Buyer and the Holder Representative) (such firm the " _Auditor_ "). Each of
Buyer and the Holder Representative shall promptly provide their assertions
regarding the Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing Date Funded Debt,
Closing Date Cash and/or Closing Date Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses and,
to the extent relevant thereto, the Closing Balance Sheet in writing to the
Auditor and to each other. The Auditor shall be instructed to render its
determination with respect to such disagreements as soon as reasonably
possible (which the parties hereto agree should not be later than twenty (20)
days following the day on which the disagreement is referred to the Auditor).
The Auditor shall base its determination solely on (i) the written submissions
of the parties and shall not conduct an independent investigation and (ii) the
extent (if any) to which Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing Date
Funded Debt, Closing Date Cash and/or Closing Date Unpaid Company Transaction
Expenses require adjustment (only with respect to the remaining disagreements
submitted to the Auditor) in order to be calculated in accordance with
the Closing Balance Sheet Principles (and the definitions of the defined
terms used in _Section_ __ _ 3.4(a_) and the Closing Balance Sheet
Principles). The determination of the Auditor shall be final, conclusive and
binding on the parties. The date on which Closing Date

 



24  Net Working Capital, Closing Date Funded Debt, Closing Date Cash and Closing
Date Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses are finally determined in accordance
with this  _Section_ __ _ 3.4(b_) is hereinafter referred to as the "
_Determination Date_ ". The fees and expenses of the Auditor shall be paid
one-half by Buyer and one-half by the Holder Representative as a Holder
Representative Expense.

 

(c) The " _Adjustment Amount_ ", which may be positive or negative, shall
mean (i) the Closing Date Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount (as finally
determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.4(b_)) plus (ii) Estimated Closing
Date Funded Debt, minus Closing Date Funded Debt (as finally determined
in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.4(b_)), plus (iii) Closing Date Cash (as
finally determined in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.4(b_)), minus
Estimated Closing Date Cash, plus (iv) Estimated Unpaid Company Transaction
Expenses, minus Closing Date Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses (as finally
determined in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.4(b_)). If the Adjustment
Amount is a positive number, then the Merger Consideration shall be increased
by the Adjustment Amount, and if the Adjustment Amount is a negative number,
the Merger Consideration shall be decreased by the absolute value of the
Adjustment Amount. The Adjustment Amount shall be paid in accordance with 
_Section_ __ _ 3.4(_ _d_ ) or _3.4(e_ ).

(d) If the Adjustment Amount is a positive number (such amount, the "
_Increase Amount_ "), then, promptly following the Determination Date, and in
any event within three (3) Business Days of the Determination Date, (x) Buyer
shall pay the Increase Amount to the Escrow Agent, and (y) the Escrow Agent
shall pay to each Pre-Closing Holder an amount in cash equal to (i) the Escrow
Amount plus the Increase Amount, multiplied by (ii) such holders Escrow
Percentage, less any applicable withholding; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in
the case of clause (y) of this sentence, any payment with respect to In the
Money Options shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation and the
Surviving Corporation shall pay such amount (reduced by the amount of any
Taxes required to be withheld under applicable Law with respect to such
payments, which amounts, so withheld, shall be disbursed by the Surviving
Corporation to the applicable taxing authority) to the Pre-Closing Holder
thereof.

(e) If the Adjustment Amount is a negative number (the absolute value of
such amount, the " _Deficit Amount_ "), then, promptly following the
Determination Date, and in any event within three (3) Business Days of the
Determination Date, (x) the Escrow Agent shall pay, from the Escrow Amount,
to Buyer an amount equal to the Deficit Amount, and (y) if any of the Escrow
Amount remain after such payment to Buyer, the Escrow Agent shall pay to each
Pre-Closing Holder an amount in cash equal to (i) the balance of the Escrow
Amount, multiplied by (ii) such holders Escrow Percentage, less any
applicable withholding; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that, in the case of clause
(y) of this sentence, any payment with respect to In the Money Options shall
be paid to the Company and the Company shall pay such amount (reduced by the
amount of any Taxes required to be withheld under applicable Law with respect
to such payments, which amounts, so withheld, shall be disbursed by the
Company to the applicable taxing authority) to the Pre-Closing Holder thereof.
Upon determination of the Adjustment Amount pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.4(_
_b_ ) and _Section_ __ _ 3.4(c_), each of Buyer and the Holder Representative
shall execute joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing
the Escrow Agent to disburse the Escrow Amount in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 3.4(e_). For the avoidance of doubt, any distributions to the
Pre-Closing Holders in respect of In the Money Options pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 3.4(_ _e_ ) shall be net of the amount of any Taxes required
to be withheld from such

 



25  distributions under applicable Law, and the amounts so withheld shall be
paid over to the Company for payment by the Company to the applicable
Governmental Authority as required by Law. In no event shall the Holder
Representative or any Pre-Closing Holder have any liability under this
_Section 3.4_ in excess of such holders allocable share of the Escrow
Amount. In no event shall Buyer be entitled to payment pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 3.4(e_) of any amount in excess of the Escrow Amount.

 

3.5 _Holder Representative Expenses_. On or prior to the Closing Date, the
Holder Representative may provide to Buyer a written estimate (which estimate
shall include such reserves as the Holder Representative determines in good
faith to be appropriate for any Holder Representative Expenses that are not
then known or determinable) of the aggregate amount of the fees and expenses
(including legal, accounting, financial advisory, brokers, consultants,
advisors and finders fees, costs and expenses) incurred, or that may be
incurred, by the Holder Representative on behalf of the Company and the
holders of the Preferred Stock, Common Stock and the Options (including the
Pre-Closing Holders) in connection with the preparation, negotiation and
execution of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or otherwise in its capacity as the Holder Representative
(the " _Holder_ _Representative Expenses_ "). On the Closing Date, Buyer shall
pay to the Holder Representative or to such other persons (and in such
amounts) as may be designated by the Holder Representative, by wire transfer
to an account or accounts designated by the Holder Representative in writing
at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, immediately
available funds in the amount of such Holder Representative Expenses. Whether
or not paid on or prior to the Closing Date, no amount shall be included on
the Closing Balance Sheet with respect to liabilities for the
Holder Representative Expenses.

3.6 _Exchange Agent_. Promptly following the date which is one year after
the Effective Time, Buyer shall instruct the Exchange Agent to deliver to the
Surviving Corporation all cash, Certificates and other documents in its
possession relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and the Exchange
Agents duties shall terminate. Thereafter, each Pre-Closing Holder of a
Certificate (other than Certificates representing Dissenting Shares) may
surrender such Certificate to the Surviving Corporation and (subject
to applicable abandoned property, escheat and similar Laws) receive in
consideration therefor, and the Surviving Corporation shall promptly pay, the
portion of the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof as
determined in accordance with this _Article III_ without any interest
thereon.

3.7 _Lost Certificate_. In the event any Certificate has been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange
Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof as determined in
accordance with this _Article III_ without any requirement to post any bond or
other security.

 

3.8 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
_Article III_ , the Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into a right to
receive any portion of the Merger Consideration and the holders thereof shall
be entitled to such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL. Each
holder of Dissenting Shares who becomes entitled to payment for such shares
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall receive payment therefor from the
Surviving Corporation in accordance with the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that (i) if any such holder of 

 



26  Dissenting Shares shall have failed to establish such holders entitlement
to appraisal rights as provided in Section 262 of the DGCL, or (ii) if any
such holder of Dissenting Shares shall have effectively withdrawn such
holders demand for appraisal of such shares or lost such holders right to
appraisal and payment for such holders shares under Section 262 of the DGCL,
such holder shall forfeit the right to appraisal of such shares and each such
share shall not constitute a Dissenting Share and shall be treated as if it
had been a Preferred Share or Common Share (as applicable) (and such holder
shall be treated as a Pre-Closing Holder) immediately prior to the Effective
Time and converted, as of the Effective Time, into a right to receive from the
Surviving Corporation the portion of the Merger Consideration deliverable
in respect thereof as determined in accordance with this _Article_ III,
without any interest thereon. The Company will give Buyer prompt notice of all
written notices received by the Company pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL,
and Buyer shall have the opportunity and right to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. Without the prior written consent of
Buyer (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the
Company shall not voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or
offer to settle, any such demand for payment. From and after the Effective
Time, no stockholder who has properly exercised and perfected appraisal rights
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall be entitled to vote his or her
shares of Preferred Stock or Common Stock, as applicable, for any purpose or
receive payment of dividends or other distributions with respect to his or her
shares of Preferred Stock or Common Stock (as applicable) (except dividends
and distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior
to the Effective Time).

 

3.9 _Withholding_. Buyer, the Company, the Exchange Agent and the Escrow
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise paid or deliverable in connection with the transactions contemplated
in this Agreement, to any Person such amounts that Buyer, the Company, the
Exchange Agent and the Escrow Agent are required to deduct and withhold with
respect to any such deliveries and payments under the Code or any provision of
state, local or foreign applicable Tax Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Buyer shall notify the Company in writing of any such requirement to deduct
or withhold at least ten (10) days before the payment to which such deduction
or withholding would apply, _provided_ , _further_ , that no amounts will be
withheld from any payments in respect of Preferred Shares, Common Shares or
Dissenting Shares so long as the Company complies with _Section_ __ _ 8.5(e)_
on or prior to the Closing. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, and
duly deposited with the appropriate Governmental Authority in accordance with
applicable Law, by Buyer, the Company, the Exchange Agent or the Escrow Agent,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made. Buyer, the Company, the Exchange Agent or the
Escrow Agent shall promptly deliver to such person receipts or other evidence
of the remittance of such amounts.

 

3.10 _RWI Policy_. After the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
Buyer shall take such action to bind and incept coverage under a
representations and warranty insurance policy (the " _RWI Policy_ "). Buyer
shall execute and cause to be executed and delivered all documents as may be
required by the insurer in connection with (a) binding coverage under the
terms of the RWI Policy and (b) issuing the final RWI Policy. Promptly
following the issuance of the final RWI Policy, Buyer shall deliver a copy of
such final policy to the Holder Representative. The RWI Policy shall include
a provision whereby the insurer expressly waives, and agrees not to pursue,
subrogation against the Company or its Affiliates, or any stockholder of the
Company or any of their respective Affiliates with respect to any claim made
by any insured thereunder (except for any knowing and intentional

 



27  fraud by any of the stockholders of the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates). No insured under the RWI Policy shall waive, amend, modify or
otherwise revise this subrogation provision, or allow such provision to be
waived, amended, modified, or otherwise revised.

35 (e) Neither the Company nor any member of the Controlled Group has
incurred or reasonably expects to incur any liability under Title IV of ERISA
(other than for premiums pursuant to Section 4007 of ERISA which have been
timely paid) or Section 4971 of the Code. Each Company Benefit Plan to
which Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA applies satisfies in
all material respects the requirements of Sections 412, 430 and 436 of the
Code and Sections 302 and 303 of ERISA. No Company Benefit Plan is in "at-risk
status" within the meaning of Section 430(i)(4) of the Code or Section
303(i)(4) of ERISA or, except as set forth in _Schedule 4.13(e)_ , subject to
the limitations of Section 436 of the Code. No Company Benefit Plan has or
has incurred an accumulated funding deficiency within the meaning of Section
302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, nor has any waiver of the minimum
funding standards of Section 302 of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code been
requested of or granted by the Internal Revenue Service with respect to any
Company Benefit Plan, nor has any lien in favor of any Company Benefit Plan
arisen under Section 412(n) or 430(k) of the Code or Section 302(f) or 303(k)
of ERISA. Neither the Company nor any member of the Controlled Group has been
required to provide security to any defined benefit pension plan pursuant to
Section 412(c)(4) or 436 of the Code or Section 306 or 307 of ERISA, and
there have been no "installment acceleration amounts" as that term is defined
in Section 430(c)(7)(C) of the Code. There has been no "reportable event"
within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA and the regulations and
interpretations thereunder which has not been fully and accurately reported in
all material respects as required under Section 4043 of ERISA, or which,
whether or not reported, would reasonably be expected to constitute grounds
for the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to institute termination
proceedings with respect to any Company Benefit Plan.

 

(f) Except as would not reasonably be expected to result in material
liability to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, with respect
to the Company Benefit Plans or the assets thereof, there are (i) no Actions
(other than routine claims for benefits in the ordinary course) pending or, to
the knowledge of the Company, threatened, and (ii) to the knowledge of the
Company, no facts or circumstances that would reasonably be expected to give
rise to any such Action against any Company Benefit Plan.

 

(g) None of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the Companys
knowledge, any other "disqualified person" (within the meaning of Section
4975 of the Code) nor any "party in interest" (within the meaning of Section
3(14) of ERISA) has engaged in any nonexempt "prohibited transaction"
(within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA) with
respect to any of the Company Benefit Plans which could subject any such
Company Benefit Plans, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any material
liability, penalty or tax under Section 502(i) of ERISA or Section 4975 of
the Code.

(h) The execution and performance of this Agreement will not (i)
constitute a stated triggering event under any Company Benefit Plan that will
result in any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise) becoming due
from the Company or any Subsidiary thereof to any current or former director,
manager, officer, employee or consultant (or dependents of such Persons), or
(ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of
compensation due to any current or former director, manager, officer,
employee or consultant (or dependents of such Persons) of the Company or any
Subsidiary thereof.

 



36 (i) No Company Benefit Plan provides or represents the obligation to
provide post-retirement medical, life or other welfare benefits to any current
or terminated employee (or any dependent thereof) of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries other than as required under applicable Law, including
pursuant to COBRA, or coverage that does not last more than 30 days following
termination.

(j) Except as would not reasonably be expected to result in material
liability to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, all required
reports with respect to each Company Benefit Plan have been timely and
accurately filed with the Internal Revenue Service, the United States
Department of Labor and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, to the
extent applicable, and, to the extent required by applicable Law, provided to
participants in the applicable Company Benefit Plan.

 

(k) Each Company Benefit Plan that is a "non-qualified deferred
compensation plan" (as such term is defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code)
is in documentary and operational compliance in all material respects with
Section 409A of the Code, and no Person has a right to any gross up
or indemnification for Taxes imposed under Section 409A of the Code from the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any such Company Benefit
Plan, payment or arrangement subject to Section 409A of the Code.

 

(l) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is in compliance in all
material respects with all applicable Laws relating to the classification of
employees as exempt or non-exempt from overtime requirements and the payment
of wages.

 

(m) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any
agreement or arrangement with any employee or other service provider of the
Company that would reasonably be expected to result, separately or in the
aggregate, in the payment of an amount that would not be deductible by reason
of Section 280G of the Code or would be subject to an excise tax under
Section 4999 of the Code as a result of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(n) The term " _Foreign Plan_ " shall mean any Company Benefit Plan that is
maintained outside of the United States for the benefit of individuals
providing services primarily outside the United States. There have not
occurred, nor are there continuing any transactions or breaches of fiduciary
duty under applicable Law with respect to any Foreign Plan that would
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Except as would
not reasonably be expected to result in material liability to the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, each Foreign Plan that is required to be
registered or meet similar requirements has been registered or has satisfied
any applicable similar requirements and has been maintained in good standing
with the applicable regulatory authorities.

 

(o) (i) All social security returns and social security reports that are
required to be filed in relation to employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their agents in Italy accurately reflect all social security
liabilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the periods

 



37  covered thereby in relation to such employees and agents and (ii) there are
no circumstances that would reasonably be expected to result in claims against
the Company or its Subsidiaries for the breach of their duties to file such
social security returns and reports required to be filed in relation to such
employees or agents or to pay the required social security contributions when
due.

 

4.14 _Labor and Employment_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.14(a)_ ,

material violation of any such Laws. Except as set forth on _Schedule

knowledge, threatened charge or complaint of employment discrimination,
harassment or violation of any other Law related to employment nor, to the
Companys knowledge, is there any reasonable basis for any such charge or
complaint, in each case, that if adversely determined would reasonably be
expected to result in a material liability to the Company and its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole. To the Companys knowledge, no employee is subject to any
restrictive covenant or any other obligation for the benefit of any
third party.

properties and to conduct its business as it is now being conducted. Each of

applicable) in good standing as a foreign corporation in all jurisdictions in
which its ownership of property or the character of its activities is such as
to require it to be so licensed or qualified, except where failure to be so
licensed or qualified would not reasonably be expected to have a Buyer
Material Adverse Effect. Buyer owns, beneficially and of record, all of the
outstanding shares of capital stock of Merger Sub.

 

5.2 _Due Authorization_. Each of Buyer and Merger Sub has all requisite
corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and
subject to the consents, approvals, authorizations and other requirements
described in _Section 5.5_) to perform all obligations to be performed by it
hereunder. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Buyer and Merger
Sub and the consummation by them of the transactions contemplated hereby have
been duly and validly authorized and approved by the Board of Directors of
Buyer and Merger Sub, and no other corporate proceeding on the part of Buyer
or Merger Sub is necessary to authorize this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (other than the adoption of this Agreement by Buyer in its
capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, which adoption will occur
immediately following execution of this Agreement by Merger Sub). This
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by each of Buyer
and Merger Sub and (assuming this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and
binding obligation of the Company and Holder Representative) this Agreement
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of each of Buyer and Merger
Sub, enforceable against Buyer and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms,
subject to the Remedies Exception.

5.3 _No Conflict_. Except as set forth on _Schedule_ _5.3_ ,
the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Buyer and Merger Sub and the
consummation by them of the transactions contemplated hereby do not and will

of any applicable Law to which Buyer or Merger Sub is subject or by which any
property, asset or right of Buyer or Merger Sub is bound, (b) conflict with,
or require any approval or consent under, the certificate of incorporation,
bylaws or other Organizational Documents of Buyer or any Subsidiary of Buyer

of any Contract to which Buyer or any Subsidiary of Buyer (including Merger
Sub) is a party or by which Buyer or any Subsidiary of Buyer (including
Merger Sub) may be bound, or terminate or result in the termination of any
such Contract, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the
properties, assets or rights of Buyer or any Subsidiary of Buyer (including
Merger Sub) or constitute an event which, after notice or lapse of time or
both, would reasonably be expected to result in any such violation, breach,
termination or creation of a Lien, except to the extent that the occurrence of
the foregoing items set forth in clauses (a) or (b) would not reasonably be
expected to have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

 

5.4 _Litigation and Proceedings_. There are no lawsuits, actions, suits,
claims or other proceedings at law or in equity, or, to the knowledge of
Buyer, investigations, pending before or by any Governmental Authority or, to
the knowledge of Buyer, threatened, against Buyer or Merger Sub which, if
determined adversely, would reasonably be expected to have a Buyer Material
Adverse Effect. There is no unsatisfied judgment or any open injunction
binding upon Buyer or Merger Sub which would reasonably be expected to have a
Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

 



48 5.5 _Governmental Consents_. Assuming the truth and completeness of the
representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement, no
consent, approval or authorization of, or designation, declaration or filing
with, any Governmental Authority is required on the part of Buyer or Merger

either case which would reasonably be expected to impair or adversely affect
such resources.

 

5.7 _Brokers_ __ _Fees_. Except fees described on _Schedule_ _5.7_
(which fees shall be the sole responsibility of Buyer), no broker, finder,
investment banker or other Person is entitled to any brokerage fee, finders
fee or other commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by

Affiliates.

Buyer nor Merger Sub is entering into this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud either
present or future creditors. Assuming that the representations and warranties
of the Company contained in this Agreement are true and correct in all
material respects, and after giving effect to the Merger, at and immediately
after the Effective Time, each of Buyer, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries (a) will be solvent (in that both the fair value of its assets

value of its assets will not be less than the amount required to pay its
probable liability on its recourse debts as they mature or become due); (b)
will have adequate capital and liquidity with which to engage in its business;
and (c) will not have incurred debts beyond its ability to pay as they mature
or become due.

 

5.9 _No_ _Outside_ _Reliance_. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
_Article V_ or any other provision hereof, each of Buyer and Merger Sub
acknowledges and agrees that neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates,
nor any of its or their respective Representatives, has made, or is making,

Buyer nor Merger Sub has relied on any representation, warranty or other
statement of the Company or any of its Affiliates, or any of its or their
respective Representatives), beyond those expressly given in _Article IV_ (as
modified by the Schedules), including any implied warranty or representation
as to condition, merchantability, suitability or fitness for a particular
purpose or trade as to any of the assets of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is
understood that any cost estimates, financial or other projections or other

 



49  predictions that may be contained or referred to in the Schedules or
elsewhere, as well as any information, documents or other materials (including

deemed to be representations or warranties of the Company, and no
representation or warranty is made as to the accuracy or completeness of any
of the foregoing except as may be expressly set forth in this Agreement (as

Agreement, each of Buyer and Merger Sub understands and agrees that any
inventory, equipment, vehicles, assets, properties and business of the Company
and its Subsidiaries are furnished "as is", "where is" and, subject only to
the representations and warranties contained in _Article IV_ (as modified by
the Schedules), with all faults and without any other representation or
warranty of any nature whatsoever. 

5.10 _Acquisition of Interests for Investment_. Each of Buyer and Merger
Sub has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that
it is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its participation in the
Merger. Each of Buyer and Merger Sub confirms that the Company has made
available to Buyer and Merger Sub and Buyers and Merger Subs
Representatives the opportunity to ask questions of the officers and
management employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as well as access to
the documents, information and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries
and to acquire additional information about the business and financial
condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and each of Buyer and Merger
Sub confirms that it has made an independent investigation, analysis and
evaluation of the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
properties, assets, business, financial condition, documents, information and
records. Buyer is acquiring the stock of the Surviving Corporation for
investment and not with a view toward or for sale in connection with any
distribution thereof, or with any present intention of distributing or selling
common stock of the Surviving Corporation. Buyer understands and agrees that
common stock of the Surviving Corporation may not be sold, transferred,
offered for sale, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of without
registration under the Securities Act, except pursuant to an exemption from

qualified by "commercially reasonable efforts."

 

(e) Buyer shall be solely responsible for and pay all fees required under
the HSR Act and any other applicable foreign antitrust or competition Laws.

7.2 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Buyer agrees that it shall indemnify
and hold harmless each present and former director, officer and employee of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries against any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any Action arising out of
or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to
the fullest extent that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case
may be, would have been permitted under applicable Law and its respective
Organizational Documents in effect on the date of this

 



56  Agreement to indemnify such person (including promptly advancing expenses as
incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law). Without
limiting the foregoing, Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each
of its Subsidiaries (i) to maintain for a period of not less than six (6)
years from the Effective Time provisions in its Organizational Documents
concerning the indemnification and exoneration (including provisions relating
to expense advancement) of the Companys and its Subsidiaries former and
current officers, directors, employees, and agents that are no less favorable
to those Persons than the provisions of the Organizational Documents of the
Company or such Subsidiary, as applicable, in each case, as of the date of
this Agreement and (ii) not to amend, repeal or otherwise modify such
provisions in any respect that would adversely affect the rights of those
Persons thereunder, in each case, except as required by Law.

(b) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Buyer shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect directors and officers
liability insurance covering those Persons who are currently covered by the
Companys or any of its Subsidiaries directors and officers liability
insurance policies on terms not less favorable than the terms of such current
insurance coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation may cause coverage to be extended under the current directors
and officers liability insurance by obtaining at or prior to the Closing a
prepaid, non-cancelable six-year "tail" policy containing terms not less
favorable than the terms of such current insurance coverage) with respect to
matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (the " _Tail
Policy_ ") (it being understood that the purchase by Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries, and the maintenance for such six-year period following the
Closing by the Surviving Corporation, of such Tail Policy will satisfy Buyers
obligation under this _Section_ __ _ 7.2(b_)), and (ii) if any claim is
asserted or made within such six-year period, any insurance required to be
maintained under this _Section 7.2_ shall be continued in respect of such
claim until the final disposition thereof; _provided_ , _further_ , that
payment for insurance coverage provided by such Tail Policy shall not exceed
250% of the annual premium paid as of the date hereof by the Company.

(c) The rights of indemnification and to receive advancement of expenses
as provided by this Agreement shall not be deemed exclusive of any other
rights to which any Person entitled to indemnification under this _Section
7.2_ (an " _Indemnified Person_ ") may at any time be entitled. No right
or remedy herein conferred by this Agreement is intended to be exclusive of
any other right or remedy, and every other right and remedy shall be
cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or
now or hereafter existing at Law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion of
any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent
or subsequent assertion of any other right or remedy. Buyer hereby
acknowledges that the Indemnified Persons have or may, in the future, have
certain rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and/or insurance
provided by other Persons (collectively, " _Other Indemnitors_ "). Buyer
hereby agrees that, with respect to any advancement or indemnification
obligation owed, at any time, to an Indemnified Person by Buyer, the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries or any Other Indemnitor, whether
pursuant to any certificate of incorporation, by-laws, partnership agreement,
operating agreement, indemnification agreement or other document or agreement
and/or pursuant to this _Section 7.2_ (any of the foregoing, an "
_Indemnification Obligation_ "), and after the Effective Time, Buyer shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to (i) jointly
and severally, and at all times, be the indemnitors of first resort (i.e.,
Buyers, the Surviving Corporations and its Subsidiaries obligations to an
Indemnified Person shall be primary and any obligation of the

 



57  Other Indemnitors to advance expenses or to provide indemnification for the
same expenses or liabilities incurred by an Indemnified Person shall be
secondary), and (ii) at all times, be required to advance, and shall be
liable, jointly and severally, for, the full amount of all expenses,
judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement to the extent
legally permitted and as required by the terms of this Agreement or
any Indemnification Obligation, without regard to any rights that an
Indemnified Person may have against the Other Indemnitors. Furthermore, Buyer
irrevocably waives, relinquishes and releases the Other Indemnitors from any
and all claims (x) against the Other Indemnitors for contribution,
subrogation, indemnification or any other recovery of any kind in respect
thereof and (y) that the Indemnified Person must seek expense advancement or
reimbursement, or indemnification, from any Other Indemnitor before the
Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries or Buyer must perform its expense
advancement and reimbursement, and indemnification obligations, under this
Agreement. Buyer hereby further agrees that no advancement, indemnification
or other payment by the Other Indemnitors on behalf of an Indemnified Person
with respect to any claim for which an Indemnified Person has sought
indemnification from Buyer or the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries
shall affect the foregoing, and the Other Indemnitors shall have a right of
contribution and/or be subrogated to the extent of such advancement,
indemnification or other payment to all of the rights of recovery of such
Indemnified Person against Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries, and Buyer or the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries shall
jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless against such amounts
actually paid by the Other Indemnitors to or on behalf of such Indemnified
Person to the extent such amounts would have otherwise been payable by Buyer
or the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries under any Indemnification
Obligation.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
this _Section 7.2_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger indefinitely
and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all successors and assigns of
Buyer and the Surviving Corporation. In the event that Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or transfers
or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of Buyer or the Surviving Corporation, as the case
may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this  _Section 7.2_.

7.3 _Employment Matters_.

 

(a) Buyer agrees that for a period of twelve (12) months after the Closing
Date, Buyer shall provide (or cause the Surviving Corporation to provide)
each employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Closing who continues in the employ of Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any
of their Subsidiaries following the Closing Date (a " _Continuing Employee_
") (i) an annual base salary at least equal to the Continuing Employees
annual base salary in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date, (ii) long
and short term cash incentive compensation opportunities that have a target
value at least equal to the Continuing Employees target long and short term
cash incentive compensation opportunities in effect immediately prior to the
Closing Date, and (iii) welfare benefits that are substantially comparable in
the aggregate to those provided to the Continuing Employee immediately prior
to the Closing Date, in each case, excluding (I) equity and equity-like
compensation and (II) the Long-Term 

 



58  Incentive Agreements. This _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ shall not limit the
obligation of Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or their Subsidiaries to
maintain any compensation arrangement or benefit plan that, pursuant to an
existing contract or applicable Law, must be maintained for a period longer
than one year. No provision of this Agreement shall be construed as a
guarantee of continued employment of any Continuing Employee and this
Agreement shall not be construed so as to prohibit Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries from having the right to terminate the employment of any
Continuing Employee, provided that any such termination is effected in
accordance with applicable Law. 

(b) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall give each Continuing Employee
full credit for purposes of eligibility to participate, level of benefits,
early retirement eligibility and early retirement subsidies and vesting (other
than benefit accrual under any defined benefit plans except as required by
ERISA) under any employee benefit plans, arrangements, collective agreements
and employment-related entitlements (other than with respect to any equity
incentive plan or program) provided, sponsored, maintained or contributed to
by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries and made available to Continuing
Employees for such Continuing Employees service with the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, and with any predecessor employer, to the same extent
recognized by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing,
except to the extent such credit would result in the duplication of benefits
for the same period of service.

 

(c) Buyer shall (i) for the period of twelve (12) months after the Closing
Date, waive for each Continuing Employee and his or her dependents, any
waiting period provision, payment requirement to avoid a waiting period, pre-
existing condition limitation, actively-at-work requirement and any other
restriction that would prevent immediate or full participation under the
health and welfare plans of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries applicable to
such Continuing Employee to the extent such waiting period, pre-existing
condition limitation, actively-at-work requirement or other restriction would
not have been applicable to such Continuing Employee under the terms of the
health and welfare plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case,
immediately prior to the Closing, and (ii) give full credit under the health
and welfare plans of Buyer and its Subsidiaries applicable to each Continuing
Employee and his or her dependents for all co-payments and deductibles
satisfied prior to the Closing in the same plan year as the Closing, and for
any lifetime maximums or out-of-pocket maximums, in each of clause (i) and
(ii), as if there had been a single continuous employer.

 

(d) If any Continuing Employees employment terminates on or after the
Closing in a manner that results in such Continuing Employee ceasing to be
eligible to receive, or otherwise not receiving, all or any portion of a Post-
Closing LTIP Payment pursuant to the Continuing Employees Long-Term Incentive
Agreement (a " _Forfeited LTIP Payment_ "), within five (5) Business Days of
such employment termination, Buyer shall provide written notice to the Holder
Representative of the name of the Continuing Employee whose employment so
terminated and the amount of the corresponding Forfeited LTIP Payment. Buyer
shall pay to the remaining LTIP Participants, Pre-Closing Holders of In the
Money Options and Holder Representative an amount equal to 60% of the
Forfeited LTIP Payment (the " _Supplemental LTIP Amount_ ") as set forth in
this Section 7.3(d). Within ten (10) Business Days following the date that is
six (6) months after the Closing Date, the Holder Representative will deliver
to Buyer a complete and accurate schedule (the " _Supplemental Payment
Schedule_ ") setting forth the portion of the Supplemental LTIP Amount (the "
_Supplemental LTIP Payment_ ") to be paid to each 

 



59  current and former employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries who is party
to a Long-Term Incentive Agreement (the " _LTIP Participants_ ") and the
portion of the Supplemental LTIP Amount (the " _Supplemental Option Payment_
") to be paid to each Pre-Closing Holder in respect of the Pre-Closing
Holders In the Money Options. Buyer shall be entitled to rely on the
Supplemental Payment Schedule. Within five (5) Business Days following receipt
of the Supplemental Payment Schedule, Buyer shall cause to be paid (x) to the
LTIP Participants, the Supplemental LTIP Payments, less applicable Tax
withholdings, in accordance with the Supplemental LTIP Schedule, (y) to the
Pre-Closing Holders of In the Money Options, the Supplemental Option Payments,
less applicable Tax withholdings, in accordance with the Supplemental LTIP
Schedule and (z) to the Holder Representative an amount (the " _Supplemental
Stockholder Amount_ ") equal to the Supplemental LTIP Amount less the sum of
all Supplemental LTIP Payments and Supplemental Option Payments required to
be paid to LTIP Participants and Pre-Closing Holders of In the Money Options
under the foregoing clauses (x) and (y). Promptly following the
Holder Representatives receipt of the Supplemental Stockholder Amount, the
Holder Representative shall deliver to each Pre-Closing Holder the portion of
the Supplemental Stockholder Amount payable to such Pre-Closing Holder in
respect of the Pre-Closing Holders Preferred Shares and Common Shares. Prior
to the Closing, and subject to Buyers review and approval of the necessary
agreements or documentation (which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), the Company shall take all action
reasonably necessary to establish a rabbi trust as required by the Long-Term
Incentive Agreements. Buyer and the Holder Representative shall cooperate in
good faith to effect the provisions of this Section 7.3(d), including promptly
providing each other with such information as is reasonably requested by the
other in order to permit the performance of their respective obligations
under this Section 7.3(d).

(e) No provision in this _Section 7.3_, whether express or implied, shall
(i) create any third party beneficiary or other rights in any employee or
former employee of the Company (including any beneficiary or dependent
thereof), any other participant in any Company Benefit Plan or any other
Person; (ii) create any rights to continued employment with Buyer, the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries or in any way
limit the ability of Buyer, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any individual at any time
and for any reason; or (iii) constitute or be deemed to constitute an
amendment to any Company Benefit Plan or any other employee benefit
plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement sponsored or maintained by
Buyer, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries or
Affiliates.

 

7.4 _Retention of Books and Records_. Buyer shall cause the Company and
its Subsidiaries to retain all books, ledgers, files, reports, plans,
operating records and any other material documents pertaining to the Company
and its Subsidiaries in existence at the Closing that are required to be
retained under current retention policies for a period of seven (7) years
from the Closing Date, and to make the same available after the Closing for
inspection and copying by the Holder Representative or its representatives at
the Holder Representatives expense, during regular business hours and upon
reasonable request and upon reasonable advance notice. To the extent Buyer or
the Company proposes to destroy or dispose of any such books, ledgers, files,
reports, plans, operating records or any other material documents at the end
of such seven (7)-year period, Buyer shall first offer, in writing at least
ninety (90) days prior to

 



60  such proposed destruction or disposition, to surrender all or any portion of
such records to the Holder Representative, the Holder Representative shall
then have the right, by written notice to Buyer delivered within 15 days
after receiving notice from Buyer, to cause any such records to be delivered
to it upon request and Buyer shall provide all reasonable assistance requested
by the Holder Representative in connection therewith.

 

7.5 _Contact_ _with Customers and Suppliers_. Until the Closing Date,
Buyer shall not, and shall cause its representatives not to, contact or
communicate with the employees, customers, potential customers, suppliers,
distributors or licensors of the Company or the Companys Subsidiaries, or any
other Persons having a business relationship with the Company or the
Companys Subsidiaries, concerning the transactions contemplated hereby
without the prior written consent of the Holder Representative.

the Stockholder Agreement have been exercised in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that such stockholders are
required to comply with the terms thereof (the " _Information Statement_ ").
The Company shall offer Buyer the opportunity to review and comment upon any

Subsidiaries to take any action outside the ordinary course of business on the
Closing Date after the Closing, file any Tax Return inconsistent with past
practices or take any other action that is not contemplated by this
Agreement, in each case that would increase the liability for Taxes taken into
account in the calculation of Closing Date Net Working Capital.

 

(d) For purposes of determining Tax liabilities and assets of the Company
and its Subsidiaries in the calculation of Closing Date Net Working Capital
for a Straddle Period, the amount of Taxes allocable to the portion of the

Taxes other than sales or use taxes, value-added taxes, employment

 



62  taxes, withholding taxes, and any Tax based on or measured by income,
receipts or profits earned during a Straddle Period, deemed to be the amount

numerator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire
Straddle Period, and (ii) in the case of any other Tax, determined as though
the taxable period of the Company or relevant Subsidiary, as applicable,
terminated at the end of the day on the Closing Date. In the case of a Tax
that is (i) paid for the privilege of doing business during a period (a "
_Privilege Period_ ") and (ii) computed based on business activity occurring
during an accounting period ending prior to such Privilege Period, any
reference to a " _Tax period_ ", a " _tax period_ ", or a " _taxable period_
" shall mean such accounting period and not such Privilege Period.

 

(e) At or prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Buyer a
certificate prepared in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section

reasonable efforts to cause Buyer or one of its Subsidiaries to be substituted
in all respects for the Holder Representative or any of its
applicable Affiliates in respect of all obligations of the Holder
Representative or such Affiliate under such Sponsor Guarantee on the Closing
Date such that the Holder Representative or such applicable Affiliate shall
have no liability with respect to such Sponsor Guarantee on or after the
Closing Date. Following the Closing, Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold

representations and warranties that are made as of a specific date, which
representations and warranties shall have been so true and correct on and as
of such date), except for breaches or inaccuracies that would not reasonably

purposes of determining the accuracy of such representations and warranties,
all materiality, Material Adverse Effect and similar qualifiers set forth in
such representations and warranties shall be disregarded), (ii)
the representations and warranties contained in _Section_ __ _ 4.6_ shall be
true and correct in all respects on and as of the Closing Date as if made on
the Closing Date (other than representations and warranties that are made as

true and correct on and as of such date), except for de minimis changes or
changes arising as a result of actions permitted to be taken in accordance
with  _Section_ __ _ 6.1_, (iii) the representations and warranties

4.6_ (which are addressed in clause (ii) hereof)) shall be true and correct in
all respects on and as of the Closing Date as if made on the Closing Date
(other than representations and warranties that are made as of a specific

on and as of such date).

 

(b) Each of the covenants of the Company to be performed at or prior to the

shall have occurred, and is continuing, that has had, or would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

 

(e) The Company shall have delivered to Buyer the deliveries contemplated
in  _Section_ __ _ 2.6(a_).

Buyer or Merger Sub, on the other hand, respectively, to comply with its
obligations under this Agreement, including under _Section 8.1_.

 

ARTICLE X.

 

TERMINATION/EFFECTIVENESS

 

10.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the transactions
contemplated hereby abandoned:

(a) by mutual written consent of the Holder Representative and Buyer;

 

(b) prior to the Closing, by written notice to the Company from Buyer if: 

 



65 (i) there is any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement on the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement, such that
the conditions specified in _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a_) or _Section_ __ _ 9.2(b_)
would not be satisfied at the Closing (a " _Terminating Company Breach_ "),
except that, if such Terminating Company Breach is curable by the Company
through the exercise of its reasonable best efforts, then, for a period of
time equal to the later of (x) thirty (30) days after receipt by the Company
of notice from Buyer of such breach and (y) the Closing Date, but, in each
case, only as long as the Company continues to use its reasonable best efforts
to cure such Terminating Company Breach (the " _Company Cure Period_ "), such
termination shall not be effective, and such termination shall become
effective only if the Terminating Company Breach is not cured within the
Company Cure Period;

 

(ii) the Closing has not occurred on or before March 31, 2018 (subject to
(A)  _Section 12.15_ and (B) the proviso to this clause (ii), the "
_Termination Date_ "), unless Buyers or Merger Subs breach is the primary
reason for the Closing not occurring on or before such date,  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.1(a_) or
_9.1(b_ ) (or, with respect to matters addressed in such Sections, _Section_
__ _ 9.1(c_)) have not been satisfied or waived on or prior to such date,
but all other conditions set forth in _Article IX_ have been satisfied or
waived (except for those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied
at the Closing), then the Termination Date may be automatically extended to a
date not beyond June 30, 2018; or

(iii) the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby is
permanently enjoined, prohibited or otherwise restrained by the terms of a
final, non-appealable order or judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction;
or

(iv) if the Company fails to deliver the Merger Consent by the close of
business on the date hereof; or

(c) prior to the Closing, by written notice to Buyer from the Company if:

(i) (A) there is any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement on the part of Buyer or Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement, such
that the conditions specified in _Section_ __ _ 9.3(a)_ or _Section_ __ _
9.3(b_) would not be satisfied at the Closing (a " _Terminating Buyer Breach_
"), except that, if such Terminating Buyer Breach is curable by Buyer through
the exercise of its reasonable best efforts, then, for a period of time equal
to the later of (x) thirty (30) days after receipt by Buyer of notice from
the Company of such breach and (y) the Closing Date, but, in each case, only
as long as Buyer continues to use its reasonable best efforts to cure such
Terminating Buyer Breach (the " _Buyer Cure Period_ "), such termination
shall not be effective, and such termination shall become effective only if
the Terminating Buyer Breach is not cured within the Buyer Cure Period, or (B)
(1) all of the conditions set forth in _Sections 9.1_ and _9.2_ have been
satisfied (other than those conditions which by their terms or nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing) as of the date the Closing should have occurred
pursuant to _Section 2.3_, and (2) Buyer or Merger Sub has failed to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement within one (1)
Business Day following the date the Closing should have occurred pursuant to
_Section 2.3_;

 



66 (ii) the Closing has not occurred on or before the Termination Date (as
may be extended pursuant to

_Section 10.1(b)(ii))_, unless the Companys breach is the primary reason
for the Closing not occurring on or before such date; or

 

(iii) the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby is
permanently enjoined, prohibited or otherwise restrained by the terms of a
final, non-appealable order or judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.

 

10.2 _Effect of Termination_. Except as otherwise set forth in this
_Section 10.2_ or in  _Section 10.3_, in the event of the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1_, this Agreement shall forthwith
become void and have no effect, without any liability on the part of any party
hereto or its respective Affiliates, employees, officers, directors or
stockholders, other than liability of the Company, Buyer or Merger Sub, as the
case may be, for any intentional and willful breach of this Agreement
occurring prior to such termination. In determining losses or damages
recoverable upon termination by a party hereto (or, subject to _Section
10.3_, the Termination Date Holders) for the other partys breach, the parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that such losses and damages shall not be
limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and shall include
the benefit of the bargain lost by such party or, in the case of the Company,
the holders of Preferred Stock, Common Stock and Options (taking into
consideration relevant matters, including other opportunities and the time
value of money), which shall be deemed to be damages of such party or, as
provided in  _Section 10.3_, the Termination Date Holders in respect of
shares of Preferred Stock, Common Stock and, to the extent applicable,
Options, as the case may be. The provisions of _Sections 10.2_ , _10.3_ ,
_Articles XI_ and  _XII_ and the Confidentiality Agreement, shall survive any
termination of this Agreement.

 

10.3 _Entitlement to Damages_.

 

(a) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, in the event of a
termination of this Agreement, to the extent Buyer or the Merger Sub are
required to pay damages pursuant to this _Article X_ in an amount that exceeds
the Companys expenses or out-of-pocket costs incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including any
disputes related thereto, such excess (the " _Holder Damages_ ") represents an
amount of damages payable in respect of losses suffered by the Termination
Date Holders in respect of shares of Preferred Stock, Common Stock and, to the
extent applicable, Options. Accordingly, in the event that damages are payable
pursuant to this _Article X_ , the Holder Representative shall, in its sole
and absolute discretion, determine the extent, if any, to which such damages
constitute Holder Damages, and Buyer or the Merger Sub, as applicable, shall
pay such Holder Damages to the Holder Representative, for the account of, and
as agent to, the Termination Date Holders, to one or more accounts designated
in writing by the Holder Representative.

 

(b) On or prior to the date the Holder Damages are paid to the Holder
Representative in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 10.3(_ _a_ ), or as
promptly as practicable thereafter, the Board of Directors of the Company will
determine in good faith which, if any, Options which shall have vested on or
before the Termination Date should be deemed to be " _Damaged Options_ " for
the purposes of determining the Termination Date Holders and each Termination
Date Holders Termination Percentage. For the purposes of this Agreement, each
Person who holds 

 



67  one or more shares of Preferred Stock, Common Stock or Damaged Options as of
11:59 p.m. (Eastern time) on the date on which this Agreement is terminated
shall be deemed to be a " _Termination Date Holder_ ".

(c) Promptly after the later of (i) the determination in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 10.3(b_) of which, if any, Options are Damaged Options and
(ii) the payment of the Holder Damages to the Holder Representative in
accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 10.3(a_), the Holder Representative shall
distribute the Holder Damages, first to the Termination Date Holders of shares
of Preferred Stock, in respect of such shares of Preferred Stock, an amount
equal to the aggregate Accruing Dividends (as defined in the Company
Certificate of Incorporation) accrued on such shares of Preferred Stock as of
the Termination Date and then (to the extent of any remaining Holder Damages),
to the Termination Date Holders, pro rata in accordance with their respective
Termination Percentages, subject to any applicable withholding; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that payment of any Holder Damages in respect of a Damaged Option
granted to a Termination Date Holder who was an employee or independent
contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries subject to Section 409A
of the Code at any time during the taxable year of such employee or
independent contractor in which such Damaged Option was granted shall in all
events be subject to the Termination Date Holders continued employment with
the Company or its Subsidiaries through the date on which Holder Damages are
distributed and any Holder Damages not distributed with respect to a Damaged
Option by reason of this proviso (such a Damaged Option, an " _Excluded
Damaged Option_ ") shall be distributed among all other Termination Date
Holders pro rata in accordance with their respective Termination Percentages
as determined without regard to any Excluded Damaged Options. For the
purposes of this Agreement, " _Termination Percentage_ " means, with respect
to any Termination Date Holder, a ratio (expressed as a percentage) equal to
(x) the sum of (A) the number of shares of Common Stock held by such holder
as of 11:59 p.m. (Eastern time) on the date of termination of this Agreement,
(B) the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of all
Preferred Shares held by such holder as of 11:59 p.m. (Eastern time) on the
date of termination of this Agreement (assuming that, as of such time, no
Accruing Dividends (as defined in the Company Certificate of Incorporation)
are outstanding and unpaid with respect to such Preferred Shares) and (C) the
number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise in full of any
Damaged Options held by such holder as of 11:59 p.m. (Eastern time) on the
date of termination of this Agreement, divided by (y) the sum of (i) the
aggregate number shares of Common Stock held by all holders as of 11:59 p.m.
(Eastern time) on the date of termination of this Agreement, plus (ii) the
aggregate number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of
all Preferred Shares held by all holders of Preferred Stock as of 11:59 p.m.
(Eastern time) on the date of termination of this Agreement (assuming that, as
of such time, no Accruing Dividends (as defined in the Company Certificate of
Incorporation) are outstanding and unpaid with respect to such Preferred
Shares), plus (iii) the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock issuable
upon the exercise in full of all Damaged Options held by all holders as of
11:59 p.m. (Eastern time) on the date of termination of this Agreement.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  _Section 10.3_,
claims for Holder Damages shall be brought solely by the Holder
Representative, on behalf of and as agent to the Termination Date Holders, and
no holder of Preferred Stock, Common Stock or Options shall be entitled
to assert a claim for Holder Damages, and no holder of Preferred Stock,
Common Stock or Options shall be a third party beneficiary with respect
thereto.

 



68 (e) The Company, Buyer and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the
agreements contained in _Section 10.2_ and this _Section 10.3_ are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that,
without these agreements, neither Buyer nor Merger Sub nor the Company would
enter into this Agreement.

ARTICLE XI.

 

HOLDER REPRESENTATIVE

 

11.1 _Designation and Replacement of Holder Representative_. The parties
have agreed that it is desirable to designate a representative to act on
behalf of holders of the Preferred Stock, the Common Stock and the Options for
certain limited purposes, as specified herein (the " _Holder Representative_
"). The parties have designated R/C Hudson Holdings, L.P. as the initial
Holder Representative, and approval of this Agreement by the holders of
Preferred Stock and Common Stock shall constitute ratification and approval of
such designation. The Holder Representative may resign at any time, and the
Holder Representative may be removed by the vote of Persons which collectively
owned more than fifty percent (50%) of the Aggregate Fully-Diluted Common
Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time (or, in the case of a
termination of this Agreement, as of such termination) (the " _Majority
Holders_ "). In the event that a Holder Representative has resigned or been
removed, a new Holder Representative shall be appointed by a vote of the
Majority Holders, such appointment to become effective upon the written
acceptance thereof by the new Holder Representative. The designation of any
Person as the Holder Representative is and shall be coupled with an interest,
and, except as set forth in this  _Article XI_ , such designation is
irrevocable and shall not be affected by the death, incapacity, illness,
bankruptcy, dissolution or other inability to act of any of the holders of
Preferred Stock or Common Stock or any of the holders of Options.

11.2 _Authority and Rights of the Holder Representative; Limitations on
Liability_. The Holder Representative shall have such powers and authority as
are necessary to carry out the functions assigned to it under this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Holder Representative shall have no
obligation to act on behalf of the holders of Preferred Stock, Common Stock
or Options, except as expressly provided herein. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Holder Representative shall have full power,
authority and discretion to (i) estimate and determine the amounts of Holder
Representative Expenses and to pay such Holder Representative Expenses in
accordance with _Section 3.5_, (ii) after the Closing, negotiate and enter
into amendments to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement for and on behalf
of the Pre-Closing Holders and (iii) in connection with a termination of this
Agreement, determine the Holder Damages, if any, and collect and distribute
(and withhold from, if applicable) such Holder Damages in accordance with
_Section 10.3_. All actions taken by the Holder Representative under this
Agreement shall be binding upon the Pre-Closing Holders and their successors
as if expressly confirmed and ratified in writing by each of them. The Holder
Representative shall have no liability to Buyer, the Company or any holder of
Preferred Stock, Common Stock or Options, or any Termination Date Holder,
with respect to actions taken or omitted to be taken in its capacity as the
Holder Representative. The Holder Representative shall at all times be
entitled to rely on any directions received from the Majority Holders;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Holder Representative shall not be required
to follow any such direction, and shall be under no obligation to take any
action in its capacity as the Holder Representative, unless the Holder
Representative is holding funds delivered to it under _Sections_ _3.5_ or
_10.3_

 



69  and/or has been provided with other funds, security or indemnities which, in
the sole determination of the Holder Representative, are sufficient to protect
the Holder Representative against the costs, expenses and liabilities which
may be incurred by the Holder Representative in responding to such direction
or taking such action. Buyer shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall have no
liability of any kind or nature to any Pre-Closing Holders in reliance on the
grant of authority under this _Article XI_ in respect of, any act or decision
of, or instruction by, or any document or other paper delivered by, the Holder
Representative on behalf of the Pre-Closing Holders. Buyer shall have no
liability of any kind or nature in connection with any dispute or controversy
among the Pre-Closing Holders in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. The Holder Representative shall be entitled
to engage such counsel, experts and other agents and consultants as it shall
deem necessary in connection with exercising its powers and performing its
function hereunder and (in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Holder
Representative) shall be entitled to conclusively rely on the opinions and
advice of such Persons. The Holder Representative shall be entitled
to reimbursement from funds paid to it under _Sections 3.5_ or _10.3_ ,
released from the Escrow Funds for the benefit of Pre-Closing Holders and/or
otherwise received by it in its capacity as the Holder Representative
pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement, for all reasonable expenses,
disbursements and advances (including fees and disbursements of its counsel,
experts and other agents and consultants) incurred by the
Holder Representative in such capacity, and shall be entitled to
indemnification against any loss, liability or expenses arising out of actions
taken or omitted to be taken in its capacity as the Holder Representative
(except for those arising out of the Holder Representatives gross negligence
or willful misconduct), including the costs and expenses of investigation and
defense of claims. In the event that the Holder Representative determines, in
its sole and absolute discretion, that the funds paid to the Holder
Representative pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.5_ exceed the Holder
Representative Expenses, prior to the final release of the Escrow Funds, the
Holder Representative shall transfer such excess amount to the Escrow Agent
solely for disbursement to the Pre-Closing Holders as Merger Consideration;
_provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, in no event shall such excess amount
become part of the Escrow Funds or otherwise become payable to Buyer.

ARTICLE XII 

MISCELLANEOUS

 

12.1 _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_. None of the
representations or warranties or the covenants or agreements contained in
this Agreement, or in any certificate delivered by any of the parties hereto
at Closing, shall survive the Effective Time (other than the covenants set
forth in _Articles II_ , _III_ ,  _XI_ and _XII_ and _Sections 6.4_ , _6.6_ ,
_7.2_ , _7.3_ , _7.4_ , _8.4_ , and _8.5_ ). In furtherance of the foregoing,
Buyer and Merger Sub hereby waive, from and after the Closing, to the fullest

(b) after the Closing Date, none of the Buyer, Merger Sub or their
respective Affiliates may seek the rescission of the transactions

liabilities and obligations respecting the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby exclusively in contract pursuant to the express terms and
provisions of this Agreement (except with respect to claims arising from

remedies or causes of action (whether in contract or in tort (including

in this Agreement; and

 

(f) the parties hereto each hereby acknowledge that this Agreement embodies
the justifiable expectations of sophisticated parties derived from
arms-length negotiations and the parties hereto specifically acknowledge that
no party hereto has any special relationship with another party hereto that
would justify any expectation beyond that of an ordinary buyer and an ordinary
seller in an arms-length transaction.

 

12.2 _Waiver_. Any party to this Agreement may, at any time prior to the
Closing, by action taken by its Board of Directors, or officers thereunto
duly authorized, waive any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement. No
waiver by any of the parties hereto of any default, misrepresentation or
breach of warranty or covenant hereunder, whether intentional or not, shall
be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation or
breach of warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in any way any rights
arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence. No waiver by
any of the parties of any of the provisions hereof shall be effective unless
explicitly set forth in writing and executed by the party sought to be charged
with such waiver.

 

12.3 _Notices_. All notices and other communications among the parties

the extent permitted under Section 251(d) of the DGCL.

 



74 12.12 _Publicity_. The Company and Buyer agree that, from the date hereof
through the Closing Date, no public release or announcement concerning the

time to time to their respective employees, customers, suppliers and other
business relations and otherwise as the Company or Buyer, as applicable, may
reasonably determine is necessary to comply with applicable Law or the
requirements of any agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

the Company shall cooperate to prepare a joint press release to be issued on
or promptly after the date of this Agreement and a joint press release to be
issued on the Closing Date. The Company and Buyer and Merger Sub agree to keep
the terms of this Agreement confidential, except to the extent and to the
Persons to whom disclosure is required by applicable Law or for purposes of
compliance with financial reporting obligations or under the rules and
regulations of any national securities exchange in which case it will use its
reasonable efforts to consult with the other parties hereto and to obtain
such parties consent; _provided_ that the parties may disclose such terms to
their respective employees, accountants, advisors and other Representatives as
necessary in connection with the ordinary conduct of their respective
businesses (so long as such Persons agree to, or are bound by contract or
professional or fiduciary obligations to, keep the terms of this Agreement
confidential and so long as the parties shall be responsible to the other
parties hereto for breach of this _Section 12.12_ or such confidentiality
obligations by the recipients of its disclosure). The Company and Buyer
further acknowledge and agree that, R/C Hudson Holdings, L.P. may disclose
such terms and the existence of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby to its Affiliates in order that such Persons may provide
information about the subject matter of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby to their respective limited partners and
prospective limited partners in connection with their fundraising and
reporting activities.

 

12.13 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid
or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions
of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. The parties further
agree that if any provision contained herein is, to any extent, held invalid
or unenforceable in any respect under the Laws governing this Agreement, they
shall take any actions necessary to render the remaining provisions of this
Agreement valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by Law so long
as the economic and legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby
is not affected in any manner that is materially adverse to any party hereto
and, to the extent necessary, shall amend or otherwise modify this Agreement
to replace any provision contained herein that is held invalid
or unenforceable with a valid and enforceable provision giving effect to the
intent of the parties.

 

12.14 _Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 

(a) Any proceeding or action based upon, arising out of or related to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may be brought in the
Delaware Chancery Court (or, if the Delaware Chancery Court shall be
unavailable, any other court of the State of Delaware or, in the case of
claims to which the federal courts have exclusive subject matter

 



75  jurisdiction, any federal court of the United States of America sitting in
the State of Delaware), and each of the parties irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of each such court in any such proceeding or action,
waives any objection it may now or hereafter have to personal jurisdiction,
venue or to convenience of forum, agrees that all claims in respect of the
proceeding or action shall be heard and determined only in any such court,
and agrees not to bring any proceeding or action arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in any other court.
Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to affect the right of any party to
serve process in any manner permitted by Law or to commence legal proceedings
or otherwise proceed against any other party in any other jurisdiction, in
each case, to enforce judgments obtained in any action, suit or proceeding
brought pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 12.14(a_).

(b) Each party hereto hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any
suit, action or other proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. Each party hereto (i) certifies that
no representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented,
expressly or otherwise, that such party would not, in the event of any action,
suit or proceeding, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (ii) acknowledges
that it and the other parties hereto have been induced to enter into this
Agreement, by, among other things, the mutual waiver and certifications in
this _Section_ __ _ 12.14(_ _b_ ).

 

12.15 _Enforcement_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur, and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law,
in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed
in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to specifically enforce
the terms and provisions of this Agreement, without proof of actual damages or
otherwise, in addition to any other remedy to which any party is entitled at
law or in equity. Each party agrees to waive any requirement for the securing
or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy. The parties further
agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is
unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, nor to
assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy. To
the extent any party hereto brings an action, suit or proceeding to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement
(other than an action to enforce specifically any provision that expressly
survives termination of this Agreement), the Termination Date shall
automatically be extended to (i) the twentieth (20th) Business Day following
the resolution of such action, suit or proceeding or (ii) such other time
period established by the court presiding over such action, suit or
proceeding.

 

12.16 _Non-Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and
any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or related to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may only be brought against,
the entities that are expressly named as parties hereto and then only
with respect to the specific obligations set forth herein with respect to
such party. Except to the extent a named party to this Agreement (and then
only to the extent of the specific obligations undertaken by such named party
in this Agreement and not otherwise), no past, present or future director,
officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate or
agent, attorney, advisor or Representative of any such Person or any of its
Affiliates shall have any liability (whether in contract, tort, equity or
otherwise) for any one or more of the representations, warranties, covenants,
agreements or other obligations or liabilities of any one or more of the
Company or Buyer under this Agreement (whether for indemnification
or otherwise) of or for any claim based on, arising out of, or related to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



76 12.17 _Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representations; Non-Assertion of
Attorney-Client Privilege_.

(a) _Conflicts of Interest_. Each of Buyer and the Company hereby waives
and shall not assert, and agrees after the Closing to cause any other
applicable Affiliates of the Company to waive and to not assert, any conflict
of interest arising out of or relating to the representation, after the
Closing (the " _Post-Closing Representation_ "), of the Holder Representative,
one or more Pre-Closing Holders, the Company, or any of its Subsidiaries or
other Affiliates, or any of their respective officers, employees or directors
(any such person, a " _Designated Person_ ") in any matter involving this
Agreement or any other agreements or transactions contemplated hereby, by any
legal counsel (" _Prior Company Counsel_ ") currently representing any
Designated Person in connection with this Agreement or any other agreements or
transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Current Representation_ ").
Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer and the Company agree that, following
the Closing, Prior Company Counsel may serve as counsel to any Designated
Person in connection with any matters related to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including any litigation, claim or
obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement notwithstanding any representation by Prior
Company Counsel prior to the Closing, and Buyer and the Company (on behalf of
itself and its Subsidiaries) hereby agree that, in the event that a dispute
arises after the Closing between Buyer, the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company, on the one hand, and any Designated Person, on the other hand,
Prior Company Counsel may represent one or more Designated Persons in such
dispute even though the interests of such Person(s) may be directly adverse to
Buyer, the Company or its Subsidiaries and even though Prior Company Counsel
may have represented the Company or its Subsidiaries in a matter
substantially related to such dispute.

 

(b) _Attorney-Client Privilege_. Buyer waives and shall not assert, and
agrees after the Closing to cause the Company and its Affiliates to waive and
to not assert, any attorney-client privilege with respect to all communication
between any Prior Company Counsel and any Designated Person that relate to the
Current Representation in connection with any Post-Closing Representation,
including in connection with a dispute between any Designated Person and one
or more of Buyer, the Company and their respective Affiliates, it being the
intention of the parties hereto that all rights to such attorney-client
privilege and to control such attorney-client privilege shall be retained by
the Holder Representative. Furthermore, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that any
advice given to or communication with any of the Designated Persons
(other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) that relate to the Current
Representation shall not be subject to any joint privilege (whether or not the
Company or one more of its Subsidiaries also received such advice or
communication) and shall be owned solely by such Designated Persons (other
than the Company and its Subsidiaries). Portions of the books and records of
the Company containing any such privileged communications shall be excluded
from the purchase, and the Holder Representative shall cause such privileged
communications to be separated or, to the extent not capable of being
separated from the books and records, redacted from the books and records of
the Company and distributed to the Holder Representative (on behalf of
the applicable

 



77  Designated Persons) immediately prior to the Closing with no copies of such
privileged communications retained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, the remaining portions of the
books and records of the Company that do not constitute such privileged
communications may be retained by the Company and/or its Subsidiaries. The
parties agree to take, and to cause their respective Affiliates to take, all
steps necessary to implement this _Section 12.17_. Buyer hereby acknowledges
that it has had the opportunity (including on behalf of its Affiliates and the
Company) to discuss and obtain adequate information concerning
the significance and material risks of, and reasonable available alternatives
to, the waivers, permissions and other provisions of this Agreement, including
the opportunity to consult with counsel other than Prior Company Counsel.
This  _Section 12.17_ shall be irrevocable, and no term of this _Section
12.17_ may be amended, waived or modified, without the prior written consent
of the Holder Representative and its Affiliates and Prior Company Counsel
affected thereby.
