ARTICLE III



_CONVERSION OF THE COMPANY S CAPITAL STOCK_



3.1 _Conversion of the Company s Capital Stock_. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement:



(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Merger Subsidiary, the Company or the holder of any shares of
Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock, (i) each share of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, other than shares to be canceled pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)_ below and
Dissenting Shares pursuant to _Section 3.5_ below, shall be converted into and
represent the right to receive the Common Stock Per Share Merger Consideration
and (ii) each share of Company Preferred Stock, other than shares to be
canceled pursuant to



 

\- 3 - _Section 3.1(b)_ below, shall be converted into and represent the right to
receive the Preferred Stock Per Share Merger Consideration. The aggregate
consideration paid to the holders of issued and outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock pursuant to this _Section 3.1(a)_ is
referred to herein as the " _Merger Consideration_."



(b) At the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock and Company
Preferred Stock, if any, held in the Companys treasury or owned by Parent,
Merger Subsidiary or any subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be canceled and retired without payment of any
consideration therefor.



(c) At the Effective Time, each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, $.01 par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation. From and after
the Effective Time, each outstanding certificate theretofore representing
shares of common stock of Merger Subsidiary shall be deemed for all purposes
to evidence ownership and to represent the same number of shares of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation.



3.2 _Payment_.



(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank, trust company
or other entity reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as the
disbursing agent (the " _Disbursing Agent_ ") in effecting the exchange of the
Merger Consideration for certificates of shares of Company Common Stock and
Company Preferred Stock (" _Stock Certificates_ "). At or prior to the
Effective Time, Parent, Merger Subsidiary and/or the Surviving Corporation
shall deposit with the Disbursing Agent cash in an aggregate amount sufficient
to make the cash payments contemplated by _Section 3.1_ to be made to
the holders of shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock. As
soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Disbursing Agent to mail a notice and a transmittal form to each holder of
record of shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock that has
not already executed a transmittal form advising such holder of the
effectiveness of the Merger and the procedure for surrendering to the
Disbursing Agent such holders Stock Certificates for exchange into the
Merger Consideration. Each such holder, upon proper surrender of such Stock
Certificates to the Disbursing Agent together with and in accordance with such
transmittal form, shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect of the shares of Company
Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock theretofore evidenced by the Stock
Certificates so surrendered, subject to any Taxes required to be withheld.
Upon surrender of such Stock Certificates to the Disbursing Agent, Parent
shall cause the Disbursing Agent promptly to deliver the Merger Consideration
to the Person entitled thereto. The Principal Stockholder shall be entitled to
prompt payment by wire transfer in accordance with instructions specified in
the transmittal form. Until properly surrendered, each such Stock Certificate
shall be deemed for all purposes to evidence only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration payable with respect to the shares of Company Common
Stock or Company Preferred Stock represented by such Stock Certificate in
accordance with _Section 3.1(a)_. Until properly surrendered, holders of Stock
Certificates will not be entitled to payment of the Merger Consideration
to which they would otherwise be entitled. No interest will be paid or
accrued on the cash payable upon the



 

\- 4 - surrender of a Stock Certificate. All costs and expenses of the Disbursing
Agent shall be borne by Parent.



(b) If the Merger Consideration (or any portion thereof) payable with respect
to any Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock is to be delivered to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the Stock Certificates surrendered
in exchange therefor are registered, it shall be a condition to the payment
of such Merger Consideration that the Stock Certificates so surrendered shall
be properly endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock powers and otherwise
in proper form for transfer, that such transfer otherwise be proper and that
the Person requesting such transfer pay to the Disbursing Agent any transfer
or other Taxes payable by reason of the foregoing or establish to the
satisfaction of the Disbursing Agent that such Taxes have been paid or are not
required to be paid. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Disbursing
Agent nor any party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Company
Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock for any Merger Consideration delivered
to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar laws.



(c) In the event any Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Stock Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Surviving
Corporation will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Stock
Certificate, the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof as
determined in accordance with this _Article III_. When authorizing such
payment of the Merger Consideration in exchange therefor, the Board of
Directors of the Surviving Corporation may, in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost,
stolen or destroyed Stock Certificate to give the Surviving Corporation a
bond in such sum as it may direct, or such other secured or unsecured
indemnity agreement as such Board of Directors may require, as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against the Surviving Corporation
with respect to the Stock Certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed.



(d) Promptly following the seven month anniversary of the Effective Time, upon
request by Parent, the Disbursing Agent shall return to the Surviving
Corporation all Merger Consideration in its possession relating to the
transactions described in this Agreement, and the Disbursing Agents duty
shall thereupon terminate. Thereafter, each holder of a Stock Certificate may
surrender such Stock Certificate to the Surviving Corporation, in accordance
with the procedures above, and (subject to applicable abandoned property,
escheat and similar laws) receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration payable with respect thereto, without any interest thereon and
subject to any Taxes required to be withheld.



3.3 _No Further Rights_. From and after the Effective Time, holders of Stock
Certificates shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company,
except as provided herein or by law.



3.4 _Closing of the Company s Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer of shares
of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock shall thereafter be made.
If, after the Effective Time, Stock Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation or the Disbursing Agent, they shall be canceled and
exchanged for the Merger Consideration, as provided in this _Article III_.



 

\- 5 - 3.5 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding _Section 3.1(a)_ , shares of Company
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by
a holder who has demanded appraisal for such shares (" _Dissenting Shares_ ")
in accordance with the DGCL shall not be converted into or represent the right
to receive the applicable Merger Consideration, unless such holder withdraws
or otherwise loses (through failure to perfect or otherwise) his, her or its
right to appraisal, and each holder of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled
only to such rights with respect to such Dissenting Shares as may be granted
to such holder pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. If after the Effective
Time such holder withdraws or loses (through failure to perfect or otherwise)
his, her or its right to appraisal, such Dissenting Shares shall be treated
as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into a right to receive
the Merger Consideration payable with respect thereto, and any right of such
holder to a judicial appraisal of the Dissenting Shares shall
be extinguished. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
give Parent notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of
shares of Company Common Stock and involve Parent in the negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands.



3.6 _Stock Options_.



(a) The Company will (i) terminate, to the extent permitted by the terms
thereof, the Company Option Plans immediately before the Effective Time,
without prejudice to the rights of the holders of outstanding Options issued
pursuant to the Company Option Plans and give appropriate notices of such
termination to the holders of outstanding Options, (ii) grant no additional
Options after the date of this Agreement under the Company Option Plans and
(iii) grant or enter into, in each case after the date of this Agreement, no
other options, warrants, rights, convertible securities or other agreements
or commitments pursuant to which the Company is required to issue any shares
of its capital stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for
its capital stock.



(b) The Company will, at or before the Closing, cancel and cause the
surrender of all outstanding Options, regardless of whether the Options are
then exercisable and regardless of the exercise price of the Options.



(c) In settlement of the surrender and cancellation of each Option that has an
exercise price less than the Common Stock Per Share Merger Consideration, the
holder of such Option (regardless of whether such Option is then exercisable)
will be entitled to receive an amount in cash, without any interest thereon,
equal to the product of (i)(A) the Common Stock Per Share
Merger Consideration, minus (B) the exercise price per share of Company
Common Stock under such Option, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such Option; provided,
however, that the amounts payable pursuant to this _Section 3.6_ shall be
reduced by any applicable federal and state withholding Taxes. Options shall
be surrendered and canceled at the Closing and, upon such surrender and
cancellation, will be paid for by the Surviving Corporation at Closing. On or
prior to Closing, the Company shall take all steps necessary to ensure that,
assuming the payments contemplated by this _Section 3.6_ are made, no Options
will remain outstanding after the Effective Time. 



 

\- 6 - 3.7 _Company Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. The Company will terminate the
Company ESP Plan effective immediately following the termination of the
current "Offering Period" (as such term is defined in the Company ESP Plan).

"). The Company has made available to Parent a true and complete copy of each
Benefit Plan.



(b) None of the Benefit Plans is a multiemployer plan (within the meaning of
Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) or a single employer pension plan
(within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA) for which the Company or
any Subsidiary could incur liability under Section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA. None

Action is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened with

could give rise to any such Action, which action would have a Material Adverse
Effect.

thereof, ERISA, the Code, or any other applicable Legal Requirement have in

deductible in the year for which they were paid or accrued. All other amounts
that should be accrued to date as liabilities of the Company or any Subsidiary
under or with respect to each Benefit Plan (including any unpaid
administrative expenses and incurred but not reported claims) for the current
plan year of each Benefit Plan have been recorded in all material respects on
the books of the Company or such Subsidiary.



(e) There has been no "reportable event," as that term is defined in Section
4043 of ERISA and the regulations thereunder, with respect to any of the
Benefit Plans which would require the giving of notice, or any event requiring
notice to be provided, under Section 4063(a) of ERISA.



(f) To the Knowledge of the Company, there has been no violation of ERISA that
could reasonably be expected to result in a material liability with respect

any of the Employee Benefit Plans with the Secretary of Labor or the Secretary
of the Treasury or the furnishing of such notices or documents to
the participants or beneficiaries of the Employee Benefit Plans.

benefit claims). To the Knowledge of the Company, the Company has not engaged
in a nonexempt prohibited transaction described in Sections 406 of ERISA or
4975 of the Code.

Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code.



(j) Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.16_ of the Disclosure Schedule, neither
the Company nor any Subsidiary has any liability or obligation under any
Benefit Plan to provide life insurance or medical or health benefits after
termination of employment to any employee or dependent, other than as required
by Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or Section 4980B of the Code, or
applicable state law.



(k) There will be no material liability of the Company or any Subsidiary (i)
with respect to any Benefit Plan that has previously been terminated or (ii)
under any insurance policy or similar arrangement procured in connection with
any Benefit Plan in the nature of a

 



 

-19- retroactive rate adjustment, loss sharing arrangement, or other liability
arising wholly or partially out of events occurring before the Effective
Time.



(l) To the Knowledge of the Company, Persons performing services for the
Company or any Subsidiary have not been improperly classified as being
independent contractors or leased employees rather than employees except where
the failure to properly classify such Persons would not have a Material
Adverse Effect.



(m) Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.16_ of the Disclosure Schedule, none of
the Benefit Plans provides any benefits that become payable or become vested
solely as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (other than benefits payable because an employee terminates
employment covered by the Benefit Plan) and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will not require the funding (whether
formal or informal) of any Benefit Plan.



4.17 _Absence of Labor Difficulties_. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary

before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the National Labor
Relations Board or any Tribunal. There is no labor strike, dispute, slowdown
or stoppage pending or to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against or

employment with the Company or any Subsidiary during the next twelve (12)
months.



4.18 _Customers and Suppliers_. There are no material disputes with any
customer or supplier of the Company or any Subsidiary that is a Key
Customer or Supplier, and there are no material disputes with customers or
suppliers that are not Key Customers or Suppliers where the failure to resolve
any such disputes, or the results of resolution of any such disputes, would
have a Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.18_ of the
Disclosure Schedule, no party to a Material Contract that is with a customer
or supplier has terminated or, to the Knowledge of the Company, has, in
writing or by an express oral statement, threatened to terminate or advised

4.19 _Licenses and Permits_. To the Knowledge of the Company, the Company and
each Subsidiary has validly and lawfully obtained and holds in full force and

in force, specifying with respect to each such policy, the name of the
insurer, type of coverage, term of policy, deductible amount, limits of
liability and annual premium (and, if the owner of such policy is not the

officers, directors and employees of the Company or any Subsidiary shall, and
that the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and the
Subsidiaries agents and representatives (including any investment
banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or any Subsidiary) not to
initiate or solicit any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer with
respect to a merger, reorganization, share exchange, tender offer,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or similar transaction involving it or any Subsidiary to acquire
all or a substantial part of the business or properties of the Company or any
Subsidiary or 5% or more of any capital stock of the Company or any capital
stock of any Subsidiary (other than a proposal or offer made by Parent, Merger
Subsidiary or any of their Affiliates), any such inquiry, proposal or offer
being hereinafter referred to as an " _Acquisition Proposal_." The Company
further agrees that neither it nor any Subsidiary nor any of the officers,
directors and employees of it or the Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall
cause its and the Subsidiaries agents and representatives (including any
investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or any of the
Subsidiaries) not to, directly or indirectly, (i) have any discussion with or
provide any information or data to any Person relating to an Acquisition
Proposal, or (ii) engage in any negotiations concerning an Acquisition
Proposal.



(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, and prior to
the receipt of the required stockholder approval of the Merger, the Company,
any Subsidiary, the Company Board or a committee of the Company Board and
the Companys and any Subsidiarys officers, directors, employees, agents and
representatives shall be permitted (i) to engage in discussions or
negotiations with a third party who seeks, without prior solicitation (other
than solicitations occurring prior to the date of this Agreement) by the
Company, any Subsidiary or any of their directors, officers, employees, agents
or representatives, to initiate such discussions or negotiations and may
furnish such third party information concerning the Company and its business,
properties, and assets if, and only to the extent that, in response to a bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal, (A) the Company Board has determined in
good faith, after consultation with its legal and financial advisors, that
such discussions may reasonably lead to a Superior Proposal and (B) prior to
furnishing such information to, or entering into discussions with, such third
party, the Company receives from such third party an executed confidentiality
agreement containing terms customary in transactions of such nature, and the
Company notifies Parent of its intention to provide information to a third
party one (1) Business Day prior to providing such



 

\- 27 - information, and (ii) to comply with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated

propose publicly to approve or recommend an Acquisition Proposal or (iii)
cause the Company or any Subsidiary to enter into any letter of intent,
agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other similar
agreement related to any Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
in response to a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal from a
third party that the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its legal and financial advisors, is a Superior Proposal,
the Company Board may change its recommendation and may enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, but only if
the Company notifies Parent, in writing of its intention to take such action
at least two (2) Business Days prior to taking such action, specifying the
material terms of such Superior Proposal and identifying the Person making
such Superior Proposal, and if Parent does not make, within two (2) Business
Days of receipt of such written notification, an offer that the Company Board
determines, in good faith after consultation with its legal and financial
advisors, is at least as favorable to the stockholders of the Company as such
Superior Proposal, it being understood that the Company shall not change its
recommendation as a result of such Superior Proposal or enter into any binding
agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal prior to the expiration of
such two (2) Business Day period, and that the Company shall postpone or
adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting, as necessary, to accommodate the
procedures set forth in this sentence.



(c) In addition to the notification required under the final sentence of
_Section 6.3(b)_ , the Company shall notify Parent promptly after receipt by
the Company (or any of its advisors) of any inquiry relating to any potential
Acquisition Proposal and the terms of such proposal or inquiry, including the
identity of the Person and its Affiliates making the same, that it
may receive in respect of any such transaction, and shall keep Parent
informed on a current basis with respect to any significant developments with
respect to the foregoing.



(d) The Company shall, and shall cause the Subsidiaries and the officers,
directors, advisors, employees, representatives and other agents of the
Company and the Subsidiaries to, cease and cause to be terminated any and all
existing activities, discussions or negotiations with third parties conducted
prior to the date hereof with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.



(e) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition
Proposal which the Company Board determines, in good faith, after consultation
with its legal and financial advisors, and after taking into account any
conditions to and risks of consummation and the ability of the party making
such proposal to obtain financing for such Acquisition Proposal, is more
favorable to its stockholders than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.



(f) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 6.3_ to the contrary, the
parties agree that the Company Board may change its recommendation to the
extent required by its fiduciary duty as set forth in _Section 8.1_ (other
than in connection with a Superior Proposal which shall be governed by this 
_Section 6.3_ ).



 

\- 28 - 6.4 _Closing Efforts_. The Company will, and will cause its officers and
agents to, use commercially reasonable efforts to effect the Closing as soon
as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, including, but not limited
to, its efforts relating to (i) completing and filing the Proxy Statement,
(ii) responding to comments and/or requests, if any, of the SEC, and (iii)
scheduling the Company Stockholders Meeting. The Company may take such
actions as it, after due consultation with Parent, deems appropriate to
maximize certainty of the Closing, and the Company shall consult with Parent
regarding any actions that Parent wants the Company to undertake to maximize
such certainty.



ARTICLE VII



_COVENANTS OF PARENT AND THE MERGER SUBSIDIARY_



Parent covenants and agrees with the Company that, at all times before the
Closing and to the extent specified, after the Closing, Parent at its expense
will comply and will cause Merger Subsidiary or the Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be, to comply with all covenants and provisions of this _Article
VII_ , except to the extent otherwise expressly required or permitted by this
Agreement.



7.1 _Conduct of Business of Merger Subsidiary_. During the period from the
date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall
not engage in any activities of any nature except as provided in or
contemplated by this Agreement.



7.2 _Obligation of Parent to Make Merger Effective and Merger Subsidiary s
Stockholder Consent_. Parent shall cause Merger Subsidiary to take all
actions necessary on its part to carry out the transactions contemplated
hereby. Parent, as the sole stockholder of Merger Subsidiary, will consent in
writing to the approval of this Agreement and the Merger in accordance with
the DGCL. 



7.3 _Information for Proxy Statement for the Company s Stockholders_. Parent
will furnish to the Company such data and information relating to it and
Merger Subsidiary as the Company may reasonably request for the purpose of
including such data and information in the Proxy Statement and any amendments
or supplements thereto used by the Company to obtain the necessary stockholder
approval of the Merger.



7.4 _Indemnification Rights_.



(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, and the Surviving Corporation (or any successor) shall,
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the officers, directors, employees and
agents of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries against all Damages arising
out of claims brought or made by third parties, including, without limitation,
derivative claims, in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to the fullest extent permitted or required under applicable law and
shall advance expenses prior to the final disposition of such claims and
liabilities to which this sentence applies. Parent and the Surviving
Corporation agree that all rights to indemnification and advancement of
expenses and exculpation and release now existing in favor of the directors,
officers or employees of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries (including,
without limitation,



 

\- 29 - any Person who was or becomes a director, officer or employee prior to the
Effective Time) (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") under Delaware Law or as
provided in the Companys or any Subsidiarys Certificate of Incorporation,
Bylaws, resolutions or any other written agreement between them with respect
to matters occurring on or prior to the Effective Time shall survive the
Merger and shall continue in full force and effect for a period of not less
than six years after the Effective Time (or, in the case of claims or other
matters occurring on or prior to the expiration of such six year period which
have not been resolved prior to the expiration of such six year period, until
such matters are finally resolved), and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, and the Surviving Corporation shall,
honor all such rights. Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect for not
less than six years from the Effective Time the current policies of the
directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the
Company (provided that Parent may substitute therefor policies of at least
the same coverage containing terms and conditions which are no less
advantageous and provided further that in no event shall Parent be required to
pay annual premiums for such insurance in excess of 200% of the annual
premiums currently paid by the Company provided, further, that if the annual
premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent and Merger
Subsidiary shall be obligated to obtain policies with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding such amount) with respect to matters
occurring on or prior to the Effective Time.



(b) Without limiting the foregoing, in the event any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation to which the provisions of this  _Section 7.4_
are applicable is brought against any Indemnified Party (whether arising
before or after the Effective Time), (i) any counsel retained by the
Indemnified Parties for any period after the Effective Time shall be subject
to the approval of the Surviving Corporation (such approval to not be
unreasonably withheld), (ii) after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the
Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor are received and (iii)
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will use commercially
reasonable efforts to assist in the vigorous defense of any such matter,
provided that the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any
settlement of any claim effected without its written consent, which consent,
however, shall not be unreasonably withheld. Any Indemnified Party wishing to
claim indemnification under this _Section 7.4_ , upon learning of any such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall notify Parent or the
Surviving Corporation (but the failure so to notify Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have under
this _Section 7.4_  except to the extent such failure materially prejudices
the Surviving Corporation). The Surviving Corporation shall be liable for the
fees and expenses hereunder with respect to only one law firm, in addition to
local counsel in each applicable jurisdiction, to represent the Indemnified
Parties as a group with respect to each such matter unless there is, under
applicable standards of professional conduct, as determined by counsel for the
Indemnified Parties, a conflict between the positions of any two (2) or more
Indemnified Parties that would preclude or render inadvisable joint or
multiple representation of such parties.



7.5 _Employee Benefits_.



(a) Parent agrees that, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending six months thereafter, the employees of the Company and any Subsidiary
will continue to be provided with salary and benefits under employee benefit
and commission or similar plans that are no less favorable in the aggregate
than those currently provided by the



 

\- 30 - Company or any Subsidiary to such employees under the Employee Benefit Plans
listed in _Schedule 4.16(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule; provided, however,
that Parent shall not be obligated to provide any equity incentive plans to
the employees of the Company or any Subsidiary.



(b) Parent agrees to cause the Company to honor all written contracts listed
in _Schedule 7.5(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedule in accordance with their
terms, which are applicable with respect to any employee, officer, director or
executive or former employee, officer, director, or executive of the Company
or any Subsidiary. Neither this _Section 7.5_ nor any other provision of this
Agreement shall limit the ability or right of the Company and the Subsidiaries
to terminate the employment of any of their respective employees after the
Effective Time (subject to any rights of any such employees pursuant to any
binding contract, agreement, arrangement, policy, plan or commitment).



(c) For purposes of all employee benefit plans, programs and agreements
maintained by or contributed to by Parent and its subsidiaries (including,
after Closing, the Surviving Corporation), Parent shall, or shall cause its
subsidiaries to cause each such plan, program or arrangement to treat the
prior service with the Company or any Subsidiary immediately prior to the
Closing of any employee of the Company or any Subsidiary (a " _Company
Employee_ ") (to the same extent such service is recognized under analogous
plans, programs or arrangements of the Company or any Subsidiary prior to the
Effective Time) as service rendered to Parent or its subsidiaries, as the
case may be, for all purposes; provided, however, that (i) such crediting of
service shall not operate to duplicate any benefit or the funding of such
benefit under any plan or (ii) require the crediting of past service for
benefit accrual purpose under any defined benefit pension plan. Company
Employees shall also be given credit for any deductible or co-payment amounts
paid in respect of the plan year in which the Closing occurs, to the extent
that, following the Closing, they participate in any other plan for which
deductibles or co-payments are required. Parent shall also cause each Parent
Plan (as hereinafter defined below) to waive any preexisting condition which
was waived under the terms of any Employee Benefit Plan immediately prior to
the Effective Time or waiting period limitation which would otherwise be
applicable to a Company Employee on or after the Effective Time. Parent shall
recognize any accrued but unused vacation of the Company Employees as of the
Effective Time, and Parent shall cause the Company and the Subsidiaries to
provide such paid vacation. For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Parent Plan_
" shall mean such employee benefit plan, as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA,
or a nonqualified employee benefit or deferred compensation plan, stock
option, bonus or incentive plan or other employee benefit or fringe benefit
program, that may be in effect generally for employees of Company and the
Subsidiaries from time to time.



(d) Parent shall satisfy or Parent shall cause the Company to satisfy any
liability for all change in control, severance and similar obligations payable
to any Company Employee, including for any Company Employee who is terminated
by Parent or the Company, or any of their respective Subsidiaries on terms no
less favorable than those provided under the applicable Company change in
control provision or severance plan.



 

\- 31 - (e) Except as provided in this _Section 7.5_ , nothing in this Agreement shall
limit or restrict the rights of Parent or the Company to modify, amend,
terminate or establish employee benefit plans or arrangements, in whole or in
part, at any time after the Effective Time.



7.6 _Financing_. Parent and Merger Subsidiary each hereby agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to arrange and obtain the Financing on the
terms set forth in the Financing Letters. Parent and Merger Subsidiary will
duly pay any and all commitment and other fees required or contemplated by the
Financing Letters, or that otherwise arise in connection with the Notes
Financing, that become due after the date hereof and prior to the Effective
Time. Parent and Merger Subsidiary will keep the Company informed on a
reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the status of their efforts
to arrange the Financing and shall not permit any material adverse amendment
or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under,
the Senior Financing Commitment Letter without the prior written consent of
the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. In the event
that Parent and Merger Subsidiary are unable to obtain the Financing on the
terms set forth in the Financing Letters, Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain alternative financing with
overall pricing, amortization, cost and maturity terms that are no less
favorable, and other terms that are no less favorable in any material respect,
to Parent and Merger Subsidiary than those contained in the
Financing Letters. The Company hereby agrees to use commercially reasonable
efforts to assist and cooperate with Parent and Merger Subsidiary in their
efforts to arrange and obtain the Financing.



7.7 _No Amendment to Principal Stockholder Agreement_. Each of Parent and
Merger Subsidiary agrees not to amend, restate, modify, consent to or waive
any provision of the Principal Stockholder Agreement in any material respect
without the prior written consent of the Company.



7.8 _Closing Efforts_. Parent and Merger Subsidiary will, and will cause their
respective officers and agents to, use commercially reasonable efforts to
effect the Closing as soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof,
including, but not limited to, its efforts relating to (i) reviewing and
commenting upon the Proxy Statement, and (ii) responding to comments and/or
requests, if any, of the SEC. Parent shall consult with the Company regarding
any actions that the Company deems appropriate to maximize certainty of the
Closing.



ARTICLE VIII



_COVENANTS OF ALL PARTIES_



8.1 _Stockholder Approval; Preparation of Company Proxy Statement_.



(a) The Company shall, as promptly as practicable following the date hereof,
prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement. The Company, acting
through the Company Board shall, subject to its fiduciary duties under
applicable Legal Requirements, include in the Proxy Statement, the
recommendation of the Company Board that the stockholders of the Company
approve the Merger and adopt this Agreement. No filing of, or amendment or
supplement to, or correspondence to the SEC will be made by the Company
without providing Parent with an opportunity to review and comment thereon.
The Company will advise Parent,



 

\- 32 - promptly after it receives notice thereof, of any request by the SEC for the
amendment of the Proxy Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or
requests by the SEC for additional information. If at any time prior to the
Company Stockholders Meeting any information relating to the Company or
Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should
be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that it would not include
any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed
with the SEC and, to the extent required by law, disseminated to the
stockholders of the Company.



(b) The Company shall, as promptly as practicable following the execution of
this Agreement, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
stockholders for the purpose of adopting the Merger Agreement and approving
the Merger (the " _Company Stockholders  Meeting_"). The Company shall (i)
use its best efforts to solicit from stockholders of the Company proxies in
favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of the Merger for the
Company Stockholders Meeting and (ii) recommend to its stockholders the
adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of the Merger; provided,
however, that nothing contained in this _Section 8.1_ shall prevent the
Company Board from discharging its fiduciary duties.



(c) The parties acknowledge that it is intended that the meeting of the
shareholders of the Principal Stockholder to be called as provided in the
Principal Stockholder Agreement (the " _Principal Stockholder s Shareholder
Meeting_") will be held immediately before the Company Stockholders Meeting.
Consequently, the Company agrees to schedule the Company Stockholders
Meeting on the same day as, and no later than three (3) hours after the time
at which the Principal Stockholders Shareholder Meeting is scheduled to
commence, unless Parent and the Company mutually agree not to hold
the Company Stockholders Meeting at that time. In the event the Principal
Stockholders Shareholder Meeting is at any time or from time to time
rescheduled, or commenced and adjourned, or has not concluded as of the time
at which the Company Stockholders Meeting is scheduled to commence, or in
the event the Company needs to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders
Meeting in accordance with _Section 6.3(b)_ , the Company shall promptly take
all such action as may be necessary and permitted by the Companys Bylaws and
applicable law to reschedule (or, if appropriate, to commence and adjourn) the
Company Stockholders Meeting so that the Company Stockholders Meeting will
commence immediately following the Principal Stockholders Shareholder
Meeting.



8.2 _HSR Act Filings; Reasonable Efforts_.



(a) Each of Parent and the Company shall (i) promptly make the filings
required of such party and use reasonable commercial efforts to cause any of
its Affiliates to make such filings under the HSR Act and any other Antitrust
Laws with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (ii) comply at the earliest practicable date with any request
under the HSR Act or such other Antitrust Laws for additional information,
documents, or other material received by such party or any of its Affiliates
from the Federal



 

\- 33 - Trade Commission or the Department of Justice or any other Tribunal in respect
of such filings, the Merger or such other transactions and (iii) cooperate
with the other party in connection with any such filing and in connection with
resolving any investigation or other inquiry of any such agency or other
Tribunal under any Antitrust Laws with respect to any such filing, the Merger
or such other transactions. Each party shall promptly inform the other party
of any communication with, and any proposed understanding, undertaking, or
agreement with, any Tribunal regarding any such filings, the Merger or such
other transactions. Neither party shall participate in any meeting with any
Tribunal in respect of any such filings, investigation, or other inquiry
without giving the other party notice of the meeting and, to the extent
permitted by such Tribunal, the opportunity to attend and participate.



(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall use all reasonable efforts to resolve
such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Tribunal with respect to
the Merger or any other transactions provided for in this Agreement under the
HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal
Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other federal, state or foreign
statutes, rules, regulations, orders or decrees that are designed
to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of
monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively, " _Antitrust Laws_ "). In
connection therewith, if any administrative or judicial action or proceeding
is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging the Merger or any
other transactions provided for in this Agreement as violative of any
Antitrust Law, and, if by mutual agreement, Parent and the Company decide that
litigation is in their best interests, each of Parent and the Company shall
cooperate and use all reasonable efforts vigorously to contest and resist any
such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed, or overturned
any Order that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents, or restricts
consummation of the Merger or any such other transactions. Each of Parent and
the Company shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to take such action
as may be required to cause the expiration of the notice periods under the
HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws with respect to the Merger and such other
transactions as promptly as possible after the execution of this Agreement.



(c) Each of the parties agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and
to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under Legal Requirements applicable to such party and
otherwise to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including (i) the obtaining of all other necessary actions or non-
actions, extensions, waivers, Permits, Consents from Persons, including third
parties (provided that the Company shall not make any payments or make any
other concessions or amend or waive the provisions of any Material Contract to
obtain a Consent) and the making of all other necessary registrations, notices
and filings (including other filings with governmental entities, if any),
(ii) the preparation of the Proxy Statement, and (iii) the execution and
delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by, and to fully carryout the purposes of, this
Agreement.



(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 8.2_ , in
connection with any action requested by any Tribunal applying the Antitrust
Laws, (i) neither Parent nor any of its subsidiaries or Affiliates shall be
required to divest any of their respective businesses, product lines or
assets, (ii) neither Parent nor any of its subsidiaries or Affiliates shall be
required



 

\- 34 - to take or agree to take any other action or agree to any limitation that
could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Parent, its
subsidiaries or Affiliates, (iii) neither the Company nor any Subsidiary shall
be required to divest any of their respective businesses, product lines or
assets, or to take or agree to take any other action or agree to any
limitation that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
and (iv) none of Parent, Merger Subsidiary or the Company shall be required to
waive any of the conditions to the Merger.



8.3 _Notifications_.



(a) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent or Merger
Subsidiary shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (i) any representation
or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect or (ii) the failure by it to comply with
or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement; provided, however, that
no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the
parties under this Agreement.



(b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent or Merger
Subsidiary shall give prompt notice to the Company, of: 



(i) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Merger or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;



(ii) any notice or other communication relating to an investigation or
restraint from any Tribunal in connection with the Merger or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; and



(iii) any Actions commenced or, to the best of its Knowledge threatened
against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting the Company or any
Subsidiary, on the one hand, and Parent or Merger Subsidiary, on the other
hand, which, if pending on the date of this Agreement would have been
required to have been disclosed pursuant to _Article IV_ or _Article V_ , as
the case may be, or which relate to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. 



8.4 _Confidentiality_. Each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary will hold, and
will cause its representatives to hold, any Information (as defined in the
Non-Disclosure Agreement entered into between the Company and Parent prior to
the date hereof, as amended from time to time) in confidence to the extent
specified under the terms of the Non-Disclosure Agreement.

definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal (provided that the
Company has complied with _Section 6.3)_.



(e) _Automatically_. By no action on the part of the parties if the Principal
Stockholder Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms.



10.2 _Effect of Termination_.



 

(a) In the event of a termination of this Agreement as provided in _Section
10.1_ , this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there shall be no
liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Merger Subsidiary or the
Company or their respective officers or directors, except with respect to
_Section 8.4_ , this _Section 10.2_ and _Article XI_ ; provided, however,
that nothing herein shall relieve any party for liability for any breach
hereof occurring prior to such termination.



(b) In the event Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to
clause (iii) of _Section 10.1(b)_ , and Parent and Merger Subsidiary are not
in material breach at such time of their respective representations,
warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement, the
Company shall pay Parents and Merger Subsidiarys fees and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) actually incurred with
Persons who are not Affiliates of Parent in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (" _Parent Expenses_ ") as liquidated damages.
The Parent Expenses shall be paid in cash by the Company not later than two
(2) Business Days after presentation to the Company of invoices or other
evidence of Parent Expenses reasonably acceptable to the Company; provided,
however, that in no event shall the Company be obligated to reimburse Parent
Expenses in excess of $4 million (the " _Parent Expense Cap_ ").



(c) In the event Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to
clause (iii) of _Section 10.1(b),_ and either (A) no change in recommendation
or approval by the Company Board occurred before the Principal Stockholders
Shareholder Meeting or the Company Stockholders Meeting, but an Acquisition
Proposal was received by the Company after the date of this Agreement and was
not withdrawn before the Principal Stockholders Shareholder Meeting or the
Company Stockholders Meeting, or (B) a change in recommendation or approval
by the Company Board occurred before the Principal Stockholders Shareholder
Meeting or the Company Stockholders Meeting, and, in all cases, Parent and
Merger Subsidiary at the time of termination are not in material breach of
their respective representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements
contained in this Agreement, and within two hundred twenty-five days of such
termination, either (i) a Change of Control Transaction is consummated, (ii) a
Change of Control Transaction is approved by the Company Board or a
special committee thereof, or approved by the Companys stockholders, (iii)
the Company enters into an agreement with respect to a Change of Control
Transaction, or (iv) a tender offer or exchange offer for outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock is or was previously commenced, and the Company Board
or a special committee thereof (A) recommends that the stockholders of the
Company tender their shares in such tender offer or exchange offer or



 

\- 39 - (B) within ten (10) Business Days after the commencement of such tender offer
or exchange offer, the Company Board fails to recommend rejection of such
offer, then the Company shall pay Parent the Alternate Transaction Fee (as
defined below) calculated in accordance with this _Section 10.2(c)_ upon
consummation of the Change in Control Transaction. The fee shall be the
amount which is equal to fifty percent (50%) of the amount, if any, by which
the aggregate consideration, including the fair market value of any non-cash
consideration valued as of the date on which such Change of Control
Transaction is consummated (the " _Alternate Transaction Closing Date_ "),
that is received by holders of the capital stock of the Company with respect
to the shares of the capital stock of the Company upon consummation of
such Change of Control Transaction exceeds the sum of (x) the aggregate
Merger Consideration that holders of the capital stock of the Company would
have received with respect to the shares of the capital stock of the Company
if the Merger had been consummated in accordance with terms of this Agreement
as in effect on the date this Agreement is terminated and (y) the aggregate
amount that would have been paid to holders of Options pursuant to _Section
3.6_ if the Merger had been consummated on the date of such termination (the
result of such calculation, the " _Total Consideration_ "); provided, however,
that in no event shall such fee exceed an amount equal to three and one-half
percent of the Total Consideration less the actual amount paid or to be paid
by the Company to Parent as Parent Expenses (the fee as so calculated, the "
_Alternate Transaction Fee_ "). The Alternate Transaction Fee shall be paid to
Parent no later than two (2) Business Days after the Alternate Transaction
Closing Date by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account
as Parent may designate. For purposes hereof, (i) the " _fair market value_ "
of any publicly traded securities as of any date shall be the closing price
or the last sale price, or, in case no such sale takes place on such date, the
average of the closing bid and asked prices, in either case as reported in the
principal consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to the
principal national securities exchange on which such securities are listed or
admitted to trading or, if such securities are not listed or admitted to
trading on any national securities exchange, the last quoted price or, if not
so quoted, the average of the high bid and low asked prices in the over-the-
counter market, as reported by the National Association of Securities Dealers,
Inc. Automated Quotation System or such other system then in use, and
the "fair market value" of any other non-cash consideration shall be
determined in good faith by the Company Board, which determination shall be
subject to the consent of Parent which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, and in the absence of such determination, shall be determined in
good faith by Parent, and (ii) a " _Change of Control Transaction_ " shall
mean any merger, reorganization, share exchange, tender offer, consolidation,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving the Company in which holders of the Company Common Stock
are to receive cash or non-cash consideration for Company Common Stock (either
directly, such as in a tender offer or merger, or indirectly, such as in a
distribution or payment in liquidation following a sale of assets by the
Company), other than a reorganization in which there is no material change in
the ownership of the Company (e.g., a reincorporation to change the Companys
state of incorporation). The Company shall, upon the request of Parent,
execute and deliver all such further documents and instruments, and take all
such further action, as may be deemed by Parent to be necessary or desirable
to carry out this _Section 10.2(c)_.



(d) In the event Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to clause (ii),
clause (iii) or clause (iv) of _Section 10.1(c)_ prior to the Company
Stockholders Meeting or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to
clause (ii) or clause (iii) of _Section 10.1(d)_ , and



 

\- 40 - Parent and Merger Subsidiary are not in material breach at such time of their
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this
Agreement, the Company shall pay Parent $8,880,000 (the " _Break-Up Fee_ ") in
cash as liquidated damages for such termination not later than two (2)
Business Days after termination.



(e) In the event that (i) an SSI Superior Proposal (as defined in the
Principal Stockholder Agreement) could also reasonably be construed as a
Superior Proposal and (ii) either (A) the board of directors of the Principal
Stockholder or any committee thereof has withdrawn its approval or
recommendation of the SSI Shareholder Proposal (as defined in the Principal
Stockholder Agreement) at any time before the Principal Stockholders
Shareholder Meeting or the Principal Stockholder enters into a definitive
agreement with respect to an SSI Superior Proposal or (B) the Company has
approved or recommended a Superior Proposal prior to the Company Stockholders
Meeting or the Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to a
Superior Proposal and (iii) the Principal Stockholder Agreement or this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to (x) clause (iii) of Section 5.1(c) or
clauses (ii) or (iv) of Section 5.1(d) of the Principal Stockholder Agreement
or (y) clauses (iii) or (iv) of _Section 10.1(c)_ or clauses (ii) or (iii) of
_Section 10.1(d)_ of the Merger Agreement and (iv) Parent and Merger
Subsidiary are not in material breach at such time of any of their respective
representations and warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in
the Principal Stockholder Agreement and this Agreement, Parent shall receive
in cash as liquidated damages (A) the Break-up Fee from the Company not later
than two (2) Business Days after such termination by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to such account as Parent may designate and
(B) if the SSI Alternate Transaction Fee (as defined in the Principal
Stockholder Agreement) is greater than the Break-Up Fee, the difference
between the SSI Alternate Transaction Fee and the Break-Up Fee from the
Principal Stockholder not later than two (2) Business Days after the SSI
Alternation Transaction Date (as defined in the Principal Stockholder
Agreement) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account as
Parent may designate. For reason of avoidance of any doubt, the parties agree
that an SSI Superior Proposal could not be reasonably construed as a Superior
Proposal if the SSI Superior Proposal relates to an acquisition of
the capital stock of the Principal Stockholder or the acquisition of shares
of Company Common Stock from only the Principal Stockholder.



(f) In no event shall Parent be entitled to receive from the Company both the
Alternate Transaction Fee and the Break-Up Fee, multiple Break-Up Fees or
Parent Expenses if a Break-Up Fee is payable. In no event shall the amount
payable by the Company in respect of the Alternate Transaction Fee and Parent
Expenses exceed the amount of the Break-Up Fee.



10.3 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended, supplemented or modified by
the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards
of Directors, at any time before or after obtaining the approval of the
Companys stockholders (if required by law), but, after any such approval,
no amendment, supplement or modification shall be made which by law requires
further approval by such stockholders without obtaining such further approval.
This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the parties hereto.



10.4 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of
Directors, may, to the extent legally



 

\- 41 - allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto, (c) waive compliance with any of the covenants or agreements
contained herein or (d) waive any condition to such partys obligations
hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension
or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on
behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any
of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver
of those rights.



10.5 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided to the
contrary in this Agreement, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with
the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether
or not the Merger is consummated.

11.3 _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall
inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors, heirs,
executors, administrators, legal representatives and permitted assigns,
provided that neither this Agreement nor any rights or obligations hereunder
may be assigned without the written consent of the other parties except that,
without the written consent of the Company, (i) Parent may assign any or all
of its rights hereunder to any Affiliate of Parent or to any other Person
that is a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Platinum Equity, LLC
or of Platinum Equity Capital Partners, L.P., a private equity fund of which
an Affiliate of Platinum Equity, LLC is the general partner, (ii)

Person (other than the parties hereto, any permitted assignee, holders of

under or by reason of this Agreement, and no Person (other than as so
specified) shall be deemed a third party beneficiary under or by reason of
this Agreement. 



11.4 _Specific Performance_. All remedies, either under this Agreement or by
law or otherwise afforded to any party hereto, shall be cumulative and not
alternative. Each party



 

\- 43 - hereto acknowledges and agrees that any breach of the agreements and covenants
contained in this Agreement would cause irreparable injury to the other
parties hereto for which such parties would have no adequate remedy at law. In
addition to any other remedy to which any party hereto may be entitled, each
of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that, in the event of any
breach of this Agreement, each non-breaching party would be irreparably and
immediately harmed and could not be made whole by monetary damages. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties hereto (i) will waive, in any action for
specific performance, the defense of adequacy of a remedy at law and (ii)
will be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they may be
entitled at law or in equity, to compel specific performance of this
Agreement.



11.5 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or the application of
any such provision to any Person or circumstance, shall be declared judicially
to be invalid, unenforceable or void, such decision shall not have the effect
of invalidating or voiding the remainder of this Agreement, it being
the intent and agreement of the parties that this Agreement shall be deemed
amended by modifying such provision to the extent necessary to render it
valid, legal and enforceable while preserving its intent or, if such
modification is not possible, by substituting therefor another provision that
is valid, legal and enforceable and that achieves the same objective.



11.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the exhibits and schedules
including, without limitation, the Disclosure Schedule hereto) and
the documents and instruments executed and delivered in connection herewith
constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof and supersede all prior and contemporaneous agreements and
understandings, whether written or oral, among the parties or any of them
with respect to the subject matter hereof, and there are no representations,
understandings or agreements relating to the subject matter hereof that are
not fully expressed in this Agreement and the documents and instruments
executed and delivered in connection herewith. All exhibits and schedules
attached to this Agreement are expressly made a part of, and incorporated by
reference into, this Agreement.



11.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with,
and the rights of the parties shall be governed by, the substantive laws of
the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice-of-law rules that
may require the application of the laws of another jurisdiction.



11.8 _Certain Construction Rules_. The article and section headings and the
table of contents contained in this Agreement are for convenience of reference
only and shall in no way define, limit, extend or describe the scope or intent
of any provisions of this Agreement. Whenever the context may require, any
pronoun used in this Agreement shall include the corresponding masculine,
feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form of nouns, pronouns and verbs
shall include the plural and vice versa. In addition, as used in this
Agreement, unless otherwise provided to the contrary, (a) all references to
days, months or years shall be deemed references to calendar days, months or
years and (b) any reference to a "Section," "Article," "Exhibit" or "Schedule"
shall be deemed to refer to a section or article of this Agreement or an
exhibit or schedule attached to this Agreement. The words "hereof," "herein,"
and "hereunder" and words of similar import referring to this Agreement refer
to this Agreement as a whole and



 

\- 44 - not to any particular provision of this Agreement. Unless otherwise
specifically provided for herein, the term "or" shall not be deemed to be
exclusive.



11.9  _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Pre-Effective Time
Covenants_. The respective representations, warranties and pre-Effective Time
covenants of Parent, the Company and Merger Subsidiary contained herein shall
expire and be terminated on the Effective Time, unless otherwise specifically
herein provided.



11.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which taken together
shall constitute one instrument binding on all the parties, notwithstanding
that all the parties are not signatories to the original or the same
counterpart. The signatures of the parties to this Agreement may be delivered
