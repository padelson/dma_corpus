certifications are complete and correct; the Company maintains
&#147;disclosure controls and procedures&#148; (as defined in

4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I><U>Organization</U>.</I>
Parent is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware. Parent is
duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation or
organization to do business, and is in good standing, in each
jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, leased
or operated by it or the nature of its business makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except for such failures
to be so qualified or licensed and in good standing that would
not reasonably be likely to prevent or materially delay
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (a
&#147;<U>Parent Material Adverse Effect</U>&#148;).

consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been
duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of
Parent and Sub. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by Parent and Sub and, assuming this Agreement
constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the other
parties hereto, constitutes a valid and binding obligation,
enforceable against them in accordance with its terms, except to
the extent that enforcement of the rights and remedies created
thereby is subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium and other similar laws of general application
affecting the rights and remedies of creditors and to general
principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

Proposal and identify the person making such Superior Proposal,

informed on a reasonably prompt basis of the status and details

Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and, in the case of an
action described in clause&nbsp;(iii) of the definition of

notified the Parent in writing of the determination that such
Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and

such Superior Proposal remains a Superior Proposal; and

determines in good faith, after consulting with outside counsel,
that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely

fiduciary duties to the Company stockholders under applicable
Law, take any of the actions described in clause&nbsp;(i) of the

of Directors remains prepared to make the determination

adjustments proposed by Parent to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions

recommendation or proposed recommendation of any Superior
Proposal shall not change the approval of the Company Board of

Company shall not be entitled to enter into an agreement with
respect to a Superior Proposal unless and until this Agreement

pursuant to Section&nbsp;8.2 of this Agreement.

hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of
motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action
or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (a)&nbsp;any claim
that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the

agrees that, in addition to other remedies, any other party
shall be entitled to an injunction (without posting a bond or
other undertaking) restraining any violation or threatened
violation of the provisions of this Agreement. In the event that
any action shall be brought in equity to enforce the provisions
of the Agreement, no party shall allege, and each party hereby
waives the defense, that there is an adequate remedy at law.
