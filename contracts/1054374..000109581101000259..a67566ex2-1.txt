defined herein have the meanings set forth in Article 11.

                                    RECITALS

         A. The Company wishes to sell to Broadcom, and Broadcom wishes to
purchase from the Company, substantially all of the assets of the Company that
are used in connection with the Company's business (the "Asset Acquisition") in
consideration of the purchase price described herein, including Broadcom's
assumption of certain liabilities and obligations of the Company described
herein.

         B. In connection with and as a condition to the Asset Acquisition,
Broadcom desires to purchase from the Selling Shareholders, and the Selling
Shareholders desire to sell to Broadcom, the Ordinary Shares owned by the

subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement (the "Equity Purchase"
and, together with the Asset Acquisition, the "Transactions").

         C. The board of directors of each of Broadcom and the Company believe
it is in the best interests of Broadcom and the Company (as applicable) and
their respective shareholders to consummate the Transactions and, in furtherance
thereof, have approved the Transactions, this Agreement and all of the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

         D. Pursuant to the Asset Acquisition, among other things, and subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Company Options and Company
Special Warrants then outstanding (whether vested or unvested) will become
exercisable for shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of
Broadcom ("Broadcom Common Stock"), on the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth herein.

         E. As a condition and an inducement to the willingness of Broadcom to
enter into this Agreement, certain shareholders of the Company have concurrently
herewith entered into (i) Support Agreements with Broadcom in substantially the
form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Support Agreements") pursuant to which,
among other things, such shareholders have agreed to vote the Ordinary Shares
owned by them in favor of the Asset Acquisition and (ii) Company Affiliate
Agreements in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (the "Company

be placed in escrow by Broadcom, the release of which amount shall be contingent
upon certain events and conditions, all as set forth in Article 8 herein.

         H. The shares of Broadcom Common Stock to be issued to the Selling
Shareholders (less the amount placed in escrow) shall upon the terms of, and
subject to the conditions in, this Agreement be delivered to the Selling
Shareholders.

         I. Broadcom shall issue the remainder of the shares of Broadcom Common
Stock to a trust (the "Trust") for the benefit of the Company's shareholders in
exchange for such shareholders' interests in the assets being sold to Broadcom
pursuant to this Agreement. This trust shall be established pursuant to the Tax
Ruling for the benefit of the Company's shareholders to facilitate the deferred
taxable gain by the Company's shareholders and to provide a source for payment
of the transaction taxes.

         J. The distribution by the Trust to the shareholders of such shares of
Broadcom Common Stock, when made, shall be made on a pro-rata basis
corresponding to such shareholder's equity interest in the Company as of the
Closing.

         K. The Company intends to commence liquidation proceedings immediately
following the Transactions and the delivery of the shares of Broadcom Common
Stock to the Trust.

         L. Each of the Company, the Selling Shareholders and Broadcom desire to
make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection
with the Transactions.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants, premises,
representations and warranties set forth herein, and for other good and valuable
consideration (the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged by
the parties), intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as
follows:

<PAGE>   13

                  (b) Immediately after and conditional upon the Equity

the Company, free and clear of all Liens, except for (A) Liens related to the
Assumed Liabilities (as defined below), (B) Liens for taxes not yet due and

involving such assets and (ii) assume and be responsible for all of the
obligations and liabilities of the Company arising on or prior to the Closing,
other than those obligations and liabilities listed on Schedule 1.1(b) (the
"Assumed Liabilities"), whether such liabilities are direct or indirect, matured
or unmatured, fixed or contingent or otherwise. In no event shall any Taxes
arising from the transactions contemplated hereby or any Taxes with respect to
periods (or portions of periods) through and including the Closing Date be an
assumed liability.

         1.2 Broadcom Assignment. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, and for all purposes of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, the Company, the Selling Shareholders and Broadcom each
agree that Broadcom shall be entitled to assign its rights to purchase the

         1.3 Assumption of Liabilities. On the Closing Date, Broadcom shall
assume the Assumed Liabilities. OTHER THAN THE ASSUMED LIABILITIES, NEITHER
BROADCOM NOR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES WILL ASSUME OR OTHERWISE BE RESPONSIBLE FOR

DIRECTORS, TRUSTEES, REPRESENTATIVES, SUBSIDIARIES, SHAREHOLDERS OR THEIR
AFFILIATES).

         1.4 Closing. Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to
Section 9.1, the closing of the Transactions (the "Closing") is expected to take
place on or about December 22, 2000 and will take place as promptly as
practicable, but no later than five Business Days following satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 7, at the offices of Brobeck,
Phleger & Harrison LLP, 550 South Hope Street, Los Angeles, California, unless

Broadcom Common Stock and, on the order of the Shareholder Agent, to the Trust
for the benefit of the Company's shareholders, an aggregate of 1,415,106 shares

                                      -3-
<PAGE>   14

Company ("DTC") as requested in writing prior to Closing by the Company. The
44,869 shares of Broadcom Common Stock which will be issued to Broadcom as a
shareholder of Vector shall not be delivered to the Trust or be placed in
Escrow. At the Closing, Broadcom shall also transfer to the Company by means of
a wire transfer, an amount equal to the total amount due to the Israeli Value
Added Tax Authorities, in respect of the Asset Acquisition.

         1.6 All Transactions Simultaneous. Except for the Equity Purchase as
described in Section 1.1(a), which shall be deemed to occur immediately prior to
all other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, no document or
transaction described in Article 1 shall be deemed to have been finally executed
or delivered until all transactions, payments and documents contemplated
hereunder are completed, and all such transactions, other than the Equity
Purchase described in Section 1.1(a) shall be deemed to be part of a single
integrated transaction.

         1.7 Maximum Number of Shares of Broadcom Common Stock to be Issued. The
maximum number of shares of Broadcom Common Stock to be issued in connection
with the Transactions, including the shares of Broadcom Common Stock to be
reserved for issuance upon exercise of any of the vested or unvested Company
Options or any unexercised Company Special Warrants to be assumed by Broadcom as
provided herein shall not exceed the Aggregate Share Number. No adjustment shall
be made in the number of shares of Broadcom Common Stock issued in the
Transactions as a result of any consideration (in any form whatsoever) received
by the Company from the date hereof to the Closing Date as a result of any
exercise, conversion or exchange of Company Options or Company Special Warrants.
On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing, by
virtue of the consummation of the Transactions and without any action on the
part of Broadcom, the Company or the holder of any Ordinary Shares or Company
Options or Company Special Warrants, the following shall occur:

                  (a) Company Options. All unexpired and unexercised Company
Options and Special Warrants, then outstanding, whether vested or unvested,
shall be assumed by Broadcom in accordance with the provisions set forth below.

                           (i) Each unexpired and unexercised Company Option and
         Company Special Warrant then outstanding, whether vested or unvested,
         shall be, in connection with the Asset Acquisition, assumed by
         Broadcom. Each Company Option and Company Special Warrant so assumed by
         Broadcom under this Agreement shall continue to have, and be subject
         to, the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such Company
         Option or Company Special Warrant immediately prior to the Closing
         (including any repurchase rights or vesting provisions), provided that
         (A) such Company Option or Company Special Warrant, as the case may be,
         shall be exercisable for that number of whole shares of Broadcom Common
         Stock equal to the number of Ordinary Shares that were issuable upon
         exercise of such Company Option or Company Special Warrant immediately
         prior to the Closing multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (rounded down to
         the nearest whole number of shares of Broadcom Common Stock) and (B)
         the per share exercise price for the shares of Broadcom Common Stock
         issuable upon exercise of such assumed Company Option or Company
         Special Warrant, as the case may be, shall be equal to the quotient
         determined by dividing the exercise price per Ordinary Share at


                                      -4-
<PAGE>   15

         which such Company Option or Company Special Warrant was exercisable
         immediately prior to the Closing by the Exchange Ratio (rounded up to
         the nearest whole cent).

                           (ii) The Company agrees to take all actions necessary
         or advisable to cause all unexercised Company Options and Company
         Special Warrants to remain unchanged except (A) for the conversion into
         options or warrants to purchase shares of Broadcom Common Stock as
         provided for in this Section 1.7(a) and (B) that any acceleration of
         vesting, continuation of vesting after termination of employment or
         other special vesting (whether with the passage of time, upon the
         occurrence of certain events or otherwise) that might occur, result
         from or be related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
         and the other agreements which are attached (or forms of which are
         attached) as exhibits hereto (the "Ancillary Agreements") has been
         prevented from occurring through the modification, in a manner
         reasonably acceptable to Broadcom, of the applicable Company Option or
         Company Special Warrant (and any employment agreement or other
         agreement providing for such acceleration) prior to the date of this
         Agreement.

         1.8 Reservation of Shares. Broadcom will reserve sufficient shares of
Broadcom Common Stock for issuance pursuant to Section 1.7(a).

         1.9 Adjustments to Exchange Ratio. The Exchange Ratio shall be
equitably adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse
split, stock combination, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution
of securities convertible into Broadcom Common Stock or Company Ordinary
Shares), reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization or other like change
with respect to Broadcom Common Stock or Company Ordinary Shares the effective
date of which occurs after the date hereof and prior to the Closing Date.

         1.10 Exemption From Registration; California Permit. Broadcom and the
Company intend that the shares of Broadcom Common Stock to be issued pursuant to
this Article 1 in connection with the Transactions will be issued in a
transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC thereunder (the
"Securities Act"), by reason of Section 3(a)(10) thereof or, pursuant to Section
5.1(c), by reason of Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. The effect of such
issuance is that (i) shares of Broadcom Common Stock issued to persons who are
not affiliates of Broadcom or the Company are not subject to restrictions on
resale arising under U.S. Securities laws and (ii) shares Broadcom Common Stock
issued to persons who are affiliates of Broadcom or the Company may be resold
pursuant to Rule 145. Subject to Section 6.1(c), Broadcom and the Company intend
that the shares of Broadcom Common Stock to be issued pursuant to this Article 1
in connection with the Transactions will be qualified under the California Code,
pursuant to Section 25121 thereof, after a fairness hearing has been held
pursuant to the authority granted by Section 25142 of such law (the "Fairness
Hearing"), and (if deemed necessary by Broadcom in its good faith judgment) such
Fairness Hearing shall also address the assumption by Broadcom of all
unexercised Company Options and Company Special Warrants pursuant to Section
1.7. Each of Broadcom and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts
(i) to file promptly within ten Business Days after the execution and delivery
of this Agreement, an application for issuance of a permit pursuant to Section
25121 of the California Code to issue such securities and (if deemed necessary
by Broadcom in its good faith judgment) to assume


                                      -5-
<PAGE>   16

such Company Options and Company Special Warrants required by this Agreement to
be assumed by Broadcom (the "California Permit") and (ii) to obtain the
California Permit as promptly as practicable thereafter.

         1.11 Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action. If, at any time after
the Closing Date, any such further action is necessary or desirable to carry out
the purposes of this Agreement or to vest Broadcom or its asignees with full
right, title and possession to all assets, properties, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company, or to effect the assignment to Broadcom or
its asignees of any and all Company Intellectual Property created by a founder,
employee or consultant of the Company (including Intellectual Property created
by any of the Company's founders prior to the creation of the Company), or to
complete and prosecute all domestic and foreign patent filings related to such
Company Intellectual Property, the officers and directors of Broadcom are fully
authorized to take, and will take, all such lawful and necessary action.

         1.12 Shares Subject to Repurchase. Forty percent of the shares of
Broadcom Common Stock to be received by each of Amir Morad, Leonid Yavits and
Brian Lemelman (each, a "Founder") in the anticipated distribution of the shares
issued pursuant to this Agreement shall be subject to repurchase by Broadcom
pursuant to a stock repurchase agreement in substantially the form set forth in
Exhibit D hereto (each, a "Stock Repurchase Agreement") entered into between the
Company and each of the Founders.

                                   ARTICLE 2
                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

         The Company hereby represents and warrants to Broadcom, subject to such
exceptions as are specifically disclosed with respect to specific numbered and
lettered sections and subsections of this Article 2 in the disclosure schedule
and schedule of exceptions (the "Company Disclosure Schedule") delivered
herewith and dated as of the date hereof, and numbered with corresponding
numbered and lettered sections and subsections, as follows:

         2.1 Organization and Qualification. The Company is a company duly
organized and validly existing under the laws of the State of Israel, and has
full corporate power and authority to conduct its business as now conducted and
as currently proposed to be conducted and to own, use, license and lease its
Assets and Properties. The Company is duly qualified, licensed or admitted to do
business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction
in which the ownership, use, licensing or leasing of its Assets and Properties,
or the conduct or nature of its business, makes such qualification, licensing or
admission necessary, except for such failures to be so duly qualified, licensed
or admitted and in good standing that could not reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the Business or Condition of the Company. Section 2.1
of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth each jurisdiction where the
Company is so qualified, licensed or admitted to do business and separately
lists each other jurisdiction in which the Company owns, uses, licenses or
leases its Assets and Properties, or conducts business or has employees or
engages independent contractors.

         2.2 Authority Relative to this Agreement. Subject only to the requisite
approval of the Asset Acquisition and this Agreement by the shareholders of the
Company, the Company has


                                      -6-
<PAGE>   17

full corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements to which the Company is a party, to perform its obligations
hereunder and thereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby. The Company's board of directors has approved this Agreement and
declared its advisability. The execution and delivery by the Company of this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which the Company is a party and the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
and the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder and thereunder,
have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary action by the board of
directors of the Company, and no other action on the part of the board of
directors of the Company is required to authorize the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which the Company
is a party and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby. This Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which the

obtained a valid and enforceable assignment sufficient to irrevocably transfer
all rights in such Intellectual Property (including the right to seek past and
future damages with respect to such Intellectual Property) to the Company and,

ownership rights in and to such Intellectual Property in accordance with
applicable Laws, the Company has recorded each such assignment of Registered
Intellectual Property with the relevant Governmental or Regulatory Authority,

Company has, and enforces, a policy requiring each employee, consultant and
independent contractor to execute proprietary information, confidentiality and
invention and copyright assignment agreements substantially in the form set
forth in Section 2.17(l) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (such agreements
providing, among other things, the "work for hire" doctrine) and all current and
former employees, consultants and independent contractors of the Company have
executed such an agreement and copies of all such agreements have been provided
to Broadcom or made available to Broadcom for review, and (ii) none of the
agreements to which the Company is a party substantially in the form of the
"Confidentiality Agreement" attached as Exhibit 1 to the Company Disclosure
Schedule supersedes, amends or otherwise modifies any other agreement that (a)
is more comprehensive with respect to the terms dealing with the Company's
disclosure of any confidential information and/or trade secrets to any
third-party and/or (b) is more restrictive on a third-party's use or disclosure
of such information and/or trade secrets.

         (m) No Company Intellectual Property or product, technology or service
of the Company is subject to any Order, Action or Proceeding or "march in"

<PAGE>   31

Intellectual Property by the Company or that may affect the validity, use or
enforceability of such Company Intellectual Property.

         (n) No (i) product, technology, service or publication of the Company,
(ii) material published or distributed by the Company or (iii) conduct or
statement of Company constitutes obscene material, a defamatory statement or
material, false advertising or otherwise violates any Law.

         (o) The Company has taken all actions necessary and appropriate to
assure that there shall be no material adverse change to its business or
electronic systems or material interruptions in the delivery of the Company's
products and services by reason of the advent of the year 2000, including that
all of its products (including products currently under development) will,
without interruption or manual intervention, continue to consistently,
predictably and accurately record, store, process, calculate and present
calendar dates falling on and after (and if applicable, spans of time including)
January 1, 2000, and will consistently, predictably and accurately calculate any
information dependent on or relating to such dates in the same manner, and with
the same functionality, data integrity and performance, as such products record,
store, process, calculate and present calendar dates on or before December 31,
1999, or calculate any information dependent on or relating to such dates.

         (p) Neither this Agreement nor any transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will result in Broadcom's granting any rights or licenses with respect
to the Intellectual Property of Broadcom to any Person pursuant to any Contract
to which the Company is a party or by which any of its Assets and Properties are
bound.

         (q) Section 2.17(q) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
list of (x) all software which the Company has licensed from any third party
which is used by the Company in its products or otherwise in its business (other
than standard off-the-shelf software) and (y) a list of all "freeware" and
"shareware" incorporated into any product now or heretofore shipped by the
Company. The Company has all rights necessary to the use of such software,
"freeware" and "shareware."

         (r) The Company's products comply in all material respects with all
applicable standards and with the feature specifications and performance
standards set forth in the Company's product data sheets, including MPEG. There
are no outstanding claims (or facts that may reasonably lead to a claim) for
breach of warranties by the Company in connection with the foregoing. All
product performance comparisons heretofore furnished by the Company to customers
or Broadcom are accurate in all material respects as of the dates so furnished
(except that, in the case of product performance comparisons made as of a
specified earlier date, such comparisons shall be accurate as of such specified
earlier date, and, in the case of product performance comparisons superseded by
a subsequent product performance comparison furnished to the customer before the
customer's acquisition of a license on the product covered by the superseded
comparison, the superseding comparison shall be accurate in all material
respects and the superseded comparison shall be disregarded).

         (s) The Company has taken all necessary and appropriate steps to
protect and preserve ownership of Company Intellectual Property. The Company has
secured valid written


                                      -21-
<PAGE>   32

assignments from all consultants and employees who contributed to the creation
or development of the Company Intellectual Property. In the event that the
consultant is concurrently employed by the Company and a third party, the
Company has taken additional steps to ensure that any Company Intellectual
Property developed by such a consultant does not belong to the third party or
conflict with the third party's employment agreement.

the Company is a party and in which any director of the Company has a financial
interest in such Contract was approved by a majority of the disinterested

         6.10 Additional Documents and Further Assurances; Cooperation. Each
party hereto, at the request of the other party hereto, shall execute and
deliver such other instruments and do and perform such other acts and things
(including all action reasonably necessary to seek and obtain any and all
consents, waivers and approvals of any Governmental or Regulatory Authority or
Person required in connection with the Transactions; provided, however, that
Broadcom shall not be obligated to consent to any divestitures or operational
limitations or activities in connection therewith and no party shall be
obligated to make a payment of money as a condition to obtaining any such
consent, waiver or approval) as may be necessary or desirable for effecting


                                      -42-
<PAGE>   53

completely the consummation of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby. Each party agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
conditions set forth in Article 7 to be satisfied, where the satisfaction of
such conditions depends on action or forbearance from action by such party.

         6.11 Indemnification.

                  (a) Broadcom and the Company agree that all rights to
indemnification or exculpation now existing in favor of the employees, agents,
directors or officers of the Company (each, a "Company Indemnified Party") as
provided in its Articles of Association or indemnification agreements as in
effect on the date of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect for
a period of six years from and after the Closing Date; provided, however, that,
in the event any claim or claims are asserted or made within such six-year
period, all rights to indemnification in respect of any such claim or claims
shall continue to disposition of any and all such claims. Any determination
required to be made with respect to whether a Company Indemnified Party's
conduct complies with the standards set forth in the Articles of Incorporation
or Bylaws or indemnification agreements of Broadcom or otherwise shall be made
by independent counsel selected by Broadcom reasonably satisfactory to the
Company Indemnified Party (whose fees and expenses shall be paid by Broadcom),
which such determination shall be final and binding on the parties thereto. The
Company hereby represents and warrants to Broadcom that no claim for
indemnification has been made by any director or officer of the Company and, to
the knowledge of the Company, no basis exists for any such claim for
indemnification.

                  (b) With respect to the Company Indemnified Parties, Broadcom
shall (to the extent available on commercially reasonable terms) cause to be
maintained in effect officers' and directors' liability insurance of at least
the same coverage and amounts and for a period of time as currently maintained
by the Company for such Company Indemnified Parties. Such coverage shall also
cover acts and omissions occurring prior to the Closing Date to the extent that
the Company's existing insurance is on a "claims made" basis.

         6.12 Form S-8. Broadcom shall file a registration statement with the
SEC on Form S-8 for the shares of Broadcom Common Stock issuable with respect to
assumed Company Options promptly after the Closing Date, and in any event within
30 days following the Closing Date, to the extent the shares of Broadcom Common
Stock issuable upon exercise of such Company Options qualify for registration on
Form S-8.

         6.13 Company's Auditors. The Company will use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause its management and its independent auditors to facilitate on a
timely basis (a) the preparation of financial statements (including pro forma
financial statements if required) as required by Broadcom to comply with
applicable SEC regulations, (b) the review of any Company audit or review work
papers, including the examination of selected interim financial statements and
data, (c) the delivery of such representations from the Company's independent
accountants as may be reasonably requested by Broadcom or its accountants, and
(d) the securing of a binding fee commitment (on terms similar to those in place
on the date of this Agreement) with respect to consents and comfort letters
requested by Broadcom after the Closing.


                                      -43-
<PAGE>   54

         6.14 Evaluation of Purchased Assets. The Company shall prepare a report
by its engineering staff that each item of equipment included in the Purchased
Assets is in good operating condition and none of such equipment is in need of
maintenance or repair, except for ordinary, routine maintenance and repairs that
are not material in nature or cost.

         6.15 Information Technology Access. In furtherance of the Company's
agreement in Section 6.3 and to facilitate prompt integration following the
Closing of the Company's information technology ("IT") inventory (e.g., voice
and data network services and software and hardware, licenses,
financial/accounting software, IT budgets, etc.) with Broadcom's, the Company
will provide Broadcom and its Representatives with access to the Company's IT
inventory, as well as the Company's personnel responsible for such IT inventory.
Because of the substantial lead time that may be required to order and install
new software and hardware to integrate the Company's IT systems with Broadcom's,
and the importance of a smooth integration of such IT systems promptly after the
Closing, the Company agrees that Broadcom may order, either in Broadcom's name
or, if required by the vendor, the Company's name, any new IT services, hardware
and software that Broadcom believes will be needed at the Company's facilities
in order to integrate Broadcom's and the Company's respective operations
following the Closing. The Company will cooperate with Broadcom in the
installation of such IT systems, hardware and software prior to and in
anticipation of the Closing, including providing Broadcom with reasonable access
to and use of the Company's appropriate personnel. If required by the vendor, at
Broadcom's request, the Company will place IT systems, hardware and software
orders in the Company's name. For clarity, it is the parties' intent not to
connect any of the ordered services or systems prior to the Closing. Broadcom
and the Company agree to cooperate with each other to minimize any potential
disruption to the Company's business from the IT integration efforts; provided,
however, that Broadcom will not have any liability to the Company for any such
disruption or as may otherwise result from the IT integration efforts, except as
may be directly caused by Broadcom's gross negligence or willful misconduct; and
provided further that in no event will Broadcom have any liability to the
Company for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special or speculative
damages, including damages for loss of profits or use, business interruption or
loss of goodwill, irrespective of whether such damages arise under contract,
tort, statute or otherwise and whether or not the Company has given Broadcom
advance notice of the possibility of such damages. If the Closing does not
occur, other than because of the Company's breach of this Agreement, Broadcom
will reimburse the Company for its reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs
incurred by it in connection with the ordering and installation of IT services,
hardware and software. If Broadcom is so required to reimburse the Company,
Broadcom will own any such hardware and software and will pay for its removal
from Company premises. Broadcom and the Company will cooperate in the removal of
any such hardware or software so as to minimize any disruption to the Company's
business. In addition, if the Closing does not occur, the Company will cooperate
with Broadcom in canceling any orders for IT services, hardware or software and
will otherwise act to minimize the costs which might be incurred in connection
with the IT integration efforts.

         6.16 Change of Structure. If, in order to better satisfy the parties'
corporate, tax and accounting objectives, it is necessary to effect the
Transactions contemplated hereby through a different structure (including a
stock purchase or a reverse triangular or forward triangular merger) than the
structure presently contemplated herein and provided that the alternative
structure shall not materially affect the value or timing of the Transactions,
the Company shall


                                      -44-
<PAGE>   55

cooperate with Broadcom in effecting the alternative structure and will take all
reasonably necessary action towards such end, including the execution of any
amendments to this Agreement (provided that such amendments relate only to the
alternative structure of the transaction and any related matters and do not
include any other substantive changes not otherwise agreed between the parties).

         6.17 Intellectual Property. The Company shall give Broadcom prompt
notice if any Person shall have (a) commenced, or shall have notified the
Company that it intends to commence, an Action or Proceeding or (b) provided the
Company with notice, in either case which allege(s) that any of the Intellectual
Property, including the Company Intellectual Property, presently embodied, or
proposed to be embodied, in the Company's products or utilized in any
development tools (including standard cells) or design environments designed or
modified by the Company infringes or otherwise violates the intellectual
property rights of such Person, is available for licensing from a potential
licensor providing the notice or otherwise alleges that the Company does not
otherwise own or have the right to exploit such Intellectual Property, including
the Company Intellectual Property. The Company shall cooperate with Broadcom in
making arrangements, prior to the Closing Date, satisfactory to Broadcom in its
sole discretion to effect the assignment to Broadcom of all Company Intellectual
Property created by the Company's founders, employees and consultants, including
certain Company Intellectual Property created by the Company's founders prior to
the Company's incorporation, and to obtain the cooperation of such Persons to
complete all appropriate patent filings related thereto. The Company shall take
commercially reasonable actions to maintain, perfect, preserve or renew the
Company Registered Intellectual Property, including the payment of any
registration, maintenance, renewal fees, annuity fees and taxes or the filing of
any documents, applications or certificates related thereto, and to promptly
respond and prepare to respond to all requests, related to the Company
Registered Intellectual Property, received from Governmental or Regulatory
Authorities. At the Closing, the Company will notify Broadcom of all material
actions which must be taken within the one hundred eighty (180) days following
the Closing Date and which are necessary to maintain, perfect, preserve or renew
the Company Registered Intellectual Property, including the payment of any
registration, maintenance, renewal fees, annuity fees and taxes or the filing of
any documents, applications or certificates related thereto.

         6.18 Delivery of Share Transfer Register and Minute Book of the
Company. The Company shall deliver its share transfer register and minute book
to Broadcom at the Closing.

         6.19 Certain Actions Relating to the Holders of Warrants. The Company
shall take all requisite commercially reasonable efforts (a) to cause all
Company Warrants, other than the Special Warrants, that would otherwise be
outstanding at or immediately prior to the Closing Date to be exercised in full,
by means of a cash exercise (and not by means of net exercise), for Ordinary
Shares prior to the Closing Date, and to cause the cash exercise price therefor
to be paid to the Company and (b) to cause the holders of all such outstanding
Company Warrants to execute and deliver to the Company waivers of notice with
respect to the notice that would otherwise be applicable to the Asset
Acquisition.

         6.20 Agreements to Revest Shares. The Company shall, prior to Closing,
enter into a Stock Repurchase Agreement with each of the Founders.


                                      -45-
<PAGE>   56

         6.21 Assumption of Options. The parties will, as soon as practicable
following the date of this Agreement, apply to the Israeli Income Tax
Commissioner for a ruling that, with respect to optionholders who are residents
of Israel, the assumption of Options by Broadcom pursuant to Section 1.7(a) is
not a taxable event.

         6.22 Allocation of Aggregate Share Number. Prior to the Closing, the
Aggregate Share Number shall be allocated among the Assets and Properties in the
manner reasonably determined by Broadcom using the allocation methods and
principles required by Section 1060 of the Internal Revenue Code. Broadcom shall
notify the Company within sixty days after the Closing Date of the allocation of
the Aggregate Share Number. Neither Broadcom nor the Company shall take any
position inconsistent with the allocation of the Aggregate Share Number as
determined in this section, and Broadcom and the Company agree that any and all
Tax Returns filed with any taxing authority or other governmental entity shall
be consistent with that allocation.

         6.23 Taxes.

                  (a) The Company shall pay all income, transfer, withholding
and other Taxes due by it under any applicable law in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby other than any Taxes which
Broadcom has withheld from the Aggregate Share Number pursuant to Section
6.23(b), which amount withheld shall be paid by Broadcom to the applicable Tax
authority.

                  (b) The Company shall deliver to Broadcom a certificate from
the Israeli Income Tax Commissioner evidencing an exemption from withholding of
Taxes (the "Certificate of Exemption"), which shall be valid and in effect as of
the Closing. In the event the Company fails to deliver the Certificate of
Exemption to Broadcom, or if Broadcom is required by the pre-ruling or
certificate from the Israeli Income Tax Commissioner delivered by the Company to
Broadcom to withhold Taxes, then Broadcom will withhold and deduct from the
Aggregate Share Number a number of shares of Broadcom Common Stock equal to all
applicable Israeli deductions and withholding taxes.

                  (c) Other than as provided in Section 6.23(a), all Taxes that
are the Company's responsibility hereunder shall be satisfied by the Company
from the amounts otherwise distributable to the shareholders of the Company (and
shall reduce such distributable amounts) or paid from the Trust to the extent
contemplated by the ruling described in Section 7.2(e).

temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other Order
issued by any court of competent jurisdiction or Governmental or Regulatory
Authority or other legal or regulatory restraint or prohibition preventing the
consummation of the Transactions shall be in effect; nor shall there be any
action taken, or any Law or Order enacted, entered, enforced or deemed
applicable to the Transactions or the other transactions contemplated by the
terms of this Agreement that would prohibit the consummation of the Transactions
or which would permit consummation of the Transactions only if certain
divestitures were made or if Broadcom were to agree to limitations on its
business activities or operations.

                  (c) Shareholder Approval. This Agreement and the Asset
Acquisition shall have been approved by the requisite votes of the Company's

Authority shall have withdrawn such notice and abandoned any such proceedings
prior to the time which otherwise would have been the Closing Date.

of a specified earlier date, which shall be accurate as of such specified
earlier date), except that any inaccuracies in such representations and
warranties will be disregarded if the circumstances giving rise to all such
inaccuracies (considered collectively) do not constitute, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, a material adverse change on the Business or
Condition of Broadcom; provided, however, that, for purposes of determining the
accuracy of such representations and warranties, all qualifications and
exceptions referring to a "material adverse change in the Business or Condition
of Broadcom" or a "material adverse effect on Broadcom" and other materiality
qualifications and materiality exceptions contained in such representations and
warranties shall be disregarded.

                  (b) Performance. Broadcom shall have performed and complied

purposes of determining the accuracy of such representations and warranties, (i)
all qualifications and exceptions referring to a "material adverse change in the
Business or Condition of the Company" and other materiality qualifications and
exceptions contained in such representations and warranties shall be disregarded
and (ii) any update of or modification to the Company Disclosure Schedule made
or purported to have been made after the date of this Agreement (other than to

of this Agreement) shall be disregarded; and provided, further that neither of
the following, in and of themselves, shall constitute a material adverse change:
(i) changes or effects which are primarily and directly caused by the execution,
delivery or performance of the pre-closing covenants set forth in this
Agreement, and (ii) any material adverse change resulting from changes in
economic conditions in the economy generally (it being understood that in any

controversy concerning the applicability of this provisio, the Company shall

Assets and Properties; and (ii) the assumption by Broadcom of the Company

Commissioner in connection with the foregoing consents and/or approvals. In

themselves, shall constitute a material adverse change: (i) changes or effects
which are primarily and directly caused by the execution, delivery or
performance of the pre-closing covenants set forth in this Agreement, and (ii)
any material adverse change resulting from changes in economic conditions in the
economy generally (it being understood that in any controversy concerning the
applicability of this proviso, the Company shall have the burden of proof with
respect to the elements of the applicable clause).

                  (l) Company Intellectual Property. No Person shall have (i)

including the Company Intellectual Property, presently embodied, or proposed to
be embodied, in the Company's products or utilized in development tools

Company infringes or otherwise violates the intellectual property rights of such
Person, is available for licensing from a potential licensor providing the

right to exploit such Intellectual Property, including the Company Intellectual
Property, unless such Person shall have withdrawn such notice and abandoned any

satisfactory to Broadcom in its sole discretion shall have been made to effect

incorporation, and to obtain the full cooperation of such Persons to complete
and prosecute all appropriate U.S. and foreign patent filings related thereto.

                  (n) Certain Waivers and Actions. (i) Except for the Special
Warrants, all outstanding Company Warrants that would otherwise be outstanding
at or immediately prior to the Closing shall have been exercised in full, by
means of a cash exercise (and not by net exercise), for Ordinary Shares prior to
the Closing and the cash exercise price therefor shall have been received by the
Company; and (ii) the holders of all outstanding Company Warrants (other than
the Special Warrants) shall have executed and delivered to the Company waivers

Liens.

                  (p) Exemption of Israel Securities Authority. Broadcom shall

Notwithstanding any right of Broadcom or the Company (whether or not exercised)
to investigate the affairs of Broadcom or the Company (whether pursuant to
Section 6.3 or otherwise), any information reviewed by Broadcom as described in
Section 4.8 or any waiver by Broadcom or the Company of any condition to Closing
set forth in Article 7, each party shall


                                      -51-
<PAGE>   62

have the right to rely fully upon the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements of the other party contained in this Agreement or in any instrument
delivered pursuant to this Agreement. Except for (i) the covenant contained in
Section 6.11 (which shall survive for the period set forth therein) and (ii)
Article 8 (which shall survive until termination of the escrow created thereby
and the satisfaction of any other obligations described therein), all of the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of each of the Company,
the Selling Shareholders and Broadcom contained in this Agreement or in any
instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Asset
Acquisition and continue until the fifteen-month anniversary of the Closing Date
(the "Expiration Date").

         8.2 Escrow Provisions.

                  (a) Establishment of the Escrow Fund. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Closing Date, the Escrow Amount, without any act of the
Company, the Selling Shareholders, the Trustee or any of the shareholders, will
be deposited with the Depositary Agent (plus a proportionate share of any
additional shares of Broadcom Common Stock as may be issued upon any stock
splits, stock dividends or recapitalizations effected by Broadcom following the
Closing Date), such deposit to constitute the "Escrow Fund" to be governed by
the terms set forth herein. The portion of the Escrow Amount contributed on
behalf of each shareholder of the Company shall be in proportion to the
aggregate number of shares of Broadcom Common Stock which such holder would
otherwise be entitled to receive in the Transactions. Notwithstanding the
references in this Agreement to the "escrow" and the Escrow Fund, the parties
acknowledge and agree that the Depositary Agent is acting as a depositary and
not as an escrow agent pursuant to this Article 8.

                  (b) Recourse to the Escrow Fund. The Escrow Fund shall be
available to compensate Broadcom and its officers, directors, employees, agents,
Affiliates and Associates (collectively, the "Broadcom Indemnitees") for any and
all Losses (whether or not involving a third party claim (a "Third Party
Claim")), incurred or sustained by Broadcom or any other Broadcom Indemnitee as
a result of any inaccuracy in or breach (or any claim by any third party
alleging or involving an inaccuracy or breach) of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement of the Company or any of the Selling Shareholders
contained herein or in the Ancillary Agreements or in any instrument delivered
pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, that, except in the case of
claims for Losses resulting from a breach, violation or inaccuracy in or
omission from any of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth
in Section 2.3 or the related sections of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
Broadcom may not make any claims against the Escrow Fund unless the aggregate
Losses incurred or sustained exceed $1,000,000 (at which such time claims may be
made for all Losses incurred or sustained). The dollar threshold set forth in
the immediately preceding proviso shall not apply to Losses resulting from any
breach, violation or inaccuracy in or omission from any of the representations
and warranties of the Company set forth in Section 2.3 or the related sections
of the Company Disclosure Schedule, which shall be recoverable without respect
to any threshold amount. Broadcom and the Company each acknowledge that such
Losses, if any, would relate to unresolved contingencies existing at the Closing
Date, which if resolved at the Closing Date would have led to a reduction in the
aggregate consideration to be paid to the Company. Neither the Company nor the
shareholders of the Company, nor the Selling Shareholders shall have any
liability under this Agreement of any sort whatsoever in excess of the Escrow
Fund, except in the


                                      -52-
<PAGE>   63

event of fraud or willful misconduct (i.e., an intentional breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, but excluding a negligent or
reckless breach) by the Company or any of the Selling Shareholders of any of
their respective representations, warranties, agreements or covenants contained
in this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or in any other instrument or
document required to be delivered pursuant to this Agreement in connection
herewith. In the event of such a fraudulent breach, Broadcom shall have all
remedies available at law or in equity (including for tort) with respect to such
breach; provided, however, that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, in no event shall any shareholder of the Company
have any liability in excess of the net consideration (after Israeli tax)
received by such shareholder in the Transactions.

                  (c) Escrow Period; Distribution of Escrow Fund upon
Termination of Escrow Period. Subject to the following requirements, the Escrow
Fund shall be in existence immediately following the Closing Date and shall
terminate at 5:00 p.m., Pacific Time, on the Expiration Date (the period of time
from the Closing Date through and including the Expiration Date is referred to
herein as the "Escrow Period") and upon the Expiration Date all shares of
Broadcom Common Stock remaining in the Escrow Fund shall be distributed to the
Selling Shareholders or the Trust, as applicable (in the case of the Trust, if
the Trust is not in existence at such time, to the Shareholder Agent, in each
case on behalf of the shareholders); provided, however, that the Escrow Period
shall not terminate with respect to such amount (or some portion thereof) that
is necessary in the reasonable judgment of Broadcom, subject to the objection of
the Shareholder Agent and the subsequent arbitration of the matter in the manner
as provided in Section 8.2(g), to satisfy any unsatisfied claims under this
Section 8.2 concerning facts and circumstances existing prior to the termination
of such Escrow Period which claims are specified in any certificate signed by
any officer of Broadcom (an "Officer's Certificate") delivered to the Depositary
Agent prior to termination of such Escrow Period. As soon as all such claims, if
any, have been resolved, the Depositary Agent shall deliver to the Trustee the
remaining portion of the Escrow Fund not required to satisfy such claims.
Broadcom shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to have such remaining
portion of the Escrow Fund delivered within five Business Days after such
resolution.

                  (d) Protection of Escrow Fund.

                           (i) The Depositary Agent shall hold and safeguard the
         Escrow Fund during the Escrow Period, shall treat such fund as a trust
         fund in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and not as the
         property of Broadcom and shall hold and dispose of the Escrow Fund only
         in accordance with the terms hereof.

                           (ii) Any shares of Broadcom Common Stock or other
         Equity Equivalents securities issued or distributed by Broadcom ("New
         Shares") in respect of Broadcom Common Stock in the Escrow Fund which
         have not been released from the Escrow Fund shall be added to the
         Escrow Fund. New Shares issued in respect of shares of Broadcom Common
         Stock which have been released from the Escrow Fund shall not be added
         to the Escrow Fund but shall be distributed to the Trustee on behalf of
         the shareholders. Cash dividends on Broadcom Common Stock shall not be
         added to the Escrow Fund but shall be distributed to the Trustee on
         behalf of the shareholders who are record holders on the record date
         set for any such dividend.


                                      -53-
<PAGE>   64

                           (iii) Each shareholder shall have voting rights with
         respect to the shares of Broadcom Common Stock contributed to the
         Escrow Fund by such shareholder (and on any voting securities added to
         the Escrow Fund in respect of such shares of Broadcom Common Stock).

                  (e) Claims Upon Escrow Fund.

                           (i) Upon receipt by the Depositary Agent at any time
         on or before the last day of the Escrow Period of an Officer's
         Certificate: (A) stating that Broadcom or another Broadcom Indemnitee
         has paid or properly accrued or reasonably anticipates that it will
         have to pay or accrue Losses, directly or indirectly, as a result of
         any inaccuracy or breach (or any claim by any third party alleging,
         constituting or involving an inaccuracy or breach) of any
         representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company
         contained in this Agreement or in any of the Ancillary Agreements or in
         any instrument or agreement delivered pursuant to this Agreement, and
         (B) specifying in reasonable detail the individual items of Losses
         included in the amount so stated, the date each such item was paid or
         properly accrued, or the basis for such anticipated liability, and the
         nature of the misrepresentation, breach of warranty, agreement or
         covenant to which such item is related, the Depositary Agent shall,
         subject to the provisions of Section 8.2(f), deliver to Broadcom out of
         the Escrow Fund, as promptly as practicable, such portion of the Escrow
         Amount equal to such Losses. Where the basis for a claim upon the
         Escrow Fund by Broadcom is that Broadcom reasonably anticipates that it
         will pay or accrue a Loss, no payment will be made from the Escrow Fund
         for such Loss unless and until such Loss is actually paid or accrued.

                           (ii) For the purposes of determining the number of
         shares of Broadcom Common Stock to be delivered to Broadcom out of the
         Escrow Fund pursuant to Section 8.2(e)(i), the shares of Broadcom
         Common Stock shall be valued at the Closing Price.

                  (f) Objections to Claims. At the time of delivery of any
Officer's Certificate to the Depositary Agent, a duplicate copy of such
certificate shall be delivered to the Shareholder Agent and for a period of
thirty days after such delivery, the Depositary Agent shall make no delivery to
Broadcom of any Escrow Amounts pursuant to Section 8.2(e) unless the Depositary
Agent shall have received written authorization from the Shareholder Agent to
make such delivery. After the expiration of such thirty day period, the
Depositary Agent shall make delivery of shares of Broadcom Common Stock from the
Escrow Fund in accordance with Section 8.2(e), provided that no such payment or
delivery may be made if the Shareholder Agent shall object in a written
statement to the claim made in the Officer's Certificate, and such statement
shall have been delivered to the Depositary Agent prior to the expiration of
such thirty day period.

                  (g) Resolution of Conflicts; Arbitration.

                           (i) In case the Shareholder Agent shall object in
         writing to any claim or claims made in any Officer's Certificate, the
         Shareholder Agent and Broadcom shall attempt in good faith to agree
         upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to


                                      -54-
<PAGE>   65

         each of such claims. If the Shareholder Agent and Broadcom should so
         agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and
         signed by both parties and shall be furnished to the Depositary Agent.
         The Depositary Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum
         and distribute shares of Broadcom Common Stock from the Escrow Fund in
         accordance with the terms thereof.

                           (ii) If no such agreement can be reached after good
         faith negotiation, either Broadcom or the Shareholder Agent may demand
         arbitration of the dispute unless the amount of the damage or loss is
         at issue in a pending Action or Proceeding involving a Third Party
         Claim, in which event arbitration shall not be commenced until such
         amount is ascertained or both parties agree to arbitration; and in
         either event the matter shall be settled by arbitration conducted by
         three arbitrators, one selected by Broadcom and one selected by the
         Shareholder Agent, and the two arbitrators selected by Broadcom and the
         Shareholder Agent shall select a third arbitrator. The arbitrators
         shall set a limited time period and establish procedures designed to
         reduce the cost and time for discovery of information relating to any
         dispute while allowing the parties an opportunity, adequate as
         determined in the sole judgment of the arbitrators, to discover
         relevant information from the opposing parties about the subject matter
         of the dispute. The arbitrators shall Rule upon motions to compel,
         limit or allow discovery as they shall deem appropriate given the
         nature and extent of the disputed claim. The arbitrators shall also
         have the authority to impose sanctions, including attorneys' fees and
         other costs incurred by the parties, to the same extent as a court of
         law or equity, should the arbitrators determine that discovery was
         sought without substantial justification or that discovery was refused
         or objected to by a party without substantial justification. The
         decision of a majority of the three arbitrators as to the validity and
         amount of any claim in such Officer's Certificate shall be binding and
         conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement, and notwithstanding
         anything in Section 8.2(f), the Depositary Agent shall be entitled to
         act in accordance with such decision and make or withhold payments out
         of the Escrow Fund in accordance therewith. Such decision shall be
         written and shall be supported by written findings of fact and
         conclusions regarding the dispute which shall set forth the award,
         judgment, decree or order awarded by the arbitrators.

                           (iii) Judgment upon any award rendered by the
         arbitrators may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction.
         Each party hereby agrees that international commercial arbitration
         under the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law
         (UNCITRAL) rules, in the English language, shall be the sole and
         exclusive forum for such arbitration and that such proceeding shall be
         held in the London Court of International Arbitration. For purposes of
         this Section 8.2(g), in any arbitration hereunder in which any claim or
         the amount thereof stated in the Officer's Certificate is at issue,
         Broadcom shall be deemed to be the Non-Prevailing Party in the event
         that the arbitrators award Broadcom less than the sum of one-half of
         the disputed amount of any Losses plus any amounts not in dispute;
         otherwise, the shareholders of the Company as represented by the
         Shareholder Agent shall be deemed to be the Non-Prevailing Party. The
         Non-Prevailing Party to an arbitration shall pay its own expenses, the
         fees of each arbitrator, the administrative costs of the arbitration
         and the expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs,
         incurred by the other party to the arbitration.

                  (h) Shareholder Agent of the Shareholders; Power of Attorney.

                           (i) In the event that the Asset Acquisition is
         approved by the shareholders of the Company, effective upon such vote,
         and without further act of any shareholder, Ezra Morad shall be
         appointed as agent and attorney-in-fact (the "Shareholder Agent") for
         each shareholder of the Company, for and on behalf of shareholders of
         the Company, to give and receive notices and communications, to
         authorize delivery to Broadcom of shares of Broadcom Common Stock from
         the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims by Broadcom, to object to
         such deliveries, to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and
         compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts
         and awards of arbitrators with respect to such claims, and to take all
         actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Shareholder
         Agent for the accomplishment of the foregoing. Such agency may be
         changed by the shareholders of the Company from time to time upon not
         less than thirty days prior written notice to Broadcom; provided,
         however, that the Shareholder Agent may not be removed unless holders
         of a two-thirds interest in the Escrow Fund agree to such removal and
         to the identity of the substituted shareholder agent. Any vacancy in
         the position of Shareholder Agent may be filled by approval of the
         holders of a majority in interest of the Escrow Fund. No bond shall be
         required of the Shareholder Agent, and the Shareholder Agent shall not
         receive compensation for his services. Notices or communications to or
         from the Shareholder Agent shall constitute notice to or from each of
         the shareholders of the Company.

                           (ii) The Shareholder Agent shall not incur any
         liability with respect to any action taken or suffered by him or
         omitted hereunder as Shareholder Agent while acting in good faith and
         in the exercise of reasonable judgment. The Shareholder Agent may, in
         all questions arising hereunder, rely on the advice of counsel and for
         anything done, omitted or suffered in good faith by the Shareholder
         Agent based on such advice, the Shareholder Agent shall not be liable
         to anyone. The Shareholder Agent undertakes to perform such duties and
         only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Agreement and no
         implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement
         against the Shareholder Agent.

                           (iii) The Shareholder Agent shall have reasonable
         access to information about the Company and the reasonable assistance
         of the Company's officers and employees for purposes of performing its
         duties and exercising its rights hereunder, provided that the
         Shareholder Agent shall treat confidentially and not disclose any
         nonpublic information from or about the Company to anyone (except on a
         need to know basis to individuals who agree in writing to treat such
         information confidentially).

                  (i) Actions of the Shareholder Agent. A decision, act, consent
or instruction of the Shareholder Agent shall constitute a decision of all the
shareholders for whom a portion of the Escrow Amount otherwise issuable to them
are deposited in the Escrow Fund and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon
each of such shareholders, and the Depositary Agent and Broadcom may rely upon
any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Shareholder Agent as being
the decision, act, consent or instruction of every such shareholder of the
Company. The Depositary Agent and Broadcom are hereby relieved from any
liability to any person for any acts


                                      -56-
<PAGE>   67

done by them in accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of
the Shareholder Agent.

                  (j) Third-Party Claims. In the event Broadcom becomes aware of
a Third Party Claim which Broadcom reasonably expects may result in a demand
against the Escrow Fund, Broadcom shall notify the Shareholder Agent of such
claim, and the Shareholder Agent, as representative for the shareholders of the
Company shall be entitled, at their expense, to participate in any defense of
such claim. Broadcom shall have the right in its sole discretion to settle any
Third Party Claim; provided, however, that if Broadcom settles any Third Party
Claim without the Shareholder Agent's consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), Broadcom may not make a claim against the
Escrow Fund with respect to the amount of Losses incurred by Broadcom in such
settlement. In the event that the Shareholder Agent has consented to any such
settlement, the Shareholder Agent shall have no power or authority to object
under any provision of this Article 8 to the amount of any claim by Broadcom
against the Escrow Fund with respect to the amount of Losses incurred by
Broadcom in such settlement.

                  (k) Depositary Agent's Duties.

                           (i) The Depositary Agent shall be obligated only for
         the performance of such duties as are specifically set forth herein,
         and as set forth in any additional written escrow instructions which
         the Depositary Agent may receive after the date of this Agreement which
         are signed by an officer of Broadcom and the Shareholder Agent, and may
         rely and shall be protected in relying or refraining from acting on any
         instrument reasonably believed to be genuine and to have been signed or
         presented by the proper party or parties. The Depositary Agent shall
         not be liable for any act done or omitted hereunder as Depositary Agent
         while acting in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment,
         and any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be
         conclusive evidence of such good faith.

                           (ii) The Depositary Agent is hereby expressly
         authorized to comply with and obey Orders of any court of law or
         Governmental or Regulatory Authority, notwithstanding any notices,
         warnings or other communications from any party or any other person to
         the contrary. In case the Depositary Agent obeys or complies with any
         such Order, the Depositary Agent shall not be liable to any of the
         parties hereto or to any other person by reason of such compliance,
         notwithstanding any such Order being subsequently reversed, modified,
         annulled, set aside, vacated or found to have been entered without
         jurisdiction or proper authority.

                           (iii) The Depositary Agent shall not be liable in any
         respect on account of (A) the identity, authority or rights of the
         parties executing or delivering or purporting to execute or deliver
         this Agreement or any documents or papers deposited or called for
         hereunder; or (B) the expiration of any rights under any statute of
         limitations with respect to this Agreement or any documents deposited
         with the Depositary Agent.

                           (iv) In performing any duties under the Agreement,
         the Depositary Agent shall not be liable to any party for damages,
         losses, or expenses, except for gross negligence or willful misconduct
         on the part of the Depositary Agent. The Depositary


                                      -57-
<PAGE>   68

         Agent shall not incur any such liability for (A) any act or failure to
         act made or omitted in good faith, or (B) any action taken or omitted
         in reliance upon any instrument, including any written statement or
         affidavit provided for in this Agreement that the Depositary Agent
         shall in good faith believe to be genuine, nor will the Depositary
         Agent be liable or responsible for forgeries, fraud, impersonations or
         determining the scope of any representative authority. In addition, the
         Depositary Agent may consult with legal counsel in connection with the
         Depositary Agent's duties under this Agreement and shall be fully
         protected in any act taken, suffered, or permitted by him, her or it in
         good faith in accordance with the advice of counsel. The Depositary
         Agent is not responsible for determining and verifying the authority of
         any person acting or purporting to act on behalf of any party to this
         Agreement.

                           (v) If any controversy arises between the parties to
         this Agreement, or with any other party, concerning the subject matter
         of this Agreement, its terms or conditions, the Depositary Agent will
         not be required to determine the controversy or to take any action
         regarding it. The Depositary Agent may hold all documents and shares of
         Broadcom Common Stock and may wait for settlement of any such
         controversy by final appropriate legal proceedings or other means as,
         in the Depositary Agent's discretion, the Depositary Agent may be
         required, despite what may be set forth elsewhere in this Agreement. In
         such event, the Depositary Agent will not be liable for any damages.
         Furthermore, the Depositary Agent may at its option, file an action of
         interpleader requiring the parties to answer and litigate any claims
         and rights among themselves. The Depositary Agent is authorized to
         deposit with the clerk of the court all documents and shares of
         Broadcom Common Stock held in escrow, except all costs, expenses,
         charges and reasonable attorney fees incurred by the Depositary Agent
         due to the interpleader action and which the parties jointly and
         severally agree to pay. Upon initiating such action, the Depositary
         Agent shall be fully released and discharged of and from all
         obligations and liability imposed by the terms of this Agreement.

                           (vi) Broadcom and its successors and assigns agrees
         to indemnify and hold the Depositary Agent harmless against any and all
         Losses incurred by the Depositary Agent in connection with the
         performance of the Depositary Agent's duties under this Agreement,
         including but not limited to any litigation arising from this Agreement
         or involving its subject matter.

                           (vii) The Depositary Agent may resign at any time
         upon giving at least thirty days written notice to the parties;
         provided, however, that no such resignation shall become effective
         until the appointment of a successor depositary agent which shall be
         accomplished as follows: the parties shall use their reasonable best

                  (b) by Broadcom or the Company if: (i) the Closing Date has
not occurred before 5:00 p.m. (Pacific Time) on March 1, 2001 (provided,
however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.1(b)(i)

                  (c) by Broadcom if there shall be any action taken, or any Law

Transactions, by any Governmental or Regulatory Authority, which would: (i)

of the Company or (ii) compel Broadcom to dispose of or hold separate all or any
portion of the Assets and Properties of the Company as a result of the
Transactions;

                  (d) by Broadcom if it is not in material breach of its
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements under this Agreement and
there has been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement on the part of the Company and (i) the Company is
not using its reasonable efforts to cure such breach, or has not cured such

a breach which by its nature cannot be cured), and (ii) as a result of such
breach any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 or Section 7.2, as the
case may be, would not be satisfied as of the Closing Date;

                  (f) by Broadcom, if the Transactions shall not have been
approved by the requisite votes or consents, as applicable, of the Company's
stockholders in accordance with Israeli Law at any meeting (or any adjournment
thereof) convened for the purpose of taking a vote with respect to the
Transactions or, in any solicitation of shareholder written consents with
respect to the Transactions, within twenty days after the record date
established for determining the Company shareholders entitled to consent;

                  (g) by Broadcom, if any of the individuals listed on Schedule
7.3(j) cease to be employed by the Company, provided, however, that Broadcom may
exercise this termination right with respect to a particular individual named in
Schedule 7.3(j) only if Broadcom gives the Company written notice of termination
of the Agreement within thirty days after receipt of written notice from the
Company that such individual has ceased to be employed by the Company; or

                  (h) by Broadcom, if, at any time, less than ninety percent of
the Company's engineering and research and development employees of the Company
employed as of the date of this Agreement (exclusive of those listed on Schedule
7.3(j)) shall cease to be employed by the Company at the Closing or if more than
ten percent of such employees shall have given any notice or other indication
that they are not willing to be employed by Broadcom or a Subsidiary of Broadcom
(as Broadcom shall designate) following the Transactions (it being understood
that if one or more Company employees cease to be employed by the Company as a
result of death or bona fide permanent disability, the number of employees of
the Company as of the date of this Agreement will be reduced correspondingly up
to a maximum of two for purposes of making the necessary calculation).

         9.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of a valid termination of this
Agreement as provided in Section 9.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void
and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Broadcom or the
Company, or their respective officers, directors or shareholders or Affiliates
or Associates; provided, however, that each party shall remain liable for any
breaches of this Agreement prior to its termination; and provided further that,
the provisions of Sections 6.5, 6.6 and 9.2, Article 10 (exclusive of Section
10.3) and the applicable definitions set forth in Article 11 shall remain in

the shareholders of the Company approve the Transactions and this Agreement,
this Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at any time by execution of
an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto;
provided, however, that the consent of the Shareholder Agent and the Depositary
Agent shall not be required in connection with any amendment to this Agreement
that does not affect the rights and obligations of the Shareholder Agent or the
Depositary Agent, as applicable.

inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such party contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) waive compliance

         10.2 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the Exhibits and Schedules
hereto, including the Company Disclosure Schedule and the Broadcom Disclosure
Schedule, constitute the entire Agreement among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings,
both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof, except for the Exclusivity Agreement, which shall continue in full force
and effect and shall survive any termination of this Agreement or the Closing in
accordance with its terms.

         10.3 Further Assurances; Post-Closing Cooperation. At any time or from
time to time after the Closing, the parties shall execute and deliver to the
other party such other documents and instruments, provide such materials and
information and take such other actions as the other party may reasonably
request to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise to cause the other party to fulfill its obligations under this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Each party agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the conditions to its obligations to
consummate the Transactions to be satisfied.

         10.4 Waiver. Any term or condition of this Agreement may be waived at
any time by the party that is entitled to the benefit thereof, but no such
waiver shall be effective unless set forth in a written instrument duly executed
by or on behalf of the party waiving such term or condition. No waiver by any
party of any term or condition of this Agreement, in any one or more instances,
shall be deemed to be or construed as a waiver of the same or any other term or
condition of this Agreement on any future occasion. All remedies, either under
this Agreement or by Law or otherwise afforded, will be cumulative and not
alternative.

         10.5 Third Party Beneficiaries. The terms and provisions of this
Agreement are intended solely for the benefit of each party hereto and their
respective successors or permitted assigns, and it is not the intention of the
parties to confer third-party beneficiary rights, and this Agreement does not
confer any such rights, upon any other Person other than any Person entitled to
indemnity under Section 6.11 or Article 8.

         10.6 No Assignment; Binding Effect. Subject to Section 1.2, neither
this Agreement nor any right, interest or obligation hereunder may be assigned
(by operation of law or otherwise) by any party without the prior written
consent of the other party and any attempt to do so will be void. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement is binding upon, inures to the benefit of and
is enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns.

         10.7 Headings. The headings and table of contents used in this
Agreement have been inserted for convenience of reference only and do not define
or limit the provisions hereof.

         10.8 Invalid Provisions. If any provision of this Agreement is held to
be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or future Law, and if the
rights or obligations of any party hereto under this Agreement will not be
materially and adversely affected thereby, (a) such provision will be fully
severable, (b) this Agreement will be construed and enforced as if such illegal,
invalid or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof, (c) the
remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect and
will not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or by
its severance herefrom and (d) in lieu of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provision, there will be added automatically as a part of this


                                      -63-
<PAGE>   74

Agreement a legal, valid and enforceable provision as similar in terms to such
illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible.

         10.9 Governing Law. This Agreement, any other acquisition agreements,
the Ancillary Agreements and any other closing documents shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the domestic laws of the State of California,
without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law provision or Rule
(whether of the State of California or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
California. Each party hereby agrees that international commercial arbitration
under the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) rules,
in the English language, shall be the sole and exclusive forum for the
institution and resolution of any action or proceeding of any kind or nature
with respect to or arising out of this Agreement, any other acquisition
agreements, the Ancillary Agreements and any other closing documents brought by
any party hereto and that such proceeding shall be held post-Closing in the
London Court of International Arbitration and pre-Closing: in Tel Aviv, Israel
(if brought by Broadcom) and in Irvine, California (if brought by the Company).
In any proceeding brought to enforce this Agreement, any other acquisition
agreements, the Ancillary Agreements or any other closing documents, the
substantially prevailing party as determined by the arbitrator will be entitled
to recover its reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, including fees on any
appeal, and neither party shall be entitled to any trial by jury.

         10.10 Construction. The parties hereto agree that this Agreement is the
product of negotiations between sophisticated parties and individuals, all of
whom were represented by counsel, and each of whom had an opportunity to
participate in and did participate in, the drafting of each provision hereof.
Accordingly, ambiguities in this Agreement, if any, shall not be construed
strictly or in favor of or against any party hereto but rather shall be given a
fair and reasonable construction without regard to the Rule of contra
proferentem.

         10.11 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but all of which
together will constitute one and the same instrument. The Depositary Agent may
execute this Agreement following the date hereof and prior to the Closing, and
such later execution, if so executed after the date hereof, shall not affect the
binding nature of this Agreement as of the date hereof between the other
signatories hereto.

         10.12 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. Except where this Agreement specifically provides for arbitration, it
is agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state having
jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity.
