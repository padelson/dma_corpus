instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of Company Common
Shares (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) (i) a letter of
transmittal that shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such
holder's Company Common Shares ("Certificates") to the Exchange Agent and shall
contain such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting surrender by such holder of Certificates to
the Exchange Agent in exchange for the Merger Consideration.

                           (ii) The holder of each Certificate, upon the
surrender by such holder to the Exchange Agent of such Certificate, together
with the letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed by such
holder in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as
may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, shall be entitled to receive
in exchange for such Certificate a check for the Merger Consideration into which
the Company Common Shares theretofore represented by such Certificate have been
converted pursuant to Section 3.1, and such Certificate shall forthwith
thereafter be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company
Common Shares that is not registered on the transfer records of the Company, the
cash consideration payable hereunder with respect to such Company Common Shares
may be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or

                                      -12-
<PAGE>

otherwise be in proper form for transfer. Each Certificate shall be deemed at
all times from and after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive, upon exchange as contemplated in this Section 3.2, the Merger
Consideration into which the Company Common Shares formerly represented by such
Certificate are converted in the Merger. No interest shall be paid or accrue on
any Merger Consideration payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

                  (b) Exchange Agent. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent
or a direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent shall enter into an agreement with
a nationally recognized financial institution designated by Parent (the
"Exchange Agent"), which shall establish reasonable procedures mutually
acceptable to Parent and the Company, for exchange in accordance with this
Article 3, through the Exchange Agent, an amount of cash sufficient to deliver
to the holders of Company Common Shares (other than Dissenting Shares) the
aggregate Merger Consideration (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the
"Exchange Fund") deliverable pursuant to Section 3.1 in exchange for outstanding
Company Common Shares. The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be issued
pursuant to Section 3.1 out of the Exchange Fund.

                  (c) Further Rights in Company Common Shares. All Merger
Consideration issued and paid upon conversion of the Company Common Shares in
accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Common Shares.

                  (d) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Shares for six
(6) months after the Effective Time shall be promptly delivered to Parent upon
demand, and any holders of Company Common Shares who have not theretofore
complied with this Article 3 shall thereafter look only to Parent (subject to
applicable abandoned property, escheat and similar Laws) for the Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon, only as a general unsecured
creditor thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if
any Certificate has not been surrendered prior to the fifth anniversary of the
Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which the Merger
Consideration in respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Entity), any amounts payable in respect
of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Laws, become
the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interests of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

                  (e) No Liability. None of Parent, the Company, Merger Sub or
the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any Person for any cash from the
Exchange Fund delivered to a Governmental Entity pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

                  (f) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and, if
required by Parent or the Exchange Agent in their respective discretion, the
posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent or the
Exchange Agent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will deliver in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon.

                  (g) Withholding. Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Shares,
Company Options or Company Warrants such amounts as Parent, Merger Sub or the
Exchange Agent are required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any
provision of state, local, provincial or foreign Tax Law, or pursuant to other
applicable judgments, decrees, injunctions or orders, with respect to the making
of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent,

                                      -13-
<PAGE>

Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Common
Shares, Company Options or Company Warrants in respect of whom such deduction
and withholding was made by Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent.

         3.3 Share Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the share transfer
books of the Company shall be closed, and, thereafter, there shall be no further
registration of transfers of Company Common Shares theretofore outstanding on
the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
certificates representing Company Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Company
Common Shares, except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable Laws. On and
after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the Exchange Agent or
Parent for any reason shall be converted into the Merger Consideration, without
interest.

         3.4 Convertible Securities.

                  (a) Company Options. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take all action, including obtaining consents from holders of Company
Options, necessary to cause each then-outstanding unexpired and unexercised
Company Option, whether vested or unvested, to be canceled immediately prior to,
but subject to the occurrence of, the Effective Time. In consideration for such
cancellation, the holder of each such Company Option shall receive, as soon as
reasonably practicable at or after the Effective Time, a cash payment from
Parent or the Surviving Corporation equal to the product of (i) the total number
of shares that were subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and (ii) the excess (if any) of (A) the Merger Consideration
over (B) the exercise price per share subject to such Company Option, such cash
payment to be reduced by any required withholding of Taxes.

                  (b) Company Warrants. Following the Effective Time, each
Company Warrant shall represent only the right, upon the valid exercise thereof,
if any, to receive the Merger Consideration for each Company Common Share into
which such Company Warrant may be exercised and shall in no event be exercisable
for any equity securities of Parent, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries.
In addition, the Company shall take all action necessary to cause all holders of
Company Warrants to either fully exercise such Company Warrants prior to the
Effective Time or agree that such Company Warrants shall be terminated upon the
Effective Time; provided, however, that the holder of any such terminated
Company Warrant shall be entitled to receive following the Effective Time, upon
surrender of the certificate representing such Company Warrant, only an amount
equal to the product of (x) the number of Company Common Shares issuable upon
exercise of such Company Warrant multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of the
per share Merger Consideration over the per share exercise price in effect for
such Company Warrant.

                  (c) Stock Appreciation Rights. At the Effective Time, except
as otherwise provided in the Retention and Non-Competition Agreements, all
Company stock appreciation rights ("Company SARs") then unvested shall vest in
accordance with their terms and each holder of Company SARs shall receive as
soon as reasonably practicable at or after the Effective Time, a cash payment
from Parent or the Surviving Corporation equal to the product of (i) the total
number of vested Company SARs (including those that vest pursuant to the
operation of this subsection (c)), and (ii) the excess (if any) of (A) the
Merger Consideration over (B) the grant price of such Company SARs, such cash
payment to be reduced by any required withholding of Taxes.

                  (d) The Company shall take all action necessary in order to
effect the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.4 as of the Effective Time.
Any materials to be submitted to the holders of

                                      -14-
<PAGE>

Company Options or Company Warrants shall be subject to review and approval by
Parent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

         3.5 Dissenting Stockholders. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, Company Common Shares that are outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger
or consented thereto in writing and who has demanded appraisal for such Company
Common Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL ("Dissenting Shares")
shall not be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration and will
be paid for by the Surviving Corporation in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL; provided, however, that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or
otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal and payment under
the DGCL, the right of such holder to such appraisal of its Company Common
Shares shall cease, and such Company Common Shares shall be deemed converted as
of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as
provided in this Article 3. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any
written demands (or purported demands) for appraisal received by the Company,
withdrawals of such demands, and any other related instruments served pursuant
to Section 262 of the DGCL and received by the Company. Parent shall direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the
DGCL and the Company shall not, except with Parent's prior written consent, (i)
voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal for
Dissenting Shares, (ii) offer to settle, or settle, any such demands, (iii)
waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal in accordance
with the DGCL, or (iv) agree to do any of the foregoing.

         Except as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company
to Parent concurrently with the execution of this Agreement (the "Company
Disclosure Schedule"), which identifies exceptions by specific Section
references, the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub
as follows:

         4.1 Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries.

                  (a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. Each
Subsidiary of the Company (each a "Company Subsidiary" and, collectively, the
"Company Subsidiaries") has been duly organized, and is validly existing and in
good standing, under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or
organization, as the case may be. Each of the Company and each Company
Subsidiary has the requisite power and authority and all necessary governmental
approvals to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business
as it is now being conducted and as currently proposed by it to be conducted,
except where failure to have such governmental approvals would not have a
Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and each Company Subsidiary is duly
qualified or licensed to do business, and is in good standing, in each
jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, leased or operated by
it or the nature of its business makes such qualification, licensing or good
standing necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified, licensed or in
good standing would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect.

                  (b) Section 4.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets
forth a true, correct and complete list of all of the Company Subsidiaries and
the jurisdictions of their incorporation or organization, as the case may be.
None of the Company or any Company Subsidiary holds an Equity Interest in any
other Person (other than a Company Subsidiary). The Company is the direct or
indirect owner of all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock or
limited liability company interests of

                                      -15-
<PAGE>

each Company Subsidiary, and all such shares of capital stock and limited
liability company interests are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable. All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock or
limited liability company interests of each Company Subsidiary are owned
directly or indirectly by the Company free and clear of all Encumbrances and are
not subject to any preemptive right or right of first refusal created by
statute, the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws or other equivalent
organizational documents, as applicable, of such Company Subsidiary or any
Contract to which such Company Subsidiary is a party or by which it is bound.
Other than prepaid purchase obligations to suppliers, there are no outstanding
contractual obligations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to loan funds
to, or make any investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or
otherwise) in, any Person, other than a Company Subsidiary.

                  (c) There are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants,
"put" or "call" rights, exchangeable or convertible securities or other
Contracts of any character relating to the issued or unissued capital stock or
other securities of any Company Subsidiary, or otherwise obligating the Company
or any Company Subsidiary to issue, transfer, sell, purchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire or sell any such securities of a Company Subsidiary.

                  (d) The Company has Made Available to Parent copies of all
certificate or articles of incorporation, bylaws, and other organizational
documents of each of the Company Subsidiaries, as currently in effect. The

Disclosure Schedule are true, correct and complete copies thereof as in effect
on the date hereof. The Company has Made Available to Parent a true, correct and
complete copy of the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws or other equivalent
organizational documents, as applicable, of each Company Subsidiary, in each
case as amended to date. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is in
violation of any of the provisions of its Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws
or equivalent organizational documents. True, correct and complete copies of all
minute books of the Company and Aviall Services, Inc. (containing records of all
proceedings, consents, actions and meetings of the Board of Directors,
committees of the Board of Directors and stockholders of the Company and Aviall
Services, Inc.) from January 1, 2003 through February 23, 2006 and January 30,
2006, respectively, have been Made Available by the Company to Parent. For the
period from January 1, 2003 through the date of this Agreement, there are no

this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by all
necessary corporate action (other than the Company Stockholders Approval). This

the Company's stockholders to adopt this Agreement (the "Company Stockholders
Meeting") is the only vote of the holders of capital stock of the Company
necessary to adopt this Agreement and effect the Merger under applicable Law and

                  (b) The Company has taken all appropriate actions so that the
restrictions on "business combinations" contained in Section 203 of the DGCL

of or any loss of any benefit under, or modify, accelerate or terminate any
rights or obligations under, or constitute a change of control or default (or an

or give to others any right of termination, vesting, amendment, acceleration or
cancellation pursuant to, any Material Contract or Company Permit, except in the
case of clauses (iii) and (iv), for such Encumbrances, or absences of consents
or approvals, which would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company do not, and the performance of this Agreement by the Company will not,

lease and/or operate its properties or other assets, or to carry on its
respective businesses substantially in the manner described in the Company SEC
Reports filed prior to the date hereof and substantially as it is being

Permits are valid and in full force and effect, except where the failure to
have, or the suspension or cancellation of, or failure to be valid or in full
force and effect of, any of the Company Permits would not, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (b) None of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is in
conflict with, or in default or violation of, (A) any Law applicable to the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or by which any property or asset of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound or affected or (B) any Company
Permit, except, with respect to both clauses (A) and (B), for any such
conflicts, defaults or violations that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, be material to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries taken as a
whole. None of the Company Permits will become terminable, in whole or in part,
as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has, within the last three (3) years,
received any written warning, notice of violation, notice of revocation or other
communication from or on behalf of any Governmental Entity, alleging (x) any
material violation of any Company Permit or (y) that the Company or any Company
Subsidiary requires any material Company Permit for its business as currently
conducted that is not currently held by it. No investigation or material inquiry
by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary
is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, in each case with
respect to any alleged or claimed violation of Law applicable to the Company or
any Company Subsidiary or by which any property or asset of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary is bound or affected.

compliance with, or has, or may have, any liability under Export Control Laws.
The Company and each Company Subsidiary has all necessary authority under the
Export Control Laws to conduct their respective businesses substantially in the
manner described in the Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof and
substantially as they are being conducted on the date hereof except as would

Subsidiary has received any written communication that alleges that the Company,
any Company Subsidiary, any director, officer, employee, Affiliate or authorized
agents of any of the foregoing or any other Person associated with or acting on
behalf of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is, or may be, in violation of,

The balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2005 (the "Company Balance
Sheet Date") contained in the Company SEC Reports is hereinafter referred to as
the "Company Balance Sheet." Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has
any liabilities (absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise) required under GAAP
to be set forth on a balance sheet that are, individually or in the aggregate,
material to the business, results of operations or financial condition of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries taken as a whole, except for (A)
liabilities incurred since the Company Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practice which are of the type that typically
recur and which do not result from any breach of contract, tort or violation of
any Law, (B) those specifically set forth or specifically and adequately
reserved against in the Company Balance Sheet, and (C) the fees and expenses of
investment bankers, attorneys and accountants incurred in connection with this
Agreement. Except as reflected in the Company Financial Statements, neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to any material off-balance sheet
arrangements (as defined in Item 303 of Regulation S-K). All reserves that are
set forth in or reflected in the Company Balance Sheet have been established in
accordance with GAAP consistently applied. At the Company Balance Sheet Date,
there were no material loss contingencies (as such term is used in Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 5 ("Statement No. 5") issued by the Financial
Accounting Standards Board in March 1975) that are not adequately provided for
in the Company Balance Sheet as required by Statement No. 5. The Company
Financial Statements comply in all material

                                      -21-

respects with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' Statement
of Position 97-2. The Company has not had any material dispute with any of its
auditors regarding accounting matters or policies during any of its past three
(3) full fiscal years or during the current fiscal year-to-date including
without limitation any dispute that would be required to be disclosed in the
Company SEC Reports. The books and records of the Company and each Company
Subsidiary have been maintained, and are being maintained, in all material
respects in accordance with applicable Law and accounting requirements, and the
Company Financial Statements are consistent with such books and records.

                  (c) The Company has Made Available to Parent a true, correct
and complete copy of (i) any amendments or modifications, which have not yet
been filed with the SEC but that are required to be filed, to Contracts or
documents that previously had been filed by the Company with the SEC pursuant to
the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, and (ii) any correspondence between the
Company and the SEC (including all comment letters received by the Company from
the SEC and all responses to such comment letters by or on behalf of the
Company) for the Company's three (3) prior fiscal years. No investigation by the
SEC with respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary is pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened.

                  (d) Each of the Company SEC Reports (i) as of the date of the
filing of such report, complied in all material respects with the requirements
of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and, to the
extent then applicable, SOXA, including in each case, the rules and regulations
thereunder, and (ii) as of its filing date (or, if amended or superseded by a
subsequent filing prior to the date hereof, on the date of such filing) did not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

                  (e) Each of the principal executive officer and principal
financial officer of the Company (or each former principal executive officer and
each former principal financial officer of the Company) has made all of the
Certifications required by Rules 13a-14 and 15d-14 under the Exchange Act and
Sections 302 and 906 of SOXA, and the rules and regulations of the SEC
promulgated thereunder. The Certifications complied in all material respects
with Rules 13a-14 and 15d-14 under the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of
SOXA, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and the statements
contained in the Certifications were true and correct as of the date of the
filing thereof. For purposes of this Agreement, "principal executive officer"
and "principal financial officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in
SOXA.

                  (f) The Company has implemented and maintains "disclosure
controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the
Exchange Act), and such disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably
designed to ensure that (i) all information (both financial and non-financial)
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and (ii) all such
information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management,
including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or
Persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications of the principal
executive officer and the principal financial officer of the Company required by
Section 302 of SOXA with respect to such reports. The Company has Made Available
to Parent copies of all written descriptions of, and all policies, manuals and
other material documents promulgating such disclosure controls and procedures.

                  (g) The Company is, and since January 1, 2003 has been, in
compliance in all material respects with (i) the applicable listing and
corporate governance rules and regulations of the New

                                      -22-

York Stock Exchange, and (ii) the applicable provisions of SOXA. There has been
no material correspondence between the Company and the New York Stock Exchange
since January 1, 2003.

                  (h) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary nor, to the
knowledge of the Company, any director, officer, employee, auditor, accountant
or Representative of the Company or any Company Subsidiary has received any
complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, in each case, regarding the
accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods or
potential fraudulent conduct of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or their
respective internal controls, or any material inaccuracy in the Company's
Financial Statements, including any complaint, allegation, assertion or claim
that the Company or any Company Subsidiary has engaged in questionable
accounting or auditing practices. No attorney representing the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, or current or former employee of the Company or of any
Company Subsidiary, has reported to the Company Board or any committee thereof
or to any director or officer of the Company evidence of a violation of
securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty, fraudulent conduct or similar
violation by the Company or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents.

                  (i) PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, which has expressed its
opinion with respect to the Company's Financial Statements for each of the years
in the five (5) year period ended December 31, 2005 included in the Company SEC
Reports (including the related notes), is "independent" with respect to the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries within the meaning of Regulation S-X and
has been "independent" within such meaning at all times since December 31, 2000.
The Company has made such disclosure of non-audit services performed by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP in its proxy statements with respect to its annual
meetings of stockholders as is required under the rules and regulations of the
SEC, and all such non-audit services have been approved in advance by the audit
committee of the Company Board.

                  (j) The Company has implemented and maintains a system of
internal control over "financial reporting" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and
15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, including,
without limitation, that (i) transactions are executed in accordance with
management's general or specific authorizations, (ii) transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with
GAAP and to maintain asset accountability, (iii) access to assets is permitted
only in accordance with management's general or specific authorization, and (iv)
the recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at
reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any
differences. Since January 1, 2003, other than in connection with SOXA
compliance and process improvements implemented voluntarily by the Company, (a)
there have not been any changes in the Company's internal control over financial
reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting; (b) there have
not been any "significant deficiencies" or "material weaknesses" (as defined by
the Public Company Accounting Board) in the design or operation of the Company's
internal controls and procedures that could adversely affect the Company's
ability to record, process, summarize and report the financial data, (c) to the
extent there have been any such significant deficiencies or material weaknesses,
they have been disclosed to the Company's outside auditors and the audit
committee of the Company Board, and (d) there has not been any fraud, whether or
not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in the Company's internal control and procedures. The Company has Made
Available to Parent copies of all reports and other documents concerning
internal controls filed with the SEC or delivered to the Company by its
auditors, in each case, prior to the date of this Agreement. The Company has
Made Available to Parent accurate and complete copies of all written
descriptions of, and all policies, manuals and other material documents
promulgating such internal accounting controls in effect as of the date of this
Agreement.

compensation agreements and severance agreements, written or otherwise, for the
benefit of, or relating to, any present or former director, officer, employee,
or consultant (provided that, for former directors, officers, employees and
consultants, such arrangements need only be listed if unsatisfied obligations of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary of greater than $10,000 remain thereunder)
under which any of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or ERISA Affiliate
could reasonably be expected to have any liability (all of the foregoing
described in clauses (i) through (vi), collectively, but exclusive of any
Foreign Plan, the "Company Benefit Plans"). There are no defined benefit or
retiree medical plans outside of the United States other than any Foreign Plan.
Furthermore, to the knowledge of the Company, there are no benefit plans outside
the United States that have a material cost to the local business other than any
Foreign Plan. The Company has not, since July 30, 2002, extended credit,
arranged for the extension of credit, or renewed, modified or forgiven an
extension of credit made prior to such date, in the form of a personal loan to
or for any Person who was, at any time since such date, an officer or director
of the Company.

                  (b) Prior to the date of this Agreement, the Company has Made
Available to Parent a true, correct and complete copy of each of the Company
Benefit Plans and any related plan documents (including adoption agreements,
vendor Contracts and administrative services agreements, trust documents,
insurance policies or Contracts including policies relating to fiduciary
liability insurance, bonds required by ERISA, amendments to the Company Benefit
Plans, employee booklets, summary plan descriptions, and summaries of material
modifications and any material employee communications of the Company relating
to changes to the Company Benefit Plans) and has, with respect to each Company
Benefit Plan that is subject to ERISA reporting requirements, Made Available to
Parent true, correct and complete copies of the Form 5500 reports filed for the
last three (3) plan years (including all audits, financial statements, schedules
and attachments thereto). Any Company Benefit Plan intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code has (i) obtained from the IRS a current
favorable determination letter as to its qualified status under the Code, or
(ii) has been established under a standardized master and prototype or volume
submitter plan for which a current favorable IRS advisory letter or opinion
letter has been obtained by the plan sponsor and is valid as to the adopting
employer.

                                      -26-
<PAGE>

The Company has also Made Available to Parent a true, correct and complete copy
of the most recent such IRS determination letter, advisory letter or opinion
letter issued with respect to each such the Company Benefit Plan, and to the
knowledge of the Company nothing has occurred since the issuance of each such
letter that could reasonably be expected to cause the loss of the Tax-qualified
status of any Company Benefit Plan subject to Section 401(a) of the Code. The
Company has also Made Available to Parent all registration statements and
prospectuses and investment policy statements prepared in connection with each
Company Benefit Plan. All individuals who, pursuant to the terms of any Company
Benefit Plan, are entitled to participate in any Company Benefit Plan, are
currently participating in such Company Benefit Plan or have been offered an
opportunity to do so and have declined in writing. Neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary nor any ERISA Affiliate sponsors or maintains any self-funded
employee benefit plan, including any plan to which a stop-loss policy applies.

                  (c) None of the Company Benefit Plans promises or provides
retiree medical or other retiree welfare benefits to any Person other than as
required under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as
amended ("COBRA") or applicable state law. There has been no "prohibited
transaction" (within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the
Code) with respect to any Company Benefit Plan that is not exempt under Section
408 of ERISA which has not been corrected and as to which any unsatisfied
penalties and excise taxes are reasonably likely to exist. Each Company Benefit
Plan has been administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms
and the requirements prescribed by any and all statutes, rules and regulations
(including ERISA and the Code), and the Company, each Company Subsidiary and
each ERISA Affiliate has performed all obligations required to be performed by
it under, is not in any material respect in default under or in violation of,
and has no knowledge of any material default or violation by any other party to,
any of the Company Benefit Plans. All contributions required to be made by the
Company, any Company Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate to any Company Benefit
Plan have been made on or before their due dates and, to the extent required by
GAAP, all amounts have been accrued for the current plan year (and no further
contributions will be due or will have accrued thereunder as of the Closing
Date, other than contributions accrued in the ordinary course of business,
consistent with past practice, after the Company Balance Sheet Date as a result
of the operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries after the Company
Balance Sheet Date). In addition, with respect to each Company Benefit Plan
intended to include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement, the Company and each
Company Subsidiary and ERISA Affiliate have at all times made timely deposits of
employee salary reduction contributions and participant loan repayments, as
determined pursuant to regulations issued by the United States Department of
Labor. No Company Benefit Plan is subject to, and neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary or ERISA Affiliate has incurred or reasonably expects to
incur any liability under Title IV of ERISA (other than for the payment of
insurance premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation). No Company
Benefit Plan has an accumulated funding deficiency within the meaning of Section
412 of the Code. With respect to each Company Benefit Plan subject to ERISA as
either an employee pension benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(2) of
ERISA or an employee welfare benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(1) of
ERISA, the Company has prepared in good faith and timely filed all requisite
governmental reports (which were true, correct and complete as of the date
filed), including any required audit reports, and has properly and timely filed
and distributed or posted all notices and reports to employees required to be
filed, distributed or posted with respect to each such Company Benefit Plan. No
suit, administrative proceeding, action or other litigation has been brought, or
to the knowledge of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, is threatened,
against the Company or any Company Subsidiary or with respect to any such
Company Benefit Plan, including any audit or inquiry by the IRS or United States
Department of Labor.

                  (d) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary or ERISA
Affiliate is a party to, or has made any contribution to or otherwise incurred
any obligation under, any "multiemployer plan" as such term is

                                      -27-
<PAGE>

defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA or any "multiple employer plan" as such term
is defined in Section 413(c) of the Code to which the Company or any Company
Subsidiaries has any liability (contingent or otherwise). There has been no
termination or partial termination of any Company Benefit Plan within the
meaning of Section 411(d)(3) of the Code in respect of which the Company or any
Company Subsidiaries has any liability (contingent or otherwise).

                  (e) As regards each Foreign Plan, (i) such Foreign Plan is in
compliance with the provisions of the Laws of each jurisdiction in which such
Foreign Plan is maintained, to the extent those Laws are applicable to such
Foreign Plan, (ii) the Company, each Company Subsidiary, and each ERISA
Affiliate has complied with all applicable reporting and notice requirements,
and such Foreign Plan has obtained from the Governmental Entity having
jurisdiction with respect to such Foreign Plan any required determinations, if
any, that such Foreign Plan is in compliance with the laws of the relevant
jurisdiction if such determinations are required in order to give effect to such
Foreign Plan, and (iii) such Foreign Plan has been administered in all material
respects in accordance with its terms and applicable Law and regulations.

                  (f) Section 4.10(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists
each Person who the Company reasonably believes is, with respect to the Company,
any Company Subsidiary and/or any ERISA Affiliate, a "disqualified individual"
(within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the regulations promulgated
thereunder) determined as of the date hereof.

                  (g) Section 4.10(g) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists
as of the date of this Agreement the number of employees of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary who are absent from active work because of disability or
other leave in excess of four Business Days, the nature of such leave (e.g.,
short-term or long-term disability), and the number of such employees who have
been absent for more than thirty (30) days.

                  (h) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
consummation of the Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby or any
termination of employment or service in connection therewith or subsequent
thereto will (i) result in any payment (including severance, unemployment
compensation, golden parachute, bonus or otherwise) becoming due to any Person
other than accrued payments, (ii) materially increase or otherwise enhance any
benefits otherwise payable by the Company or any Company Subsidiary, (iii)
result in the acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such
benefits, except as required under Section 411(d)(3) of the Code, (iv) increase
the amount of compensation due to any Person, or (v) result in the forgiveness
in whole or in part of any outstanding loans made by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary to any Person.

                  (i) To the knowledge of the Company, (i) Section 4.10(i) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule lists each Company Benefit Plan that grants any
compensation, equity award or bonus that could be deemed deferred compensation
within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, and (ii) such Company Benefit
Plan is in compliance with Section 409A of the Code.

                  (j) (i) Each of the Company and each Company Subsidiary is in
compliance in all material respects with all currently applicable Laws

occupational safety and health and employment practices, including the
Immigration Reform and Control Act, (ii) the Company and each Company Subsidiary
has paid in full to all employees, independent contractors and consultants all

Subsidiary is liable for any payment to any trust or other fund or to any
Governmental Entity, with respect to unemployment compensation benefits, social
security or

                                      -28-

other benefits or obligations for employees (other than routine payments to be
made in the normal course of business and consistent with past practice), and
(iv) there are no material controversies pending or, to the knowledge of the

misappropriate the Intellectual Property of any third party and does not and
will not constitute unfair competition or unfair trade practices under the Laws
of any jurisdiction and to the Company's knowledge, there is no substantial
basis for such a claim.

                  (m) None of the Company-Owned IP Rights, the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries is subject to any judicial or governmental proceeding
or outstanding order, or material Contract or stipulation, (A) restricting in
any manner the use, transfer, or licensing by the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries of any Company-Owned IP Right or which may affect the validity, use
or enforceability of any such Company-Owned IP Right, or (B) restricting the
conduct of the business of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in
order to accommodate Third Party Intellectual Property rights, in both cases

or any equivalent Governmental Entity.

                  (n) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has

employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or the use by the Company or
any Company Subsidiary of the services of any consultant or independent
contractor does not subject the Company or any Company Subsidiary to any
liability to any third party for improperly soliciting such employee, consultant
or independent Contractor to work for the Company or any Company Subsidiary,
whether such liability is based on contractual or other legal obligations to
such third party.

                  (s) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have taken
commercially reasonable steps to protect and preserve the confidentiality of all
confidential or non-public information or similar proprietary information

disclosure or appropriation of Confidential Information owned by the Company or

exclusions thereof); (ii) to all packaging, advertising and marketing materials
to the extent required by law; (iii) to any legally binding representations
provided to customers; and (iv) applicable product or service specifications or

that are not material in amount) of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
(whether or not shown or required to be shown on any Tax Return) that are due
and payable have been timely paid in full and the accruals and reserves for

Subsidiaries. All reserves for Taxes as adjusted for operations and transactions

custom and practice of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries are adequate to

party.

Company or any Company Subsidiary is pending or, to the knowledge of Company,
threatened. No deficiencies have been asserted in writing against the Company or
any Company Subsidiary as a result of examinations by any state, local, federal
or foreign Taxing authority which have not been fully resolved and paid and, to
the knowledge of the Company, no issue has been raised by any examination

resulting from any audit or examination relating to Taxes of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary by any Taxing authority has been paid or is being contested
in good faith and in accordance with the Law and is fully reserved for on the
Company Balance Sheet in accordance with GAAP. To the knowledge of the Company,
no claim has ever been made in writing by an authority in a jurisdiction where
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries does not file Tax Returns that
the Company or any Company Subsidiary, as the case may be, is or may be subject
to Tax in that jurisdiction. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is
subject to any private letter ruling of the IRS or comparable rulings of other
Tax authorities that will be binding on the Company or any Company Subsidiary
with respect to any period following the Closing Date. Neither the stock of any
Company Subsidiary nor any asset, right or property of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary is subject to any Encumbrance for Taxes (other than an

Company Subsidiary.

state, local or foreign income Tax law), (ii) open transaction or installment
disposition made on or prior to the Closing Date, or (ii) prepaid amount

the Merger, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is subject to any
limitation on the use of its Tax attributes under Section 382, 383, and 384 of
the Code or Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-15 or -21 (regarding separate
return limitation years) or any comparable provisions of state law.

Subsidiary, except where failure to be in full force and effect or to be valid
and effective, and for such default and events of default and such claims, in
each case, which would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect. There is not, under the Dallas Lease any existing default or
event of default (or event that with notice or lapse or time or both would
constitute a default) by the landlord (or as the case may be, if applicable,
sublandlord) thereunder that would give rise to a material claim by the Company
or any Company Subsidiary against said landlord or sublandlord.

Company and each Company Subsidiary. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall be required to provide access to or to
disclose any information (i) where such access or disclosure would result in the
loss of the attorney-client privilege or work product privilege of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary or contravene any Law or binding agreement entered
into prior to the date of this Agreement (provided that with respect to any such
binding agreements, and following execution of this Agreement, the Company will

obtain all necessary third party consents to allow Parent to review all such
agreements), or (ii) to the extent that outside counsel to the Company advises

information which it has received or to which it has gained access pursuant to
this Section 6.5 in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of
March 3, 2006 between the Company and Parent, as amended from time to time (the

expression of interest, proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably
be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) agree to, accept,

                                      -49-

previously furnished to any Person with which the Company has engaged in any
activities related to any Acquisition Proposal within the twelve (12) month
period preceding the date of this Agreement. If any Representative of the
Company, whether in his or her capacity as such or in any other capacity, takes
any action that the Company is obligated pursuant to this Section 6.6 to use all
reasonable efforts to ensure that its Representatives do not take, then the
Company shall be deemed for all purposes of this Agreement to have breached this
Section 6.6.

                  (b) Notice. The Company, as promptly as practicable (but in no

or request and (y) provide to Parent, as promptly as practicable, a copy of all
written materials and other information provided to the Company in connection
with any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, expression of interest, proposal,

the Company Board at which the Company Board is reasonably expected to discuss
any Acquisition Proposal, including to determine whether such Acquisition
Proposal is a Superior Offer.

                  (c) Superior Offers. In the event that any Person submits to
the Company (and does not withdraw) an Acquisition Proposal that the Company
Board concludes in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and a financial advisor of national standing) is, or is reasonably likely to
become, a Superior Offer, then notwithstanding Section 6.6(a), the Company may,

identity of such Person and all of the material terms and conditions of such
Acquisition Proposal and of the Company's intention to take actions in response
to such Superior

                                      -50-
<PAGE>

Offer, specifying the actions it intends to take; and (D) in the case of clause
(ii), the Company first shall have received from such Person an executed
confidentiality agreement containing terms at least as restrictive with regard
to the Company's Confidential Information as the Confidentiality Agreement, it
being understood that such confidentiality agreement shall not include any
provision for any exclusive right to negotiate with such Person or having the
actual or purported effect of restricting the Company from fulfilling its
obligations under this Agreement.

                  (d) Changes of Recommendation. Nothing in this Agreement shall
prevent the Company Board from (i) withholding, withdrawing, amending or

not have, within four (4) Business Days of Parent's receipt of the Notice of
Superior Offer, made an offer that the Company Board determines in its good
faith judgment (after consultation with a financial advisor of national

Superior Offer (it being agreed that (1) the Company Board shall convene a
meeting to consider any such offer by Parent promptly following the receipt
thereof, (2) that the Company Board will not withhold, withdraw, amend or modify
the Company Board Recommendation or terminate the Agreement pursuant to Section
8.1(h) for four (4) Business Days after receipt by Parent of the Notice of
Superior Offer, and (3) any change to the financial or other material terms of
such Superior Offer shall require a new Notice of Superior Offer to Parent and a
new four (4) Business Day period under this clause (E)), and (F) the Company
Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that, in light of such Superior Offer and any offer made by Parent
pursuant to Section 6.6(d)(E), the Company Board is required to withhold,
withdraw, amend or modify the Company Board Recommendation or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(h) to comply with its fiduciary obligations to
the Company's stockholders under applicable Law.

                  (e) Compliance with Tender Offer Rules. Nothing contained in
this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board from taking and
disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or taking any action required by any
order or` decree of any Governmental Entity; provided, however, that neither the
Company Board nor any committee thereof shall withhold, withdraw, amend or
modify the Company Board Recommendation unless specifically permitted to do so
pursuant to this Section 6.6.

                  (f) Stockholder Disclosures. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall prohibit the Company from making any disclosure to the
stockholders of the Company if the Company Board has concluded in its good faith
judgment (after receipt of advice from its outside legal counsel) that such
disclosure is required in order to comply with its fiduciary obligations to the
Company's stockholders under applicable Law or to comply with securities laws.
Such disclosure shall not be deemed to withhold, withdraw, amend or modify the
Company Board Recommendation or otherwise constitute a breach of this Section
6.6.

         6.7 Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings.

                  (a) Promptly after the execution of this Agreement, each of
Parent and the Company shall apply for or otherwise seek, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain, all consents and approvals required to be
obtained by it for the consummation of the Merger. Without limiting the

                                      -51-
<PAGE>

generality or effect of the foregoing, each of Parent and the Company shall, (i)
as soon as practicable, and in any event no later than ten (10) Business Days
after the date of this Agreement, make any initial filings required under the
HSR Act and (ii) as promptly as practicable, make any additional filings
required by any other applicable Antitrust Laws. The parties hereto shall
consult and cooperate with one another, afford one another (or one another's
counsel) an opportunity to review in advance any analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals to be made
or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in connection with proceedings
under or relating to any Antitrust Law; and consider in good faith the views of
one another, in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals; provided, however, that,
with respect to any such analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda,
briefs, arguments, opinions or proposals, each of Parent and the Company need
not supply the other (or its counsel) with copies (or in case of oral
presentations, a summary) to the extent that any Law applicable to such party
requires such party or the Company Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access
to any such properties or information. Unless otherwise agreed, to the extent
reasonably practicable and permitted by applicable Law, no party shall have any
material discussions or communications with any Governmental Entity with respect
to the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement without, where practical,
consulting with a representative of the other party.

                  (b) Each party will notify the other promptly upon the receipt
of (i) any comments from any officials of any Governmental Entity in connection
with any filings made pursuant hereto and (ii) any request by any officials of
any Governmental Entity for amendments or supplements to any filings made
pursuant to, or information provided to comply in all material respects with,
any Laws. Whenever any event occurs that is required to be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to any filing made pursuant to Section 6.7(a), each
party will promptly inform the other of such occurrence and cooperate in filing
with the applicable Governmental Entity such amendment or supplement.

                  (c) Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any
Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement under the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as
amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, Council Regulation
139/2004 of the European Community and any other federal, state or foreign
statutes, rules, regulations, orders or decrees that are designed to prohibit,
restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization,
lessening of competition or restraint of trade (collectively, "Antitrust Laws").
Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to take
such action as may be required to cause the expiration or termination of the
waiting or notice periods or the receipt of approval decisions under the HSR Act
or other Antitrust Laws with respect to such transactions as promptly as
possible after the execution of this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing,
Parent and the Company shall take any and all of the following actions to the
extent necessary to obtain the approval of any Governmental Entity with
jurisdiction over the enforcement of any applicable Laws regarding the
transactions contemplated hereby: (i) entering into negotiations, (ii) providing
information required by Law, and (iii) substantially complying with any "second
request" for information pursuant to the Antitrust Laws.

                  (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, if any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted
(or threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by
this Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Law, it is expressly understood and
agreed that (i) Parent and the Company shall litigate, contest or defend against
any administrative or judicial action or proceeding that seeks to obtain a
temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction preventing, in whole or
in part, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, provided, however,
that if a Governmental Entity issues a Restraint either Parent or the Company
may, in its sole discretion, terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c)
and (ii) Parent shall make reasonable best efforts to eliminate the grounds of
objection to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, that may be

                                      -52-
<PAGE>

asserted by any Governmental Entity under any Antitrust Laws, so as to enable
the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event, no later
than the Outside Date), provided, however, that Parent shall not be required to
undertake any efforts that, in its judgment, would or could substantially impair
its ability to conduct any of its businesses or the business of the Company in
the manner that they have been conducted in the past.

                  (e) Notwithstanding Section 6.7(d) or any other provision of
this Agreement, nothing in this Section 6.7 shall (i) require Parent to make
proposals, execute or carry out agreements, or submit to orders, providing for a
Divestiture or (ii) limit a party's right to terminate the Agreement pursuant to
Sections 8.1(b) or 8.1(c) so long as such party has until such termination
complied in all material respects with its obligations under this Section 6.7.

         6.8 Certain Notices. Each of Company and Parent, as the case may be,
will notify the other party in writing promptly after learning of (i) any notice
or other communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person
is or may be required in connection with the Merger, (ii) any notice or other
communication from any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger, (iii)
any change, occurrence or event that, individually or in the aggregate with any
other changes, occurrences and events, would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect, or that is reasonably likely to cause any of the
conditions to closing set forth in Article 7 not to be satisfied, or (iv) any
claim, or any verbal or written inquiry by any Tax Authority, regarding Taxes in
excess of $5,000 payable by the Company. Each of Parent and Company shall give
prompt notice to the other party of any representation or warranty made by it
contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect, or any failure by it to comply with or satisfy in any material respect
any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
under this Agreement, provided, however, that no such notification shall affect
the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

         6.9 Public Announcements. Parent and the Company have agreed to the
text of the press release announcing the signing of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. Other than with respect to any announcement
relating to any action specifically permitted to be taken by the Company
pursuant to Section 6.6(d), Parent and the Company shall provide to each other
any subsequent press releases related to this Agreement, the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby and shall consult with each other before
issuing or making any such release. Neither Parent nor the Company shall issue
any such press release or make any such public statement without the prior
written consent of the other party; provided that the either party may, without
obtaining the prior consent of the other party, issue such press release or make
such public statements as such party determines in good faith, following
consultation with legal counsel, are required by Law or the rules and
regulations of the New York Stock Exchange, if it has used all reasonable
efforts to consult with the other party. Each of Parent and the Company shall
cause its employees, officers and directors to comply with this Section 6.9.

         6.10 Indemnification.

                  (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent will assume, and
will cause the Surviving Corporation to fulfill and honor in all respects, the
obligations of the Company pursuant to any indemnification agreements between
the Company and its directors and officers set forth on Section 6.10 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule as of the Effective Time (the "Indemnified Parties")
and any indemnification provisions under the Company Certificate of
Incorporation or Company Bylaws as in effect on the date of this Agreement, in
each case, subject to applicable Law. The Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation will contain provisions with respect to
indemnification that are at least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as
those contained in the Company Certificate of Incorporation and Company Bylaws
as in effect on the date of this Agreement, which

                                      -53-
<PAGE>

provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of
six (6) years from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect
the rights thereunder of the Indemnified Parties, unless such modification is
required by applicable Law.

                  (b) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause to be maintained directors' and officers' liability insurance ("D&O
Insurance") in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective
Time covering each individual who at the date of this Agreement was an
Indemnified Party covered as of the date hereof or hereafter by the Company's
D&O Insurance on terms with respect to coverage and amounts no less favorable
than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof; Parent shall have the
right to cause coverage to be extended under the Company's D&O Insurance by
obtaining a six (6) year "tail" policy on terms and conditions no less
advantageous than the Company's existing D&O Insurance, and such "tail" policy
shall satisfy the provisions of this Section 6.10. In lieu of the foregoing,
prepaid policies may be obtained prior to the Effective Time, which policies
shall provide for terms and conditions no less advantageous than the Company's
existing D&O Insurance with the prior written consent of Parent, which shall not
be unreasonably withheld. If such prepaid policies have been obtained prior to
the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
maintain such policies in full force and effect, and continue to honor the
obligations thereunder.

                  (c) In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and
shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then and in each such case, proper
provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation, or at Parent's option, Parent, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 6.10.

                  (d) This Section 6.10 shall survive the consummation of the
Merger, is intended to benefit each of the Indemnified Parties, shall be binding
on all successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation and Parent, shall be
enforceable by each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives,
and may not be amended, altered or repealed with respect to any Indemnified
Party after the Effective Time without the prior written consent of such
Indemnified Party (provided that any amendment, alteration or repeal prior to
the Effective Time shall be governed by Section 8.3).

         6.11 Employees.

                  (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub
shall have the rights and obligations described in this Section 6.11 and Section
6.12 regarding the individuals who were employees of the Company or a Company
Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time and who continue employment
with the Company, a Company Subsidiary or Parent or a Parent Subsidiary
following the Effective Time (including each such individual who is on vacation,
temporary layoff, leave of absence, sick leave or short- or long-term disability
leave) ("Continuing Employee").

                  (b) All Continuing Employees shall be employed solely on an
"at will" basis, except to the extent required by the provisions of written
employment Contracts or as required by applicable Law.

                  (c) Within a reasonable period of time after the last Business
Day of each month after the date of this Agreement and on or about the date that
is five (5) Business Days prior to the expected date on which the Closing will
occur, the Company shall, as and to the extent necessary, deliver to Parent a
revised Section 4.10(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, which sets forth
each Person who the Company reasonably believes is, with respect to the Company
or any ERISA Affiliate, a "disqualified individual" (within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code and the regulations

                                      -54-
<PAGE>

promulgated thereunder), as of the date such revised Section 4.10(f) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule is made available to Parent.

         6.12 Benefit Plans.

                  (a) Subject to Section 6.11(b):

                  (i) Parent shall, through the period beginning at the
Effective Time and ending December 31, 2007, cause each Continuing Employee to
be provided compensation (including wages and cash and equity incentive
compensation opportunities) and employee benefits substantially no less
favorable in the aggregate than the compensation and employee benefits,
respectively, to which they were entitled in the aggregate immediately before
the Effective Time; provided that in no event shall Parent cause a reduction in
the severance benefits to which Continuing Employees are entitled during the
period ending December 31, 2007 below the level of entitlement in effect
immediately before the Effective Time;

                  (ii) For all purposes under each employee benefit plan
maintained by Parent, any Parent Subsidiary or any of their Affiliates in which
Continuing Employees become eligible to participate upon or after the Effective
Time, the Continuing Employees shall be given credit for all service with the
Company or a Company Subsidiary, as applicable, to the same extent as if such
services had been rendered to Parent or any of its Affiliates. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, such credit shall not be used to determine benefit accruals,
except with respect to severance and vacation benefits; and

                  (iii) As to the plan years then in place at the Effective
Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Company and each Company Subsidiary, to
use all best efforts to: (i) waive all limitations as to pre-existing
conditions, exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements and waiting
periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to
the Continuing Employees under any welfare or fringe benefit plan in which the
Continuing Employees may be eligible to participate after the Closing; and (ii)
provide each Continuing Employee with credit under any general leave, welfare
plan or fringe benefit plan in which the Continuing Employee becomes eligible to
participate after the Closing for any co-payments and deductibles paid by and
out of pocket requirements satisfied by such Continuing Employee for the then
current plan year under the corresponding welfare or fringe benefit plan
maintained by the Company or any Company Subsidiary prior to the Closing.

                  (b) As promptly as practicable following the execution of this
Agreement, the Company shall appoint an independent nationally recognized
financial institution to serve as fiduciary for the Company Employee Savings
Plan (the "Savings Plan") with respect to Company Common Shares held under the
Savings Plan who, together with the trustee of the Savings Plan, shall
coordinate and take any and all appropriate actions to effectuate the voting of
such Company Common Shares held under the Savings Plan in the Company
Stockholders Meeting.

                  (c) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the
execution of this Agreement and in no event later than thirty (30) days
following execution of this Agreement, the Company shall amend in form and
substance agreed to in writing by Parent the Company Supplemental Executive
Retirement Income Plan to provide that, for purposes of determining whether a
Company executive's "Annual Compensation" is substantially similar to his or her
Annual Compensation in the year immediately preceding a Change in Control, the
reference in Section 9.1 of such Plan to incentive compensation is intended to
denote the incentive opportunities made available to such executive, rather than
the amount of incentive compensation actually paid to him or her.

                                      -55-
<PAGE>

                  (d) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the
execution of this Agreement and in no event later than thirty (30) days
following execution of this Agreement, the Company shall duly approve and adopt
resolutions of the Company Board appointing, effective as of the Effective Time,
the Employee Benefit Plans Committee of Parent (provided that it consists of at
least three members) as the sole Plan Administrator under all Company Benefit
Plans and appointing, effective as of the Effective Time, the Employee Benefit
Investment Committee of Parent as the sole fiduciary for investment of the
assets of all Company Benefit Plans, each case in form and substance approved in
writing by Parent.

                  (e) The Company acknowledges and agrees that benefits payable
in the event of a change of control under the Company's Benefit Restoration
Plan, effective as of January 1, 1994, as amended, shall be paid in accordance
with the terms of the Company's Benefit Restoration Plan, subject to the offset
for benefits payable pursuant to the Company's Retirement Plan, as amended,
including but not limited to Amendment No. 13, which will be applied as if the
IRS had already issued the determination letter referenced in it provided that,
to the extent such Amendment No. 13 is the subject of an unfavorable IRS
determination letter or the Company elects not to pursue a favorable IRS
determination letter covering (or withdraws a determination application to the
extent applicable to) such Amendment No. 13, the Company shall make an
additional payment as soon as practical thereafter (together with interest at an
annualized rate equal to the so-called composite "prime rate" as quoted from
time to time during the relevant period in the Southwest Edition of The Wall
Street Journal, plus two percent (2%)) to each affected participant, who
participated in the Company's Benefit Restoration Plan at the Effective Time,
equal to the amount that would have been paid had Amendment No. 13 not been in
effect, less any amounts actually paid since the Effective Time.

                  (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 6.12 is not
intended to and shall not require Parent to continue any Company Benefit Plan
beyond the time when it otherwise lawfully could be terminated or modified, or
to provide any Continuing Employee with any rights to continued employment,
severance pay (except as provided in Section 6.12(a)(i)) or similar benefits
following any termination of employment.

         6.13 Standstill Provisions. The parties hereto acknowledge that Parent
and the Company have previously executed the Confidentiality Agreement which
shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms, provided,
however, that the standstill restrictions on Parent and Merger Sub set forth in
the Confidentiality Agreement are hereby waived by the Company, provided
however, that in the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1
such standstill restrictions shall survive in accordance with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

         6.14 Third Party Consents; Notices. The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts, to the extent requested by Parent, to obtain and deliver to
Parent at or prior to the Closing, all consents, waivers and approvals under
each Material Contract set forth on Section 6.14 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, using a form reasonably acceptable to Parent. The Company shall give
all notices and other information required to be given to the employees of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, any collective bargaining unit representing
any group of employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary and any
applicable Governmental Entity under the WARN Act, the National Labor Relations
Act, as amended, the Code, COBRA and other applicable Laws in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

         6.15 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take all such steps as may be required (to the extent permitted under applicable
Law) to cause any disposition of Company Common Shares (including derivative
securities with respect to Company Common Shares) resulting from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is subject to
the reporting

                                      -56-
<PAGE>

requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company to
be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

         6.16 Reasonable Efforts; Cooperation. Subject to the limitations set
forth in Section 6.6(d), each of the parties hereto agrees to use reasonable
best efforts, and to cooperate with each other party hereto, to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably
necessary, appropriate or desirable to consummate and make effective, in the
most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, including (i) taking all reasonable actions necessary to
satisfy the respective conditions set forth in Article 7 and (ii) executing and
delivering such other instruments and doing and performing such other acts and
things as may be necessary or reasonably desirable to effect completely the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. The
Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed of, and cooperate with Parent in
connection with, any stockholder litigation or claim against the Company or its
directors and officers relating to the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, provided, however, that no settlement of any
such litigation shall be agreed to without Parent's consent, and provided,
further that all obligations in this Section 6.16 shall be subject to
obligations of the Company under applicable Laws relating to attorney-client
communication and privilege.

         6.17 Notes Tender Offer.

                  (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been
terminated in accordance with Section 8.1, the Company will commence a tender
offer (the "Notes Tender Offer") for all of the $200,000,000 aggregate principal
amount at maturity of the 7-5/8% Senior Notes due 2011 (the "Senior Notes") as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution of this Agreement, but in
no event later than the mailing of the Company Proxy Statement. The aggregate
consideration payable to each holder of Senior Notes pursuant to the Notes
Tender Offer shall be an amount in cash established by Parent. The Notes Tender
Offer shall be made pursuant to an Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation
Statement prepared by the Company in connection with the Notes Tender Offer in
form and substance satisfactory to Parent (as amended from time to time, the
"Notes Offer to Purchase").

                  (b) As part of the Notes Tender Offer, the Company shall
solicit the consent of the holders of the Senior Notes, to amend, eliminate or
waive certain sections (as selected by Parent) of the Senior Notes Indenture
(the "Notes Consents"). The Surviving Corporation's obligation to accept for
payment and pay for the Senior Notes tendered pursuant to the Notes Tender Offer
or make any payment for the Notes Consents shall be subject to the conditions
that (i) the conditions set forth in Article 7 below shall have been satisfied
or waived, (ii) the simultaneous occurrence of the Effective Time and (iii) such
other conditions as are customary for transactions similar to the Notes Tender
Offer. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Notes Tender Offer, the Parent
agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation to accept for payment, as promptly as
practicable after expiration of the Notes Tender Offer, all Senior Notes validly
tendered and not withdrawn. The Company will not waive any of the conditions to
the Notes Tender Offer without the prior written consent of Parent.

                  (c) The Company shall prepare, as promptly as practicable, the
Notes Offer to Purchase, together with related letters of transmittal and
similar ancillary agreements (such documents, together with all supplements and
amendments thereto, being referred to herein collectively as the "Notes Tender
Offer Documents"), relating to the Notes Tender Offer and to disseminate to the
record holders of the Senior Notes, and to the extent known by the Company, the
beneficial owners of the Senior Notes (collectively, the "Noteholders"), the
Notes Tender Offer Documents; provided, however, that prior to the dissemination
thereof, the Company shall consult with Parent with respect to the Notes Tender
Offer Documents and shall include in such Notes Tender Offer Documents all
comments reasonably proposed by Parent. Parent shall provide the Company with
any information for inclusion in the Notes Tender

                                      -57-
<PAGE>

Offer Documents which may be required under applicable Law and which is
reasonably requested by the Company. If at any time prior to the acceptance of
Senior Notes pursuant to the Notes Tender Offer any event should occur that is
required by applicable Law to be set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement
to, the Notes Tender Offer Documents, the Company will prepare and disseminate
such amendment or supplement; provided, however, that prior to such
dissemination, the Company shall consult with Parent with respect to such
amendment or supplement and shall include in such Notes Tender Offer Documents
all comments reasonably proposed by Parent. The Company will notify Parent at
least 48 hours prior to the dissemination of the Notes Tender Offer Documents,
or 24 hours prior to the mailing of any amendment or supplement thereto, to the
Noteholders.

                  (d) At such time as the Company receives consents from
Noteholders holding at least a majority of the aggregate principal amount of
Senior Notes, the Company agrees to execute, and to cause all of the guarantors
that are a party to the Senior Notes Indenture to execute, and will use
reasonable best efforts to cause the trustee under the Senior Notes Indenture to
execute, a supplemental indenture (the "Supplemental Indenture") in order to
give effect to the amendments of the Indenture contemplated in the Notes Tender
Offer Documents; provided, however, that notwithstanding the fact that the
Supplemental Indenture will become effective upon such execution, the proposed
amendments set forth therein (the "Proposed Amendments") will not become
operative unless and until all conditions to the Notes Tender Offer have been
satisfied or waived by the Company and the Company accepts all Senior Notes (and
related consents) validly tendered for purchase and payment pursuant to the
Notes Tender Offer. In such event, the parties hereto agree that the Proposed
Amendments will be deemed operative as of immediately prior to such acceptance
for payment, and the Company will thereafter be obligated to make all payments
for the Senior Notes (and related consents) so tendered.

                                    ARTICLE 7
                               Closing Conditions

respective obligations of each party to effect the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated herein shall be subject to the satisfaction, at or
prior to the Effective Time, of the following conditions, any or all of which
may be waived, in whole or in part, to the extent permitted by applicable Law:

                  (a) Company Stockholders Approval. The Company Stockholders
Approval shall have been obtained.

                  (b) No Order. No Governmental Entity shall have obtained,
enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any statute, rule, regulation,
executive order, decree, judgment, injunction, arbitration award, finding or
other order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent), in any case that is
in effect and prevents or prohibits consummation of the Merger (each, a
"Restraint").

                  (c) HSR Act. Any applicable waiting periods, together with any
extensions thereof, under the (i) HSR Act and (ii) other Antitrust Laws required
to consummate the Merger shall have expired or been terminated.

         7.2 Additional Conditions to Obligations of Parent and Merger Sub. The
obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to effect the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated herein are also subject to the satisfaction, at or
prior to the Effective Time, of the following conditions:

and warranties of the Company contained in Section 4.1, Section 4.3, Section

                                      -58-
<PAGE>

Effective Time (except that those representations and warranties that address
matters only as of a particular date need only be true and correct as of such
date) and (ii) all other representations and warranties of the Company contained
in this Agreement and in any certificate or other writing delivered by the
Company pursuant hereto, in each case disregarding and without giving any effect
to all qualifications and exceptions contained herein and therein relating to
materiality or Material Adverse Effect or any similar standard or qualification,
shall be true and correct as of the date hereof and as of the Effective Time
(except that those representations and warranties that address matters only as
of a particular date need only be true and correct as of such date), except
where the failure of such representations and warranties to be so true and
correct has not had and would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect.

                  (b) Agreements and Covenants. The Company shall have performed
or complied in all material respects with all agreements and covenants required
by this Agreement to be performed or complied with by it on or prior to the

                  (c) Material Adverse Effect. There shall not have occurred any
Material Adverse Effect.

arbitration or investigation shall be pending or threatened in which any
Governmental Entity is a party wherein an unfavorable injunction, judgment,
order, decree, ruling or charge would (i) prevent, restrain or otherwise
interfere with the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or (ii) affect adversely the right or powers of Parent to own, operate
or control the Company or any portion of the business or assets of the Company
or Parent, and no such injunction, judgment, order, decree, ruling or charge
shall be in effect.

                  (e) Sarbanes-Oxley Certifications. With respect to any of the
Company SEC Reports filed with the SEC after the date of this Agreement, neither
the principal executive officer nor the principal financial officer of the
Company shall have failed to provide the necessary certifications in the form
required under Section 302 and Section 906 of the SOXA.

                  (f) Officer's Certificate. The Company shall have delivered to

dated as of the Closing Date, to the effect that the conditions set forth in
this Section 7.2 have been satisfied.

         7.3 Additional Conditions to Obligations of the Company. The obligation
of the Company to effect the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
herein are also subject to the satisfaction, at or prior to the Effective Time,
of the following conditions:

                  (a) Representations and Warranties. (i) The representations
and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub contained in Section 5.1, Section 5.3
and Section 5.4 shall be true and correct in all material respects as of the
date hereof and as of the Effective Time as though made on and as of the
Effective Time (except that those representations and warranties that address
matters only as of a particular date need only be true and correct as of such
date) and (ii) all other representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub
contained in this Agreement and in any certificate or other writing delivered by
Parent or Merger Sub pursuant hereto, in each case disregarding and without
giving any effect to all qualifications and exceptions contained herein and
therein relating to materiality or Parent Material Adverse Effect or any similar
standard or qualification pursuant hereto shall be true and correct as of the
date hereof and as of the Effective Time (except that those representations and
warranties that address matters only as of a particular date need only be true
and correct as of such date), except where

                                      -59-
<PAGE>

the failure of such representations and warranties to be so true and correct has
not had and would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.

                  (b) Agreements and Covenants. Parent shall have performed or
complied with, in all material respects, all agreements and covenants required
by this Agreement to be performed or complied with by it on or prior to the
Effective Time.

                  (c) Officer's Certificate. Parent shall have delivered to the
Company a certificate, signed by an authorized officer of Parent and dated as of
the Closing Date, to the effect that the conditions set forth in this Section
7.3 have been satisfied.

                        Termination, Amendment and Waiver

         8.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated, and the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be abandoned, at any
time prior to the Effective Time, by action taken or authorized by the Board of
Directors of the terminating party or parties, whether before or after the
Company Stockholders Approval has been obtained:

                  (a) By mutual written consent of Parent and the Company, by
action of their respective Boards of Directors;

                  (b) By either Parent or the Company if the Merger shall not
have been consummated prior to November 30, 2006; provided, however, that such
date may, from time to time, be extended by Parent (by written notice thereof to
the Company) or by the Company (by written notice thereof to Parent) up to and
including February 28, 2007, in the event all conditions to effect the Merger
other than one or more conditions set forth in Section 7.1(c) (the "Regulatory
Conditions") have been or are capable of being satisfied at the time of each
such extension and the Regulatory Conditions have been or are reasonably capable
of being satisfied on or prior to February 28, 2007 (such earlier date, as it
may be so extended, shall be referred to herein as the "Outside Date");
provided, further, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
8.1(b) shall not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill any of its
obligations under this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the
failure of the Merger to be consummated on or before such date;

                  (c) By either Parent or the Company subject to Section 6.7(d)
of this Agreement if any Governmental Entity shall have issued a Restraint;
provided that the party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 8.1(c) shall have satisfied its obligations under Section 6.7;

                  (d) By either Parent or the Company if the Company
Stockholders Approval shall not have been obtained upon a vote taken thereon at
the Company Stockholders Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof;
provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
8.1(d) shall not be available to the Company where the failure to obtain the
Company Stockholders Approval is caused by any action or failure to act of the
Company that constitutes a breach of this Agreement; provided, further, that no
termination by the Company pursuant to this Section 8.1(d) shall be effective
unless concurrently therewith it fulfills its obligations under Section 8.2;

                  (e) By Parent if (at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholders Approval) (i) the Company Board or any committee thereof shall for
any reason have withheld, withdrawn, amended or modified in a manner adverse to
Parent the Company Board Recommendation, (ii) the Company shall have failed to
include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (iii) the
Company Board or any committee thereof shall have approved or publicly
recommended any Acquisition Proposal,

<PAGE>

(iv) the Company shall have entered into any letter of intent with respect to or
other Contract for any Acquisition Proposal, (v) the Company shall have
materially breached any of the provisions of Sections 6.4 or 6.6, or (vi) a
tender or exchange offer relating to securities of the Company shall have been
commenced by a Person unaffiliated with Parent, and the Company shall not have
sent to its security holders pursuant to Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the
Securities Act, within ten (10) Business Days after such tender or exchange
offer is first published sent or given, a statement disclosing that the Company
recommends rejection of such tender or exchange offer;

                  (f) By Parent, if there shall have been or have been disclosed
any Effect that constitutes a Material Adverse Effect or if (i)(A) the Company
shall have materially breached any of its covenants or agreements set forth in
this Agreement or (B) any representation or warranty of the Company set forth in
this Agreement shall have become materially untrue or incorrect, (ii) such
breach or misrepresentation, if curable, is not cured within twenty (20)
Business Days after written notice thereof, and (iii) such breach or
misrepresentation would cause the conditions set forth in Section 7.2(a) or
Section 7.2(b) not to be satisfied;

                  (g) By the Company, if (i)(A) either Parent or Merger Sub has
materially breached any of its covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement or (B) any representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub set
forth in this Agreement shall have become materially untrue or incorrect, (ii)
such breach or misrepresentation, if curable, is not cured within twenty (20)
Business Days after written notice thereof, and (iii) such breach or
misrepresentation would cause the conditions set forth in Section 7.3(a) or
Section 7.3(b) not to be satisfied; or

                  (h) By Company, in accordance with Section 6.6(d); provided,

8.1(h) to be deemed effective, Company shall have complied with Section 6.6(d)
and concurrently therewith fulfilled its obligation under Section 8.2.

         8.2 Effect of Termination.

                  (a) Limitation on Liability. In the event of termination of
this Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in Section 8.1, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and there shall be no liability or
obligation on the part of Parent or the Company or their respective
Subsidiaries, officers, directors or stockholders, except (i) with respect to
Section 6.5 (Confidentiality), Section 6.9 (Public Announcements), this Section
8.2 (Effects of Termination) and Article 9 (General Provisions) and (ii) with
respect to any liabilities or damages incurred or suffered by a party as a
result of the willful breach by the other party of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or other agreements set forth in this Agreement.

                  (b) Parent Expenses. Parent and the Company agree that if this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(d) (at a time when the condition
described in Section 8.2(c)(iv)(B) exists), Section 8.1(e) or Section 8.1(h)
then the Company shall pay Parent an amount equal to the sum of Parent's
Expenses in an amount not to exceed $2,500,000. Payment of Parent's Expenses
shall be made no later than two (2) Business Days after delivery to the Company
of notice of demand for payment and a documented itemization setting forth in
reasonable detail all of Parent's Expenses (which itemization may be
supplemented and updated from time to time by Parent until the 90th day after
Parent delivers such notice of demand for payment).

                  (c) Company Termination Fee. In addition to any payment
required by Section 8.2(b), the Company shall pay to Parent a termination fee of
$44,400,000 in immediately available funds in the event that this Agreement is
terminated (i) by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(e), (ii) by the Company
pursuant to Section 8.1(d) if at such time Parent was entitled to terminate
pursuant to

                                      -61-
<PAGE>

Section 8.1(e), (iii) by Company pursuant to Section 8.1(h) or (iv) (A) in the
event that this Agreement is terminated by either party pursuant to Section
8.1(d) (other than by the Company if at such time Parent was entitled to
terminate pursuant to Section 8.1(e)), (B) at any time after the date of this
Agreement and before the vote on this Agreement of the Company Stockholders
Meeting, an Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company shall have been
publicly announced, and (C) the Company enters into a definitive agreement with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal, or an Acquisition Proposal is consummated,
within twelve (12) months following the termination of this Agreement. For
purposes of the directly preceding sentence, references (x) to "10%" in clauses
(i) and (iii) of the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be
a reference to "50% and (y) to "Company Subsidiaries" in such definition shall
be deemed to be a reference to "Company Subsidiaries" that constitute a
"significant subsidiary" (as defined in Rule 1.-02(w) of Regulation S-X).
Payment of any amount described in Section 8.2(b) and this Section shall not be
in lieu of damages incurred in the event of willful breach of this Agreement.
Any payment required to be made pursuant to Section 8.2(c)(i), 8.2(c)(ii) or
8.2(c)(iii) shall be made no later than two (2) Business Days after the date of
termination. Any payment required to be made pursuant to Section 8.2(c)(iv)
shall be made no later than two (2) Business Days after the entering into of a
definitive agreement with respect to, or the consummation of, an Acquisition
Proposal. All payments under this Section 8.2 shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by Parent. The Company
acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.2 are an integral
part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these
agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the
Company fails promptly to pay any amount due to the other party pursuant to this
Section 8.2 and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit that
results in a judgment against the Company for all or any portion of the amounts
set forth in this Section 8.2, the Company shall pay to Parent its costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the aggregate amount of the
fees and expenses at a rate equal to the prime rate reported in The Wall Street
Journal on the date such payment was required to be made plus 2%.

         8.3 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto,
whether before or after the Company Stockholders' Approval has been obtained, at
any time prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that, after the Company
Stockholders Approval has been obtained, no amendment may be made without
further stockholder approval that, by Law or in accordance with the rules of any
relevant stock exchange, requires further approval by such stockholders. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by the
parties hereto.

         8.4 Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party hereto
may (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
acts of the other party hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of the other party contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto, and (iii) waive compliance by the other
party with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing
signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby, but such extension or waiver
or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant,
agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with
respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

         8.5 Fees and Expenses. Subject to Section 8.2, all Expenses incurred by
the parties hereto shall be borne solely and entirely by the party that has
incurred the same; provided, however, that each of Parent and the Company shall
pay one-half of the filing fee(s) for filings made pursuant to Antitrust Laws;
provided further that Parent shall reimburse all Expenses up to an aggregate of
$625,000 incurred by the Company in connection with the Notes Tender Offer in
the event this Agreement is terminated other than pursuant to Sections 8.1(d)
(at a time when the condition described in Section 8.2(c)(iv)(B) exists), (e) or
(h).

         9.1 Non-Survival of Representations and Warranties. None of the
representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered

contemplates performance after the Effective Time.

reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

         9.4 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of
the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end
that transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

                                      -64-

assignment without such consent shall be null and void. Notwithstanding the

interests and obligations under this Agreement to any wholly owned Parent
Subsidiary without the Company's consent.

         9.7 Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
solely to the benefit of each party hereto and their respective successors and
assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, other than pursuant
to Section 6.10, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right,
benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

         9.8 Mutual Drafting. Each party hereto has participated in the
preparation and drafting of this Agreement, which each party acknowledges is the
result of extensive negotiations between the parties.

         9.9 Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Trial by Jury.

                  (a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware without reference to such
state's principles of conflicts of law.

                  (b) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or Federal court
of the United States of America, located in the State of Delaware, and any
appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the agreements delivered in connection herewith or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or for recognition or
enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the parties hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence any such action or
proceeding except in such courts, (ii) agrees that any claim in respect of any
such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such Delaware state
court or, to the extent permitted by Law, in such Federal court, (iii) waives,
to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection that
it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such action or
proceeding in any such Delaware state or Federal court, and (iv) waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such Delaware state or Federal
court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such
action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.
Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the
manner provided for notices in Section 9.2. Nothing in this Agreement will
affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other
manner permitted by Law.

                  (c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY
THAT MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND
DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY
OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (1) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY
OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK
TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (2) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (3) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (4) IT
HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.9(c).

         9.10 Disclosure. Any matter disclosed in any section of a party's
disclosure schedule shall be considered disclosed for other sections of such
disclosure schedule, but only to the extent that it would be readily apparent
that such matter on its face would apply to a particular section of a party's
disclosure schedule. The provision of monetary or other quantitative thresholds
for disclosure does not and shall not be deemed to create or imply a standard of
materiality hereunder.

         9.11 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
original or facsimile counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in
separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an
original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
agreement.

         9.12 Remedies Cumulative; Specific Performance. Except as otherwise
provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party
hereto shall be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy
conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a
party hereto of any one remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any other
remedy and nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed a waiver by any party of
any right to specific performance or injunctive relief. The parties hereto agree
that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity. Each party hereto
agrees to waive any requirement for the posting of, or securing of, a bond in
connection with any such remedy.

         9.13 Agreement to Protect Parent's Acquired Goodwill. As part of the
Merger, certain employee stockholders have executed non-competition agreements
agreeing not to compete, not to solicit employees, and not to solicit customers
during the time they are employed by Parent and for two (2) years thereafter,

of the corporation, to the full extent permitted from time to time by the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware as the same exists or may

                               AND RESTATED BYLAWS

                                       OF

                                  AVIALL, INC.

                               ARTICLE 1. OFFICES

        The principal office of the corporation shall be located at its
principal place of business, which at the time of adoption of these Bylaws is
100 N. Riverside Drive, Chicago, IL 60606-1596. The corporation may have such
other offices, either within or without the State of Delaware, as the Board of
Directors ("Board") may designate or as the business of the corporation may
require from time to time.

                             ARTICLE 2. STOCKHOLDERS

        2.1 Annual Meeting. The annual meeting of stockholders shall be held on
a date and at a time designated by the Board, for the purpose of electing
directors and transacting such other business as may properly come before the
meeting. If the day fixed for the annual meeting is a legal holiday at the place
of the meeting, the meeting shall be held on the next succeeding business day.
If the election of directors is not held on the day designated for the annual
meeting of stockholders, or at any adjournment thereof, the election shall be
held at a special meeting of the stockholders called as soon thereafter as
practicable.

        2.2 Special Meetings. The President, the Board, or the holders of not
less than one-tenth of all the outstanding shares of the corporation entitled to
vote at the meeting may call special meetings of the stockholders for any
purpose.

        2.3 Place of Meeting. All meetings shall be held at the principal office
of the corporation or at such other place within or without the State of
Delaware designated by the Board or by any persons entitled to call a meeting
hereunder, or by a waiver of notice signed by all of the stockholders entitled
to vote at the meeting.

        2.4 Notice of Meeting. The President, the Secretary, the Board, or
stockholders calling an annual or special meeting of stockholders as provided
for herein, shall cause to be delivered to each stockholder entitled to vote at
the meeting either personally or by mail, not less than ten nor more than sixty
days before the meeting, written notice stating the place, day, and hour of the
meeting and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose of purposes for which
the meeting is called. If such notice is mailed, it shall be deemed delivered
when deposited in the United States mail properly addressed to the stockholders
at their respective addresses as they appear on the stock transfer books of the
corporation, with postage prepaid.

                                      -1-
<PAGE>

        2.5 Waiver of Notice. Whenever any notice is required to be given to any
stockholder under the provisions of these Bylaws or the Certificate of
Incorporation or the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware ("DGCL"),
a waiver thereof in writing, signed by the person or persons entitled to such
notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed
equivalent to the giving of such notice.

        2.6 Fixing of Record Date for Determining Stockholders. For the purpose
of determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of
stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or stockholders entitled to receive
payment of any dividend, or in order to make a determination of stockholders for
any other purpose, the Board may fix in advance a date as the record date for
any such determination. Such record date shall be not more than fifty days and,
in case of a meeting of stockholders, not less than ten days prior to the date
on which the particular action requiring such determination is to be taken. If
no record date is fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote
at a meeting or to receive payment of a dividend, the date and hour on which the
notice of meeting is mailed or on which the resolution of the Board declaring
such dividend is adopted, as the case may be, shall be the record date and time
for such determination. When a determination of stockholders entitled to vote at
any meeting of stockholders has been made as provided in this section, such
determination shall apply to any adjournment thereof.

        2.7 Voting List. At least ten days before each meeting of stockholders,
a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting, or any
adjournment thereof, shall be made, arranged in alphabetical order, with the
address of and number of shares held by each stockholder. This list shall be
open to inspection in accordance with the DGCL for a period of ten days prior to
such meeting. The list shall be kept open at such meeting for the inspection of
any stockholder.

        2.8 Quorum. A majority of the outstanding shares of the corporation
entitled to vote, represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum
at a meeting of the stockholders. If less than a majority of the outstanding
shares are represented at a meeting, a majority of the shares so represented may
adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice. At a meeting
adjourned and reconvened, if a quorum is present or represented at the
reconvened meeting, any business may be transacted that might have been
transacted at the meeting as originally notified. The stockholders present at a
duly organized meeting may continue to transact business until adjournment,
notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a
quorum.

        2.9 Manner of Acting. If a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of
the majority of the shares represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on
the subject matter shall be the act of the stockholders, unless the vote of a
greater number is required by these Bylaws, the Certificate of Incorporation, or
the DGCL.

                                      -2-
<PAGE>

        2.10 Proxies. A stockholder may vote by proxy executed in writing by the
stockholder or by the stockholder's attorney-in- fact. Such proxy shall be filed
with the Secretary of the corporation before or at the time of the meeting.
Unless otherwise provided in the proxy, a proxy shall be invalid after eleven
months from the date of its execution.

        2.11 Voting of Shares. Each outstanding share entitled to vote shall be
entitled to one vote upon each matter submitted to a vote at a meeting of
stockholders.

        2.12 Action by Stockholders Without a Meeting. Any action required or
permitted to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders may be taken without a
meeting if a written consent setting forth the action so taken is signed by all
stockholders entitled to vote with respect to the subject matter thereof. Any
such consent shall be inserted in the minute book as if it were the minutes of a
meeting of the stockholders.

                          ARTICLE 3. BOARD OF DIRECTORS

        3.1 General Powers. The business and affairs of the corporation shall be
managed by the Board.

        3.2 Number and Tenure. The number of directors shall not be more than
seven and not fewer than one, as shall be determined from time to time by
resolution of the Board. The initial board shall be composed of six directors.
No decrease in the number of directors shall have the effect of shortening the
term of any incumbent director. Unless a director dies, resigns, or is removed,
each director shall hold office until the next annual meeting of stockholders or
until the director's successor is elected, whichever is later. Directors need
not be stockholders of the corporation or residents of the State of Delaware.

        3.3 Resignation. Any director may resign at any time by delivering
written notice to the President or the Secretary, or to the registered office of
the corporation, or by giving oral notice at any meeting of the directors or
stockholders.

        3.4 Annual and Regular Meetings. An annual Board meeting shall be held
without notice promptly after and at the same place as the annual meeting of the
stockholders. By resolution, the Board may specify the time and place either
within or without the State of Delaware for holding regular meetings without
other notice than such resolution.

        3.5 Special Meetings. Special Board meetings may be called by or at the
request of the President, the Secretary or any two directors. The person or
persons authorized to call special meetings may fix any place either within or
without the State of Delaware as the place for holding any special Board meeting
called by them.

                                      -3-
<PAGE>

        3.6 Notice of Special Meetings. Notice of each special meeting, stating
the time and place of the meeting, shall be given to each director by mail,
telephone, or other electronic transmission or personally. If by mail, such
notice shall be given not less than five days before the meeting; and if by
telephone, other electronic transmission or personally, not less than two days
before the meeting. Neither the business to be transacted at nor the purpose of
any special meeting need be specified in the notice of such meeting.

        3.7 Waiver of Notice.

                  3.7.1 Written. Whenever any notice is required to be given to
any director under the provisions of these Bylaws, the Certificate of
Incorporation, or the DGCL, a waiver thereof in writing, signed by the person or
persons entitled to such notice, whether before or after the time stated
therein, shall be deemed equivalent to the giving of such notice. Neither the
business to be transacted at nor the purpose of any regular or special meeting
of the Board need be specified in the waiver of notice of such meeting.

                  3.7.2 Attendance. The attendance of a director at a meeting
shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except where a director
attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any
business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.

        3.8 Quorum. Except as provided in these Bylaws, the Certificate of
Incorporation, or the DGCL, a majority of the total number of directors shall
constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any Board meeting but, if
less than a majority is present at a meeting, a majority of the directors
present may adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice.

        3.9 Manner of Acting. The act of the majority of the directors present
at a meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the Board, unless
the vote of a greater number is required by these Bylaws, the Certificate of
Incorporation, or the DGCL.

        3.10 Vacancies. Any vacancy occurring on the Board may be filled by the
affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors though less than a
quorum of the Board. A director elected to fill a vacancy shall be elected for
the unexpired term of such director's predecessor in office. Any directorship to
be filled by reason of an increase in the number of directors may be filled by
the Board for a term of office continuing only until the next election of
directors by the stockholders.

        3.11 Removal. At a meeting of stockholders called expressly for that
purpose, one or more members of the Board (including the entire Board) may be
removed, with or without cause, by a vote of the holders of a majority of the
shares then entitled to vote on the election of directors.

        3.12 Presumption of Assent. A director of the corporation present at a
Board meeting at which action on any corporate matter is taken shall be presumed
to have assented to the action taken unless such director's dissent is entered
in the minutes of the meeting, or unless such director files a written dissent
to such action with the person acting at the secretary of the meeting before the
adjournment thereof, or unless such director forwards such dissent by registered
mail to the Secretary of the corporation immediately after the adjournment of
the meeting. A director who voted in favor of such action may not dissent.

        3.13 Committees. The Board may, by resolution passed by a majority of
the whole Board, appoint standing or temporary committees, each committee to
consist of one or more directors of the corporation, and invest such committees
with such powers as it may see fit, subject to such conditions as may be
prescribed by the Board and by applicable law. The Board may designate one or
more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent
or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. In the absence or
disqualification of a member of a committee, the member or members thereof
present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not they
constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board to act
at the meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member. The
designation of any such committee and the delegation of authority thereto shall
not relieve the Board, or any member thereof, of any responsibility imposed by
law.

        3.14 Compensation. By Board resolution, directors and committee members
may be paid their expenses, if any, of attendance at each Board or committee
meeting, or a fixed sum for attendance at each Board or committee meeting, or a
stated salary as director or a committee member, or a combination of the
foregoing. No such payment shall preclude any director or committee member from
serving the corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation
therefor.

        3.15 Action by Directors Without a Meeting. Any action that could be
taken at a meeting of the Board or of any committee appointed by the Board may
be taken without a meeting if a written consent setting forth the action to be
taken is signed by each of the directors or by each committee member. Any such
written consent shall be inserted in the minute book as if it were the minutes
of a Board or a committee meeting.

        3.16 Meetings by Telephone. Members of the Board or any committee
thereof may participate in a meeting of such Board or committee by means of
conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all
persons participating in the meeting can hear each other. Participation by such
means shall constitute presence in person at a meeting

executed and filed with the Secretary of the corporation. All certificates

                    ARTICLE 10. INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE

        10.1 Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made
a party to or is involved in any action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a "proceeding"), by
reason of the fact that he or she or a person of whom he or she is the legal
representative is or was a director, officer or employee of the corporation or
is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer or
employee of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans,
whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity
as a director, officer or employee or in any other capacity while serving as a
director, officer or employee, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the
corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL as the same exists or
may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the
extent that such amendment permits the corporation to provide broader
indemnification rights than said law permitted the corporation to provide prior
to such amendment), against all expense, liability and loss (including, without
limitation, attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties
and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably

                                      -9-
<PAGE>

incurred or suffered by such person in connection therewith and such
indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director,
officer or employee and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs,
executors and administrators; provided, however, that except as provided in
section 10.2 of this Bylaw with respect to proceedings seeking to enforce rights
to indemnification, the corporation shall indemnify any such person seeking
indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by
such person only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the
Board of the corporation.

        10.2 If a claim under section 10.1 of this Bylaw is not paid in full by
the corporation within thirty days after a written claim has been received by
the corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the
corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in
whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of
prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an
action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any
proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking,
if any is required, has been tendered to the corporation) that the claimant has
not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible under the DGCL for
the corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden
of proving such defense shall be on the corporation. Neither the failure of the
corporation (including its Board, independent legal counsel or stockholders) to
have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that
indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she
has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual
determination by the corporation (including its Board, independent legal counsel
or stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of
conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the
claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.

        10.3 Following any "change in control" of the corporation of the type
required to be reported under Item 1 of Form 8-K promulgated under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, any determination as to entitlement
to indemnification shall be made by independent legal counsel selected by the
claimant, which such independent legal counsel shall be retained by the Board on
behalf of the corporation.

        10.4 The right to indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred
in defending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition conferred in this
Bylaw shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or
hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested
directors or otherwise.

        10.5 The corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect
itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation or
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise
against any expense,

                                      -10-
<PAGE>

liability or loss, whether or not the corporation would have the power to
indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the DGCL.

        10.6 The corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by
the Board, grant rights to indemnification, and rights to be paid by the
corporation the expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its
final disposition, to any agent of the corporation to the fullest extent of the
provisions of this Bylaw with respect to the indemnification and advancement of
expenses of directors, officers and employees of the corporation.

        10.7 The right to indemnification conferred in this Bylaw shall be a
contract right and shall include the right to be paid by the corporation the
expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final
disposition; provided, however, that if the DGCL requires, the payment of such
expenses incurred by a director or officer in his or her capacity as a director
or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by
such person while a director or officer, including, without limitation, service
to an employee benefit plan) in advance of the final disposition of a
proceeding, shall be made only upon delivery to the corporation of an
undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer, to repay all amounts so
advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such director or officer is
not entitled to be indemnified under this Bylaw or otherwise.

                             ARTICLE 11. AMENDMENTS

        These Bylaws may be altered, amended or repealed and new Bylaws may be
adopted by the Board at any regular or special meeting of the Board. The
stockholders may also make, alter, amend, and repeal the Bylaws of the
corporation at any annual meeting or at a special meeting called for that
purpose; and all Bylaws made by the directors may be amended, repealed, altered,
or modified by the stockholders at any regular or special meeting called for
that purpose.

              ARTICLE 12. ACTIONS BY THE CORPORATION AS STOCKHOLDER

        Each of the Chairman, the President, any Vice President and the
Secretary of the corporation may from time to time execute on behalf of the
corporation (a) waivers of notice of annual or special stockholders' meetings of
any of the corporation's subsidiary corporations or any other corporation the
stock of which is held by or for the benefit of the corporation; (b) written
consents to action taken without a meeting by all stockholders of such
corporations; and (c) proxies appointing persons to vote the stock of such
corporations that is held by or for the benefit of the corporation at annual or
special meetings for the purpose of electing directors of such corporations and
for the transaction of such other business as may properly come before such
meetings or any adjournment thereof, and instructing the person or persons so
appointed as to the manner of casting such vote or giving such consent.
