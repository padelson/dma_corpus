Purchase Agreement, dated as of December 14, 2001, by and among National
Broadcasting Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("PURCHASER"), Granite
Broadcasting Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("SELLER"), KNTV Television,
Inc., a Delaware corporation ("TV") and KNTV License, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("LICENSE CO.").   WHEREAS, Seller is the holder of all the
capital stock of TV, and TV is the holder of all the capital stock of License
Co.;   WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Seller has approved, and deems it
advisable and in the best interests of Seller to consummate, the acquisition
of TV by Purchaser; and   WHEREAS, each of the Boards of Directors of
Purchaser, TV and License Co. has approved, and deems it advisable and in the
best interests of its respective shareholders to consummate, the acquisition
of TV by Purchaser, which acquisition is to be effected by the purchase of
all the outstanding capital stock of TV by Purchaser upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein.   NOW, THEREFORE, in
consideration of the foregoing and the mutual representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements set forth herein, intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:   ARTICLE I   PURCHASE AND
SALE OF SHARES; OTHER CLOSING PAYMENTS   SECTION 1.1 SALE AND TRANSFER OF
SHARES. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the
Closing, Seller shall sell, convey, assign, transfer and deliver to Purchaser
the Shares, free and clear of all Encumbrances.   SECTION 1.2 THE PURCHASE
PRICE. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including
Section 1.3, in consideration of the aforesaid sale, conveyance, assignment,
transfer and delivery to Purchaser of the Shares, Purchaser shall pay to
Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account as
Seller specifies to Purchaser in writing not less than two Business Days
before the Closing Date, an amount (such amount, as adjusted pursuant to
Section 1.3, the "PURCHASE PRICE") equal to:   (a) $230,000,000 (the
"PRELIMINARY AMOUNT"), plus     (b) the amount, if any, by which Estimated
Working Capital exceeds zero, provided that if the Estimated Working Capital
exceeds the Capped Amount, then such amount shall be capped at the Capped
Amount, minus   (c) the amount, if any, by which Estimated Working Capital
is less than zero, plus   (d) subject to the terms of Exhibit 5.8, the
Excess Opex Amount, if any, minus   (e) subject to the terms of Exhibit
5.8, the Unpaid Opex Amount, if any, plus   (f) subject to the terms of
Exhibit 5.8, the Excess Capex Amount, if any, minus   (g) subject to the
terms of Exhibit 5.8, the Unpaid Capex Amount, if any.   SECTION 1.3
WORKING CAPITAL ADJUSTMENT. (a) Not less than 10 Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser a statement setting forth a
good faith estimate (the "RECEIVABLES ESTIMATE") by Seller of the amount of
Closing Date Receivables. Not less than 5 Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser a statement setting forth a good
faith estimate (the "ESTIMATE") by Seller of Actual Working Capital, which
statement shall, for the avoidance of doubt, include the Receivables
Estimate. Each of the Receivables Estimate and the Estimate shall
be calculated by Seller in accordance with GAAP as applied by Seller in
preparing the Financial Statements. Upon Purchaser\'s review of the statement
containing the Receivables Estimate, if Purchaser considers in its reasonable
judgment that any of the cash receivables under 120 days included in such
Receivables Estimate are, or are likely to be, uncollectible in the ordinary
course:   (i) any of such cash receivables as so selected  by Purchaser, up
to an aggregate of $2,000,000 (the "AGGREGATE  EXCLUDABLE CASH RECEIVABLES
AMOUNT"), shall be removed from the  Receivables Estimate contained in the
Estimate (such removed cash  receivables, the "EXCLUDED CASH
RECEIVABLES"),   (ii) the Estimate, as so amended, shall be the  "ESTIMATED
WORKING CAPITAL," and   (iii) for all purposes of this Agreement,  Actual
Working Capital shall be deemed to exclude the Excluded Cash 
Receivables.   Page 2    (b) Following the Closing, Purchaser shall
prepare, and Seller shall cooperate with Purchaser in preparing, a statement
setting forth the Actual Working Capital (the "ACTUAL WORKING CAPITAL
STATEMENT"). The Actual Working Capital Statement shall be prepared in
accordance with GAAP as applied by Seller in preparing the Financial
Statements and otherwise in accordance with the definition of Actual Working
Capital; provided however, that if:   (i) the amount of Excluded Cash
Receivables  is less than the Aggregate Excludable Cash Receivables Amount
(the  amount, if any, by which the amount of Excluded Cash Receivables is
less  than the Aggregate Excludable Cash Receivables Amount, being the 
"ADDITIONAL EXCLUDABLE CASH RECEIVABLES AMOUNT"), and   (ii) during the
course of preparation by  Purchaser of the Actual Working Capital Statement,
Purchaser considers  in its reasonable judgment that any of the cash
receivables under 120  days included in its calculation of Actual Working
Capital are, or are  likely to be, uncollectible in the ordinary
course,  then any of such cash receivables as so selected by Purchaser, up
to an aggregate amount equal to the Additional Excludable Cash Receivables
Amount, may be removed by Purchaser from its calculation of Actual Working
Capital (such removed cash receivables, the "ADDITIONAL EXCLUDED CASH
RECEIVABLES"), and for all purposes of this Agreement, Actual Working Capital
shall be deemed to exclude the Additional Excluded Cash Receivables.   (c)
Within 60 days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall deliver to Seller a
copy of the Actual Working Capital Statement along with a statement (the
"WORKING CAPITAL ADJUSTMENT NOTICE") of the amount by which the Estimated
Working Capital is more or less, as the case may be, than the Actual Working
Capital.   (d) If Seller disputes any item on the Actual Working
Capital Statement or Working Capital Adjustment Notice, then Seller shall
notify Purchaser, in writing (a "DISPUTE NOTICE"), of each disputed item
(collectively, the "DISPUTED AMOUNTS") and specify the amount thereof in
dispute within 30 days after delivery to it of the Working Capital Adjustment
Notice; provided that Seller shall not dispute any cash receivables under 120
days excluded from the calculation of Actual Working Capital by Purchaser in
accordance with Section 1.3(b). If Seller does not so notify Purchaser, (i)
Seller shall be deemed to have agreed with the calculation of Actual Working
Capital in the Actual Working Capital Statement and the information contained
in the Working Capital Adjustment Notice, (ii) there shall be deemed to be no
Disputed Amounts, (iii) "Actual Working Capital" shall be deemed to be the
amount set forth in the Actual Working Capital Statement and (iv) the date of
de-   Page 3   termination of the Actual Working Capital shall be the
date on which such 30-day period expired.   (e) If there are Disputed
Amounts and Purchaser and Seller resolve such disputes within 10 Business
Days after delivery to Purchaser of the Dispute Notice by Seller, then
"Actual Working Capital" shall be deemed to be the amount agreed to by Seller
and Purchaser and the date of determination of the Actual Working Capital
shall be the date on which Purchaser and Seller so agreed.   (f) If there
are Disputed Amounts and Purchaser and Seller cannot resolve any such dispute
within 10 Business Days after delivery to Purchaser of the Dispute Notice by
Seller, then such dispute shall be resolved by a nationally recognized
independent accounting firm reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and Seller
(the "INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTING FIRM"). If Purchaser and Seller do not agree
upon a mutually acceptable Independent Accounting Firm within such
10-Business-Day period, Purchaser and Seller shall each select a nationally
recognized independent accounting firm, and the Independent Accounting Firm
shall be selected by the firms chosen by Purchaser and Seller. The
Independent Accounting Firm shall resolve the Disputed Amounts and
determine the amount of "Actual Working Capital" as promptly as practicable,
provided that Purchaser and Seller shall request that the Independent
Accounting Firm render its determination within no later than 30 days after
submission of the Disputed Amounts for resolution by the Independent
Accounting Firm. The determination of "Actual Working Capital" by the
Independent Accounting Firm shall be final and binding on the parties and the
date of determination of the Actual Working Capital shall be the date on
which the Independent Accounting Firm makes its determination. Any expenses
relating to the engagement of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be
allocated evenly between Purchaser and Seller.   (g) If the Estimated
Working Capital is more than the Actual Working Capital, then Seller shall
pay to Purchaser within 5 Business Days from the applicable date of
determination of the Actual Working Capital, the amount by which the
Estimated Working Capital is more than the Actual Working Capital, provided
that if Estimated Working Capital is equal to or greater than the Capped
Amount, then Seller shall only be required to pay Purchaser the amount, if
any, by which the Capped Amount exceeds the Actual Working Capital.   (h) If
the Estimated Working Capital is less than the Actual Working Capital, then
Purchaser shall pay to Seller within 5 Business Days from the applicable date
of determination of the Actual Working Capital, the amount by which the
Estimated Working Capital is less than the Actual Working Capital, provided
that: (i) if Estimated Working Capital was equal to or greater than
the Capped Amount, then Purchaser shall not be required to make any payment
to Seller, and (ii) if Estimated Working Capital was less than the Capped
Amount, but Actual Working Capital is equal to or greater than the Capped
Amount,   Page 4   then Purchaser shall only be required to pay Seller
the amount, if any, by which the Estimated Working Capital is less than the
Capped Amount.   SECTION 1.4 REFUND BY PURCHASER OF UNEARNED
AFFILIATION PAYMENTS. If the Closing shall occur prior to December 31, 2002,
on the Closing Date, Purchaser shall refund to Seller an amount (the
"AFFILIATION REFUND Amount") of the 2002 Affiliation Payment Amount equal
to:   (a) the 2002 Affiliation Payment Amount, multiplied by   (b) a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days of calendar year 2002
from and including the day after the Closing Date to and including December
31, 2002, and the denominator of which is 365.   ARTICLE II   THE
CLOSING   SECTION 2.1 THE CLOSING. The sale and transfer of the Shares by
Seller to Purchaser shall take place at the offices of Akin, Gump,

subject only to Permitted Encumbrances and together with all endorsements
thereto reasonably requested by Purchaser including a non-imputation
endorsement.   SECTION 2.3 DELIVERIES BY PURCHASER. At the

Real Property. No real property owned by Seller is used in the operation of
the Station, is necessary for the operation of the business of TV or License

surveys relating to the Real Property and (ii) all documents evidencing all
Encumbrances upon the Real Property have heretofore been furnished to
Purchaser. There are no pending, or to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened

interfere with the use of any Real Property in connection with the operation
of the Station or the conduct of TV\'s and License Co.\'s business in all
material respects in the same manner as such business has been conducted
prior to the date hereof. Neither the whole nor any portion of the Real
Property nor any other assets of TV or License Co. is subject to any
governmental decree or order to be sold or is being condemned, expropriated
or otherwise taken by any public authority with or without payment of
compensation therefor, nor has any such condemnation, expropriation or
taking been proposed. Neither TV nor License Co. is a party to any lease,
sublease or similar arrangement (whether written or oral) under which TV or
License Co. is a lessor, sublessor or otherwise makes available for use by
any third party any portion of the Real Property.   (b) Neither TV nor
License Co. has received any written notice of, or other writing referring
to, or has any other actual knowledge of, any requirements or recommendations
by (i) any Governmental Entity or (ii) any insurance company that has issued
a policy covering any part of the Real Property or by any board of fire
underwriters or other body exercising similar functions, requiring any
repairs or work to be done on any part of the Real Property, which repair or
work has not been completed.   (c) TV is in possession of an Application for
Building Permit, dated July 19, 1979 and a duplicate original of the original
Certificate of Occupancy issued by the   Page 14    City of San Jose on
October 17, 1979 with respect to the Real Property in San Jose, California
owned by TV. True and complete copies of such permit and certificate and, to
the extent in Seller\'s, TV\'s or License Co.\'s possession, any other
licenses for the use and operation of the Real Property, have heretofore been
furnished to Purchaser. Neither TV nor License Co. has received any written
notice of its failure to obtain or maintain any appropriate easements or
rights of way, including proofs of dedication, required to use and operate
the Real Property in the manner in which the Real Property is currently being
used and operated. To the Knowledge of Seller no additional approvals,
permits or licenses will be required, as a result of the Transactions, to be
issued after the date hereof in order to permit TV and License Co., following
the Closing, to continue to own or operate the Real Property in the same
manner as heretofore, other than any such approvals, permits or licenses that
are ministerial in nature and are normally issued in due course upon
application therefore without further action by the applicant.   (d)
Neither TV nor License Co. is a party to, or, to the Knowledge of Seller, is
obligated under any option, right of first refusal or other contractual right
to sell, dispose of or lease any of the Real Property or any portion thereof
or interest therein to any Person other than Purchaser.   (e) There is no
contract or agreement to which TV or License Co. is a party, other than the
Leases, affecting any of the Real Property for which Purchaser will be
responsible or liable after Closing, or which is not terminable on thirty
(30) days\' notice without premium or penalty.   (f) Each of the parcels
owned by TV or License Co. is assessed for real estate tax purposes as a
wholly independent tax lot, separate from any adjoining land, buildings,
structures or other improvements.   (g) The rights of the holders of the
beneficial interests in easements or reservations thereof, rights of way,
highway and railroad crossings, sewers, electric and other utility lines,
telegraph and telephone lines, and all zoning, building code and other
covenants, conditions and restrictions as to the use of the Real Property
which encumber the Real Property do not materially interfere with the use of
such Real Property in connection with the operation of the Station or the
conduct of TV\'s and License Co.\'s business in all material respects in the
same manner as such business has been conducted prior to the date hereof and,
in the case of Real Property owned by TV and/or License Co., do not
materially adversely affect the value of the Real Property affected thereby,
as TV or License Co. (as applicable) reasonably value such owned Real
Property, for the operation of the Station or the conduct of TV and License
Co.\'s business (as applicable).   (h) As of the date hereof, the rights of
the holders of the beneficial interests in liens securing the claims of
materialmen, landlords and others, individually and in the aggregate, are not
substantial in amount, do not materially interfere with the present or  
Page 15    proposed use of any of the TV Assets subject thereto or
materially impair the conduct of the business of TV or License Co. and no
such liens secure amounts, or payments, that are past due.   SECTION 3.17
LEASES. Section 3.17 of the Disclosure Schedule lists all Leases. A true and
complete copy of each Lease has heretofore been delivered to Purchaser. Each
Lease is valid, binding and enforceable in accordance with its terms and is
in full force and effect except as such enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other laws relating to or affecting
creditors\' rights generally and the exercise of judicial discretion in
accordance with general equitable principles. No Person other than TV or
License Co. has any right to occupy or possess any portion of the Real
Property other than rights arising under Permitted Encumbrances (including
landlord\'s rights of access pursuant to the Leases). The leasehold estate
created by each Lease is free and clear of all Encumbrances other
than Permitted Encumbrances. There are no existing defaults by TV or License
Co., or to the Knowledge of Seller, by any landlord under any of the Leases.
No event has occurred that (whether with or without notice or lapse of time)
would constitute a default by TV or License Co. or, to the Knowledge of
Seller, any other party thereto under any Lease. None of Seller, TV or
License Co. has received written notice that any lessor under any Lease will
not consent (where such consent is necessary) to the consummation of the
Transactions without requiring any modification of the rights or obligations
of the lessee thereunder. No lease pursuant to which Seller leases any real
property is used in the operation of the Station, is necessary for the
operation of the business of TV or License Co., or is included in the
definition of Seller TV Asset.   SECTION 3.18 PLANT AND EQUIPMENT. To the
Knowledge of Seller, the structures and equipment owned or used by TV and
License Co. are structurally sound with no known defects and are in good
operating condition and repair (ordinary wear and tear excepted) and are
adequate for the uses to which they are being put. To the Knowledge of
Seller, none of such structures or equipment are in need of maintenance or
repairs except for ordinary, routine maintenance and repairs which are not
material in nature or cost. To the Knowledge of Seller, the roof of each
structure on any Real Property that is owned by TV or License Co. is
watertight and in good repair and condition. Neither TV nor License Co. has
received written notification that it is in violation of any applicable
building, zoning, health or other law, ordinance or regulation in respect of
their operations or the Real Property. No structures or plants owned by
Seller are used in the operation of the Station, are necessary for the
operation of the business of TV or License Co., or are included in
the definition of Seller TV Assets.   SECTION 3.19 ENVIRONMENTAL

all Environmental Laws including the possession by TV and License Co. of all
permits and other gov-   Page 16    ernmental authorizations required
under all applicable Environmental Laws, and is in compliance with the terms
and conditions thereof.   (b) Since January 1, 1995, none of Seller, TV or
License Co. has received any written, or to the Knowledge of Seller, oral
communication, from a Governmental Entity, that alleges that TV or License
Co. is not in full compliance with any Environmental Laws.   (c) There is
no Environmental Claim by any Person that is pending or, to the Knowledge of
Seller, threatened against Seller, TV or License Co., or against any Person
whose liability for any Environmental Claim Seller, TV or License Co. has
retained or assumed either contractually or by operation of law. To the
Knowledge of Seller, no Encumbrance has been threatened to be placed on any
Real Property (currently or previously owned, leased or used) under any
Environmental Law.   (d) There are no past or present actions,
activities, circumstances, conditions, events or incidents, including the
use, storage, release, emission, discharge, presence or disposal of any
Materials of Environmental Concern, or exposure of any Persons to any
condition, that to the Knowledge of Seller could form the basis of any
Environmental Claim against Seller, TV or License Co. or against any Person
whose liability for any Environmental Claim TV or License Co. has retained or
assumed either contractually or by operation of law.   (e) Without in any
way limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.19,
(i) since January 1, 1995, all on-site and off-site locations where TV or

investigations or audit, and analysis that is in the possession of Seller, TV
or License Co. regarding environmental matters pertaining to or the
environmental condition of TV and License Co. or any Real Property currently
or previously owned, leased or used, or the compliance (or noncompliance) by
TV or License Co. with any Environmental Laws.   Page 17     (g)
Neither TV nor License Co. is subject to any Environmental Laws presently

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.   (a) Section 3.25 of the Disclosure Schedule
contains a true and complete list of all Plans. Other than as may be required
by law, none of Seller, TV, License Co. nor any ERISA Affiliate has any
commitment or formal plan, whether legally binding or not, to create any
additional employee benefit plan or modify or change any existing Plan that
would affect any director, consultant or employee or former director,
consultant or employee of TV or License Co. which could cause any liability
to Purchaser, TV or License Co. Section 3.25 of the Disclosure Schedule
identifies each Plan that is subject to Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or
Section 412 of the Code (each such Plan, a "TITLE IV PLAN"). Section 3.25 of
the Disclosure Schedule specifically identifies each Plan maintained solely
by TV (each, a "TV PLAN").   (b) Seller has heretofore delivered or made
available to Purchaser a true and complete copy of each Plan and any
amendments thereto (or if a Plan is not a written Plan, a description
thereof), each agreement creating or modifying any related trust or other
funding vehicle, the most recent reports or summaries required under ERISA or
the Code and the most recent determination letter received from the Internal
Revenue Service with respect to each Plan intended to qualify under Section
401 of the Code.   (c) No liability under Title IV or Section 302 of
ERISA has been incurred by Seller, TV, License Co. or any ERISA Affiliate
that could cause any liability to Purchaser, TV or License Co. following
the Closing, and no condition exists that presents a material risk to
Purchaser, TV or License Co. of incurring any such liability, other than
liability for premiums due the PBGC (all of which premiums have been paid
when due).   (d) The PBGC has not instituted proceedings to terminate any
Title IV Plan and no condition exists that presents a material risk that such
proceedings will be instituted.   (e) With respect to each Title IV Plan,
the present value of accrued benefits under such plan, based upon the
actuarial assumptions used for funding purposes in the most recent actuarial
report prepared by such plan\'s actuary with respect to such plan did not
exceed, as of its latest valuation date, the then current value of the assets
of such plan allocable to such accrued benefits.   (f) No Title IV Plan or
any trust established thereunder has incurred any "accumulated funding
deficiency" (as defined in Section 302 of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code),
whether or not waived, as of the last day of the most recent fiscal year of
each Title IV Plan ended prior to the Closing Date. All contributions
required to be made with respect to any Plan have been timely made or
reflected on the Financial Statements.   Page 21     (g) No Title IV
Plan is a "multi-employer pension plan" as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA,
nor is any Title IV Plan a plan described in Section 4063(a) of ERISA.
Neither TV and License Co. nor any ERISA Affiliate has made or suffered a
"complete withdrawal" or a "partial withdrawal," as such terms are
respectively defined in Sections 4203 and 4205 of ERISA (or any liability
resulting therefrom has been satisfied in full) pursuant to which TV or
License Co. could have liability at or following the Closing.   (h) To the
extent Purchaser or TV could have liability following the Closing, none of
Seller, TV, License Co., any Plan, any trust created thereunder, nor any
trustee or administrator thereof has engaged in a transaction in connection
with which TV, License Co., any Plan, any such trust, or any trustee or
administrator thereof, or any party dealing with any Plan or any such trust
could be subject to either a civil penalty assessed pursuant to Section 409
or 502(i) of ERISA or a tax imposed pursuant to Section 4975 or 4976 of the
Code.   (i) Each Plan intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of
Section 401(a) of the Code (each, an "EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN") is so qualified
and the trusts maintained thereunder are exempt from taxation under Section
501(a) of the Code.   (j) No Plan that is sponsored by TV or License
Co. provides medical, surgical, hospitalization, death or similar
benefits (whether or not insured) for employees or former employees of TV or
License Co. for periods extending beyond their retirement or other
termination of service, other than (i) coverage mandated by applicable law,
(ii) death benefits under any "pension plan," or (iii) benefits the full cost
of which is borne by the current or former employee, director or consultant
(or his beneficiary).   (k) No amounts payable under the Plans (excluding
any amounts which may be payable pursuant to any plans or agreement entered
into on or following the Closing) to Continuing Employees will fail to
be deductible for federal income tax purposes by virtue of Section 280G of
the Code.   (l) The consummation of the Transactions will not,
either alone or in combination with another event, (i) entitle any current or
former employee, director or consultant of TV or License Co. to severance
pay, unemployment compensation or any other payment, except as expressly
provided in this Agreement or as otherwise may be required by law, or (ii)
accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of
compensation due any such employee, director or consultant.   (m) Except
for routine claims for benefits, there are no pending, and to the Knowledge
of Seller, threatened claims by or on behalf of any Plan, by any TV or
License Co. employee or beneficiary covered under any such Plan, or otherwise
involving any such Plan.    Page 22     (n) No amounts paid by TV or
License Co. to any Employee Benefit Plan would fail to be deductible under
Sections 404 or 404A of the Code by TV or License Co.   SECTION 3.26 TAX

have been fully paid or finally settled, and, to the Knowledge of Seller, no
issue has been raised in any examination, audit, investigation,

by application of similar principles, could reasonably be expected to result
in the proposal or assertion of a Tax deficiency for another year not so

by the rules of the FCC in order to maintain the continuing accuracy and
completeness of the statements contained in the FCC Application. Copies of
any amendments, filings, or correspondence pertaining to the FCC Application

Section 5.4(b)(i)(A), or with its covenant in Section 5.4(b)(i)(B) as it
relates to the condition in Section 6.2(f), Purchaser\'s remedy for such

so that Seller may, at its expense, examine, make copies of or take
possession of such materials.   (b) For a period of six (6) years following
the Closing, Seller shall retain and make available for inspection by
Purchaser or its representatives upon reasonable notice for any reasonable
purpose the books and records relating to TV, License Co. or the operation of
the Station prior to the Closing Date, which Seller was not obligated to

dispose of, alter or destroy any such materials without giving reasonable
prior written notice to Purchaser so that Purchaser may, at its expense,
examine, make copies of or take possession of such materials.   SECTION
5.15 EMPLOYEES(a) . (a) Immediately prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall
cause each TV employee who is on leave or otherwise not actively employed by
TV (but not including any employee who is on vacation, jury duty, sick leave
or other short-term leave where such employee is expected to return to work
within seven (7) business days following the Closing Date) (such individuals,
"INACTIVE EMPLOYEES") to be employed by Seller or an Affiliate of Seller
other than TV or License Co; provided, however, that, Seller shall, prior to
taking action to accomplish the foregoing, notify Purchaser of the
individuals in respect of which such action is to be taken.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Seller is prohibited by law from
transfering the employment of an Inactive Employee to Seller or an Affiliate
of Seller other than TV or License Co., such Inactive Employee shall remain
an employee of TV on and after the Closing Date and shall be deemed to be a
Continuing Employee as of the Closing Date for all purposes of this
Agreement.   (b) On the Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause TV to
continue to employ all Continuing Employees and shall provide Continuing
Employees, or cause Continuing Employees to be provided, with such benefits
as are substantially comparable to those received by other similarly situated
employees of Purchaser; PROVIDED, THAT, nothing herein shall require TV to
continue the employment of any Continuing Employee for any period of time
thereafter or require Continuing Employees to be provided any particular type
or level of employee benefits. Each Continuing Employee\'s period of
employment with Seller and TV (including any current or former Affiliate of
Seller) and with the Station shall be taken into account for purposes of
determining, as applicable, eligibility for participation and vesting under
the 401(k) plan, health and welfare plans (other than post-retirement health
and welfare plans) and the vacation policy of the Purchaser (or of a
Purchaser Affiliate) applicable to each Continuing Employee.   (c) Seller
and TV shall reasonably cooperate, to the extent permitted by law, with
Purchaser\'s attempts to obtain information relating to the individuals
employed   Page 45     by TV, including making available to Purchaser
such employees\' personnel files and performance evaluations.   (d)
Purchaser shall not be required to assume, and neither TV nor License Co.
shall be deemed to retain at Closing, any Plan or any Liabilities with
respect thereto, other than (i) granting credit to each Continuing Employee
(and any Inactive Employee who is re-employed by TV following the Closing
Date) for all unused sick leave accrued under Seller\'s sick leave accrual
policy by such employee as of the Closing Date (or re-employment date in the
case of Inactive Employees), with continuing accruals, if any, to be governed
by the Purchaser\'s sick leave policy, (ii) discharging TV\'s liabilities for
the payment of all unused vacation accrued under Seller\'s vacation accrual
policy by the Continuing Employees (and any Inactive Employee who is re-
employed by TV following the Closing Date) as of the Closing Date (or re-
employment date in the case of Inactive Employees), with continuing
accruals, if any, to be governed by Purchaser\'s vacation accrual policy,
(iii) discharging any liabilities included in the determination of Actual
Working Capital and (iv) subject to Section 2.4, pursuant to any TV Plan;
provided, however, that with respect to clauses (i) and (ii) of this
sentence, Seller shall have provided to Purchaser a schedule setting forth
for each Continuing Employee (and re-employed Inactive Employee) the amount
of accrued sick leave and vacation leave as of the Closing Date (or re-
employment date). Any expenses and benefits with respect to medical claims
incurred by any Continuing Employees or their covered dependents before the
Closing Date shall be the responsibility of Seller except to the extent
reflected in the determination of Actual Working Capital. TV shall retain all
responsibility for the payment of all medical, dental, health and
disability claims of Continuing Employees and their covered dependents
incurred on or after the Closing Date. If Continuing Employees or their
dependents become eligible to participate in a medical, dental or health plan
of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, Purchaser shall cause such plan to (i)
waive any pre-existing condition limitations for conditions covered under the
applicable Seller Welfare Plans and (ii) honor any deductible and out-of-
pocket expenses incurred by the Continuing Employees and their dependents and
beneficiaries under the Seller Welfare Plans during the portion of the Seller
Welfare Plans\' fiscal year preceding the Closing. If Continuing Employees or
their dependents or beneficiaries become eligible to participate in a group
term life insurance plan maintained by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates,
Purchaser shall cause such plan to waive for a period not to exceed 31 days
from the first date of eligibility, any medical certification for such
persons up to the amount of coverage the Continuing Employees and their
dependents and beneficiaries had under the group term life insurance plan
maintained by Seller or any of its Affiliates; provided, however, that
Purchaser shall not be required to cause the waiver of medical certifications
for any dependents who apply for GE Long Term Care Insurance.   (e)
Immediately prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall cause each Savings Plan
Employee to become fully vested in his or her account balance under the
Savings Plan. As soon as practicable following the Closing Date, each Savings
Plan Employee shall have the right to elect to receive a distribution of all
or a portion of such employee\'s ac-   Page 46     count balance in the
Savings Plan (subject to, and in accordance with, the provisions of the
Savings Plan and applicable law). Purchaser shall take any and all necessary
action to cause the trustee of a defined contribution plan of Purchaser or
one of its Affiliates (such plan, the "PURCHASER\'S SAVINGS PLAN"), if
requested to do so by a Savings Plan Employee, to accept the direct "roll
over" of all or a portion of such employee\'s account balance under the
Savings Plan, provided that Purchaser\'s Savings Plan shall not be required
to accept a roll-over of any loan made by the Savings Plan to a Continuing
Employee. Seller shall cause each Inactive Employee who accepts re-employment
with TV in accordance with clause (g) of this Section 5.15 to become fully
vested in his or her account balance under the Savings Plan immediately prior
to the date such Inactive Employee commences re-employment with TV.   (f)
With respect to the year in which the Closing occurs, Purchaser or an
Affiliate of Purchaser shall establish flexible spending accounts for medical
and dependent care expenses under a new or existing plan established or
maintained under Section 125 and Section 129 of the Code ("PURCHASER\'S
FSA"), effective as of the Closing Date, for each Continuing Employee who as
of the Closing Date, is a participant in a flexible spending account for
medical or dependent care expenses under a Plan pursuant to Section 125 and
Section 129 of the Code ("SELLER\'S FSA"). Purchaser or an Affiliate
of Purchaser shall credit or debit, as applicable, effective on the day after
the Closing Date, the applicable account of each such Continuing Employee
under Purchaser\'s FSA with an amount equal to the balance of each such
Continuing Employee\'s account under Seller\'s FSA as of the Closing Date. As
soon as administratively practicable after the Closing Date, the Seller shall
transfer to Purchaser an amount equal to the total contributions made to the
Seller\'s FSA by Continuing Employees in respect of the plan year in which
the Closing Date occurs, reduced by an amount equal to the total claims
already paid to Continuing Employees in respect of such plan year. From and
after the Closing Date, Seller shall provide Purchaser or an Affiliate of
Purchaser with such information such entity may reasonably request to enable
it to verify any claims information pertaining to Seller\'s FSA.   (g)
Purchaser shall cause TV to promptly offer employment to each Inactive
Employee who has returned to active employment with Seller or an Affiliate of
Seller upon receipt of a written notice from Seller that such Inactive
Employee has returned to active employment. Such offer of employment shall
provide for a base rate of salary or compensation no less favorable than as
provided to the Inactive Employee immediately prior to the time such
Inactive Employee ceased active employment with TV. Upon commencement of re-
employment with TV, Purchaser shall cause each Inactive Employee to be
treated as if such Inactive Employee was a Continuing Employee and the
Closing Date occurred upon the date such Inactive Employee commenced re-
employment with TV; provided, however, that Purchaser shall not be required
to establish flexible spending accounts for medical and dependent care
expenses in respect of any Inactive Employee unless Purchaser receives a
transfer from Seller in respect of such accounts as contemplated under
Section 5.15(f). In addition, Purchaser shall or shall cause its Affiliates
to credit any Inactive Employee\'s service with Seller or an Affiliate of
Seller following the Closing for purposes of determining, as   Page
47      applicable, eligibility for participation and vesting under the
401(k) plan, health and welfare plans (other than post-retirement health and
welfare plans) and the vacation policy of Purchaser (or of a Purchaser
Affiliate) as contemplated under clause (b) of this Section 5.15 as if such
employee was a Continuing Employee as of the Closing Date.   SECTION 5.16
LABOR ORGANIZATIONS. Seller shall not voluntarily recognize or cause TV or
License Co. to voluntarily recognize any labor organization as the collective
bargaining representative of any employees of TV or License Co. Seller shall
notify Purchaser immediately if a petition is filed by any labor organization
requesting an election to determine whether or not it is the exclusive
bargaining agent for any employees of TV or License Co. or if a labor union
is certified as bargaining agent for any of the employees of TV or License
Co. Seller also shall notify Purchaser prior to commencing collective
bargaining negotiations with any labor organization representing
any employees of TV or License Co. and prior to entering into any
collective bargaining agreement with any labor organization representing any
employees of TV or License Co.   SECTION 5.17 OTHER COVENANTS AND RIGHTS.

EFFECT THE CLOSING. The obligations of Seller to consummate the Closing shall
be subject to the satisfaction on or prior to the Closing Date of each of
the following conditions:   (a) CERTIFICATE OF PURCHASER OFFICER. Purchaser
shall have delivered to Seller at the Closing a certificate signed by an
executive officer of Purchaser, dated the Closing Date, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Seller, to the effect that, as of the
Closing Date, the conditions set forth in Sections 6.3(b) and (c) hereof have
been satisfied.   (b) REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. All of
the representations and warranties of Purchaser set forth in this Agreement
shall be true and correct in all respects as of the Closing Date, except to
the extent the failure to be true and correct would not, individually or in
the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on Purchaser\'s ability to
perform its obligations hereunder;   (c) COVENANT BREACH. Purchaser shall
not have failed to perform in any material respect any obligation or to
comply in any material respect with any agreement or covenant to be performed
or complied with by it under this Agreement.   (d) GOVERNMENT ACTION. There
shall not be, at the time of Closing, threatened or pending any suit, action
or proceeding by any Governmental Entity seeking to restrain or prohibit the
consummation of the Closing in accordance with the terms and conditions
hereof.   Page 52     (e) OPINION OF PURCHASER\'S COUNSEL. Purchaser
shall have delivered to Seller at the Closing an opinion of Morrison and
Foerster LLP, dated the Closing Date, with respect to FCC matters in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Seller and customary for this type of
transaction. In rendering such opinion, counsel may rely, to the extent
appropriate as to matters of fact, upon statements and certificates of
officers of Purchaser.  The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of
Seller, may be waived by Seller, in whole or in part, at any time and from
time to time in the sole discretion of Seller. The failure by Seller at any
time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of
any such right and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may
be asserted at any time and from time to time.   ARTICLE VII  
TERMINATION AND CERTAIN OTHER MATTERS   SECTION 7.1 TERMINATION. The
Transactions may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing Date:   (a)
By the mutual written consent of Purchaser and Seller;   (b) By Purchaser or
Seller if any Governmental Entity shall have issued an order, decree or
ruling or taken any other action (which order, decree, ruling or other action
the parties hereto shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to lift),
which permanently restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits the acquisition
by Purchaser of the Shares and such order, decree, ruling or other action
shall have become final and non-appealable.   (c) By Seller:   (i) if (x)
none of Seller, TV or License Co. is then  in material breach of this
Agreement and (y) Purchaser shall have  breached any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or other  agreements contained in this Agreement which
would give rise to the  failure of a condition set forth in Article VI and
such breach  shall not have been substantially cured within 15 Business
Days  after Purchaser receives written notice thereof; or   (ii) on or
after the Drop Dead Date, if the Closing  shall not have theretofore occurred
and if the failure of the  Closing to occur is not the result of a breach of
a representation,  warranty or covenant by Seller, TV or License Co.   Page
53     (d) By Purchaser:   (i) if (x) Purchaser is not then in material
breach of  this Agreement and (y) Seller, TV or License Co. shall have 
breached any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement  contained
in this Agreement which would give rise to the failure of  a condition set
forth in Article VI and such breach shall not have  been substantially cured
within 15 Business Days after Seller  receives written notice thereof;
provided, however, that a  supplement or amendment to the Disclosure Schedule
shall not  constitute a cure of any such breach;   (ii) on or after the
Drop Dead Date, if the Closing  shall not have theretofore occurred and if
the failure of the  Closing to occur is not the result of a breach of a
representation,  warranty or covenant by Purchaser; or   (iii) in
accordance with Exhibit 5.17.   SECTION 7.2 EFFECT OF TERMINATION. (a) In
the event of the termination of the Transactions by any party hereto pursuant

Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 7.1, this Agreement shall
forthwith become null and void, and there shall be no liability or obligation
thereafter on the part of Purchaser, Seller, TV or License Co. except as
provided in Section 7.1(c) and as set forth in Section 11.1.   (c)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, upon
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1 hereof (other than
Section 7.1(a)), Seller, TV and License Co. shall remain liable to Purchaser
for fraud or for any willful breach of this Agreement by Seller, TV or
License Co. existing at the time of such termination, and Purchaser shall
remain liable to Seller for fraud or for any willful breach of this Agreement
by Purchaser existing at the time of such termination, and Seller, on the one
hand, or Purchaser, on the other hand, may seek such remedies, including
damages and fees of attorneys, against the other with respect to any such
breach as are provided in this Agreement or as are otherwise available at law
or in equity.   SECTION 7.3 CLOSING AFTER SEPTEMBER 30, 2002. If the
Closing shall not have occurred on or before September 30, 2002 and on
September 30, 2002 the only condition in Article VI capable of being
satisfied on or before the Closing Date in advance of the Closing which is
not satisfied is Section 6.1(c), Purchaser shall pay Seller one-third of
0.50% of the Tranche A Principal Amount on the first Business Day of each of
the months of Octo-   Page 54    ber, November and December 2002;
provided that, if the Closing shall occur in October or November 2002, no
payment by Purchaser to Seller pursuant to this Section 7.3 with respect to
the month or months after Closing shall be required. "TRANCHE A PRINCIPAL
AMOUNT" shall mean the principal amount of the Tranche A Loans outstanding on
the applicable date of payment; provided that if such principal amount
outstanding is greater than $110 million, the Tranche A Principal Amount
shall be capped at $110 million.   SECTION 7.4 EFFECT OF EXERCISE OF

Right:   (a) Purchaser shall pay Seller an amount for the period from
January 1, 2003 to the earlier of (i) the Closing Date and (ii) March 31,
2003, equal to 5% per annum of the Preliminary Amount, such amount to
be payable in arrears on the last day of each of January, February and
March 2003 to the extent the Closing does not occur in any such month, and on

Section  7.4(b) below, Seller shall pay Purchaser one-twelfth of the 2003 
Affiliation Payment on the first Business Day of each of the months  of
January, February and March 2003,   (iii) if the Closing shall occur in any
of January,  February or March 2003, on the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
refund  Seller an amount of the 2003 Affiliation Payment equal to (A)  one-
twelfth of the 2003 Affiliation Payment multiplied by (B) a  fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days of such  month from the first day of
such month to and including the Closing  Date, and the denominator of which
is 30, and   (iv) if the Closing shall not occur on or prior to  March 31,
2003, on April 1, 2003, Seller shall pay to Purchaser the  remaining unpaid
balance of the 2003 Affiliation Payment, and   (v) all payments pursuant to

INDEMNIFICATION   SECTION 8.1 INDEMNIFICATION BY SELLER; REMEDIES.   (a)
From and after the Closing, Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties from and against and in respect of all
Purchaser Losses.   (b) Seller\'s indemnification obligations under Section
8.1(a) shall be subject to each of the following limitations:   (i) subject
to the proviso at the end of this Section  8.1(b), Seller\'s indemnification
obligations relating to clause (i)  of the definition of Purchaser Losses
("PURCHASER\'S REPRESENTATION  LOSSES") (other than those arising out of any
breach of any  representation or warranty contained in Sections 3.25 and
3.26)  shall survive only until the eighteen-month anniversary of the 
Closing Date. Seller\'s indemnification obligations relating to  Purchaser
Losses arising out of any breach of any representation or  warranty contained
in Section 3.25 or 3.26 shall survive until the  date which is 60 days after
the expiration (giving effect to any  valid extensions, waivers and tolling
periods) of the applicable  statute of limitation. No claim for the recovery
of any Purchaser\'s  Representation Losses may be asserted by any Purchaser
Indemnified  Party after the expiration of the applicable indemnification
period  as set forth herein; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that claims asserted in 
writing by any Purchaser Indemnified Party with reasonable  specificity prior
to the expiration of the applicable  indemnification period shall not
thereafter be barred by the  expiration of the applicable indemnification
period;   (ii) no reimbursement for Purchaser\'s Representation  Losses
asserted under Section 8.1(a) shall be required unless and  until the
cumulative aggregate amount of such Purchaser\'s  Representation Losses
exceeds $2,000,000, after which reimbursement  for the aggregate amount of
Purchaser\'s Representation Losses in  excess of $2,000,000 may be
asserted;   (iii) in no event shall Seller be obligated to provide 
indemnification with respect to any individual or related group of  claims
for Purchaser\'s Representation Losses if the entire amount  of Purchaser\'s
Representation Losses relating to such individual or  related group of claims
is, or is reasonably expected to be, less  than $25,000, and such claims
shall not be considered Purchaser\'s  Representation Losses for purposes of
Section 8.1(b)(ii) hereof; and   Page 56     (iv) in no event shall
Seller\'s aggregate liability to  Purchaser with respect to Purchaser\'s
Representation Losses exceed  an amount equal to 35% of the Purchase
Price.  PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the limitations set forth in this Section
8.1(b) shall not apply to Purchaser Losses arising out of any breach of any
representation or warranty contained in Sections 3.1 to 3.6, or any of
clauses (ii) through (vi) of the definition of Purchaser Losses.   SECTION
8.2 INDEMNIFICATION BY PURCHASER; REMEDIES.   (a) From and after the
Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Seller
Indemnified Parties from and against and in respect of all Seller Losses.  
(b) Subject to the proviso at the end of this Section 8.2(b), Purchaser\'s
indemnification obligations relating to clause (i) of the definition of
Seller Losses ("SELLER\'S REPRESENTATION LOSSES") shall survive only until
the eighteen-month anniversary of the Closing Date. No claim for the recovery
of any Seller\'s Representation Losses may be asserted by Seller after the
expiration of the applicable indemnification period as set forth herein;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that claims asserted in writing by any Seller Indemnified
Party with reasonable specificity prior to the expiration of the applicable
indemnification period shall not thereafter be barred by the expiration of
the applicable indemnification period; PROVIDED, FURTHER, HOWEVER, that the
limitation set forth in the first sentence of this Section 8.2(b) shall not
apply to Seller\'s Representation Losses arising out of any breach of any
representation or warranty contained in Sections 4.1 to 4.2, or any of
clauses (ii) through (v) of the definition of Seller Losses.   SECTION 8.3
NOTICE OF CLAIM; DEFENSE. An Indemnified Party shall give the applicable
Indemnifying Party prompt written notice of any third-party claim (a "THIRD-
PARTY CLAIM") that may give rise to any indemnification obligation under this
Article VIII, together with the estimated amount of such claim, and the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the defense (at the
Indemnifying Party\'s expense) of any such claim through counsel of the
Indemnifying Party\'s own choosing by so notifying such Indemnified Party
within 30 days of the first receipt by the Indemnifying Party of such written
notice from such Indemnified Party; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any such counsel
shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. Failure to give
such written notice shall not affect the indemnification obligations
hereunder in the absence of actual and material prejudice. If, under
applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict with respect to any
significant issue between any Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party
exists in respect of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall pay
the reasonable fees and expenses of such additional counsel as may be
required to be retained in order to resolve such conflict. The Indemnifying
Party shall be liable for the fees and expenses of counsel employed by the
Indemnified Party for any period during which the Indemnifying Party has not
assumed the defense of any   Page 57    such Third-Party Claim (other
than during any period in which the Indemnified Party will have failed to
give written notice of the Third-Party Claim as provided above). If the
Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the Indemnified Party shall have the
right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own
expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party, it
being understood that the Indemnifying Party shall control such defense. If
the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute a Third-Party Claim,
the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof,
which cooperation shall include, to the extent reasonably requested by the
Indemnifying Party, the retention, and the provision to Indemnifying Party,
of records and information reasonably relevant to such Third-Party Claim, and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any materials provided hereunder.
If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute any Third-Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall agree to any settlement, compromise or
discharge of such Third-Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party may recommend
and that, by its terms, discharges the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates
from the full amount of liability in connection with such Third-Party Claim;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, without the consent of the Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall not consent to, and the Indemnified Party shall not
be required to agree to, the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement that (i) provides for injunctive or other non-monetary relief
affecting the Indemnified Party or any Affiliate of the Indemnified Party or
(ii) does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving of a
release from all liability with respect to such claim by each claimant or
plaintiff to each Indemnified Party that is the subject of such Third-Party
Claim. The Indemnified Party shall not agree to any settlement of, or entry
of any judgment arising from, any Third-Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed.   SECTION 8.4 TAX EFFECT OF INDEMNIFICATION PAYMENTS.
All indemnity payments made by an Indemnifying Party to an Indemnified
Party pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated for all Tax purposes
as adjustments to the consideration paid with respect to the Shares.  
SECTION 8.5 EFFECT OF INVESTIGATION. The right to indemnification, payment of
Purchaser Losses, payment of Seller Losses or for other remedies based on any
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of any party contained in or
made pursuant to this Agreement shall not be affected by any investigation
conducted with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being
acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution and delivery of
this Agreement or the date the Closing occurs, with respect to the accuracy
or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such representation, warranty,
covenant or obligation. The waiver of any condition to the obligation of any
party to consummate the Transactions, where such condition is based on the
accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the performance of or
compliance with any covenant or obligation, shall not affect the right to
indemnification, payment of Purchaser Losses, payment of Seller Losses or
other remedy based on such representation, warranty, covenant or
obligation.   Page 58     SECTION 8.6 CERTAIN LIMITATIONS. No officer,
director, employee or agent of Seller, TV, License Co., Purchaser or of any
of their respective Affiliates shall have any liability under this Agreement
or any document delivered in connection herewith. With respect to
any indemnification claims arising in connection with Purchaser Losses or
Seller Losses, to the maximum extent permitted by law, no Indemnifying Person
shall be liable for any Special Damages asserted or claimed by an Indemnified
Party and irrespective of whether the Indemnified Party has been advised of
the possibility of any such Special Damages, except to the extent such
Special Damages arise as a result of an Indemnified Party\'s fraud or
willful misconduct, PROVIDED, FURTHER however, that the foregoing shall not
preclude recovery by any Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article VIII in
respect of Purchaser Losses or Seller Losses, as the case may be, which are
incurred by an Indemnified Party and which relate to Special Damages that are
asserted or claimed by a third-party in a Third-Party Claim. Each of Seller
and Purchaser hereby waives any claim that these exclusions deprive it of an
adequate remedy.   SECTION 8.7 SURVIVAL OF COVENANTS, REPRESENTATIONS
AND WARRANTIES. Each of the covenants, representations and warranties of
Seller and Purchaser in this Agreement or in any schedule, instrument or
other document delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Closing
Date and shall continue in force thereafter except as limited by Section 8.1
or 8.2, as the case may be.   SECTION 8.8 NATURE OF REMEDIES. If the
Closing shall occur, except in the case of fraud or willful misconduct, the
remedies set forth in this Article VIII shall be the sole and exclusive
remedies of, and in lieu of any other remedies that may be available to, the
Indemnified Parties for any of the matters covered by this Article VIII,
provided that no party hereto shall be deemed to have waived any right of
recourse (whether a claim under this Article VIII or otherwise) arising from
fraud or willful misconduct of any other party hereto, and provided, further,
that no party shall be deemed to have waived any right to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to specifically enforce
the terms and provisions of this Agreement, as set forth in Section 11.8.  
SECTION 8.9 SUBROGATION. In the event that an Indemnifying Party makes any
payment to any Indemnified Party for indemnification for which such
Indemnified Party could have collected on a claim against a third party
(including under any contract and any insurance claims), the Indemnifying
Party shall be entitled to pursue claims and conduct litigation on behalf of
such Indemnified Party and any of its successors, to pursue and collect on
any indemnification or other remedy available to such Indemnified Party
thereunder with respect to such claim and generally to be subrogated to the
rights of such Indemnified Party. Except pursuant to a settlement agreed to
by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall not waive or release
any contractual right to recover from a third party any loss subject to
indemnification hereby without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying
Party.   Page 59     ARTICLE IX   TAX MATTERS AND INDEMNIFICATION  
SECTION 9.1 TAX TREATMENT. Seller and Purchaser hereby agree that an election
under Section 338 of the Code (or any similar provision of the law of any
state or other taxing jurisdiction) will not be made with respect to TV in
connection with the Transactions and for purposes of all Tax Returns
and other applicable filings, Purchaser and Seller will report the stock
purchase contemplated by this Agreement as a purchase and sale, respectively,
of the stock of TV.   SECTION 9.2 TAX INDEMNIFICATION. (a) Except
as provided in this Article IX, Seller shall be responsible for, and
shall indemnify and hold Purchaser, TV, License Co. and their Subsidiaries
harmless from and against:   (i) any liability for Taxes imposed on TV,
License Co.  or any of their Subsidiaries for any taxable period ending on
or  before the Closing Date, and for the portion of any Straddle Period  (as
defined below) ending on the Closing Date (a "PRE-CLOSING TAX  PERIOD");  
(ii) any Taxes imposed on TV or License Co. as members  of the "affiliated
group" (within the meaning of Section 1504(a) of  the Code) of which Seller
(or any predecessor or successor) is the  common parent that arises under
Treasury Regulation Section  1.1502-6(a) and any similar provisions under
state or local law  including TV or License Co. as members in a "unitary
business" as  that term has been defined in U.S. Supreme Court
jurisprudence;   (iii) the breach by Seller or the failure by Seller to 
perform (or cause to be performed) any of the covenants contained  in this
Article IX and Section 5.1(q) of the Agreement;   (iv) all Transfer Taxes
for which Seller is liable  pursuant to Section 9.8; and   (v) reasonable
attorneys\' fees, reasonable  accountants\' fees and out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by Purchaser  in the investigation or defense of any claim arising
under Sections  9.2(a)(i)-(iv) or in asserting, preserving or enforcing any
of the  rights of Purchaser arising under Article IX, except as otherwise 
provided in Section 9.4(b),  provided, however, that the amount of any such
indemnification provided hereunder shall be net of any accruals and related
reserves for Taxes included in the final determination of the Actual Working
Capital.   Page 60     (b) Except as provided in Section 9.8, Purchaser
shall be responsible for, and shall hold Seller and its Subsidiaries harmless
from and against,   (i) any Taxes imposed on Purchaser, TV, License Co.
and  their Subsidiaries for all taxable periods ending  after the Closing
Date (except with respect to a  Straddle Period, in which case Purchaser\'s
indemnity  will cover only that portion of any Taxes that do not  relate to
a Pre-Closing Tax Period) ("POST-CLOSING  TAX PERIOD");   (ii) any Transfer
Taxes for which the Purchaser may be  liable pursuant to Section 9.8;  
(iii) any liability for Taxes attributable to a breach by  Purchaser of its
obligations under this Agreement;  and   (iv) reasonable attorneys\' fees,
reasonable accountants\'  fees and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Seller
in  the investigation or defense of any claim arising  under Sections
9.2(b)(i)-(iii) or in asserting,  preserving or enforcing any of the rights
of Seller  arising under Article IX, except as otherwise  provided in
Section 9.4(b).   (c) To the extent that an indemnification obligation of
one party pursuant to this Section 9.2 may overlap with another
indemnification obligation of such party pursuant to this Section 9.2, the
party entitled to such indemnification shall be limited to only one of such
indemnification payments.   (d) Whenever in accordance with this Article IX
Purchaser shall be required to pay Seller an amount in respect of liabilities
for Taxes for Post-Closing Tax Periods or Seller shall be required to pay
Purchaser an amount in respect of liabilities for Taxes for Pre-Closing Tax
Periods, such payments shall be made the later of 10 days after requested or
10 days before the requesting party is required to pay the related Tax
liability.   SECTION 9.3 COMPUTATION OF TAX LIABILITIES. (a) To the
extent permitted or required by Law or administrative practice the taxable
year of TV and License Co. which includes the Closing Date shall be treated
as closing on (and including) the Closing Date.   (b) In the case of any
taxable period that includes but does not end on the Closing Date (a
"STRADDLE PERIOD"), Taxes of TV and License Co. for the Straddle Period shall
be computed as if the taxable period for TV and License Co. ended at the
close of the Closing Date, except that (i) exemptions, allowances or
deductions that are allowed on an annual basis shall be apportioned on a per-
diem basis and (ii) real property, personal property, intangibles and other
similar taxes shall be allocated in accordance with the principles of Section
164(d) of the Code.   Page 61    SECTION 9.4 PROCEDURES RELATING TO TAX
INDEMNIFICATION. (a) If a claim for Taxes, including, notice of a pending
audit, shall be made by any taxing authority in writing (a "TAX CLAIM"),
which, if successful, might result in an indemnity payment pursuant to
Section 9.2 hereof, the party seeking indemnification (the "TAX INDEMNIFIED
PARTY") shall notify the other party (the "TAX INDEMNIFYING PARTY") in
writing of the Tax Claim within fifteen business days of receipt of such Tax
Claim. If notice of a Tax Claim (a "TAX NOTICE") is not given to the Tax
Indemnifying Party within such period or in detail sufficient to apprise the
Tax Indemnifying Party of the nature of the Tax Claim, the Tax Indemnifying
Party shall not be liable to the Tax Indemnified Party to the extent that the
Tax Indemnifying Party\'s position would be materially prejudiced as a result
thereof.   (b) With respect to any Tax Claim which might result in
an indemnity payment to a Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant to Section
9.2 hereof, Seller and Purchaser, if elected by Purchaser, shall in good
faith cooperate with each other to jointly control all proceedings taken in
connection with such Tax Claim (including, selection of counsel) and, if
Purchaser so elects to jointly control such Tax Claims, will each pay fifty
percent of the fees and expenses associated with such Tax Claims. In no case
shall Seller or Purchaser settle or otherwise compromise any Tax Claim
referred to in the preceding sentence without the prior written consent of
Purchaser or Seller, respectively. If Seller determines that it will not
contest such a Tax Claim, Seller shall so notify Purchaser in timely fashion
and expressly affirm its obligation to indemnify Purchaser in respect of such
Tax Claim. Failing such notification, Purchaser shall be entitled, but shall
not be required, to take actions that it reasonably deems appropriate to
protect its interests. Seller, Purchaser, TV, License Co., their affiliates
and any successors thereto shall reasonably cooperate with each other in
contesting such Tax Claim, which cooperation shall include, without
limitation, the retention of records for the period described in Section
9.5(c) and providing reasonable access to each party\'s representatives of
records and information for Pre-Closing Tax Periods and Straddle Periods
which are relevant to such Tax Claim and making employees available at
reasonable times and without undue interference with the employer\'s business
operations to provide additional information or explanation of any material
provided hereunder or to testify at proceedings relating to such Tax Claim.
In the event that issues relating to a liability for Taxes for a Pre-Closing
Tax Period are required to be dealt with in the same proceeding as separate
issues relating to a liability for Taxes for a Post-Closing Tax
Period, Purchaser shall have the right, at its expense, to control the
proceeding with respect to such Post-Closing Tax Period items.   (c)
Neither the Purchaser, TV, License Co. nor the Seller shall enter into any
compromise or agree to settle any Tax Claim pursuant to any proceeding which
would materially increase the other party\'s liability for Taxes for such
year or a subsequent year without the written consent of the other party,
which consent may not be unreasonably withheld. The Purchaser, TV, License
Co. and the Seller agree to cooperate in the defense against or compromise of
any claim in any such Tax Claim proceeding.   Page 62    SECTION 9.5 TAX
RETURNS. (a) Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared and timely file or
cause to be timely filed all required Tax Returns relating to TV and License
Co. for any taxable period which ends on or before the Closing Date.
Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared and timely file or cause to
be filed all required Tax Returns relating to TV and License Co. for taxable
periods ending after the Closing Date and all required Tax Returns for
subsequent taxable periods. All such returns shall be prepared and all
elections with respect to such returns shall be made, to the extent permitted
by law, in a manner consistent with prior practice. Seller shall provide
Purchaser with copies of all "pro forma" Tax Returns of, or with respect to,
TV and License Co. for any taxable period beginning January 1, 2001
and ending on or before the Closing Date within ten (10) Business Days of
filing such Tax Returns. Before filing any Tax Return with respect to any
Straddle Period, Purchaser shall provide Seller with a copy of such Tax
Return at least twenty days prior to the last date for timely filing such Tax
Return (giving effect to any valid extensions thereof) accompanied by a
statement calculating in reasonable detail Seller\'s indemnification
obligation pursuant to Section 9.2 hereof. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Seller shall have no indemnification obligation
pursuant to Section 9.2 hereof with respect to any Taxes covered by such Tax
Return until Seller has received such Tax Return and such statement. If for
any reason Seller does not agree with Purchaser\'s calculation of its
indemnification obligation, Seller shall notify Purchaser of its disagreement
within ten days of receiving a copy of the Tax Return and Purchaser\'s
calculation, and such dispute shall be resolved pursuant to the Tax Dispute
Resolution Mechanism. If Seller agrees with Purchaser\'s calculation of its
indemnification obligation, Seller shall pay to Purchaser the amount of
Seller\'s indemnification at the time specified in Section 9.2(d).   (b) The
Seller shall pay or cause to be paid when due and payable all Taxes with
respect to TV and License Co. for any taxable period ending on or before the
Closing Date to the extent such Taxes exceed the amount, if any, accrued or
reserved for such Taxes on the Actual Working Capital Statement, and the
Purchaser shall so pay or cause to be paid Taxes for any taxable period
ending after the Closing Date (subject to its right of indemnification from
the Seller by the date set forth in Section 9.2(d)) for Taxes attributable to
the portion of any Tax period that includes the Closing Date pursuant to
Section 9.2.   (c) Seller, TV, License Co. and Purchaser shall
reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their respective affiliates, officers,
employees, agents, auditors and representatives reasonably to cooperate, in
preparing and filing all Tax Returns, including maintaining and making
available to each other all records necessary in connection with Taxes and in
resolving all disputes and audits with respect to all taxable periods
relating to Taxes. Purchaser and Seller recognize that Purchaser will need
information regarding the amount of any net operating loss carryover, net
capital loss carryover or similar tax attribute of TV or License Co. that
arises during any Pre-Closing Tax Period and that is available to TV or
License Co., as the case may be, for any Post-Closing Tax Period
(collectively, the "ATTRIBUTES"). Seller further acknowledges that Purchaser
