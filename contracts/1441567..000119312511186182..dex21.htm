-iv-  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION

 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION (the "Agreement") is made
and entered into as of July 11, 2011 by and among MedQuist Holdings Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("Parent"), Miami Acquisition Corporation, a Pennsylvania
corporation and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Sub I"), Miami
Acquisition LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a direct wholly-
owned subsidiary of Parent ("Sub II", and with Sub I, the "Subs"), Multimodal
Technologies, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation (the "Company"), and Michael
Finke, who will serve as the representative of the Companys shareholders, and
is referred to herein from time to time as the "Securityholder
Representative."

 

RECITALS

 

A. Through the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the parties intend
to develop a strong technology platform through the combination of their
respective product portfolios and resources in order to better support their
existing and future customers and to more broadly serve the healthcare
information-technology industry.

 

B. Thus, the Boards of Directors of each of Parent, Sub I and the Company
believe it is in the best interests of each company and its respective
shareholders that Parent acquire the Company through the statutory merger of
Sub I with and into the Company with the Company as the surviving corporation
(the "First Step Merger"), as more fully provided in this Agreement.

C. Immediately after the First Step Merger, Parent shall cause the Company to
merge with and into Sub II with Sub II as the surviving entity (the "Second
Step Merger" and, taken together with the First Step Merger, the "Integrated
Merger" or the "Merger"), as more fully provided in this Agreement.
The Integrated Merger is intended to constitute a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "Code"). Parent and the Company intend that the First Step Merger and
the Second Step Merger will constitute integrated steps in a single "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of Treas. Reg. §1.368-2(g), which plan of
reorganization the parties adopt by executing this Agreement. 

D. Pursuant to the First Step Merger, among other things, and subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, all of the issued and outstanding
capital stock of the Company shall be converted into the right to receive the
consideration set forth herein.

E. Contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as
an inducement to Parents willingness to enter into this Agreement, certain of
the Shareholders are executing a joinder agreement (the "Shareholder
Joinder") in favor of the Parent in substantially the form attached hereto as
Exhibit B.

F. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and the Subs, on the other hand,
desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and other
agreements in connection with the Integrated Merger. 

G. Capitalized terms used herein that are not defined where used shall have
the meanings ascribed to them in the Glossary attached hereto as Exhibit A. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements, covenants and other
promises set forth herein, the mutual benefits to be gained by the
performance thereof, and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged and accepted, the
parties hereby agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

1.1 _The Integrated Merger_. At the Effective Time and subject to and upon
the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the applicable provisions of
the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law of 1988 (the "Pennsylvania Law"),
Sub I shall be merged with and into the Company, the separate corporate
existence of Sub I shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the
surviving corporation and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. The
surviving corporation after the First Step Merger is hereinafter referred to
as the "Interim Surviving Corporation." Immediately after the Effective Time,
and subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
applicable provisions of the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act (the "LLC
Act") and Pennsylvania Law, the Interim Surviving Corporation shall be merged
with and into Sub II, the separate corporate existence of the Interim
Surviving Corporation shall cease, and Sub II shall continue as the surviving
entity and as a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. The surviving entity
after the Second Step Merger is hereinafter referred to as the "Final
Surviving Entity."

 

1.2 _Effective Time_. The closing of the First Step Merger (the "Closing")
shall take place, and the parties agree to effect such Closing, at the
offices of Pepper Hamilton LLP, The New York Times Building, 37th Floor, 620
Eighth Avenue, New York, New York 10018, at 10:00 a.m. eastern time on the
third Business Day following HSR Approval or, if later, the satisfaction (or,
to the extent permitted by applicable law, waiver by all parties) of the other
conditions set forth in Article V hereof, or at such other place, time and
date as may be agreed in writing between Parent and the Company. The date
upon which the Closing actually occurs shall be referred to herein as the
"Closing Date." On the Closing Date, the parties hereto shall cause the First
Step Merger to be consummated by filing Articles of Merger in substantially
the form attached hereto as Exhibit C-1, with the Department of State of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (the "Certificate of Merger"), in accordance with
the applicable provisions of Pennsylvania Law (the time of the acceptance of
such filing by the Department of State of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
shall be referred to herein as the "Effective Time"). Immediately after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Second Step Merger to be consummated
by filing a Certificate of Merger or Consolidation in substantially the form
attached hereto as Exhibit C-2, with the Department of State of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and a Certificate of Merger in substantially the
form attached hereto as Exhibit C-3 with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware (the latter referred to herein as the "Second Step Certificate of
Merger"), in accordance with the applicable provisions of Pennsylvania
Law and the LLC Act.

1.3 _Effect of the First Step Merger and the Second Step Merger_. At the
Effective Time, the effect of the First Step Merger shall be as provided in
the applicable provisions of Pennsylvania Law. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, except as
otherwise agreed to pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, all of the
property, rights,

 



-2-   privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Sub I shall vest in the
Interim Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the
Company and Sub I shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Interim Surviving Corporation. At the effective time of the Second Step
Merger, the effect of the Second Step Merger shall be as provided in the
applicable provisions of Pennsylvania Law and the LLC Act. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the effective time of
the Second Step Merger, except as otherwise agreed to pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers
and franchises of the Interim Surviving Corporation shall vest in Sub II as
the surviving entity in the Second Step Merger, and all debts, liabilities and
duties of the Interim Surviving Corporation shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of Sub II as the surviving entity in the Second Step
Merger.

1.4 _Formation Documents_.

 

(a) Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time, the

Agreement; _provided, however_ , that at the Effective Time, the appropriate
section of such Limited Liability Company Agreement shall be amended and

liability company is Multimodal Technologies, LLC."

1.5 _Management_.

-4-   this Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and
conditioned upon the delivery of an executed Option Surrender Agreement, an
amount in cash for each Company Option held by such Optionholder equal to (i)
the Per Share Option Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of
Company Common Stock underlying such Company Option (regardless of whether
such Company Option was fully vested at the time of cancellation), less (ii)
the per share exercise price of such Company Option multiplied by the number
of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such Company Option. For the
avoidance of doubt, no part of the Merger Consideration will be allocated or
distributed to Optionholders on account of Company Options.

(c) _No Fractional Shares_ _._ _ _ No fraction of a share of Parent Common
Stock will be issued pursuant to the Merger, but in lieu thereof, each
Shareholder who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent
Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable to such Shareholder) shall receive from Parent an amount of cash
(rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest, equal to the product of
(i) such fraction, multiplied by (ii) the Signing Date Price (each, a
"Fractional Payment" and collectively, all such Fractional Payments are
referred to as the "Fractional Amount").

(d) _Withholding Taxes_. Notwithstanding any other provision in this
Agreement, Parent, the Company, the Subs and the Paying Agent shall have the
right to deduct and withhold Taxes from any payments to be made hereunder if
such withholding is required by Law, and to request any necessary Tax forms,
including Form W-9 or the appropriate series of Form W-8, as applicable, or
any similar information, from any recipients of payments hereunder. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been delivered and paid to the
person or entity in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

(e) _Capital Stock of Subs_. Each share of Common Stock of Sub I issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
Common Stock of the Interim Surviving Corporation. Each stock certificate of
Sub I evidencing ownership of any such shares shall continue to evidence
ownership of such shares of capital stock of the Interim Surviving
Corporation. Each share of Common Stock of the Interim Surviving Corporation
issued and outstanding immediately after the Effective Time shall be
converted into and exchanged for the applicable corresponding interest in the
Final Surviving Entity. Each stock certificate of the Interim Surviving
Corporation evidencing ownership of any such shares shall continue to evidence
the applicable corresponding interest in the Final Surviving Entity.

1.7 _Determination of Initial Cash Consideration_.

(a) _Estimated Statement; Adjustment; Dividend_.

 

(i) Attached hereto as Schedule 1.7 is a statement prepared by the Company
(the "Estimated Statement") setting forth the Companys estimate (such
estimate is referred to as the "Estimated Working Capital") of the Companys
Working Capital as of the Signing Date, calculated in accordance with this
Agreement (the "Signing Working Capital Amount") and the Companys estimate
(such estimate is referred to as the "Estimated Cash Balance") of the
Companys Cash as of the Signing Date (the "Signing Cash Balance"). The 

 



-5-   acceptance by Parent of the Estimated Statement, shall not limit or
otherwise affect Parents remedies under this Agreement, including Parents
right to include such changes or other changes in the Final Statement, or
constitute an acknowledgment by Parent of the accuracy of the Estimated
Statement.

(ii) Subject to Section 1.7(e), the Initial Cash Consideration shall be (A)
increased on a dollar for dollar basis by the amount, if any, by which the
Estimated Working Capital is greater than Two Hundred Fifty Thousand
Dollars ($250,000) (the "Working Capital Target"), or (B) decreased on a
dollar for dollar basis by the amount, if any, by which the Estimated Working
Capital is less than the Working Capital Target (any such adjustment to the
Initial Cash Consideration is referred to as the "Estimated Adjustment").

(iii) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall pay a cash
dividend to the Shareholders and cash bonuses to Optionholders in an aggregate
amount (the "Cash Distribution Amount") equal to the amount, if any, by which
the Estimated Cash Balance is greater than Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars
($250,000) (the "Cash Target"); provided, however, such Cash Distribution
Amount shall be reduced by the aggregate amount of Indebtedness paid by the
Company or the Subsidiary during the period from the Signing Date until
immediately prior to the Effective Time (as so reduced, the "Net Cash
Distribution Amount").

(b) _Final Statement_.

(i) Parent shall cause to be prepared and, as soon as practical, but in no
event later than forty-five (45) days after the Closing Date, shall cause to
be delivered to the Securityholder Representative, a calculation of the
Signing Working Capital Amount and the Signing Cash Balance (the "Final
Statement") together with such schedules and data with respect to the
determination thereof as may be appropriate to support such Final Statement.

 

(ii) For a period of thirty (30) days following the delivery of the Final
Statement, the Securityholder Representative and/or its, his or her
accountants shall be provided with reasonable access to and the right to
review and copy, at reasonable times during normal business hours upon not
less than two (2) Business Days prior written notice, those books, records
and work papers of the Company and the Final Surviving Entity which are
relevant to the calculation of the Signing Working Capital Amount and Signing
Cash Balance solely for purposes of verifying the amounts thereof. If the
Securityholder Representative disputes any items in or components of the
Final Statement, the Securityholder Representative shall notify the Parent in
writing, setting forth in reasonable detail the amount, nature and basis of
such dispute within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Final Statement
(the "Dispute Notice"). If the Securityholder Representative fails to deliver
a Dispute Notice within such thirty (30) day period, then the Final Statement
and the Parents determination of the Signing Working Capital Amount and
Signing Cash Balance set forth therein shall be deemed final, binding and
conclusive for all purposes hereunder. In the event a Dispute Notice is timely
given by the Securityholder Representative, the Parent and the Securityholder
Representative shall use their diligent good faith efforts to resolve such
dispute between themselves. If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute
within thirty (30) days after delivery of the Dispute Notice, then any
remaining items in dispute shall be submitted to an independent nationally
recognized accounting firm reasonably acceptable to the Parent and the
Securityholder Representative (the "Independent Accountant") to resolve
the dispute and to make a final

 



-6-   determination of the Signing Working Capital Amount and Signing Cash
Balance. The Independent Accountants shall be directed to resolve the dispute
as promptly as practicable (and in any event within thirty (30) days from the
date that the dispute is submitted to it). Parent and the Securityholders
Representative shall each furnish to the Independent Accountant such work
papers and other documents and information relating to the disputed issues,
and shall provide interviews and answer questions, as such Independent
Accountant may reasonably request. The determination of the Independent
Accountant shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties hereto. The
amounts determined to be the Signing Working Capital Amount and the Signing
Cash Balance pursuant to this Section 1.7(b)(ii) shall constitute the "Final
Working Capital" and the "Final Cash Balance," respectively. The fees and
expenses of the Independent Accountant in connection with the resolution of
disputes pursuant to this paragraph shall be shared equally by the Parent and
the Shareholders; provided, however, that if the Independent Accountant
determines that one party has adopted a position or positions that is/are
frivolous or clearly without merit, the Independent Accountant may, in its
discretion, require that a greater portion, or all, of any such fees and
expenses be paid by such party.

(c) _Post Closing Adjustment; Payment_.

 

(i) If: (A) the Final Working Capital as determined pursuant to Section
1.7(b)(ii) (the "Final Adjustment") results in a greater deficiency or a
lesser surplus than set forth in the Estimated Statement and used to calculate
the Initial Cash Consideration paid at Closing, or (B) the Final Cash Balance
as determined pursuant to Section 1.7(b)(ii) is less than the Estimated Cash
Balance, the difference shall be set-off against and deducted from the First
Deferred Payment; provided, however, that if and to the extent the First
Deferred Payment is not sufficient to pay such difference in full, each
Shareholder shall pay to the Parent as soon as reasonably practicable, but in
any event within twenty (20) Business Days, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account or accounts designated by Parent, its, his or
her Pro Rata Portion of any such difference.

(ii) If (A) the Final Working Capital as determined pursuant to Section
1.7(b)(ii) results in a greater surplus or a lesser deficiency than set forth
in the Estimated Statement and used to calculate the Initial Cash
Consideration paid at Closing, or (B) the Final Cash Balance as determined
pursuant to Section 1.7(b)(ii) exceeds the Cash Target by an amount that is
greater than the Cash Distribution Amount, the difference shall be delivered
by the Parent to the Paying Agent in Cash, subject to Section 1.7(e) below,
as soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event within five (5) Business
Days, along with instructions to distribute such amount to the Shareholders in
accordance with Sections 1.8 and 1.9 below.

(d) _Calculations_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement,
including Schedule 1.7, the parties hereto covenant and agree that no amount
shall be (or is intended to be) included, in whole or in part (either as an
increase or a reduction), more than once in the calculation of (including any
component of) the Final Working Capital or the Final Cash Balance or any
other calculated amount pursuant to this Agreement if the effect of such
additional inclusion (either as an increase or a reduction) would be to cause
such amount to be over- or under-counted for purposes of such calculation.
The parties hereto further covenant and agree that if any provision of this
Agreement requires an amount or calculation to be "determined in accordance
with this Agreement and GAAP" (or words of similar import), then to the
extent that the terms of this Agreement (including Schedule 1.7) expressly
conflict with, or are expressly inconsistent with, GAAP in connection with
such determination, the terms of this Agreement (including Schedule 1.7)
shall control.

 



-7-  (e) _Equity Election_. To the extent necessary to maintain at least
40% "continuity of interest" under Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(e),
which percentage shall be calculated by assuming that Deferred Cash
Consideration is paid in full, the Securityholder Representative may elect, by
giving written notice thereof to the Parent at any time prior to a payment
being made to the Shareholders on account of the Estimated Adjustment or a
Final Adjustment (an "Adjustment Notice"), to require the Parent to pay a
portion of any such payment (such elected amount, the "Elected Amount") by
delivering such number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Elected
Amount divided by the Signing Date Price (the "Adjustment Shares").
Notwithstanding the preceding, the number of Adjustment Shares shall not
exceed the difference between (i) 9,800,000 and (ii) the sum of (A) the Equity
Consideration (net of any Elected Amount) and (B) the number of restricted
shares to be issued under the Employee Awards and under the Employment
Agreements.

1.8 _Payment Schedule_. At or prior to the Closing, the Company shall prepare
and deliver to Parent a schedule, which the Company hereby represents and
warrants will be true, correct and complete as of the date of delivery
("Payment Schedule") setting forth (i) a calculation of the Initial Cash
Consideration, as well as the amount of any Indebtedness, Company Transaction
Expenses (including the names of the beneficiaries thereof and their
respective portions thereof), the Transaction Bonus Amount (including the
names of the beneficiaries thereof and their respective portions thereof) and
the Telegentis Payment (including the names of the beneficiaries thereof and
their respective portions thereof), (ii) the name, address, taxpayer
identification number, and respective Pro Rata Portion of each Shareholder
entitled to distribution of Merger Consideration, along with a statement as to
whether each such Shareholder is an Accredited Shareholder or an Unaccredited
Shareholder, (iii) the number of shares of each class of capital stock held
by each such Shareholder including the respective applicable Certificate
numbers representing such shares, (iv) the amount of each element of Merger
Consideration to which each such Shareholder is entitled, (v) the name,
address and taxpayer identification number of each Optionholder entitled to
distribution of a portion of the Option Surrender Consideration, and (vi) the
amount of the Option Surrender Consideration to which each such Optionholder
is entitled.

1.9 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time that are held by any Shareholder who is entitled
to demand and properly demands appraisal of such Shares (the
"Dissenting Shares") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the
provisions of Section 1930 and Subchapter D of Chapter 15 of Pennsylvania Law,
shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as
provided in Section 1.6(a), but instead such Shareholder shall be entitled to
payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with
Pennsylvania Law. At the Effective Time, the Dissenting Shares shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist,
and each holder or beneficial owner of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of
such shares in accordance with Section 1930 and Subchapter D of Chapter 15 of
Pennsylvania Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder or
beneficial owner of Dissenting Shares shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall
waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 1930 and
Subchapter D of Chapter 15 of Pennsylvania Law or a court of

 



-8-   competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder or beneficial owner
is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 1930 and Subchapter D of
Chapter 15 of Pennsylvania Law, then the right of such holder or beneficial
owner to be paid the fair value of such holders or beneficial owners
Dissenting Shares under Section 1930 and Subchapter D of Chapter 15 of
Pennsylvania Law shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to
have been converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the
right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 1.6(a).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no shareholder of
the Company shall have any right to seek appraisal of Company Common Stock if
such right is not expressly provided for as a result of the Merger under
Section 1930 and Subchapter D of Chapter 15 of Pennsylvania Law,
including after giving full effect to the exemptions set forth in Section
1571(b) of the Business Corporation Law, and nothing in this Agreement is
intended to confer any such right in circumstances where it is otherwise not
so required.

 

1.10 _Surrender of Certificates_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, LLC shall serve
as agent for the Parent (such institution and any successor permitted under
the Paying Agent Agreement, including the Parent, the "Paying Agent") in
connection with the Merger pursuant to a paying agent agreement entered into
by the Parent and the Paying Agent contemporaneously with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement in the form of Exhibit D hereto ("Paying Agent
Agreement"). Parent shall be responsible to the Shareholders and Optionholders
for any failure by Paying Agent to deliver the Merger Consideration and Option
Surrender Consideration in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement
and the Paying Agent Agreement, and for any other breach by Paying Agent of
the terms of the Paying Agent Agreement, except to the extent such failure or
breach is a result of (x) the acts or omissions of a Shareholder(s),
Optionholder(s) and/or the Securityholder Representative or (y) deficiencies
or inaccuracies in the Payment Schedule.

(b) _Delivery of Merger Consideration_. At the Effective Time Parent shall
deliver: (i) $250,000 of the Initial Cash Consideration (constituting the
Representative Fund) to the Securityholder Representative as provided in
Section 6.4(c) below; (ii) the Equity Consideration, the Fractional Amount,
the Option Surrender Consideration and the Initial Cash Consideration (as set
forth on the Payment Schedule and net of the Representative Fund) to the
Paying Agent for exchange in accordance with this Article I and distribution
to the Shareholders and the Optionholders; (iii) the Transaction Bonus Amount
to the Company for distribution in such amounts and to such beneficiaries as
set forth on the Payment Schedule; (iv) the Telegentis Payment to the Company
for distribution in such amounts and to such beneficiaries as set forth on the
Payment Schedule; and (v) the Company Transaction Expenses (to the extent
unpaid at the Effective Time) to the Company for distribution in such amounts
and to such beneficiaries as set forth on the Payment Schedule.

 

(c) _Exchange Procedures_.

(i) Prior to, on or as soon as reasonably practicable after the Signing Date,
the Company shall mail or otherwise deliver a Shareholder Joinder,
Stockholders Agreement and a letter of transmittal substantially in the form
of Exhibit E-1 hereto ("Letter of Transmittal") to each Shareholder. The
Shareholder Joinder shall include, among other things, a representation as to
whether such Shareholder is an "accredited investor" within the meaning of
Regulation D

 



-9-   promulgated under the Securities Act (each, an "Accredited Shareholder" and
collectively, the "Accredited Shareholders"). The Company will instruct
the Shareholders to complete, execute and return to the Company (if returned
prior to the Effective Time) or the Paying Agent (if returned after the
Effective Time) the Shareholder Joinder and Letter of Transmittal, together
with the certificates representing their shares of Company Common Stock (the
"Certificates") and, for those Shareholders that are Accredited Shareholders,
the Stockholders Agreement. Any Shareholder that does not certify that he,
she or it is an "accredited investor" or that has not returned a duly
completed and executed Shareholder Joinder as of the Closing Date will be
deemed not to be an accredited investor for purposes of this Agreement (each,
an "Unaccredited Shareholder" and collectively, the "Unaccredited
Shareholders"). At the Closing, the Company shall deliver the Payment Schedule
and all completed and executed Letters of Transmittal, Shareholder Joinders,
Stockholders Agreements and Certificates received by the Company as of such
date to the Paying Agent. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to
the Paying Agent, together with a duly completed and validly executed Letter
of Transmittal, Shareholder Joinder and (to the extent such Shareholder is an
Accredited Shareholder) Stockholders Agreement in accordance with the
instructions thereto, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive from the Paying Agent, subject to and in accordance with this
Agreement, in exchange therefor, his, her or its allocable portion of the
Merger Consideration, as set forth in the Payment Schedule. Subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Deferred Cash Consideration
shall be distributed by the Paying Agent to each holder of Company Common
Stock who has surrendered his, her or its Company Common Stock in accordance
with the foregoing promptly after receipt of such consideration by the Paying
Agent from the Parent. Until so surrendered, each Certificate outstanding
after the Effective Time (other than those representing any Dissenting Shares)
will be deemed, for all corporate purposes thereafter, to evidence only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration (without interest) into which such
shares of Company Common Stock shall have been so converted. No portion of the
Merger Consideration will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to shares of Company Common Stock formerly
represented thereby until the holder of record of such Certificate shall
surrender such Certificate (or an affidavit to the effect that such
Certificate has been lost, stolen or never issued) pursuant hereto, together
with a properly completed and validly executed letter of transmittal. No
interest shall be paid or accrued on any portion of the Merger Consideration
paid hereunder.

(ii) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Signing Date, the Company
shall mail or otherwise deliver a Stock Option Surrender Agreement in the form
of Exhibit E-2 hereto (the "Option Surrender Agreement") to each Optionholder
with instructions to execute and return such Option Surrender Agreement to the
Company (if returned prior to the Effective Time) or the Paying Agent (if
returned after the Effective Time) on or before December 31st of the calendar
year in which the Effective Time occurs. At the Closing, the Company shall
deliver all executed Option Surrender Agreements received by the Company as of
such date to the Paying Agent. Upon the later of: (a) the surrender of a
validly executed Option Surrender Agreement in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and (b) the Effective Time, the holder of such Company
Option shall be entitled to receive from the Paying Agent, subject to and in
accordance with this Agreement, in exchange therefor, his, her or its
allocable portion of the Option Surrender Consideration, as determined
pursuant to Section 1.6(b). No portion of the Option Surrender Consideration
will be paid to any Optionholder until such Optionholder shall deliver a
validly executed Option Surrender Agreement to the Paying Agent. No interest
shall be paid or accrued on any portion of the Option Surrender Consideration
paid hereunder.

 



-10-  (d) _Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or
other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to
Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time will be paid
to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of
Parent Common Stock represented thereby until the holder of record of such
Certificate shall have complied with Section 1.10(c)(i). Subject to applicable
law, following satisfaction of the terms and conditions of Section 1.10(c)
hereof, there shall be paid to the record holder of the certificates
representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor,
without interest, at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore
paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock. No interest
shall be payable on any cash deliverable upon the exchange of any Company
Common Stock.

 

(e) _Transfers of Ownership_. If any certificate for shares of Parent Common
Stock held by a Shareholder is to be issued in a name other than that in
which the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, or if
any cash amounts are to be disbursed pursuant to Section 1.6 hereof to any
person other than the person or entity whose name is reflected on the
Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor, it will be a condition of the
issuance or delivery thereof that the certificate so surrendered will be
properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the
person requesting such exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent
designated by it any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the
issuance of a certificate for shares of Parent Common Stock in any name other
than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or
established to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it that
such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

(f) _Paying Agent to Return Merger Consideration_. At any time following the
last day of the twelfth (12th) month following the deposit of any component of
Merger Consideration, Parent shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to
deliver to Parent or its designated successor or assign all portions of the
Merger Consideration and Option Surrender Consideration that have been
deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to Section 1.10(b) hereof but
not disbursed to the Shareholders and Optionholders pursuant to Section
1.10(c) hereof, and thereafter the Shareholders and Optionholders shall be
entitled to look only to Parent (subject to the terms of Section 1.10(g)
hereof) with respect to any and all amounts that may be payable to such
holders pursuant to Section 1.6 hereof. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, any portion of the Merger Consideration deposited with the Paying
Agent to pay for Dissenting Shares for which appraisal rights shall have been
perfected shall be returned to Parent, upon demand.

(g) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
1.10, neither the Paying Agent, the Final Surviving Entity, nor any party
hereto shall be liable to a Shareholder or Optionholder for any amount
properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law. Any such portion of the Merger Consideration
and Option Surrender Consideration remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of
Company Common Stock and Company Options immediately prior to such time as
such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Entity shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, become property of
Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

 



-11-  1.11 _Terms and Conditions for Payment of Deferred Cash Consideration_. 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, within five (5)
Business Days after each of the first three anniversaries of the Closing
Date, the Parent shall deliver the First Deferred Payment, the Second Deferred
Payment and the Third Deferred Payment, respectively (each, a "Deferred
Payment"), to the Paying Agent, together with instructions to distribute the
same to the Shareholders in accordance with the Payment Schedule.

(b) If the Parent fails to timely make any of the Deferred Payments when due
and does not remedy such failure within ten (10) Business Days after receipt
of written notice thereof from the Securityholder Representative, then (i) all
of the Deferred Payments shall accelerate and become immediately due and
payable in full; and (ii) Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, to
Securityholder Representative as agent for the Shareholders (A) the
Securityholder Representatives costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees) in connection with the collection of such Deferred Payments,
plus (iii) interest on such unpaid amount of the Deferred Payments at the rate
of eighteen percent (18%) per annum (or the highest rate permitted by
applicable law, if less) for the period from the due date of such Deferred
Payment through the date the Deferred Payments are actually received by the
Securityholder Representative or the Paying Agent, as the case may be. 

1.12 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid in respect of the surrender for exchange of shares of
Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to be
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common
Stock, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records
of the Final Surviving Entity of shares of Company Common Stock which were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Final Surviving Entity for
any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article
I.

1.13 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificates
shall have been lost, stolen, destroyed or claimed never to have been issued,
the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen , destroyed or
never issued certificates upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
holder thereof, such amount, if any, as may be required pursuant to Section
1.6 hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may, in its discretion and as
a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the Shareholder who is
the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates to provide an
indemnification agreement in a form and substance acceptable to Parent,
against any claim that may be made against Parent or the Paying Agent with
respect to the certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

1.14 _Reorganization Status_. The Integrated Merger is intended to constitute
a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Parent
and the Company intend that the First Step Merger and the Second Step Merger
will constitute integrated steps in a single "plan of reorganization" within
the meaning of Treas. Reg. §1.368-2(g), which plan of reorganization the
parties adopt by executing this Agreement. None of the parties hereto will
take any action nor fail to take any action, which action or failure may
cause the Integrated Merger to fail to qualify as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, other than actions required by this
Agreement. Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause each of their
Affiliates to, take the position for all Tax purposes that the Integrated
Merger qualifies as a reorganization under Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code.
The Deferred Cash Consideration is intended to be, and shall be reported as,
part of the Merger Consideration paid with respect to the Company Common Stock
and none of such Deferred Cash Consideration shall be reported or treated as
compensation paid to the recipient.

redacted (x) to remove references concerning the valuation of the Company or
other highly confidential materials, (y) as necessary to comply with
contractual arrangements, and (z) as necessary to address reasonable attorney-
client or other privilege or confidentiality concerns; and (ii) keep the
others reasonably informed of any developments, meetings or discussions with
any Governmental Entity in respect of any filings, investigation, or inquiry
concerning the Merger. No party to this Agreement shall participate in or
agree to participate in any substantive meeting, telephone call or discussion
with any Governmental Entity in respect of any filings, investigation
(including any settlement of the investigation), litigation or other inquiry
relating to such matters unless it consults with the other party in advance

party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting, telephone
call or discussion. The parties to this Agreement will coordinate and
cooperate fully with each other in exchanging such information and providing
such assistance as the other party may reasonably request in connection with
the foregoing. 

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, if any objections
are asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under the
HSR Act, FTC Act, Clayton Act, Sherman Act or if any investigation, litigation
or other administrative or judicial action or proceeding is commenced or
proposed or threatened to be commenced challenging any of the 

 



-43-   transactions contemplated hereby as violative of the HSR Act, FTC Act,
Clayton Act or Sherman Act or which would otherwise prevent, materially impede
or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
each of the Company, Parent and Subs shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to resolve, and to cooperate and assist the other parties in resolving, any
such objections, investigation or litigation, action or proceeding, and shall
make such proposals and take such actions so as to permit the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated as
promptly as practicable in accordance with applicable Law (including
the Antitrust Law).

(e) Each party to this Agreement shall (i) subject to subsection (d) above,
respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any inquiries or requests
for additional information and documentary material received from any
Governmental Entity in connection with any antitrust or competition matters
related to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) not extend any waiting period or agree to refile under the HSR
Act (except with the prior written consent of the other party hereto) and
(iii) not enter into any agreement with any Governmental Entity agreeing not
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(f) If any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby under any regulatory law or if any action, whether
judicial or administrative, is instituted by any Governmental Entity or any
private party challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby as
violative of the HSR Act, FTC Act, Clayton Act or Sherman Act, each of
Parent, Subs and the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to:
(i) oppose or defend against any action to prevent or enjoin consummation of
this Agreement (and the transactions contemplated herein); and/or (ii) take
such action as reasonably necessary to overturn any regulatory action by any
Government Entity to block consummation of this Agreement (and the
transactions contemplated herein), including by defending any action brought
by any Governmental Entity in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated,
overturned or terminated, including by appeal if necessary, in order to
resolve any such objections or challenge as such Governmental Entity
or private party may have to such transactions under such regulatory law so
as to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
provided that Parent, Subs and the Company shall cooperate with one another in
connection with all proceedings related to the foregoing and Parent shall
have final decision making authority on any action or decision required under
this Section 4.6(f) or under Section 4.6(g) below to insure that Parent can
meet its obligations and its ability to consummate the transaction. The
parties shall take reasonable efforts to share information protected from
disclosure under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine, joint
defense privilege or any other privilege pursuant to this section so as to
preserve any applicable privilege.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 4.6 or
elsewhere in this Agreement, Parent and Subs shall have no obligation under
this Agreement: (i) to divest or agree to divest (or cause any of its
subsidiaries to divest or agree to divest) any of its or their respective
businesses, product lines or assets, or to take or agree to take (or cause any
of its subsidiaries to take or agree to take) any other action with respect to
their or the Companys or the Final Surviving Entitys respective businesses,
product lines or assets or (ii) to agree (or cause any of its subsidiaries to
agree) to any limitation or restriction on any of its or their respective
businesses, product lines or assets.

 



-44-  (h) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company
shall not, without the consent of Parent, publicly or before any Governmental
Entity or other third party, offer, suggest, propose or negotiate, and shall
not commit to or effect, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise,
any sale or divestiture. The Company, Parent and Subs and any of their
respective Affiliates shall not take any action with the intention to hinder
or delay the obtaining of clearance or any necessary approval of any Antitrust
Authority under an Premerger Notification Rule or Antitrust Law or the
expiration of the required waiting period under the Premerger Notification
Rules or Antitrust Law.

 

(i) If any divestiture agreed to by the Parent requires action by or with
respect to the Company or its businesses or assets, and such action would
constitute a breach of this Agreement, the Parent hereby agrees to consent to
the taking of such action by the Company and any such action may, at the
discretion of the Company, be conditioned upon consummation of the Merger. 

4.7 _Consent of Shareholders_.

(a) The parties acknowledge and agree that Section 1906 of the Pennsylvania
Law ("Section 1906") shall apply to this Agreement as a result of the
classification of Shareholders into separate groups and the mandatory
treatment of the Shareholders in such groups in a manner that is materially
different from the treatment accorded other Shareholders holding shares of the
same class of Company Common Stock: (i) based on whether such Shareholders
are Accredited Shareholders or Unaccredited Shareholders pursuant to Section
1.10(c), and (ii) with respect to the Accredited Shareholders, based on
whether such Accredited Shareholders are employees, non-employees or Key
Employees of the Company pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement required to
be executed pursuant to Section 4.16 (and which is incorporated into this
Agreement by reference). In accordance with paragraph (a) of Section 1906,
contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement
Shareholders holding at least a majority in interest of the Company Class A
Common Stock and the Company Class B Common Stock are executing
and delivering the Shareholder Joinder which includes, among other things,
the (x) written consent and approval of all Shareholders of this Agreement,
the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby, (y) agreement of all the
Shareholders to perform the obligations imposed on the Shareholders pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement including without limitation the
indemnification obligations set forth in ARTICLE VI and (z) the appointment of
Michael Finke as the Securityholder Representative (collectively, the
"Shareholders Approval"). Promptly following the Signing Date, the Company
shall request of any Shareholders that have not previously done so to execute
and deliver the Shareholder Joinder, and, as provided in paragraph (c) of
Section 1906, any Shareholder that properly objects to this Agreement shall be
entitled to Dissenters Rights in accordance with the provisions of Section
1.9 above.

 

(b) Promptly following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
Shareholders and the Company shall take such actions as are necessary to
submit for shareholder approval (in a manner that complies with the
requirements of Section 280G(b)(5) of the Code and the regulations promulgated
thereunder) any payments made (or to be made) or benefits conferred (or to
be conferred) (including, without limitation, the acceleration of
exercisability of stock options) on any Person by reason of, or arising out of
or relating to, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that would be
deemed to constitute "parachute payments" (within the meaning of Section

 



-45-   280G of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder) (the "280G
Payments"). Prior to soliciting such approval, the Company shall provide
drafts of such shareholder approval materials and waivers to Parent for its
review and approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Prior
to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Parent evidence that a vote of
the Shareholders was solicited in accordance with the foregoing provisions of
this Section 4.7(b) and that either (A) the requisite number of shareholder
votes was obtained with respect to the 280G Payments (the "280G Approval"), or
(B) that the 280G Approval was not obtained, and, as a consequence, the 280G
Payments shall not be made or provided.

4.8 _Additional Documents and Further Assurances; Reasonable Efforts;
Access_.

(a) Each party hereto, at the request of another party hereto, shall execute
and deliver such other instruments and do and perform such other acts and
things as may be necessary or desirable for effecting completely the
consummation of the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions provided in this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take
promptly, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do promptly, or cause to
be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and
regulations to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated
hereby, to satisfy the conditions to the obligations to consummate the
Merger, to obtain all necessary governmental waivers, consents and approvals
and to effect all necessary registrations and filings and to remove any
injunctions or other impediments or delays, legal or otherwise, in order to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
for the purpose of securing to the parties hereto the benefits contemplated by
this Agreement. The Company authorizes the Parent to give prompt notice to
the third parties and to attempt to obtain the third party consents,
approvals, waivers and estoppel certificates set forth on Section 4.8 of the
Disclosure Schedule. The Company shall cooperate with and assist the Parent
in giving such notices and obtaining such consents, approvals, waivers and
estoppel certificates including without limitation transmitting written
requests on Company letterhead and other correspondence (via email or
telephone) by or on behalf of Company officers and in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to the Company seeking the foregoing. The parties agree
that, in the event that any consent, approval, waiver, estoppel certificate or
other authorization necessary or desirable to preserve for the Parent, the
Company or Final Surviving Entity any right or benefit under any lease,
license, commitment or other contract to which the Company is a party is not
obtained prior to the Closing, the Securityholder Representative will,
subsequent to the Closing, cooperate with the Parent, the Company and Final
Surviving Entity in attempting to obtain such consent, approval, waiver,
estoppel certificate or authorization as promptly thereafter as
practicable. From time to time after the Closing, and for no further
consideration, each of the parties shall execute, acknowledge and deliver such
assignments, transfers, consents, assumptions and other documents and
instruments and take such other actions as may be necessary or desirable to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Related Agreements.

(c) Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, from the date hereof through the
Closing the Company will give to Parent and its Representatives reasonable
access at reasonable times to the offices, books and records, Returns,
contracts, commitments, facilities and accountants of the Company, and will
furnish and make available to Parent and its Representatives all such

 



-46-   documents and copies of documents and all such additional financial and
operating data and other information pertaining to the affairs of the Company
as Parent and its Representatives may reasonably request. On the Closing
Date, the Company will deliver or cause to be delivered to the Parent (to the
extent not available at the premises of the Company) all original agreements,
documents, books and records and files stored on computer disks or tapes or
any other storage medium in the possession of the Company relating to the
business and operations of the Company.

__4.9 _Public Announcements._ Parent and Sub, on the one hand, and the
Company, on the other hand, shall consult with each other before issuing, and
provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press
release or other public statements with respect to the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall not issue any such press
release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation or
without the prior consent of the other parties (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided, however, that a party may,
without the prior consent of any other party, issue such a press release or
other similar public statement as may be required by applicable Law or any
listing agreement with a national securities exchange or market to which the
disclosing party is a party, in which case reasonable efforts to provide the
other parties with the opportunity to review and comment upon the press
release or other statement and to address any comments provided by such
parties will be made prior to such disclosure. __

4.10 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers; Insurance_.

(a) From the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the date on
which the Effective Time occurs, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law, each person who was or is made a party
or threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any action, suit or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by
reason of the fact that he or she is or was at any time prior to the
Effective Time, a director or officer of the Company (the "Company Indemnified
Parties"), against all expense, liability and loss (including reasonable
attorneys fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and
amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by
such Company Indemnified Party in connection therewith, whether claimed prior
to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the
Company would have been permitted under its Charter Documents in effect on
the Signing Date. The right to indemnification conferred in this Section
4.10(a) shall include the right to be paid from each of the Parent and the
Surviving Corporation the reasonable expenses incurred in defending any such
action, suit or proceeding in advance of its final disposition, within thirty
(30) days of receipt by the Parent or the Surviving Corporation from the
Company Indemnified Party of a written claim therefore; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company Indemnified Party to whom such expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately
and finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that such Company
Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification under applicable Law
under the organizational documents of the Final Surviving Entity.

(b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the limited liability
company agreement of the Final Surviving Entity shall contain, and the Parent
shall cause the limited liability company agreement of the Final Surviving
Entity to so contain, provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of present and former
directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries than are set forth
in the Articles of Incorporation and By-laws of the Company on the date
hereof.

 



-47-  (c) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain,
or shall cause the Final Surviving Entity to maintain, directors and
officers liability insurance covering any Company Indemnified Parties who are
currently covered by the Companys existing directors and officers
liability insurance on terms no less advantageous to such persons than such
existing insurance; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Parent or
the Final Surviving Entity be required to expend in the aggregate in excess of
two hundred fifty percent (250%) of the annual premium currently paid by the
Company for such coverage, and if such premium would at any time exceed two
hundred fifty percent (250%) of such amount, then Parent or the Final
Surviving Entity shall maintain insurance policies which provide the maximum
and best coverage available at an annual premium equal to two hundred fifty
percent (250%) of such amount; and _provided_ , _further_ , that this Section
4.10(c) shall be deemed to have been satisfied if a prepaid policy or policies
(i.e., "tail coverage") have been obtained by the Company which policy or
policies provide such directors and officers with the coverage described in
this Section 4.10(c) for an aggregate period of not less than six (6) years
with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before
the Closing Date.

 

(d) The provisions of this Section 4.10 are intended to be in addition to the
rights otherwise available to the current officers and directors of the
Company by law, charter, statute, by-law or agreement, and shall operate for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Company Indemnified
Parties, their heirs and their representatives.

 

4.11 _Board Participation Rights_. During the period from the Closing Date
until December 31, 2014, the Securityholder Representative (or his nominee)
shall have the right to attend and participate in all meetings of the Parents
Board of Directors in a nonvoting capacity, and to receive copies of all
notices, minutes, consents, and other information and materials that the
Parent provides to its directors at the same time as such information and
materials are provided to the directors, except as to matters with respect to
which a majority of the members of the Parents Board of Directors determines
that the Securityholder Representative (or his nominee) has a conflict of
interest. The Securityholder Representative (and each successive nominee, as
the case may be) shall be required to execute a confidentiality agreement with
the Parent in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Parent prior
to his or her participation in any meeting of the Parents Board of Directors
or the receipt of any materials described in this Section.

 

4.12 _Certain Tax Matters_.

(a) Except to the extent otherwise required under applicable Law, the parties
shall treat the taxable year of the Company as ending for all Tax purposes at
the end of the day on the Closing Date. 

(b) Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed
all Returns of the Company and the Subsidiary (i) for any taxable period that
ends on or before the Closing Date that are due after the Closing Date taking
into account applicable extensions (each, a "Pre-Closing Period Tax Return"
and the taxable period, a "Pre-Closing Tax Period") and (ii) for any taxable
period beginning on or before the Closing Date and ending after the Closing
Date (each,

 



-48-   a "Straddle Period Tax Return" and the taxable period, a "Straddle Period").
Unless otherwise required by applicable Law, Parent shall prepare such Returns
in a manner consistent with the past practice of the Company and the
Subsidiary. Each such Return will be submitted to the Securityholder
Representative for review and comment at least twenty (20) days prior to the
date such Return is filed and the Parent shall incorporate any reasonable
comments made by the Securityholder Representative prior to the filing of such
Return. In the event there is a disagreement as to whether revisions requested
by the Securityholder Representative should be included in any such Return,
Securityholder Representative and Parent shall attempt in good faith to
resolve such disagreement. Any such disagreement that cannot be resolved
between the Securityholder Representative and Parent shall be submitted
to and resolved by the Independent Accountant , whose decision shall be
final. Notwithstanding the above, Parent shall be entitled to file any such
Return by its due date. In the event such Return does not reflect resolution
of the disagreement (whether resolved by Parent and the Securityholder
Representative together or by the Independent Accountant), such Return shall
be amended as necessary to conform with the resolution of the disagreement.
The fees and costs of the Independent Accountant in connection with any
dispute under this Section 4.12(b) shall be split equally between the Parent,
on the one hand, and the Shareholders on the other hand. All Taxes shown due
and payable on such Returns shall be subject to indemnification as provided
under Section 6.2(a)(iii).

(c) In the case of any taxable period that begins on or before the Signing
Date and ends after the Signing Date (whether or not such period ends on,
before or after the Closing Date), the portion of Taxes for such period which
relates to the portion of such taxable period ending on the Signing Date
shall (i) in the case of any Taxes, other than Taxes based upon or related to
income or receipts or expenses (e.g., payroll Taxes), be deemed to be the
amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the
numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on the
Signing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire
taxable period, and (ii) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to
income or receipts or expenses, be deemed equal to the amount which would be
payable if the relevant taxable period ended as of the end of the Signing
Date.

(d) Parent and the Securityholder Representative shall, and each shall cause
its Affiliates, to cooperate as and to the extent reasonably requested by the
other parties, in connection with the preparation and filing of Returns and in
any Tax audit, examination or other Tax proceeding. Such cooperation shall
include retaining and providing records and information that are reasonably
relevant to any such matters and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional related information and explanation.
The parties shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, retain all
Returns of the Company and the Subsidiary, schedules and work papers and all
material records or other documents relating to Tax matters of the Company
and the Subsidiary for the taxable period first ending after the Closing Date
and for all prior taxable periods until the expiration of the statute of
limitations of the taxable periods to which such Returns and other documents
relate (including extensions).

(e) Parent and the Securityholder Representative agree, upon request of the
other, to use reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document
from any Governmental Entity or any other Person as may be necessary to
mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could otherwise be imposed.

 



-49-  (f) Any refund of Taxes of the Company (including interest thereon) with
respect to a taxable period or portion thereof ending on or before the
Signing Date shall be the property of the Shareholders and shall be promptly
paid to the Shareholders by Parent if received by Parent or any of its
Affiliates or the Company, (i) provided that such Taxes were either paid by
the Company on or before the Signing Date, taken into account in the
determination of the Final Adjustment or otherwise borne economically by the
Shareholders, (ii) not to the extent that such Tax refund was taken into
account in the determination of the Final Adjustment or attributable to losses
or deductions incurred after the Signing Date, and (iii) not to the extent
that payment of the refund would result in less than 40% "continuity of
interest" under Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(e).

(g) Except as otherwise required by applicable Law or Section 4.12(b), Parent
shall not, nor shall Parent cause or permit its Affiliates to, amend, re-file
or otherwise modify any Return of the Company for any taxable period that ends
on or before the Signing Date or begins before and ends after the Signing
Date.

(h) Any transfer taxes (including real property and stock transfer
Taxes), stamp duties, filing fees, registration fees, recordation expenses or
other similar taxes, fees, charges or expenses, including penalties and
interest thereon ("Transfer Taxes") incurred by the Shareholders, the Company
or any other party in connection with the First Step Merger or the Second
Step Merger or in connection with any of the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement shall be borne by the Shareholders. Shareholders shall file
all necessary documentation and Returns with respect to such Transfer Taxes.

(i) At Closing, the Company shall deliver to Parent certification, in form
and substance acceptable to Parent, that the Company has not been during the
five years preceding the Closing Date a US real property holding corporation

Parent with evidence reasonably acceptable to Parent that the Company has
taken all actions necessary and appropriate to terminate such 401(k) Plan
effective prior to the Closing.

 

4.14 _Secured Indebtedness_. At or prior to the Closing, the Company shall
deliver to Parent written evidence in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Parent that all secured Indebtedness of the Company and the
Subsidiary shall have been paid in full as of the Closing Date, and that all
Liens in favor of such holder on the Companys or the Subsidiarys assets
shall be terminated, released and discharged as of the Closing Date.

4.15  _Non-Competition/Non-Solicitation_. At or prior to the Closing, the
Company shall deliver to Parent evidence in form and substance acceptable to
the Parent that each Key Employee and Eric Carraux has in place a non-

Covenant Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit J, and such agreements shall be
in full force and effect.

 



-50-  4.16 _Stockholders  Agreement_. The Parent and each of the
Accredited Shareholders shall enter into a Stockholders Agreement with
respect to registration rights and lock-up provisions applicable to the Equity

before the later of: (a) the Closing Date, and (b) the date such Shareholder
tenders his, her or its Letter of Transmittal and Certificate(s).

in full as of the Closing Date.

4.19 _Shareholder Notice_. Promptly following the Signing Date, but in no
event more than three (3) Business Days after the Signing Date, the Company

licensed or otherwise distributed or commercialized by the Company or the
Subsidiary within six (6) months of the Signing Date) infringes upon,
misappropriates or violates an Intellectual Property right of any third party
in the markets, channels and countries where such Company Product, Company
Intellectual Property or Publicly Available Software is currently used, sold,
licensed or otherwise distributed or commercialized by the Company or the
Subsidiary or currently intended by the Company or the Subsidiary to be used,
sold, licensed or otherwise distributed or commercialized by the Company or
the Subsidiary (each, an "IP Claim") (clauses (i) through (v) of this Section
6.2(a)

 



-53-   are collectively referred to herein as "Parent Indemnified Losses"). For
avoidance of doubt, (A) any Losses under this Section 6.2(a)(v) shall include
costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses of
investigation and defense, incurred or sustained by the Parent Indemnified
Parties related to any such Third Party Claim that leads to or results in any
such final judgment or settlement, and (B) no Parent Indemnified Party shall
be entitled to indemnification for any Third Party Claim under this Section
6.2(a)(v) unless an Officers Certificate with respect to such Third Party
Claim is delivered to the Securityholder Representative within fifteen (15)
months following the Closing Date.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, subject to the
limitations set forth in this Agreement, prior to the Effective Time, the
Company agrees to indemnify and hold the Parent Indemnified Parties harmless
against all Losses incurred or sustained by the Parent Indemnified Parties,
or any of them (other than the Surviving Corporation and Final Surviving
Entity), directly or indirectly, as a result of, with respect to or in
connection with the Parent Indemnified Losses.

 

(c) Subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, the Parent agrees
to indemnify and hold the Company (prior to the Effective Time), and the
Shareholders (from and after the Effective Time), and their respective
officers, directors, managers, employees, stockholders, agents, successors,
heirs and Affiliates (collectively, the "Securityholder
Indemnified Parties"), harmless against all Losses incurred or sustained by
the Securityholder Indemnified Parties, or any of them, directly or
indirectly, as a result of, with respect to or in connection with:

 

(i) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of the Parent
contained in this Agreement or in any certificate or other instruments
delivered by or on behalf of the Parent pursuant to this Agreement; and

(ii) any failure by the Parent to perform, fulfill or comply with any
covenant applicable to it contained in this Agreement.

(d) In determining the amount of any Losses for which a Parent Indemnified
Party or a Securityholder Indemnified Party (each an "Indemnified Party") is
entitled to assert a claim for indemnification hereunder, the amount of any
such Losses shall be determined after deducting therefrom (i) the amount of
any insurance proceeds and other third party recoveries actually received in
respect of such Losses by the Indemnified Party (which proceeds and recoveries
the Indemnified Party agrees to use diligent efforts to obtain) and (ii) any
Tax benefits actually realized. If an indemnification payment is received by
any party, and such party or any of its Affiliates later receives insurance
proceeds, other third party recoveries or realized Tax benefits in respect of
the related Losses for which it is required to account pursuant to the
preceding sentence, the Indemnified Party shall immediately pay to the
indemnifying party (or, in the case of the Shareholders, the
Securityholder Representative, for the benefit of the Shareholders), a sum
equal to the lesser of (A) the actual amount of such insurance proceeds, other
third party recoveries and realized Tax benefits and (B) the actual amount of
the indemnification payment previously paid to the Indemnified Party with
respect to such Losses. Without limiting the rights of the parties under this
Article VI, any Indemnifying Party shall have a reasonable opportunity to
mitigate any Losses with respect to which such Indemnified Party is entitled
to assert a claim for indemnification hereunder, at the Indemnifying Partys
sole cost and expense, provided that (i) the rights and obligations of the 

 



-54-   Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party under this Agreement are not
limited in any way and (ii) the exercise of the foregoing right by the
Indemnifying Party does not delay, prejudice or interfere in any way with the
Indemnified Partys right to promptly defend or settle Third Party Claims or
otherwise adversely affect the Indemnified Party.

(e) For purposes of calculating the amount of Losses incurred by a Parent
Indemnified Party or a Securityholder Indemnified Party arising out of or
resulting from any breach of a representation or warranty, covenant or
agreement, the references to a "Company Material Adverse Effect," "Parent
Material Adverse Effect" or materiality (or other correlative terms) shall be
disregarded.

 

6.3 _Indemnification Claims._

(a) _Satisfaction of Claims_.

(i) Subject to Section 6.5 hereof, any claims by a Parent Indemnified Party
for indemnification of Losses claimed under Section 6.2(a) to which such
Parent Indemnified Party becomes entitled pursuant to the provisions of
Sections 6.3(b) through (e) below or by final, non-appealable order of a
court of competent jurisdiction shall be satisfied (A) first, by setting-off
against and deducting the amount of such Losses from any and all Deferred
Payments, and (B) only if and to the extent the Deferred Payments are not
sufficient to pay such Losses in full, each Shareholder shall pay to the
Parent Indemnified Party, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
an account or accounts designated by Parent (subject to the next sentence of
this Section 6.3(a)(i)), its, his or her Pro Rata Portion of any such
indemnification claim which is not satisfied pursuant to the foregoing clause
(A); provided, however that if a Shareholder becomes obligated to pay to a
Parent Indemnified Party its, his or her Pro Rata Portion of any
indemnification claim pursuant to clause (B) above at any time while any
shares of Purchaser Common Stock received by such Shareholder as part of the
Merger Consideration remain subject to the restrictions on transfer set forth
in Section 12 of the Stockholders Agreement, then fifty-five percent (55%) of
such payment obligation shall be satisfied by transferring and delivering to
the Parent shares of Parent Common Stock, which will for these purposes be
valued at the Signing Date Price, and forty-five percent (45%) shall be
payable by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by the Parent. If the indemnifying Shareholder does not own a
sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock to meet the foregoing
requirement, then he, she or it shall deliver all shares of Parent Common
Stock then owned by the Shareholder to the Parent Indemnified Party and the
balance of that Shareholders Pro Rata Portion shall be payable by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the
Parent.

 

(ii) Any amounts payable to Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to Section
6.2(b) to which such Parent Indemnified Party becomes entitled pursuant to
the provisions of Sections 6.3(b) through (e) below or by final, non-
appealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction shall be payable by the
Company to the Parent by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account or accounts designated by the Parent.

(iii) Any amounts payable to the Securityholder Indemnified Parties pursuant
to Section 6.2(c) to which such Securityholder Indemnified Party becomes
entitled pursuant to the provisions of Sections 6.3(b) through (e) below or by
final, non-appealable order of a 

 



-55-   court of competent jurisdiction shall be payable by the Parent to the
Securityholder Representative, on behalf of the applicable Securityholder
Indemnified Parties, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account or accounts designated by the Securityholder Representative, to be
disbursed to the applicable Securityholder Indemnified Parties by the
Securityholder Representative; provided, however, upon written notice by the
Securityholder Representative to Parent, Parent shall limit the amount payable
to the Securityholder Representative to the extent that such payment would
result in less than 40% "continuity of interest" under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.368-1(e).

(iv) Any payment for Losses pursuant to this Article VI shall be treated as
an adjustment to the Merger Consideration.

(b) _Claims for Indemnification_.

 

(i) In order to seek indemnification under Section 6.2(a) or Section 6.2(b)
hereof, Parent shall deliver an Officers Certificate to the Securityholder
Representative or the Company, as appropriate, at any time on or before the
Survival Date or the Effective Time, respectively. Unless the Parent receives
from the Securityholder Representative or the Company, as the case may be, an
Objection Notice pursuant to Section 6.3(c) hereof, the Parent shall be
entitled to indemnification for the Loss set forth in such Officers
Certificate in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.3(a)(i) or Section
6.3(a)(ii), as appropriate.

(ii) In order to seek indemnification on behalf of one or more Securityholder
Indemnified Parties under Section 6.2(c) hereof, the Company or Securityholder
Representative, as appropriate, shall deliver a Securityholder
Representatives Certificate to the Parent at any time on or before the
Survival Date. Unless the Parent delivers an Objection Notice to the
Securityholder Representative pursuant to Section 6.3(c) hereof, the Parent
shall pay an amount equal to the Loss set forth in such
Securityholder Representative Certificate in accordance with the provisions
of Section 6.3(a)(iii). For the purposes hereof, "Securityholder
Representatives Certificate" shall mean a certificate signed by the Company
or the Securityholder Representative, as appropriate: (A) stating that a
Securityholder Indemnified Party has paid, sustained, incurred, or properly
accrued Losses for which it is entitled to indemnification hereunder, and (B)
specifying in reasonable detail the individual items of Losses included in
the amount so stated, the manner in which such amounts were calculated, the
date each such item was paid, sustained, incurred, or properly accrued, and
the nature of the misrepresentation, breach of warranty or covenant to which
such item is related.

(c) _Objections to Claims for Indemnification_. Upon receipt of an Officers
Certificate or a Securityholder Representatives Certificate, as appropriate,
from an Indemnified Party, the Securityholder Representative, the Company or
the Parent, as the case may be (the "Indemnifying Party"), shall review the
claims therein and shall be entitled to object in a written statement to the
claims made in such certificate (an "Objection Notice"), such Objection Notice
to contain a description of the basis of such objection and shall be
delivered to Indemnified Party prior to the expiration of the thirtieth (30th)
day after its receipt of such Officers Certificate or Securityholder
Representatives Certificate. If the Indemnifying Party does not object in
writing within such 30-day period, such failure to so object shall be an
irrevocable acknowledgment by the Indemnifying Party that the Indemnified
Party is entitled to the full amount of the claim for Losses set forth in
such Officers Certificate or Securityholder Representatives Certificate,
provided that

 



-56-   the Officers Certificate or Securityholder Representatives Certificate has
been validly delivered in accordance with Section 8.1 hereof. If the
Indemnifying Party does not so object then, subject to the limitations set
forth herein, the amount of Losses claimed shall be paid in accordance with
the provisions of Section 6.3(a).

(d) _Resolution of Conflicts_.

(i) In case an Indemnifying Party delivers an Objection Notice in accordance
with Section 6.3(c) hereof, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party
shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties
with respect to each of such claims. If the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement
shall be prepared and signed by both parties, and the amount of Losses so
agreed, if any shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of Section
6.3(a).

(ii) At any time following delivery of an Objection Notice by an Indemnifying
Party to an Indemnified Party, either Parent, on the one hand, or the
Securityholder Representative, on the other hand, may pursue any and all legal
or equitable remedies available to them under applicable law, subject to the
provisions of Section 6.5 below.

(e) _Third-Party Claims_. In the event an Indemnified Party becomes aware of
a third party claim which the Indemnified Party reasonably believes may
result in a demand for indemnification pursuant to this Article VI (a "Third
Party Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party of
such claim and, upon written notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnified Party may assume control of the defense of such Third Party Claim
with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party. If the
Indemnified Party does not assume the defense of such Third Party Claim
within a 15 day period following the time it becomes aware of such Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall control such defense. The party not
controlling such defense shall execute any appropriate powers of attorney to
allow the other party to control the defense, and may participate therein at
its own expense. The party controlling such defense shall keep the other party
advised of the status of such Third Party Claim and the defense thereof and
shall consider in good faith recommendations made by the other party with
respect thereto. The Indemnified Party shall not agree to any settlement of
such Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned. The Indemnifying Party shall not agree to any settlement of a
Third Party Claim that (x) does not include a complete release of the
Indemnified Party from all liability with respect thereto (y) imposes any
liability or obligation on the Indemnified Party or (z) may result in
additional Taxes on the Indemnified Party, in each case without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned.

6.4 _Securityholder Representative._

 

(a) By virtue of the approval of the Merger and this Agreement by the
requisite vote of the Shareholders, each of the Shareholders shall be deemed
to have agreed to appoint Michael Finke as his, her or its agent and attorney-
in-fact, as the Securityholder Representative for and on behalf of the
Shareholders to give and receive notices and communications, to authorize
payment to any Parent Indemnified Party in satisfaction of claims by any
Parent Indemnified Party, to object to such payments, to agree to, negotiate,
enter into settlements and compromises of, and

 



-57-   demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of
arbitrators with respect to such claims, to assert, negotiate, enter into
settlements and compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders
of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to, any other claim by any
Parent Indemnified Party against any Shareholder or by any such Shareholder
against any Parent Indemnified Party or any dispute between any
Parent Indemnified Party and any such Shareholder, in each case relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and to take all other
actions that are either (i) necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the
Securityholder Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing or (ii)
specifically mandated by the terms of this Agreement. The Securityholder
Representative will also act as a proxy for each Shareholder who elects to
execute and deliver a Proxy and Voting Agreement in the form prescribed by
the Securityholder Representative, granting the Securityholder Representative
the right to vote the shares of Parent Common Stock held by such Shareholder
following the Closing in accordance with the provisions of such Proxy and
Voting Agreement with a view toward combining the voting power of those
Shareholders and increasing their collective influence over the affairs of the
Parent after the Effective Time. The Securityholder Representative may be
changed from time to time upon not less than thirty (30) days prior written
notice to Parent; _provided, however_ , that the Securityholder Representative
may not be removed unless Shareholders holding a majority of the
Company Class A Common Stock (as of the Effective Time) agree to such removal
and to the identity of the substituted agent. No bond shall be required of the
Securityholder Representative, and the Securityholder Representative shall not
receive any compensation for its services. Notices or communications to or
from the Securityholder Representative shall constitute notice to or from the
Shareholders.

(b) The Securityholder Representative shall not be liable for any act done or
omitted hereunder or under any Proxy and Voting Agreement as Securityholder
Representative while acting in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable
judgment. The Shareholders shall indemnify the Securityholder Representative
and hold the Securityholder Representative harmless against any loss,
liability or expense incurred without gross negligence or bad faith on the
part of the Securityholder Representative and arising out of or in connection
with the acceptance or administration of the Securityholder Representatives
duties hereunder or under any Proxy and Voting Agreement, including the
reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel retained by the
Securityholder Representative ("Securityholder Representative Expenses"). A
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Securityholder Representative,
including but not limited to an amendment, extension or waiver of this
Agreement, shall constitute a decision of the Shareholders and shall be final,
binding and conclusive upon the Shareholders; and Parent may rely upon any
such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Securityholder
Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Shareholders. The Parent is hereby relieved from any liability to any person
for any decision, act, consent or instruction of the Securityholder
Representative. 

(c) At the Closing, the Parent shall pay $250,000 of the Initial Cash
Consideration to the Securityholder Representative for Securityholder
Representative Expenses (the "Representative Fund"). The Securityholder
Representative shall maintain the Representative Fund in a separate bank
account for the benefit of the Shareholders. Any
Securityholder Representative Expenses above the amount in the Representative
Fund shall be paid by the Shareholders on a pro rata basis in accordance with
its, his or her Pro Rata Portion of the Merger Consideration received
hereunder. Any unused funds remaining in the Representative Fund shall be
distributed to the Shareholders according to their Pro Rata Portion.

 



-58-  6.5 _Limitations on Indemnification Obligations; Remedy_.

 

(a) Except as set forth in Section 6.5(c), no Parent Indemnified Party or
Securityholder Indemnified Party may recover any Losses under Sections
6.2(a)(i), 6.2(a)(v), 6.2(b) (with respect to a Representation Breach or an IP
Claim), or Section 6.2(c)(i), respectively hereof: (i) with respect to any
single Loss (or series of related Losses) of less than $25,000; and (ii)
unless and until the aggregate Losses incurred by the Parent Indemnified
Parties or the Securityholder Indemnified Parties, respectively, for the
matters set forth in Section 6.2(a)(i), 6.2(a)(v), 6.2(b) (with respect to a
Representation Breach or an IP Claim), or Section 6.2(c)(i) exceed $1,000,000
(the "Basket Amount"), in which case the Parent Indemnified Parties or the
Securityholder Indemnified Parties, as the case may be, shall be entitled to
recover all such Losses in respect of such matters (not just amounts in excess
of the Basket Amount), subject to the limitations set forth in Section
6.5(a)(i) and Section 6.5(b).

(b) Except as set forth in Section 6.5(c) hereof, in no event shall the
aggregate collective liability of the Company (with respect to the period
from the Signing Date through the Effective Time) and the Shareholders (from
and after the Effective Time), on the one hand, and the Parent, on the other
hand, for Losses under Sections 6.2(a)(i), 6.2(a)(v), 6.2(b) (with respect to
a Representation Breach or an IP Claim), or Section 6.2(c)(i), respectively
exceed $13,000,000, and in no event shall the aggregate individual liability
of any Shareholder arising out of the Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby exceed his, her or its Pro Rata Portion of $13,000,000.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
limitations set forth in Sections 6.5(a) and (b) shall not apply in respect of
Losses arising out of (A) fraud, or (B) any breach or inaccuracy of any
Fundamental Representation.

(d) Except (i) to the extent resulting from fraud by the Company, any one or
more Shareholders or the Parent, or (ii) for the rights of the parties under
Article VII, the remedies provided in this Article VI shall be the exclusive
remedies of the parties hereto and their heirs, successors and assigns in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No party may
commence any suit, action or proceeding against any other party hereto, its
heirs, successors or assigns or any of their respective Affiliates with
respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, whether in contract, tort or
otherwise, except with respect to any rights, remedies or claims based on
fraud or to enforce such partys express rights under this Article VI.
Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit Parents remedies under the
Shareholder Joinder against any Shareholder with respect to a breach by that
Shareholder of his, her or its representations, warranties and covenants
contained therein.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article VI
or elsewhere in this Agreement, the parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to a temporary
restraining order or an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy to which any party may
be entitled hereunder or at Law or in equity.

 



-59-  (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article VI
or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither the Company nor the Shareholders
shall under any circumstances be responsible for, or have any indemnification
obligations or other liability or obligations to any Parent Indemnified
Parties with respect to: (i) any Losses resulting from or arising out of any
External Factors (but subject to the indemnification rights under Section
6.2(a)(i) and Section 6.2(b) (with respect to a Representation Breach)
and Section 6.2(a)(v)), (ii) any Losses or amounts taken into account in
calculating the Final Adjustment or reserved for on the Current Balance Sheet,
or (iii) any Losses resulting from or arising as a result of any IP
Claim brought against any of the Parent Indemnified Parties following any
claim or lawsuit (each, a "Suit"), or threat of a Suit, initiated by or on
behalf of any of the Parent Indemnified Parties or their Affiliates against
the party bringing the IP Claim (an "IP Claimant") or any of such IP
Claimants Affiliates; provided, however, that this subsection (iii) shall not
relieve the Company or the Shareholders of their indemnification obligations
with respect to any IP Claim that is brought against any of the Parent
Indemnified Parties if the Suit, or threat of a Suit, initiated by or on
behalf of such Parent Indemnified Party(ies) or its Affiliate(s), was
initiated in response to a Suit brought by or an explicit oral or written
threat of a Suit made by or on behalf of the IP Claimant against such Parent
Indemnified Party(ies) or its Affiliate(s) alleging infringement,
misappropriation or violation of Intellectual Property rights of such
IP Claimant.
