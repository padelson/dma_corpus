this Agreement are defined in _Section_ __ _ 8.12_.

 

WHEREAS, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, Merger Sub has agreed to commence a cash tender offer to acquire
all of the outstanding shares of the common stock, par value $0.0001 per
share, of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") for $225.00 per share (such
amount, or any other amount per share paid in such offer in accordance
with this Agreement, the " _Offer Price_ "), net to the seller in cash,
without interest (such offer, as may be extended and amended from time to time
as permitted under, or required by, this Agreement, the " _Offer_ ");

 

WHEREAS, following the consummation of the Offer, upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the
Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "), Merger Sub will be merged
with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), with the Company surviving the
Merger, and pursuant to the Merger each share of Company Common Stock that is
not validly tendered and accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer (except as
otherwise provided herein) will be converted into the right to receive the
Offer Price, net to the seller in cash, without interest;

 

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company acknowledge and agree that the
Merger shall be effected under Section 251(h) of the DGCL and, subject to the
terms of this Agreement, effected as soon as practicable following the
consummation of the Offer;

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has unanimously (i) determined
that this Agreement and the Transactions are advisable, fair to and in the
best interests of the Company and its stockholders, (ii) duly authorized and
approved the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this
Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the Transactions, (iii)
resolved that the Merger shall be effected under Section 251(h) of the DGCL
and that the Merger shall be consummated as soon as practicable following the
Offer Acceptance Time and (iv) resolved, subject to the terms of this
Agreement, to recommend that the Companys stockholders accept the Offer and
tender their shares of Company Common Stock in the Offer;

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of Parent and Merger Sub has
unanimously duly authorized and approved the execution, delivery and
performance by each of Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and the
consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Transactions, and the Board of
Directors of Merger Sub has declared this Agreement advisable;

 

WHEREAS, Parent, in its capacity as sole stockholder of Merger Sub, will
approve and adopt this Agreement by written consent immediately following its
execution;

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
as a condition and inducement to the willingness of Parent and Merger Sub to
enter into this Agreement, Tassos Gianakakos, as a holder of Company Common
Stock, has delivered to Parent and Merger Sub a tender and support agreement
(the " _Support Agreement_ ") dated as of the date hereof providing that such
stockholder has, among other things, agreed to (i) tender the shares of
Company Common Stock beneficially owned by him in the Offer, and (ii) support
the Merger and the other Transactions, each on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in the Support Agreement; and

WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this
Agreement.

   

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
hereby agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

_The Transactions _

SECTION 1.01. _The Offer_. (a) __ _ Provided_ that this Agreement shall
not have been terminated in accordance with _Article VII_ , as promptly as

subject only to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent such waiver is
permitted by this Agreement and applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in
Annex I (collectively, the " _Offer Conditions_ ") and, for the avoidance of
doubt, no other conditions, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger
Sub to), at or as promptly as practicable following the Expiration Time,
irrevocably accept for payment (such time of acceptance for payment, the "
_Offer Acceptance Time_ ") and, at or as promptly as practicable following
the Offer Acceptance Time (and in any event within three (3) Business Days)
pay for all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer. Parent shall provide or cause to be provided
to Merger Sub, at the Offer Acceptance Time and on a timely basis at all times
thereafter, the funds necessary to purchase any shares of Company Common Stock
that Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer.

 

(c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer
to Purchase_ ") in accordance with the terms set forth in this Agreement and
subject only to the Minimum Condition and the other Offer Conditions. Merger
Sub expressly reserves the exclusive right to (i) increase the Offer Price,
(ii) waive any Offer Condition other than the Minimum Condition, the
Termination Condition or the conditions set forth in clause (b) or (d) of
Annex I and (iii) make any other changes to the terms and conditions of the
Offer not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,

Parent shall cause Merger Sub not to, (A) except as otherwise required or
expressly permitted by _Section_ __ _ 1.01(f)_, decrease the Offer Price, (B)
change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (C) decrease the
maximum number of shares of Company Common Stock sought to be purchased in
the Offer, (D) impose any conditions to the Offer other than the Offer
Conditions, (E) amend, modify or supplement any of the Offer Conditions in a
manner that adversely affects, or would reasonably be expected to
adversely affect, the holders of Company Common Stock, (F) amend, modify or
waive the Minimum Condition, the Termination Condition or the conditions set
forth in clause (b) or (d) of Annex I, (G) except as otherwise required or
expressly permitted by _Section_ __ _ 1.01(e)_, extend or otherwise change
the Expiration Time or (H) otherwise amend, modify or supplement any of the
other terms of the Offer in any manner that adversely affects, or would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect, the holders of Company Common
Stock. The Offer may not be terminated prior to its scheduled Expiration Time,
unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Article VII_.

 

(d) The Offer shall expire at midnight (New York City time) ( _i.e._ , one
minute after 11:59 p.m. New York City time) on the date that is twenty
business days (calculated in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the
Exchange Act) following the commencement (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2
under the Exchange Act) of the Offer (such initial expiration date and time of
the Offer, the " _Initial Expiration Time_ ") or, if the Offer has been
extended pursuant to and in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.01(e)_, the
date and time to which the Offer has been so extended (the Initial Expiration
Time, or such later expiration date and time to which the Offer has been so
extended, the " _Expiration Time_ ").

 



2

    

(e) Subject to each party heretos respective rights to terminate the
Agreement pursuant to _Article VII_:

(i) If, at the then-scheduled Expiration Time, any of the Offer Conditions
has not been satisfied or waived by Parent and Merger Sub (to the extent such
waiver is permitted under this Agreement and applicable Law), then (x) Merger
Sub may, in its sole discretion (and without the consent of the Company or
any other Person) and (y) upon the Companys written request, Merger Sub
shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, extend the Offer on one or more
occasions in consecutive increments of up to ten (10) Business Days each
(each such increment to end at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the last
Business Day of such increment) in order to permit the satisfaction of such
Offer Condition(s); _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) Merger Sub shall not be
required to extend the Offer to a date later than the Outside Date and Merger
Sub shall not be permitted to extend the offer to a date later than the
Outside Date without the prior written consent of the Company and (ii) if at
any then scheduled expiration of the Offer, all of the Offer Conditions (other
than the Minimum Condition and any Offer Conditions that are by their nature
to be satisfied at the Offer Acceptance Time) have been satisfied or
waived (to the extent permitted by this Agreement and applicable Law) and the
Minimum Condition has not been satisfied, Merger Sub shall not be required to
(and Parent shall not be required to cause Merger Sub to) extend the Offer for
more than three additional consecutive increments of ten (10) Business Days
(or such shorter periods as may be agreed to by the Company and Merger Sub);

 

(ii) Merger Sub shall extend the Offer for the minimum period required by
applicable Law, interpretation or position of the SEC or its staff or The
NASDAQ Global Select Market (the " _NASDAQ_ ") or its staff; and

 

(iii) Merger Sub shall not, and Parent shall not permit Merger Sub to,
extend the Offer in any manner except as required or expressly permitted
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1.01(e)_.

(f) The Offer Price shall be adjusted appropriately and proportionately to
reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend
(including any dividend or other distribution of securities convertible into
Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to Company
Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and at or prior to the
Offer Acceptance Time, and such adjustment to the Offer Price shall provide
to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action.

 

(g) In the event that this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
_Article VII_ , Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) as
promptly as practicable (and in any event within one (1) Business Day of such
termination) irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer, and shall
not acquire any shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and
shall cause any depository acting on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub to return,
in accordance with applicable Law, all tendered shares of Company Common Stock
to the registered holders thereof.

 

(h) As promptly as practicable on the date of commencement of the Offer
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act), Parent and Merger
Sub shall (i) file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with
respect to the Offer (together with all exhibits, amendments and
supplements thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ ") that will contain or incorporate
by reference the Offer to Purchase and form of the related letter of
transmittal (the Schedule TO, together with all documents included therein
pursuant to which the Offer will be made, and all amendments and supplements
thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ ") and (ii) cause the Offer Documents to be
disseminated to holders of shares of Company Common Stock. Each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company agrees to promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent such party
becomes aware that such information shall have become false or misleading in
any material respect, and Parent further agrees to use all reasonable efforts
to promptly cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC
and to promptly be disseminated to holders of shares of Company Common

 Stock, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable Law. The
Company shall promptly furnish or otherwise make available to Parent, Merger
Sub or Parents legal counsel any information concerning the Company and the
Companys Subsidiaries that is required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in
the Offer Documents or that is reasonably requested by Parent or Merger Sub in
connection with any action contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 1.01(h)_. The
Company and its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the Offer Documents prior to the filing thereof with the SEC, and
Parent and Merger Sub shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to
any comments made by the Company and its counsel. Parent and Merger Sub agree
to provide the Company and its counsel with any comments (including a summary
of any oral comments) that Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel may receive
from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after
receipt of such comments. Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall give the Company
and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to participate in the formulation of
any written response to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to
the Offer Documents, and Parent and Merger Sub shall respond promptly to any
such comments.

 

(i) Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the paying agent with
respect to the Offer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
amounts otherwise payable pursuant to the Offer such amounts as are required
to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the " _Code_ ") and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, or under any provision of state, local or
non-U.S. Tax Law. To the extent amounts are so withheld and paid over to the
appropriate Governmental Authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.

 

SECTION 1.02. _Company Actions_ _._

 

(a) As promptly as practicable on the date of commencement of the Offer
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act), the Company shall,
concurrently with or following the filing of the Schedule TO, file with the
SEC and disseminate, in accordance with applicable U.S. Federal securities
Laws and Section 262 of the DGCL, to holders of shares of Company Common
Stock a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9
(together with any exhibits, amendments or supplements thereto, the "
_Schedule 14D-9_") that, subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.02_, shall contain the
Company Board Recommendation and a notice of appraisal rights in accordance
with Section 262 of the DGCL. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
agrees to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the
Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent such party becomes aware that such
information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and
the Company further agrees to use all reasonable efforts to promptly cause the
Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to promptly be
disseminated to holders of shares of Company Common Stock, in each case as and
to the extent required by applicable Law. Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly
furnish or otherwise make available to the Company or its legal counsel any
information concerning Parent, Merger Sub or any Affiliate of Parent that is
required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Schedule 14D-9 or that is
reasonably requested in connection with any action contemplated by this
_Section_ __ _ 1.02(a)_. Unless the Board of Directors of the Company has
made an Adverse Recommendation Change, (i) Parent and its counsel shall be
given reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9
prior to the filing thereof with the SEC, and the Company shall give
reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by Parent and its
counsel, (ii) the Company agrees to provide Parent and its counsel with any
comments (including a summary of any oral comments) the Company or its counsel
may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9
promptly after receipt of such comments, and (iii) the Company shall give
Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to participate in the
formulation of any written response to any comments of the SEC or its staff
with respect to the Schedule 14D-9, and the Company shall respond promptly to
any such comments. To the extent requested by the Company, Parent shall cause
the Schedule 14D-9 to be mailed or otherwise disseminated to the holders of
Company Common Stock together with the Offer Documents disseminated to the
holders of Company Common Stock.

 

(b) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall (or shall cause its
transfer agent to) promptly furnish Parent with a list of its stockholders,
mailing labels and any available listing or computer file containing

 



4

    

 the names and addresses of all record holders of shares of Company Common
Stock and lists of securities positions of shares of Company Common Stock held
in stock depositories as of the most recent practicable date, to the extent
known by the Company, and shall provide to Parent such additional information
(including updated lists of stockholders, mailing labels and lists of
securities positions) as Parent may reasonably request in connection with the
Offer. Except as permitted by _Section_ __ _ 5.05_, Parent and Merger Sub and
their Representatives shall hold in confidence the information contained in
any such labels, listings and files, shall use such information only in
connection with the Transactions and, if this Agreement shall be terminated,
shall, upon written request, deliver, and shall use their reasonable efforts
to cause their Representatives to deliver, to the Company or destroy
(at Parents election) all copies and any extracts or summaries from such
information then in their possession or control.

 

(c) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 1.01(h)_ and _Section_ __ _ 5.02_, the
Company consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of a description of
the Company Board Recommendation.

 

SECTION 1.03. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the provisions of the
DGCL (including Section __ 251(h) of the DGCL), at the Effective Time, Merger
Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease, and the Company shall be the
surviving corporation in the Merger. The Company, as the surviving corporation
after the Merger, is hereinafter referred to as the " _Surviving Corporation_
".

 

SECTION 1.04. _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ")
shall take place as soon as practicable following (but in any event on the
same date as) the Offer Acceptance Time, subject to the satisfaction or waiver
(to the extent such waiver is permitted by applicable Law) of the conditions
set forth in _Article V_ I (other than those conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver

ARTICLE II

_Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock; Exchange of Certificates;_

_Equity-Based Awards_

 

SECTION 2.01. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent,
Merger Sub or the holder of any shares of Company Common Stock or any shares
of capital stock of Merger Sub:

 

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of
capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.0001
per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) _Cancelation of Certain Shares_. All shares of Company Common Stock
that are owned by the Company as treasury stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration
shall be delivered in exchange therefor. All shares of Company Common Stock
then held by Parent or Merger Sub, including any shares irrevocably accepted
for payment by Merger Sub in the Offer, shall be canceled and shall cease to
exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding
share of Company Common Stock (other than (i) Appraisal Shares to be treated
in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.06_ and (ii) shares of Company Common
Stock to be canceled in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.01(b)_) shall be
converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent only the right to
receive $225.00 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As
of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist,
and each holder of a certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_
") or non-certificated shares of Company Common Stock held in book entry form
(each, a " _Book Entry Share_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be paid in
consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate or Book Entry Share
in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.02(b)_.

 

SECTION 2.02. _Exchange of Certificates and Book Entry Shares_ _._

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall designate the
Companys transfer agent (or another bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company) to act as agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for

 



6

    

 the payment of the Merger Consideration in accordance with this _Article II_
and, in connection therewith, prior to the Closing Date shall enter into an
agreement with the Paying Agent in a form reasonably acceptable to the
Company. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to
be deposited with the Paying Agent an amount in cash sufficient to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration (such cash being hereinafter referred to as
the " _Exchange Fund_ "). Pending its disbursement in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 2.02_, the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent
as directed by Parent in short-term direct obligations of the United States
of America or short-term obligations for which the full faith and credit of
the United States of America is pledged to provide for the payment of
principal and interest. Any interest and other income from such investments
shall become part of the funds held by the Paying Agent for purposes of paying
the Merger Consideration, and any amounts in excess of the aggregate amount of
the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.01_ shall be
returned to the Surviving Corporation in accordance with _Section_ __ _
2.02(e)_. Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to promptly
replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the
Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying
Agent to make all payments of Merger Consideration in accordance herewith. No
investment losses resulting from investment of the funds deposited with the
Paying Agent shall diminish the rights of any holder of shares of Company
Common Stock to receive the Merger Consideration as provided herein. The
Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than as expressly
set forth in this Agreement.

(b) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, and in any
event within three (3) Business Days thereafter, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person who was, as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of Company Common
Stock (other than the Company Common Stock to be canceled in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 2.01(b)_) (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying
Agent, and which shall be in such form and shall have such other customary
provisions (including customary provisions regarding delivery of an "agents
message" with respect to Book Entry Shares) as Parent and the Company may
reasonably agree prior to the Closing Date) and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book Entry Shares in exchange
for payment of the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section_ __ _
2.01(c)_. Upon (A) surrender of a Certificate for cancelation to the Paying
Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with such letters instructions (and such other
customary documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent) or (B)
in the case of Book Entry Shares, receipt of an "agents message" by the
Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent
may reasonably request), the holder of such Certificate or Book Entry Share
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for
each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate
or Book Entry Share, and the Certificate or Book Entry Share so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be
made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate or Book Entry Share is registered, it shall be a condition of
payment that (x) the Certificate or Book Entry Share so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (y)
the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book Entry
Share surrendered and shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction
of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax either has been paid or is not
applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.02_,
each Certificate and Book Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration
as contemplated by this _Article II_.

 

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock_. The
Merger Consideration paid in respect of shares of Company Common Stock upon
the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book Entry Shares in accordance
with the terms of this _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock
previously represented by such Certificates or Book Entry Shares, and at the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with
respect to, and thereafter there shall be no further registration
of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of, the
shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective

 



7

    

 Time. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates that
represented ownership of shares of Company Common Stock and Book Entry Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such shares, except as otherwise provided for herein or
by applicable Law. Subject to the last sentence of _Section_ __ _ 2.02(f)_,
if, at any time after the Effective Time, Certificates and Book Entry Shares
are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be
canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article II_.

 

(d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if reasonably required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such
Person of a customary bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct,
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to
such Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to be paid
in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificate as contemplated by this _Article II_.

 

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. At any time following the first
anniversary of the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled
to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest received with respect thereto) which has not been
disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book Entry Shares, and thereafter
such holders shall be entitled to look only to Parent for, and Parent shall
remain liable for, payment of their claims for the Merger Consideration
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_.

 

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, none of the parties hereto, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any Person for Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable state, federal or other abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such
holders at such time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, the property of Parent or its designee, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

in addition to, the consideration provided pursuant to sub-clauses (i) through
(iii) of this _Section_ __ _ 2.03(a)_) as may be required to provide
that, immediately prior to the Effective Time:

(i) by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, each Company Stock Option, whether vested or unvested, that is

cancelled and automatically converted into solely the right to receive, for
each share of Company Common Stock underlying such Company Stock Option,
without interest and subject to deduction for any required withholding under
applicable Tax Law, an amount in cash from Parent or the Surviving Corporation
equal to the excess of (A) the Offer Price over (B) the per share exercise
price of such Company Stock Option;

 

(ii) by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, each Company RSU Award that is outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall be cancelled and
automatically converted into solely the right to receive, for each share of
Company Common Stock underlying such Company RSU Award, without interest and
subject to deduction for any required withholding under applicable Tax Law, an
amount in cash from Parent or the Surviving Corporation equal to the Offer
Price; and

 



8

    

(iii) by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, each Company PSU Award that is outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time, shall be cancelled and automatically converted into
solely the right to receive for each share of Company Common Stock
underlying such Company PSU Award, without interest and subject to deduction
for any required withholding under applicable Tax Law, an amount in cash from
Parent or the Surviving Corporation equal to the Offer Price, which amount
shall be payable on the same schedule and subject to the same vesting
conditions (including any acceleration of vesting conditions) as applied to
the Company PSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(b) _Company ESPP_. As promptly as reasonably practicable following the
date of this Agreement, the Company shall take such actions (to the extent
not already taken prior to the date of this Agreement) as may be required to
provide that, with respect to the MyoKardia, Inc. Amended and Restated

following the date of this Agreement shall be limited to those employees who

all amounts allocated to each participants account under the Company ESPP as
of such date shall be returned to the participant by the Company pursuant to
the terms of the Company ESPP, and (v) the Company ESPP shall terminate no
later than immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

SECTION 2.04. _Payments with Respect to Equity-Based Awards_. Promptly

through its payroll systems the amounts due pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.03_
(less any withholding required under any applicable Tax Law); _provided_ that
payments with respect to any Company PSU Awards shall be made as promptly as
reasonably practicable following vesting of such Company PSU Award.

 

SECTION 2.05. _Adjustments_. Without duplication of any adjustment
made pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.01(f)_, if between the date hereof and the

the occurrence or record date of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend (including any dividend or other distribution of securities

Consideration as provided in _Section 2.01(c)_, but instead shall
be canceled and shall represent the right to receive only those rights
provided under Section __ 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that if
any such Person shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or
lose the right to appraisal under Section __ 262 of the DGCL, then the right
of such Person to receive those rights under Section __ 262 of the DGCL shall
cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of
the Effective Time into, and shall represent only the right to right to
receive, the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 2.01(c)_, without
interest thereon.

its Subsidiaries to any compensation, severance pay, unemployment

SECTION 3.13. _Intellectual Property_ _. _ (a) __ _ Section_ __ _
3.13(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and complete list
of all IP Registrations that are included in the Company Owned IP and Company
Exclusively Licensed IP (including, for clarity, any IP Registrations that
are exclusively in-licensed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries)
(collectively, the " _Company Registrations_ ") which, in each case,
specifies, as applicable, the owner(s) (including any co-owner(s)),
application and patent or other registration numbers and dates, title and
jurisdiction, and, if the owner is not the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, the corresponding license agreement(s) pursuant to which the
Company and its Subsidiaries have the right to use such IP. Each Company
Registration is subsisting and in full force and effect, and to the Companys
Knowledge, each issued or registered Company Registration is valid and
enforceable.

(b) The Company and/or one of its Subsidiaries solely owns all right,
title and interest in and to all Company Owned IP, free and clear of all Liens
(other than Permitted Liens), and has the right to use, pursuant to

 



19

    

 a valid and enforceable license agreement, all Company Exclusively Licensed
IP and other IP licensed to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any
third party, including as necessary for, or as used or held for use in, the
conduct of the business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as currently
conducted (collectively, the " _Company IP_ ") and, to the Companys
Knowledge, the Company IP constitutes all IP necessary for the exercise of
the Covered Rights. No Company Owned IP, and to the Companys Knowledge, no
Company Exclusively Licensed IP, is subject, in any material respect, to any
outstanding consent or Judgment or is subject to any exclusive or other
material option or similar contingent right or joint ownership interest.

(c) With respect to each Company Registration for the Company Owned IP,
and to the Companys Knowledge, the Company Exclusively Licensed IP, there has
not been (and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received
notice of) any inventorship challenge, opposition, cancellation, _inter_
_partes_ review, derivative proceeding, re-examination (including supplemental
re-examination), nullity, post-grant review, interference, or invalidity or
unenforceability action or other material proceeding before any Governmental
Authority, and to the Companys Knowledge, none have been threatened. With
respect to each Patent included in the Company Registrations included in the
Company Owned IP, and to the Companys Knowledge for the Company Registrations
included in the Company Exclusively Licensed IP, (i) each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries and, to the Companys Knowledge, any Company Licensor or
other Person associated with the filing or prosecution of any such Patent, has
complied in all material respects with all applicable Laws in connection with
the filing and prosecution of such Patent, including the duty of candor to
the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office; (ii) all listed inventors of such
Patent are the sole inventors of such Patents (including as the term
"inventor" is defined and interpreted under U.S. patent law) and have
irrevocably assigned all right, title and interest in and to such inventions
and Patents to the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, or to the third party
that has assigned such inventions and Patents to the Company or one of its
Subsidiaries (or, if any such inventions or Patents are in-licensed to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, then to the Company Licensor), and all
third parties that assigned such inventions and Patents to the Company or one
of its Subsidiaries have irrevocably assigned all right, title and interest
in and to such inventions and Patents to the Company or its applicable
Subsidiary; and (iii) all inventor and other assignments of any such
inventions and Patents (including from any collaborators or other third
parties) to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or, if in-licensed to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, to the Company Licensor) have been
properly executed pursuant to a valid and enforceable assignment agreement
and recorded with the applicable Governmental Authority in accordance with
applicable Laws, and no such assignments (including the inventions or Patents
covered therein) are subject to any options or similar contingent rights or
joint ownership interests or any other encumbrances, except where the failure
to record any such assignment would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole.

(d) To the Companys Knowledge, since January 1, 2018, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries (including through any Company
Employee/Contractor), nor the conduct of their respective businesses
(including the exercise of any Covered Rights), is or was (or will be, to the
Companys Knowledge, through the exercise of the Covered Rights as currently
contemplated) infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the IP of
any other Person in any material respect. Since January 1, 2018, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has (and, to the Companys Knowledge, no
Company Licensor has) received any complaint, notice or other communication,
or is or was a party to any Action, involving, in any material respect, any
(i) allegation that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including through
any Company Employee/Contractor) or the conduct of their respective businesses
is or was, or through the exercise of any Covered Rights will be, infringing,
misappropriating or otherwise violating any IP of any other Person (including
any demand from any Person to take a license or refrain from using any IP) or
(ii) challenge to the ownership, use, validity, enforceability, patentability
or registerability of any Company Owned IP and, to the Companys Knowledge,
the Company Exclusively Licensed IP, and with respect to each of the foregoing
clauses (i) and (ii), no such Action has been threatened in writing (or, to
the Companys Knowledge, otherwise). The representations and warranties set
forth in this Agreement shall be read without any application of 35 U.S.C.
§271(e)(1) (the statutory research exemption) or any other similar Laws, in
each case, to the same extent as if such Laws have no force or effect or do
not exist.

(e) Since January 1, 2018, and except as set forth in  _Section_ __ _
3.13(e)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has filed any Actions against any Person alleging, in any
material respect, any misappropriation, infringement or other violation by
any Person of any Company IP, and, to the Companys Knowledge, no Person has
infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated any Company IP in any
material respect. The Company or one of its Subsidiaries has the sole and
exclusive right to bring an Action against any other Person for past, present
or future infringement, misappropriation or other violation of any Company
Owned IP.

 

(f) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has taken reasonable measures
to protect, maintain and enforce the Company Owned IP and, to the Companys
Knowledge, the Company Exclusively Licensed IP (including the confidentiality
of any trade secrets included therein), including by requiring each Company
Employee/Contractor (and to the Companys Knowledge, each Company Licensor
has required each Licensor Employee/Contractor) involved in any material
respect in the conception, reduction to practice, or other creation for or on
behalf of the Company of any IP to enter into valid and enforceable
written agreements (each, an " _Employee/Contractor IP Agreement_ ") with the
Company or its applicable Subsidiary (or, as applicable, such Company
Licensor), pursuant to which such Person is bound to maintain and protect the
confidential information of the Company and its Subsidiaries (or, as
applicable, such Company Licensor) and assign to the Company or its applicable
Subsidiary (or, as applicable, such Company Licensor) sole ownership of all
such IP conceived, reduced to practice or otherwise created by such Person in
the course of such Persons employment or other engagement with the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (or, as applicable, such Company Licensor), all in
accordance with all applicable Laws.

 

(g) No academic institution, research center, international organization or
Governmental Authority or any Person working for or on behalf of any of the
foregoing entities (collectively, " _Academic/Governmental Persons_ ") has, or
would reasonably be expected to have, any ownership or any other material
right, title or interest (including any "march in" or co-ownership rights) in
or to any Company Owned IP, including any claim or option or other contingent
right to any of the foregoing. No funding, IP, facilities, personnel or
other resources of an Academic/Governmental Person has been used in
connection with any research or development activities (other than clinical
trial activities) conducted by or on behalf of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, including with respect to any Product(s), or the conception,
reduction to practice other creation of any Company IP.

(h) The consummation of the Transactions will not materially impair any
right, title or interest of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in or to
any Company IP or Company Systems.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
if at any time on or after the date hereof and prior to the Offer Acceptance
Time, the Company or any of its Representatives receives a bona fide Takeover
Proposal, which Takeover Proposal was made after the date hereof and did not

request that such Takeover Proposal made orally be made in writing and (ii)
if the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof determines

expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, and that failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then the
Company and any of its Representatives may (x) enter into an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement with the Person or group of Persons making the
Takeover Proposal and furnish pursuant to such Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement information (including non-public information) with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person or group of Persons who has made

that the Company shall substantially concurrently provide to Parent any non-
public information concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is
provided to any Person given such access which was not previously provided to
Parent or its Representatives and (y) following the execution of an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, engage in or otherwise participate in
discussions or negotiations regarding such Takeover Proposal with the Person
or group of Persons making such Takeover Proposal and its or their
Representatives. Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the Company shall not be
required to enforce, and shall be permitted to waive, any provision of any
standstill or confidentiality agreement that prohibits or purports to
prohibit the submission or making of a private Takeover Proposal to the Board
of Directors of the Company.

 

(c) From and after the date hereof and prior to the Offer Acceptance Time,
the Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify Parent

such written proposal or offer and copies of any written materials related
thereto exchanged between the Company and such Person), and the Company shall
keep Parent informed on a reasonably prompt basis of the status of, and any
material developments with respect to (and in any event within 24 hours of
any such development), any such Takeover Proposal (including any changes to
the material terms thereof). For the avoidance of doubt, all information
provided to Parent pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 5.02(c)_ will be subject

(d) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof
shall (i)(A) withhold, withdraw or qualify (or modify in a manner adverse to
Parent), or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw or qualify (or modify in a
manner adverse to Parent), the Company Board Recommendation (or fail to
include the Company Board recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9) (any action
described in this clause (i)(A), an

 



35

    

 " _Intervening Event Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), (B) after public
announcement of a Takeover Proposal (other than a tender or exchange offer),
fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation upon a written
request therefor by Parent by the earlier of ten (10) Business Days following
a written request by Parent and two (2) Business Days prior to the then-
scheduled Expiration Time; _provided_  that Parent may make only one such
request with respect to any Takeover Proposal, (C) recommend the approval or
adoption of, or approve or adopt, or publicly propose to recommend, approve or
adopt, any Takeover Proposal or (D) with respect to a tender or exchange
offer constituting a Takeover Proposal, fail to publicly recommend against
such tender or exchange offer or fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Board
Recommendation within ten (10) Business Days of such tender or exchange offer
having been commenced within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act
(any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as an " _Adverse
Recommendation Change_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that it is understood and
agreed that the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof (x)
may make or cause the Company to make a customary "stop, look and
listen" communication and (y) in the case of a tender or exchange offer
constituting a Takeover Proposal, may elect to take no position with respect
to such Takeover Proposal until the close of business on the tenth (10th)
Business Day after the commencement of such Takeover Proposal pursuant to Rule
14e-2 under the Exchange Act, in each case without such action
being considered an Adverse Recommendation Change, or (ii) execute or enter
into (or cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or
enter into) any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, license agreement, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or
other similar agreement relating to a Takeover Proposal, other than any
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (each, a " _Company Acquisition
Agreement_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing limitations but subject to the
Companys compliance with _Section_ __ _ 5.02(e)_ or _Section_ __ _
5.02(f)_, as applicable, prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, but not after,
the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof may (I) make
an Adverse Recommendation Change or (II) cause the Company to enter into a
Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Takeover Proposal that did not
result from a material breach of this _Section_ __ _ 5.02_ and terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.01(d)(ii)_, if the Board of
Directors of the Company or any committee thereof has determined in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, that (x) in the case of an Intervening Event Adverse Recommendation
Change, such Adverse Recommendation Change is not made in response to a
Takeover Proposal and is made in response to an Intervening Event, and
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (y) in the case of (A) clause (I)
where such Adverse Recommendation Change is made in response to a Takeover
Proposal or (B) clause (II), such Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal.

(e) Prior to taking any of the actions expressly permitted by _Section_ __
_ 5.02(d)_, in the event such action is proposed to be taken in connection
with a Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors of the Company or any
committee thereof shall not, and shall cause the Company not to, take any
action set forth in clause _ Section 5.02(d)(I)_ or _(II)_ , unless (1) the
Company has first given Parent at least three (3) Business Days prior written
notice of its intention to take such action (which notice shall specify the
identity of the party making such Superior Proposal and the material terms and
conditions thereof and shall include copies of all material documents related
thereto), (2) the Company has negotiated, and has caused its Representatives
to negotiate, in good faith with Parent during such three (3) Business Day
notice period following Parents receipt of the notice described in clause
(1), to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable Parent to propose in
writing an offer to effect revisions to the terms of this Agreement such that
it would cause such Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior
Proposal, and (3) following the end of such three (3) Business Day notice
period, the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof shall
have considered in good faith such written offer, and shall have determined in
good faith after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel that (x) the Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior
Proposal if the revisions proposed in any such revised written offer by Parent
were to be given effect and (y) the failure to take such action would
continue to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law (it being understood that the Company shall be required to
comply again with its obligations under the foregoing clauses (1), (2)
and (3) in the event of any change to the financial or other material terms
of such Superior Proposal, except that references to three (3) Business Days
above shall be deemed to be references to two (2) Business Days).

 



36

    

(f) Prior to taking any of the actions expressly permitted by  _Section_
__ _ 5.02(d)_, in the event an Intervening Event Adverse Recommendation
Change is proposed to be taken in connection with an Intervening Event, the
Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof shall not,
and shall cause the Company not to, make an Intervening Event Adverse
Recommendation Change, unless (1) the Company has first given Parent at least
three (3) Business Days prior written notice of its intention to effect an
Intervening Event Adverse Recommendation Change in connection with such
Intervening Event, which notice shall specify the nature of the Intervening
Event in reasonable detail, (2) the Company has negotiated, and has caused its
Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent during such three (3)
Business Day notice period following Parents receipt of the notice described
in clause (1), to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable Parent to
propose in writing an offer to effect revisions to the terms of this
Agreement that would eliminate the need of the Board of Directors of the
Company to effect an Intervening Event Adverse Recommendation Change in
connection with such Intervening Event and (3) following the end of such
three (3) Business Day notice period, the Board of Directors of the Company or
any committee thereof shall have considered in good faith any such revised
written offer by Parent and shall have determined in good faith
after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel that
the failure to effect such Intervening Event Adverse Recommendation Change
would continue to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law.

 

(g) Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 5.02_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company or the Board of Directors of the Company or any
committee thereof from (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the
Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a)
of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any
disclosure to its stockholders if the Board of Directors of the Company
determines, in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law; _provided_ , that any such action that would
otherwise constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change shall be made only in
compliance with the other provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.02_.

 

(h) As used in this Agreement, " _Takeover Proposal_ " shall mean a
proposal or offer from any Person or "group" (within the meaning of Section
13(d) of the Exchange Act) (other than Parent and its Subsidiaries) relating
to, in a single transaction or series of related transactions, any direct or
indirect (i) acquisition or exclusive license of 20% or more of the
consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries (based on the fair
market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of
the Company or any committee thereof), including through the acquisition of
equity interests in or other capital stock of one or more Subsidiaries of the
Company owning such assets, (ii) acquisition of beneficial ownership of 20% or
more of the outstanding Company Common Stock, (iii) tender offer or exchange
offer that if consummated would result in any Person or group beneficially
owning 20% or more of the outstanding Company Common Stock, or (iv) merger,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company pursuant
to which such Person or group (or the stockholders of any Person) would
acquire, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of the consolidated assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries (based on the fair market value thereof, as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company or any
committee thereof), beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the outstanding
Company Common Stock, or 20% or more of the aggregate voting power of the
Company or of the surviving entity in a merger, consolidation, share exchange
or other business combination involving the Company or the resulting direct or
indirect parent of the Company or such surviving entity; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that this Agreement and the Transactions shall not be deemed a
Takeover Proposal.

 

(i) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any bona
fide written Takeover Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company or
any committee thereof has determined in its good faith judgment (i) would be
more favorable to the Companys stockholders from a financial point of view
than the Transactions, taking into account all legal, regulatory, financial,
financing and other aspects of such proposal and of this Agreement, and (ii)
is reasonably likely to be completed; _provided_ that for purposes of the
definition of "Superior Proposal", the references to "20%" in the definition
of Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "100%".

 



37

    

(j) As used in this Agreement, " _Intervening Event_ " shall mean an
event, development or change in circumstances arising or occurring after the
date of this Agreement that materially affects the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and which was not known or reasonably
foreseeable by the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if known, the
material consequences of which were not reasonably foreseeable by the Board of
Directors of the Company) as of or prior to the date of this Agreement;
_provided_ that in no event shall (1) the receipt, existence or terms of a
Takeover Proposal or (2) clearance of the Merger under the HSR Act constitute
an Intervening Event.

 

(k) The Company agrees that in the event any Subsidiary or Representative
of the Company takes any action at the direction or on behalf of the Company
which, if taken by the Company, would constitute a breach of this _Section_ __
_ 5.02_, the Company shall be deemed to be in breach of this _Section_ __ _
5.02_.

 

SECTION 5.03. _Efforts_. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall cooperate with the other
parties hereto and use (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries and
Affiliates to use) their respective reasonable best efforts (unless, with
respect to any action, another standard of performance is expressly provided
for herein) to promptly (i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do,
or cause to be done, and assist and cooperate with the other parties hereto in
doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to cause the conditions to
Closing to be satisfied as promptly as reasonably practicable and to
consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner reasonably
practicable, the Transactions, including preparing and filing promptly and
fully all documentation to effect all necessary filings, notices, petitions,
statements, registrations, submissions of information, applications and other
documents, (ii) obtain all approvals, consents, registrations, waivers,
permits, authorizations, orders and other confirmations from any Governmental
Authority or third party necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
Transactions and (iii) execute and deliver any additional instruments

clauses (i) through (iii), with respect to filings, notices, petitions,
statements, registrations, submissions of information, applications and other
documents, approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations and
other confirmations relating to Antitrust Laws, which are addressed in Section
5.03(c) below. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, prior to the
Effective Time, no party hereto shall be required to, and the Company shall
not without the consent of Parent, pay any consent or other similar fee,
"profit-sharing" or other similar payment or other consideration in any form
(including increased rent or other similar payments or commercial
accommodation or agree to enter into any amendments, supplements or other
modifications to (or waivers of) the existing terms of any Contract), or
provide additional security (including a guaranty) or otherwise assume or
incur or agree to assume or incur any liability, to obtain any consent of any
Person (other than any Governmental Authority) under any Contract.

 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Company and
Parent shall each (i) take all action necessary to ensure that no Takeover
Law is or becomes applicable to any of the Transactions and refrain from
taking any actions that would cause the applicability of such Laws and (ii) if
the restrictions of any Takeover Law become applicable to any of the
Transactions, take all action reasonably necessary to ensure that the
Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise lawfully minimize the effect of
such Takeover Law on the Transactions.

(c) Each of the parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to
make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the
HSR Act with respect to the Transactions, as soon as practicable and advisable
after the date of this Agreement, but in no event later than ten (10) Business
Days after the date hereof, and to utilize reasonable best efforts to supply
as promptly as practicable any additional information and documentary material
that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act. Parent shall pay all filing
fees applicable for filings made pursuant to this Section. Further, each
party hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to eliminate each and every
impediment and obtain all consents under the HSR Act or any other such
Antitrust Laws that may be required by any foreign or U.S. federal, state or
local Governmental Authority pursuant thereto, in each case with competent
jurisdiction, so as to enable the parties hereto to consummate the
Transactions prior to the Outside Date. Without limiting the foregoing,
Parents and Merger Subs reasonable

 



38

    

 best efforts shall include (i) committing to or effecting, by consent
decree, hold separate order, trust, or otherwise, the divestiture, sale,
license, transfer, assignment or other disposition of assets or businesses of
the Company or its Subsidiaries, (ii) terminating, relinquishing, modifying,
transferring, assigning, restructuring, or waiving existing agreements,
collaborations, relationships, ventures, contractual rights, obligations or
other arrangements of the Company or its Subsidiaries, and (iii) creating or
consenting to create any relationships, ventures, contractual rights,
obligations, behavioral undertakings or other arrangements of the Company or
its Subsidiaries (and, in each case, to enter, or offer to enter, into
agreements and stipulate to the entry of an order or decree or file
appropriate applications with any Governmental Authority in connection with
any of the foregoing and in the case of actions by or with respect to any of
the Company or its businesses or assets, by consenting to such action by the
Company) (each a " _Divestiture Action_ "); _provided_ , that Parent and
Merger Sub shall not be required to take a Divestiture Action or any other
action pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.03(c)_ (x) if such Divestiture
Action or other action would reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a material adverse impact on, or as measured in comparison
to, the expected benefits of the Transactions to Parent and Merger Sub and (y)
unless such Divestiture Action or other action is necessary to consummate the
Transactions prior to the Outside Date. In no event shall Parent, the Company
or their respective Affiliates be required to proffer, consent to or agree to
or effect any undertaking or other action relating to any objections asserted
by any Governmental Authority with respect to the Transactions under any
Antitrust Laws unless such action is conditioned upon the consummation of the
Merger. Neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries shall, without the express
written consent of Parent, take or agree to take any action relating to any
objections asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the
Transactions under any Antitrust Laws with respect to its business or
operations, but, if requested by Parent in writing, the Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, subject to this _Section_ __ _ 5.03(c)_,
take any such actions to obtain any of the governmental approvals contemplated
in this _Section_ __ _ 5.03(c)_.

 

(d) Each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission with a Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions
and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry by or before a
Governmental Authority relating to the Transactions, including any proceeding
initiated by a private person, and (ii) subject to applicable Laws relating to
the exchange of information, consult with the other parties hereto with
respect to information relating to the other parties hereto and their
respective Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that appears in any filing made
with, or written materials submitted to, any third Person or any Governmental
Authority in connection with the Transactions, other than "4(c) documents"
and "4(d) documents" as these terms are used in the rules and regulations
under the HSR Act. To the extent reasonably practicable, all telephone calls
and meetings with a Governmental Authority regarding the Transactions shall
include representatives of Parent and the Company, and each party hereto must
inform the other of any communications with a Governmental Authority relating
to any Antitrust Laws. Except as otherwise restricted by this  _Section_ __ _
5.03(d)_, Parent and the Company or their outside counsel shall have the right
to review in advance all written materials submitted or communications made to
any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions, in each case,
to the extent such materials or communications are related to any Antitrust
Laws; _provided_ that materials required to be provided pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 5.03(d)_ may be redacted (A) to remove references concerning
the valuation of the Company, (B) as necessary to comply with contractual
arrangements, (C) as necessary to comply with applicable Law, and (D) as
necessary to address reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns;
_provided_ _further_ , that a party may reasonably designate any competitively
sensitive material provided to another party under this _Section_ __ _
5.03(d)_ as "Outside Counsel Only". Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent
shall, following consultation with the Company and after giving due
consideration to its views and acting reasonably and in good faith, direct and
control all aspects of each party heretos efforts to gain regulatory
clearance either before any Governmental Authority or in any action brought to
enjoin the Transactions pursuant to any Antitrust Laws.

 

(e) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall, nor shall they permit their
Subsidiaries or controlled Affiliates to, acquire or agree to acquire any
rights, interests, assets, business, Person or division thereof (through
acquisition, license, joint venture, collaboration or otherwise), if such
acquisition would reasonably be expected to materially increase the risk
of not obtaining any applicable clearance, consent, approval or waiver under
the

 



39

    

 HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws with respect to the Offer or the Merger or
the other Transactions or otherwise not complying with the requirements of
this Section.

 

SECTION 5.04. _Public Announcements_. Parent and the Company shall
consult with each other before issuing, and give each other a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other public
statements with respect to the Transactions, and shall not issue any such
press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation,
except as may be required by applicable Law, Judgment, court process or the
rules and regulations of any national securities exchange or national
securities quotation system if it has used its commercially reasonable
efforts to consult with the other party hereto but has been unable to do so
prior to the time such press release or public statement is so required to be
issued. The parties hereto agree that the initial press release to be issued
with respect to the Transactions following execution of this Agreement shall
be in the form heretofore agreed to by the parties hereto (the "
_Announcement_ "). Notwithstanding the forgoing, this _Section 5.04_
shall not apply to any press release or other public statement (a) made by
the Company or Parent which is consistent with the Announcement and the terms
of this Agreement and does not contain any information relating to the Company
that has not been previously announced or made public in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement or (b) made or proposed to be made by the Company or
Parent with respect to the matters described in, and in compliance with the
provisions of,  _Section 5.02_.

SECTION 5.05. _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Between the date
of this Agreement and the earlier of the Effective Time and the valid
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.01_, upon
reasonable notice and subject to applicable logistical restrictions or
limitations as a result of COVID-19 or any COVID-19 Measures, the Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and
Parents Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to
the Companys and its Subsidiaries officers, designated employees,
properties, books, Contracts and records and the Company shall furnish
promptly to Parent and Parents Representatives such information concerning
its business, personnel, assets, liabilities and properties as Parent may
reasonably request; _provided_ that Parent and its Representatives shall
conduct any such activities in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably
with the business or operations of the Company; _provided_ _further_ , that
the Company shall not be obligated to provide such access or information if
the Company determines, in its reasonable judgment (after consultation with
its outside counsel), that doing so would (i) result in the disclosure of
trade secrets or competitively sensitive information to third parties, (ii) __
violate applicable Law, an applicable Judgment or a Contract or obligation of
confidentiality owing to a third party, (iii) __ jeopardize the protection of
an attorney-client privilege, attorney work product protection or other legal
privilege; or (iv) __ jeopardize the health and safety of any employee of
the Company or its Subsidiaries in light of COVID-19 (taking into account any
COVID-19 Measures); _provided_ _further_ that to the extent reasonably
practicable, (x) __ the parties hereto will make appropriate substitute
arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding
proviso apply and (y) __ the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to communicate the applicable information to Parent in a way that would not
violate any applicable Law or waive such a privilege. Parent shall direct all
initial requests for access pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 5.05_ to the
Chief Business Officer or the General Counsel of the Company or another person
designated in writing by the Company. Until the Effective Time, all
information provided amongst the parties hereto will be subject to the terms
of the letter agreement dated as of September __ 17, 2020, by and among the
Company and Parent (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

 

SECTION 5.06. _Indemnification and Insurance_. (a) __ From and after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to) in each case to the fullest extent permissible by
applicable Law, (i) __ indemnify and hold harmless each individual who at
the Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the Effective Time was, a
director or officer of the Company or of a Subsidiary of the Company (each, an
" _Indemnitee_ " and, collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ ") with respect
to all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties,
costs (including amounts paid in settlement or compromise) and expenses
(including fees and expenses of legal counsel) in connection with any Action
based on or arising out of (A) __ the fact that an Indemnitee is or was a
director or officer of the Company or such Subsidiary or (B) __ acts or
omissions by an Indemnitee in the Indemnitees capacity as a director or
officer of the Company or such Subsidiary or taken at the request of the
Company or such Subsidiary (including in connection with serving at the

 



40

    

 request of the Company or such Subsidiary as a representative of another
Person (including any employee benefit plan)), in each case of clauses __ (A)
and (B), at, or at any time prior to, the Effective Time (including any
Action relating in whole or in part to the Transactions) and (ii) __ assume
(in the case of the Surviving Corporation, in the Merger without any further
action) all obligations of the Company and such Subsidiaries to the
Indemnitees in respect of indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time as provided in the Company Charter Documents and
the organizational documents of such Subsidiaries as in effect on the date of
this Agreement or in the agreements in effect as of the date of this Agreement
providing for indemnification between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
and any Indemnitee. Without limiting the foregoing, from and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause, unless otherwise required by Law, the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to
contain provisions no less favorable to the Indemnitees with respect to
limitation of liabilities of directors and officers and indemnification than
are in the Company Charter Documents as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of the Indemnitees. In addition, from the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to) advance any expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) of
any Indemnitee under this _Section_ __ _ 5.06_ as incurred to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law; _provided_ that the Indemnitee to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such expenses if it is
ultimately determined that such Indemnitee was not entitled to indemnification
under this _Section_ __ _ 5.06_.

 

(b) Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnitees shall
cooperate to the extent reasonably practicable in the defense of any claim
and shall provide access to properties and individuals as reasonably requested
and furnish or cause to be furnished records, information and testimony, and
attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals,
as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

(c) For the six-year period commencing immediately after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect the Companys current
directors and officers liability insurance covering acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time with respect to those individuals
who are covered by the Companys directors and officers liability insurance
policies on terms and scope with respect to such coverage, and in amount, no
less favorable to such individuals than those of such policy in effect on the
date of this Agreement (or Parent may substitute therefor policies, issued by
reputable insurers, of at least the same coverage with respect to
matters existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time, including a "tail"
policy); _provided_ that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be
required to expend in any one year an amount in excess of the Premium Cap. The
Company shall have the right prior to the Effective Time to purchase a six-
year prepaid "tail policy" on terms and conditions providing at least
substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries
with respect to matters existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time,
covering without limitation the Transactions, so long as the effective annual
premium under such policy does not exceed the Premium Cap. If such prepaid
"tail policy" has been obtained by the Company, it shall be deemed to satisfy
all obligations to obtain insurance pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _
5.06(c)_ and the Surviving Corporation shall cause such policy to be
maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and to honor all of
its obligations thereunder.

 

(d) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.06_ are (i) intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her
heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such individual may have under the Company Charter Documents, by contract or
otherwise. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this
_Section_ __ _ 5.06_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as
to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee to whom this _Section_ __ _
5.06_ applies unless (x) such termination or modification is required by
applicable Law or (y) the affected Indemnitee shall have consented in writing
to such termination or modification. The Indemnitees to whom this _Section_
__ _ 5.06_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section_ __ _
5.06_. The Surviving Corporation agrees to (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to) pay or

 



41

    

 advance, upon written request of the Indemnitee, all costs, fees and
expenses, including attorneys fees, that may be incurred by the Indemnitee in
enforcing the indemnity and other rights provided in this _Section_ __ _
5.06_; _provided_ that the Indemnitee to whom expenses are advanced provides
an undertaking to repay such expenses if it is ultimately determined that such
Indemnitee was not entitled to indemnification under this _Section_ __ _
5.06_.

(e) In the event that (i) Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective successors or assigns (A) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity
of such consolidation or merger or (B) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, or (ii) Parent
or any of its successors or assigns dissolves the Surviving Corporation, then,
and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors
and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the
obligations thereof set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.06_.

 

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or
shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers
insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective
directors or officers, it being understood and agreed that
the indemnification provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 5.06_ is not prior
to or in substitution for any such claims under such policies.

 

SECTION 5.07. _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall be permitted to take such steps as may be reasonably necessary to cause
dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities)
pursuant to the Transactions by each individual who is a director or officer
of the Company subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act to be exempt under
Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

SECTION 5.08. _Employee Matters_. __(a) For a period beginning at
the Effective Time and ending on the earliest of (such earliest period, the "
_Continuation Period_ ") (i) the first anniversary of the Effective Time, (ii)
__ January __ 1, 2022 and (iii) __ the termination of employment of the
relevant employee (provided, that, for the avoidance of doubt, such
termination would not affect any severance protections otherwise required
pursuant to this Section __ 5.08), Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, provide to the employees of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries immediately prior to, and who remain so employed immediately
following, the Effective Time (each, a " _Continuing Employee_ ") (A) __
annual base salary or base wages (as applicable) at least equal to the level
that was provided to each such Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time, (B) target annual cash bonus opportunity or target cash
commissions opportunity at least equal to the level of target annual cash
bonus opportunity or target cash commissions opportunity that was provided to
each such Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
(C) __ severance and outplacement benefits to each Continuing Employee that
are no less favorable than, and pursuant to the terms of, the Companys
severance and/or change in control plans or outplacement arrangements set
forth on Section __ 5.08(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter (in each case,
as in effect on, and in the form provided to Parent prior to, the date hereof,
subject to any modifications permitted under _Section 5.01(b)(vi)_ and the
corresponding section of the Company Disclosure Letter), and (D) __ employee
benefit plans and arrangements (other than base salaries or base wages, bonus
opportunities, severance benefits, defined benefit pension, nonqualified
deferred compensation, retiree or post-termination health or welfare benefit,
equity or equity based compensation, retention or change in control-related
compensation or benefits, long-term incentive or nonqualified deferred
compensation or employee stock purchase plans (collectively, the " _Specified
Arrangements_ ")) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the
employee benefit plans and arrangements (other than the Specified
Arrangements) provided to Continuing Employees immediately prior to the
Effective Time under the Company Plans. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
commencing on January __ 1, 2021 through the remainder of the Continuation
Period, Parent may satisfy its obligations under this _Section 5.08_ by
either providing the Continuing Employees with employee benefit plans and
arrangements (other than the Specified Arrangements) that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than those provided to similarly situated employees
of Parent or the same as provided to Continuing Employees immediately prior
to the Effective Time under the Company Plans, with such determination of the
employee benefits hereunder to be made by Parent in good faith.

 



42

    

(b) If requested by Parent at least five (5) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall take or shall cause to be taken all actions
necessary, including the adoption of written resolutions of the appropriate
governing body in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent (copies of which
shall be provided to Parent prior to the Closing), to terminate each Company
Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code (the "
_Company_ __ _ 401(k)_ __ _ Plan_"), and to fully vest all participants
under such Company 401(k) Plan, such termination and vesting to be effective
no later than the Business Day preceding the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company 401(k) Plan termination and full vesting
of participants thereunder may be made contingent upon the consummation of
the Transactions.

(c) With respect to any 401(k) plan of Parent and its Subsidiaries and any
vacation, paid time-off and severance plans in which Continuing Employees are
eligible to participate after the Effective Time, for purposes of eligibility
to participate, level of benefits and vesting, each Continuing Employees
service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as well as service with
any predecessor employer of the Company or any such Subsidiary, to the extent
service with the predecessor employer was recognized by the Company or such
Subsidiary) shall be treated as service with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
to the same extent such service was recognized for the same purpose under a
similar Company Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated
immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
service need not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would
result in any duplication of benefits or compensation for the same period of
service. No Continuing Employee shall be credited with his or her years of
service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
predecessors before the Effective Time for purposes of benefit accruals under
any defined benefit pension plans or any retiree medical or life insurance or
other welfare-type benefits, or for any purposes under any equity or equity-
based plans, that are maintained by Parent and its Subsidiaries.

 

(d) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to, waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-
existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and
waiting periods under any group health benefit plan maintained by Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries in which Continuing Employees (and their eligible
dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time
and in the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs, except to the extent
that such pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work
requirements and waiting periods would not have been satisfied or waived
under the comparable Company Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to recognize the dollar amount of all co-payments,
deductibles and similar expenses paid by each Continuing Employee (and his or
her covered, eligible dependents) during the plan year in which the Effective
Time occurs for purposes of satisfying such years deductible and co-payment
limitations under the relevant group health benefit plans in which they will
be eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time and in the plan
year in which the Effective Time occurs.

(e) Parent hereby acknowledges that the consummation of the
Offer constitutes a "change of control", a "change in control" or a "sale
event" (or a term of similar import) for purposes of any Company Plan set
forth on Section 5.08(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter that contains a
definition of "change of control", a "change in control" or a "sale event" (or
a term of similar import), as applicable. Annual cash incentive bonuses for
calendar year 2020 and the Companys sabbatical program shall be treated as
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.08(e)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter. For
Continuing Employees for whom the Company has been sponsoring their work visas
and paying the related expenses, in each case as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
during the Continuation Period, continue to sponsor such Continuing Employees
work visas on the same terms as apply to similarly-situated employees of
Parent for whom Parent sponsors work visas and in all respects subject to
applicable Law.

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.08_, whether express or
implied, shall be treated as an establishment, termination, amendment or other
modification of any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement,
contract, policy or arrangement, or shall limit the right of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates to establish, amend,
terminate or otherwise modify any benefit or compensation plan, program,
agreement, contract, policy or arrangement following the Effective Time.
Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 5.08_, whether

 



43

    

 express or implied, shall create any rights or remedies whatsoever,
including any third-party beneficiary or other rights, in any Person not a
party to this Agreement, or shall be construed to create any right to
employment or service with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Affiliates or continued employment or to any particular term or condition of
employment or to limit the ability of Parent or the Surviving Corporation
or any of their Affiliates to terminate the employment or service of any
service provider (including any Continuing Employee) at any time and for any
or no reason. Further, nothing in this Section 5.08 shall apply to Continuing
Employees while they are terminated or temporarily laid off as a result of
COVID-19 related circumstances.

 SECTION 5.09. _Notification of Certain Matters; Stockholder Litigation_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall give prompt notice to the
Company, and the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, of (i) any

circumstance that (A) has had or would reasonably be expected to result in
any Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect, as applicable,
or (B) is reasonably likely to result in any of the Offer Conditions not being
able to be satisfied prior to the Outside Date, and (iii) any Clinical Event
( _provided_ that notwithstanding the foregoing, the delivery of any notice

hereto, the remedies available hereunder to the party hereto receiving such
notice or the conditions to such partys obligation to consummate the Offer,
the Merger or any of the other Transactions).

 

(b) The Company (x) shall (1) give Parent the opportunity to participate
in, but not control, the defense and settlement of any Transaction Litigation
against the Company or its directors relating to this Agreement or the
Transactions (to the extent that the attorney-client privilege is not
undermined or otherwise adversely affected) and (2) keep Parent reasonably
informed with respect to the status thereof, and (y) shall not offer or
propose to settle, settle or agree to settle any such Transaction Litigation
without Parents prior written consent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Without otherwise limiting
the Indemnitees rights with regard to the right to counsel, following the
Effective Time, the Indemnitees shall be entitled to continue to retain
Goodwin Procter LLP or such other counsel selected by such Indemnitees and
reasonably acceptable to Parent to defend any Transaction Litigation.

 SECTION 5.10. _Stock Exchange De-listing_. Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to, and prior to the Closing, the Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Parent to, cause the Company
Common Stock to be de-listed from the NASDAQ and de-registered under the
Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time.

SECTION 5.11. _Rule 14d-10 Matters_. Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time,
the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "
_Compensation Committee_ ") will cause each employment

which consideration is payable to any officer, director or employee who is a
holder of any security of the Company to be approved by the Compensation
Committee (comprised solely of "independent directors") in accordance with
the requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act and the
instructions thereto as an "employment compensation, severance or other
employee benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under
the Exchange Act and satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor
set forth in Rule 14d-10(d) of the Exchange Act.

the Offer Acceptance Time, Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
(other than Merger Sub) to, transfer all shares of Company Common Stock
beneficially owned by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to Merger Sub.

 

SECTION 5.13. _Director Resignations_. Prior to the Closing, the Company
shall use reasonable best efforts to deliver to Parent written resignations
executed by each director of the Company (and, to the extent requested,

 



44

    

 each director of each Subsidiary of the Company) in office immediately prior
to the Effective Time, which resignations shall be effective at the Effective
Time.

primarily resulted in the events specified in this _Section_ __ _ 7.01(b)(i)_
(it being understood that Parent and Merger Sub shall be deemed a single party

of _Section_ __ _ 5.05_, _Sections 7.02_ and _7.03_ , _Article VIII_ and the
Confidentiality Agreement, all of which shall survive termination of this
Agreement), and there shall be no liability on the part of Parent, Merger Sub
or the Company or their respective directors, officers and Affiliates, except
that no such termination shall relieve any party from liability for damages
to another party resulting from a Willful and Material Breach of this
Agreement or from fraud. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that any failure of Parent or
Merger Sub to satisfy its obligation to accept for payment or pay for Company
Common Stock following satisfaction of the Offer Conditions, and any failure
of

 



46

    

 Parent to cause the Merger to be effected following satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in _Article VI_ , will be deemed to constitute a Willful
and Material Breach of a covenant of this Agreement.

SECTION 7.03. _Termination Fee_. (a) __ In the event that:

(i) this Agreement is terminated (A) by the Company or Parent pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 7.01(b)(_ _i_ _)_ ( _provided_ that (x) at the time of any
such termination, the conditions to the Offer set forth in clauses (b), (c)
and (d) of Annex I are satisfied and the Minimum Condition is not satisfied,
and (y) with respect to any such termination by the Company, the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _ Section_ __ _ 7.01(b)(_ _i_ _)_ is
then available to Parent) or by Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.01(c)(_
_i_ _)_ resulting from a Willful and Material Breach of this Agreement by the
Company, (B) a bona fide Takeover Proposal shall have been publicly made or
otherwise communicated or delivered to the Companys Board of Directors and
shall have become publicly known after the date of this Agreement and prior to
such termination, and such Takeover Proposal shall not have been irrevocably
withdrawn in good faith prior to such termination, and (C) within twelve
months of the date this Agreement is so terminated, the Company (1) enters
into a Company Acquisition Agreement with any Person or Persons with respect
to any Takeover Proposal and such Takeover Proposal is subsequently
consummated or (2) consummates any Takeover Proposal; _provided_ that, for
purposes of clauses (B) and (C) of this _Section_ __ _ 7.03(a)(_ _i_ _)_ ,
the references to "20%" in the definition of Takeover Proposal shall be
deemed to be references to "50%"; or

 

(ii) this Agreement is terminated (A) by Parent pursuant to  _Section_ __
_ 7.01(c)(ii)_ or (B) by the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _
7.01(d)(ii)_;

then, in any such event under clause (i) or (ii) of this _Section_ __ _
7.03(a)_, the Company shall pay the Company Termination Fee to Parent or its
designee by wire transfer of same day funds (x) in the case of  _Section_ __
_ 7.03(a)(ii)(A)_, within two (2) Business Days after such termination, (y)
in the case of _Section_ __ _ 7.03(a)(ii)(B)_, substantially concurrently
with such termination or (z) in the case of _Section_ __ _ 7.03(a)(_ _i_ _)_
, within two (2) Business Days after the consummation of, the Takeover
Proposal referred to therein; it being understood that in no event shall the
Company be required to pay the applicable Company Termination Fee on more
than one occasion. In the event that Parent shall become entitled to and
receive payment of the Company Termination Fee, the receipt of the Company
Termination Fee shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all
losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates or any other Person in connection with this Agreement
(and the termination hereof), the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for
such termination, and the Company shall have no further liability, whether
pursuant to a claim in law or in equity, to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates or any other Person, and none of Parent, Merger Sub or
any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person shall be entitled to
bring or maintain any Action against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates for damages or any equitable relief arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement, any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or any matters forming the basis for such termination; _provided_
that nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 7.03_ shall relieve the Company from
liability for damages arising from a Willful and Material Breach of this
Agreement or from fraud.

As used herein, " _Company Termination Fee_ " shall mean a cash amount equal
to $458,000,000.

(b) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
_Section_ __ _ 7.03_ are an integral part of the Transactions and that,
without these agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this
Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay any amount due
to Parent pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.03_, the Company shall also pay
any costs and expenses incurred by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with a
legal action to enforce this Agreement that results in a judgment against the
Company for such amount, together with interest on the amount of any unpaid
fee, cost or expense at the publicly announced prime rate of Citibank, N.A.
from the date such fee, cost or expense was required to be paid to the

survive the Effective Time. This _Section_ __ _ 8.01_ shall not limit any
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or in any document or
instrument delivered pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement that by
its terms applies in whole or in part after the Effective Time.

 

SECTION 8.02. _Amendment or Supplement_. Subject to compliance with

failure or delay by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub in exercising any right

instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

 

SECTION 8.04. _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the

48

    

 intended to and does not confer upon any Person other than the parties

respect of such shares; (ii) __ if the Effective Time occurs, the right of
the Companys stockholders to receive the Merger Consideration; (iii) __ if

SECTION 8.07. _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_. (a) __ This Agreement and
any matters or disputes relating thereto shall be governed by, and construed
in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts
executed in and to be performed entirely within that State, regardless of the
laws that might otherwise govern under any applicable conflict of Laws
principles.

(b) All Actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the
Transactions shall be heard and determined in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
declines to accept jurisdiction over any Action, any state or federal court
within the State of Delaware), and in each case, appellate courts therefrom,
and the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction
and venue of such courts in any such Action and irrevocably waive the defense
of an inconvenient forum or lack of jurisdiction to the maintenance of any
such Action. The consents to jurisdiction and venue set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 8.07(b)_ shall not constitute general consents to service of
process in the State of Delaware and shall have no effect for any purpose
except as provided in this paragraph and shall not be deemed to confer rights
on any Person other than the parties hereto. Each party hereto agrees
that service of process upon such party in any Action arising out of or
relating to this Agreement shall be effective if notice is given by overnight
courier at the address set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.10_ of this Agreement.
The parties hereto agree that a final judgment in any such Action shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing in the foregoing shall restrict any partys rights to seek any
post-judgment relief regarding, or any appeal from, a final trial court
judgment.

 

SECTION 8.08. _Specific Enforcement_. The parties hereto agree
that irreparable damage for which monetary relief, even if available, would
not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that any provision of this
Agreement is not performed in accordance with its specific terms or is
otherwise breached, including if the parties hereto fail to take any action
required of them hereunder to consummate this Agreement. The parties
acknowledge and agree that (a) __ the parties hereto shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in the courts described in _Section_ __ _ 8.07(b)_ without
proof of damages or otherwise, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled under this Agreement and (b) __ the right of specific
enforcement is an integral part of the Transactions and without that right
neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement. The
right to specific performance hereunder shall include the right of the Company
to cause Parent and Merger Sub to cause the Offer, the Merger and the other
Transactions to be consummated on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement. Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose
the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief
on the basis that the parties have an adequate remedy at law or an award
of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
equity. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with
this _Section_ __ _ 8.08_ shall not be required to provide any bond or other
security in connection with any such order or injunction. __
