$1.00 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only

 (h) _Fractional Shares_.

 SECTION 2.2 _Treatment of Company Options and other Company Stock-Based Awards_. 

   

 (a) At the Effective Time, each option (a " _Company Option_ ") granted by the Company under the Company Stock Plan to purchase shares of Company Common Stock which is outstanding and unexercised as of the Effective Time (other than an Under Water Option, as defined in this Section 2.2(a)) shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock and shall be converted automatically into an option to purchase a number of Parent Shares (a " _Converted Option_ ") at an exercise price determined as provided below (and the Converted Option otherwise shall remain subject to the terms of the Company Stock Plan and the agreements or letters evidencing grants thereunder): 

   

 (i) the number of Parent Shares to be subject to the Converted Option shall be equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company Option and (y) the Exchange Ratio, provided that any fractional Parent Shares resulting from such multiplication shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share; and 

   ##### 

  

   

 (ii) the exercise price per Parent Share under the Converted Option shall be equal to the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock under the Company Option divided by the Exchange Ratio, provided that such exercise price shall be rounded up to the nearest cent. 

   

 Except as otherwise provided in this Section 2.2, the duration and other terms of each Converted Option shall be the same as the applicable Company Option (after giving effect to any rights resulting exclusively from the transaction contemplated under this Agreement pursuant to the Company Stock Plan and the award agreements thereunder) except that all references to the Company shall be deemed to be references to Parent and all references to the Board of Directors of the Company shall be deemed to be references to the Board of Directors of Parent. 

   

 For purposes of this Section 2.2(a), an "Under Water Option" is a Company Option with respect to which the Option Price (as such term is defined in the Company Stock Plan) to purchase a share of Company Common Stock under such option exceeds the Fair Market Value (as such term is defined in the Company Stock Plan) of a share of Company Common Stock immediately before the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, each Under Water Option shall (pursuant to the terms of the Company Stock Plan) be canceled and shall have no further force or effect whatsoever. 

   

 (b) At the Effective Time, each right of any kind, contingent or accrued, to receive shares of the Company Common Stock or benefits measured by the value of a number of shares of Company Common Stock, and each award of any kind consisting of shares of Company Common Stock, granted under the Company Stock Plan (including restricted stock, restricted stock units, deferred stock units, performance shares (or units), phantom stock units and dividend equivalents), other than Company Options (each, a " _Company Stock-Based Award_ "), which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to represent a right or award with respect to shares of Company Common Stock and shall be converted, at the Effective Time, into a right or award with respect to a number of Parent Shares (a " _Converted Award_ ") equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company Stock-Based Award and (y) the Exchange Ratio, provided that any fractional Parent Shares resulting from such multiplication shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share and the Converted Awards otherwise shall remain subject to the terms of the Company Stock Plan and the agreements or letters evidencing grants thereunder after giving effect to any rights resulting exclusively from the transactions contemplated under this Agreement pursuant to the Company Stock Plan and the award agreements thereunder. Any performance-based Company Stock-Based Award with respect to which the vesting terms thereunder is contingent (in whole or in part) upon the timely satisfaction of any performance conditions for any period which extends beyond the Effective Time shall remain subject to all service based vesting conditions through the end of the applicable performance period and shall be subject to the following adjustments with respect to the applicable performance vesting conditions: 

   ##### 

  

   

 (i) _2009 Performance Awards_. In the case of a Company Stock-Based Award with a vesting condition linked to calendar year 2009 performance, the determination of whether the applicable performance vesting requirement has been met with respect to the corresponding Converted Award shall be determined based on the Companys actual performance (adjusted in a manner reasonably acceptable to Parent to eliminate the impact of costs relating to the negotiation, closing, transition and integration of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) through the end of the calendar month which ends on, or immediately precedes, the Closing Date and comparing such performance to the product of (x) the applicable annual performance target for such Company Stock-Based Award multiplied by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of completed calendar months for 2009 ending with the calendar month which ends on, or immediately precedes, the Closing Date, and the denominator of which is 12. 

   

 (ii) _2010 Performance Awards_. In the case of a Company Stock-Based Award with a vesting condition linked to calendar year 2010 performance, the performance condition shall be deemed satisfied in full as of December 31, 2010 with respect to the corresponding Converted Award (without regard to actual performance by the Company or Parent). 

   

 (c) Except as set forth under Section 2.2(b) with respect to the waiver of performance conditions related to Company Stock-Based Awards, the Company shall not exercise its discretion under the Company Stock Plan to accelerate the vesting or eliminate the performance conditions related to any Company Options or Company Stock-Based Awards or make any payments with respect to any Under Water Option. 

  

 SECTION 2.3 _Surrender of Company Shares_. 

   

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint Computershare Limited (or such other commercial bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to the Company) to act as agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging for the Merger Consideration Company Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "). Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, to be held in trust for the holders of Company Shares, certificates (if such shares shall be certificated) representing Parent Shares issuable pursuant to Section 2.1 and cash in lieu of fractional Parent Shares payable pursuant to Section 2.1(h) in exchange for outstanding Company Shares. 

   

 (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each record holder, as of the Effective Time, of Book-Entry Shares, a form of letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such Company Shares for distribution of the Merger Consideration therefor. Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of Book-Entry Shares, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor Parent Shares and any cash in lieu of fractional 

   ##### 

  

   

Parent Shares in an amount equal to the Merger Consideration for each Company
Share formerly represented by such Book-Entry Shares (less any required
withholding taxes) and such Book-Entry Shares shall then be canceled. No
interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Book-
Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration issued in respect of the Book-Entry
Shares. If issuance of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a person
other than the person in whose name the surrendered Book-Entry Shares is
registered, it shall be a condition of issuance that the Book-Entry Shares so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer, in the sole discretion of the Exchange Agent, and that the
person requesting such issuance shall have paid any transfer and other taxes
required by reason of the issuance of the Merger Consideration to a person
other than the registered holder of the Book-Entry Shares surrendered or
shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that
such tax either has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered
as contemplated by, and in accordance with, this Section 2.3, each Book-Entry
Share (other than Book-Entry Shares representing Company Shares to be
canceled pursuant to Section 2.1(c), 2.1(d) or 2.1(e)) shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender the applicable Merger Consideration as contemplated by this
Article II. 

   

 (c) At any time following the date that is twelve months after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any Parent Shares and any cash in lieu of fractional Parent Shares to be issued in respect of Company Shares pursuant to this Article II that remain unclaimed by holders of Book-Entry Shares and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look to Parent and the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration issuable upon due surrender of their Book-Entry Shares. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Exchange Agent, in connection with the exchange of Company Shares for the Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any amount paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II in respect of Book-Entry Shares that have been surrendered in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Company Shares represented thereby. If any Company Shares shall not have been surrendered prior to six years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration, any dividends or distributions payable to the holder of such Company Shares or any cash payable in lieu of fractional Parent Shares, would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity), any such Merger Consideration or dividends or distributions in respect thereof shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of any claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. 

   

 (d) After the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Company Shares that were outstanding prior to the Effective Time. After the Effective 

   ##### 

  

   

Time, Book-Entry Shares presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer
shall be canceled and exchanged for the consideration provided for, and in
accordance with the procedures set forth in, this Article II. 

   

 (e) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Shares issuable with respect to the Company Shares shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Book-Entry Shares until those Book-Entry Shares are surrendered as provided in this Article II. Upon surrender of the Book-Entry Shares, in accordance with this Article II, there shall be issued and/or paid to the holder of Parent Shares, issued in exchange therefor, without interest, at the time of surrender, the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to those Parent Shares with a record date on or after the date of the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date on or prior to the date of the surrender and not previously paid. 

  

 SECTION 2.4 _Withholding Rights_. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Shares an amount not in excess of the amount it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the payment of such consideration under the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax or other Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by or on behalf of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and operate
its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted,

defined below). The Company and each of its subsidiaries is duly qualified or
licensed to do business in each jurisdiction where the character of its
properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its activities
makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for any such failure

financial performance or results of operations or any change in the price of
the Company Common Stock, in and of itself (it being understood that the
facts or occurrences giving rise or contributing to such failure that are not
otherwise excluded from the definition of a "Material Adverse Effect" may be
taken into account in determining whether there has been a Material Adverse
Effect); _provided_  that, in the case of the immediately preceding clauses
(A), (B), (D) or (E), such changes, effects or circumstances do not affect
the Company or its subsidiaries disproportionately relative to
other companies operating in the same industry) or (ii) does, or would

change in the price of Parent Shares, in and of itself (it being understood
that the facts or occurrences giving rise or contributing to such failure
that are not otherwise excluded from the definition of a "Parent Material
Adverse Effect" may be taken into account in determining whether there has
been a Parent Material Adverse Effect); _provided_ that, in the case of the

 (b) Any Change of Recommendation shall not change the approval of this Agreement, the Voting Agreements or any other approval of the Board of Directors of the Company, including in any respect that would have the effect of causing any state (including Delaware) corporate takeover statute or other similar statute to be applicable to 

   #####

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, unless
this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 8.1, the obligation
of the Company to call, give notice of, convene, hold, and submit this
Agreement and the Merger for a vote at the Stockholders Meeting as promptly

At the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Parent evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent of the resignation of all directors of the Company and its subsidiaries specified by Parent in writing reasonably in advance of the Closing (but in no event less than five business days prior to the Closing Date), in each case, effective at the Effective Time. 

   

 SECTION 6.4 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. 

    

 (a) From the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time or the earlier termination of this Agreement, to the extent permitted by applicable Law or regulation, upon reasonable prior written notice, the Company shall, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its subsidiaries, officers, directors and employees to, afford Parents officers, employees, auditors and other authorized representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to its officers, employees, properties, offices, and other facilities and to all books and records, and shall furnish Parent with all 

   ##### 

  

    

financial, operating and other data and information as Parent, through its
officers, employees or authorized representatives, may from time to time
reasonably request in writing, whether related to the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents, transition planning
or post-closing integration;  _provided_ that any such investigation or
consultation shall be conducted in such a manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company or its
subsidiaries or otherwise result in any significant interference with the
prompt and timely discharge by such employees of their normal duties.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, neither the Company nor any
of its subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the
rights of its clients, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of
the Company or its subsidiaries or contravene any Law, rule, regulation,
order, judgment, decree or binding agreement entered into prior to the date
of this Agreement. 

   

 (b) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub will hold and treat and will cause its officers, employees, auditors and other authorized representatives to hold and treat in confidence all documents and information concerning the other party and its subsidiaries furnished to such party in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, dated December 19, 2008, between the Company and Parent (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") which Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

The Company agrees that it 

   ##### 

  

    

will, and it will cause its subsidiaries and Representatives to, immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any persons conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal or any potential Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall
(I) promptly (and in any event within one business day after receipt) notify
Parent in writing of the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal (or any request
for information or other inquiry that may reasonably be expected to lead to
an Acquisition Proposal) after the date of this Agreement, which notice shall
include the identity of the person making such Acquisition Proposal and the
material terms thereof and (II) keep Parent reasonably informed of the status
and details (including any material developments with respect to such
Acquisition Proposal). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in
this Agreement shall prevent the Company or its Board of Directors from: (i)
taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communication to stockholders in connection with the making or amendment of
a tender offer or exchange offer) or from making any disclosure to the
Companys stockholders as, in the good faith judgment of the Board of
Directors of the Company, after receiving advice from outside counsel, is
consistent with its obligations hereunder and is required by applicable Law;
(ii) prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, providing access to
its properties, books and records and providing information or data in
response to a request therefor by a person who has made an unsolicited bona
fide Acquisition Proposal if the Board of Directors receives from the person
so requesting such information an executed confidentiality agreement on
terms substantially similar to those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement (except for such changes specifically necessary in order for the
Company to be able to comply with its obligations under this Agreement);
(iii) prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, contacting and engaging
in discussions with any person who has made an unsolicited bona
fide Acquisition Proposal solely for the purpose of clarifying such
Acquisition Proposal and any material terms thereof and the conditions to
consummation so as to determine whether such Acquisition Proposal is, or may
reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal; and (iv) prior to
obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, contacting and engaging in
any negotiations or discussions with any person who has made an unsolicited
bona fide Acquisition Proposal (which negotiations or discussions are not
solely for clarification purposes), if and only to the extent that in
connection with the foregoing clauses (ii) or (iv), (1) the Board of
Directors of the Company shall have determined in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor
that, (x) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or is reasonably likely to
lead to, a Superior Proposal, and (y) that the failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (2)
prior to taking such action, the Company shall provide written notice to
Parent of such matter. 

   

 (b) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) recommend, adopt or approve, or propose publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Proposal Documentation (as defined below) or (ii) execute (or allow the Company or any of its subsidiaries to execute) any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar agreement constituting an Acquisition Proposal (other than a 

   ##### 

  

    

confidentiality agreement pursuant to Section 6.5(a)) (any such
documentation, " _Acquisition Proposal Documentation_ "). Notwithstanding the
foregoing or any other provision of this Section 6.5 to the contrary, if, at
any time prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, the Companys Board
of Directors determines, in response to an Acquisition Proposal that
was unsolicited and that did not otherwise result from a material breach of
Section 6.5(a), that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, (A)
the Company or its Board of Directors may terminate this Agreement, (B) the
Board of Directors of the Company may approve or recommend such Superior
Proposal to its stockholders and/or (C) concurrently with the termination of
this Agreement, the Company may enter into or execute any
Acquisition Proposal Documentation with respect to such Superior Proposal;
_provided_ , that the Company may only take such actions at a time that is
after the third business day following Parents receipt of written notice
advising Parent that the Board of Directors of the Company has received a
Superior Proposal. Such written notice shall specify the material terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal and identify the person making such
Superior Proposal. During such three business day period, the Company shall
provide an opportunity for Parent to propose such adjustments to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to
constitute a Superior Proposal; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that any such
proposed adjustment shall be at the discretion of Parent at the time. The
Company or its Board of Directors may not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 6.5(b), and any purported termination pursuant to
this sentence shall be void and of no force or effect, unless the
Company prior to or concurrently with such termination pursuant to this
Section 6.5(b) pays to the Parent the Company Termination Fee. 

   

 (c) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any Acquisition Proposal made by a third party for more than 50% of the outstanding equity interests in the Company or more than 50% of the consolidated assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (i) on terms that the Board of Directors of the Company determined in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal and financial advisors, and considering such factors as the Board of Directors of the Company considers to be appropriate (including the conditionality and the timing and likelihood of consummation of such proposal), are more favorable to the Companys stockholders from a financial point of view than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) is reasonably capable of being consummated, including, without limitation, the receipt of the approvals of Corvina Holdings Limited, SK Telecom Co., Ltd. and Parent or their respective affiliates pursuant to contractual approval or consent rights. 

  

 SECTION 6.6 _Employment and Employee Benefits Matters_. 

    

 (a) Without limiting any additional rights that any Company Employee may have under any Company Plan, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its subsidiaries, for a period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the 18-month anniversary thereof, to maintain (i) the Company Severance Plan and (ii) existing severance practices as described in Section 6.6(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, each as currently in effect, and (subject to all of the terms and conditions set forth in such plan) to make severance payments to any eligible Company 

   ##### 

  

    

Employee terminated during that 18-month period in accordance with such
Company Severance Plan and severance practices. 

   

 (b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its subsidiaries (i) to continue for the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the 12-month anniversary thereof (the " _Compensation Protection Period_ ") to compensate the Company Employees who continue to be employed in good standing at substantially the same base salaries or base hourly wages as in effect for such employees immediately before the Effective Time, (ii) to provide for the bonuses, if any, earned through December 31, 2009 pursuant to Section 6.6(e), and (iii) during the Compensation Protection Period, to either (A) continue (subject to Sections 6.6(a) and 6.6(e)) to provide benefits which are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the benefits provided under the Company Plans at the Effective Time or (B) provide benefits which are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the benefits provided directly or indirectly by Parent to employees who provide similar services to or perform similar functions for Parent or its subsidiaries. 

   

 (c) As of and after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, give Company Employees who continue to be employed in good standing full service credit for purposes of eligibility and vesting and benefit accruals (but not for purposes of benefit accruals (i) under any defined benefit pension plans or under any plan which provides post-retirement medical or dental or prescription drug or other post-retirement welfare benefits or for vacation if any payment has been made in lieu of vacation or (ii) which would result in any duplication of benefits for the same period of service) under any employee benefit plans, programs and policies which are provided for the benefit of Company Employees as of and after the Effective Time by Parent, its subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation for such Company Employees service with the Company, its subsidiaries and their predecessor entities (each, a " _Parent Plan_ ") to the same extent such service was recognized by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time under any corresponding Company Plan or program or policy of the Company. With respect to each Parent Plan that is a "welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), Parent or its subsidiaries shall (i) cause there to be waived for any Company Employee any pre-existing condition limitation or eligibility limitation to the extent neither such employee nor his or her eligible dependents were subject to any such limitation under the corresponding Company Plan and (ii) give effect, in determining any deductible and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to claims incurred and amounts paid by, and amounts reimbursed to, Company Employees under any Company Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time as if the claims had been incurred and the amounts had been paid or reimbursed under a corresponding Parent Plan. 

   

 (d) From and after the Effective Time, Parent will honor, and will cause its subsidiaries to honor, the terms of the Company Plans, as such Company Plans may be amended pursuant to their terms, in each case to the extent legally binding on the Company or any of its subsidiaries. Further, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, make the matching contribution for 2009 which is called for under the terms of the Companys 401(k) Plan pursuant to the terms of such plan as in effect on the date of this Agreement. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (e) Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue the Operating Partnerships 2009 Incentive Plan (which also is known as the Companys Annual Incentive Plan) and the Operating Partnerships 2009 Mid-Term Incentive Plan through the performance cycles which for each plan end on December 31, 2009 and pay the bonuses, if any, earned for each such cycle pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in each such plan; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that (1) the extent to which the applicable performance conditions for a bonus under such plans are met shall be determined based on the Companys actual performance (adjusted in a manner reasonably acceptable to Parent to eliminate the impact of costs relating to the negotiation, closing, transition and integration of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) through the end of the calendar month which ends on, or immediately precedes, the Closing Date and comparing such performance to the Companys targeted year-to-date performance goals through the end of such calendar month, (2) the payment of the bonuses earned under the Operating Partnerships 2009 Incentive Plan shall be paid in accordance with the terms of such plan in February, 2010 except as otherwise expressly called for under the terms of the Operating Partnerships 2009 Incentive Plan or, if and to the extent applicable, an employment agreement and (3) the payment of the bonuses earned under the Operating Partnerships Mid-Term Incentive Plan shall be paid in accordance with the terms of such plan, 30% in February, 2010, 30% in August, 2010 and 40% in February, 2011 except as otherwise expressly called for under the terms of the Operating Partnerships 2009 Mid-Term Incentive Plan or, if and to the extent applicable, an employment agreement. 

   

 (f) No person other than the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall have any rights with respect to the provisions of this Section 6.6. 

  

 SECTION 6.7 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. 

    

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation agrees that it will indemnify, defend and hold harmless each present and former officer, director or employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries and any fiduciary under any Company Plan (in each case, when acting in such capacity), determined as of the Effective Time (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), against any costs or expenses (including attorneys fees and disbursements), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding, inquires or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to (i) the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was an officer, director, employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or (ii) matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including this Agreement and the transactions and actions contemplated hereby) whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, as provided in the Company Certificate of Incorporation or Company Bylaws, in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, or pursuant to any other agreements in effect on the date hereof, copies of which have been provided to Parent. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that this Section 6.7 does not purport to limit any rights that any Indemnified Party may have under any employment agreement or Company Plan. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (b) The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of former or present directors and officers than are set forth in the Company Certificate of Incorporation and Company Bylaws, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such individuals, except as may be required by Law. 

   

 (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall and, if the Company is unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time to obtain and fully pay, at no expense to the beneficiaries, for "tail" insurance policies with a claims period of six years from and after the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, " _D andO Insurance_"), for the persons who are covered by the Companys existing DandO Insurance, with terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage at least as favorable as the Companys existing DandO Insurance with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby), and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain such DandO Insurance in full force and effect for their full terms. If the Company and the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect, at no expense to the beneficiaries, for a period of six years from and after the Effective Time for the persons who are covered by the Companys DandO Insurance in place as of the date of this Agreement with terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage at least as favorable as provided in the Companys existing policies as of the date of this Agreement, or, if such insurance is unavailable, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, purchase the best available DandO Insurance for such six-year period from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to the Companys existing DandO Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and with levels of coverage at least as favorable as provided in the Companys existing policies as of the date of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing, in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such policies an annual premium amount in excess of 300% of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance; and _provided_ _further_ , that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount. 

   

 (d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or a majority of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving 

   ##### 

  

    

Corporation shall assume all of the obligations set forth in Section 6.6 and

 (e) The provisions of this Section 6.7 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their respective successors, heirs and legal representatives, shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation and shall not be amended in any matter that is adverse to the Indemnified Parties (including their successors, heirs and legal representatives) without the consent of the Indemnified Party (including the successors, heirs and legal representatives) affected thereby. 

   

 (f) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Section 6.7 shall be in addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the Company Certificate of Incorporation or Company Bylaws or equivalent documents of any of its subsidiaries, or under any applicable Contracts or Laws, and Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor and perform under all indemnification agreements entered into by the Company or any of its subsidiaries. 

  

 SECTION 6.8 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company or Parent shall give the other party the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation against the Company and its directors or Parent and its directors, as the case may be, relating to the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents or the Merger; _provided_ , however, that no such settlement of any such litigation shall be agreed to without the Companys or Parents consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. 

   

 SECTION 6.9 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any change or event (i) that has, or would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect or (ii) that it believes results or would reasonably be expected to result in a failure of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2. Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company of any change or event (i) that has had, or would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have, a Parent Material Adverse Effect or (ii) that it believes results or would reasonably be expected to result in a failure of the conditions set forth in Section 7.3. The delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.9, however, shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice. If any event or matter arises after the date of this Agreement that, if existing or occurring at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or described in the Company Disclosure Schedule or that is necessary to correct any information in the Company Disclosure Schedule that has been rendered inaccurate thereby, then the Company shall promptly supplement, or amend the Company Disclosure Schedule that it has delivered pursuant to this Agreement and deliver such supplement or amendment to Parent; provided that such supplement or amendment shall be for informational purposes only and shall not enlarge, reduce or otherwise modify the rights of the parties hereunder (including the right of any party to assert the failure of a condition to Closing set forth in Article VII without regard to any such supplement or amendment). Any noncompliance with this Section 6.9 shall not constitute the failure of a condition set forth in Article VII to be satisfied or give rise to any right of termination under Article VIII.

 SECTION 6.10 _Further Action; Efforts._  

    

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party will use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws and regulations to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each party hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable and in any event within fifteen business days of the date of this Agreement and to supply as promptly as reasonably practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and to take all other actions necessary, proper or advisable to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable. 

   

 (b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in Section 6.8(a) to obtain all requisite approvals and authorizations for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law, use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a private party; (ii) keep the other party reasonably informed of any communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") or any other Governmental Entity and of any communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby; and (iii) permit the other party to review any communication given by it to, and consult with each other in advance of any meeting or conference with, the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Entity or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any other person, and to the extent permitted by the FTC, the DOJ or such other applicable Governmental Entity or other person, give the other party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences.

Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
resolve any such objections or suits so as to permit consummation of the

be expected to prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation
of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby, including

holding separate or other disposition of, any of its assets or the assets of
its subsidiaries or the conducting of its business in a manner which would
resolve such objections or suits. Without excluding other possibilities, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be deemed to be materially

Agreement and one month from the date of the Stockholders Meeting.

 (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in Section 6.10(a), Section 6.10(c) or Section 6.10(d) shall require Parent, Merger Sub or the Company to take any action which would materially deprive Parent of the benefits of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents (such condition, restriction or requirement, a " _Burdensome Condition_ "). 

   

 (f) In connection with, and without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall (i) take all actions necessary to ensure that no state antitakeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes operative with respect to this Agreement, the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) if any state antitakeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes operative with respect to this Agreement, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, take all actions necessary to ensure that this Agreement, the Merger and any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the

   #####

 (i) if there shall have been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Parent or Merger Sub contained in this Agreement such that the conditions set forth in Section 7.3(a) or Section 7.3(b) would not be satisfied and, in either such case, such breach is incapable of being cured or has not been cured by the Termination Date; _provided_ that the Company shall have given Parent at least twenty days written notice prior to such termination stating the Companys intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(d)(i); _provided_ _further_ that the Company shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(d)(i) if the Company is then in material breach of any of its covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement; or

 (i) In the event that this Agreement is terminated (x) by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(iii), (y) by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(e)(ii), or (z) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(f) if prior to the vote to approve this Agreement at the Stockholders Meeting or any postponement or adjournment thereof, the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof (A) shall have made a Change of Recommendation or (B) shall have recommended, adopted or approved, or publicly proposed to recommend, adopt or approve, any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Proposal Documentation, then the Company shall pay the Company Termination Fee to Parent, at or prior to the time of termination in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(iii) or as promptly as reasonably practicable in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 8.1(e)(ii) or Section 8.1(f), payable by wire transfer of same day funds (and, in any event, within two business days following such termination). For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Company Termination Fee_ " means $14,200,000. 

   

 (ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(c) or Section 8.1(f) (other than in the 

   ##### 

  

    

circumstances described in Section 8.2(b)(i)) or by Parent pursuant to
Section 8.1(e)(i) and (A) at any time after the date of this Agreement and
prior to such termination (in the case of a termination pursuant to Section
8.1(c)), or prior to the breach giving rise to Parents right to terminate
under Section 8.1(e)(i) (in the case of a termination pursuant to Section
8.1(e)(i)) or prior to the taking of a vote to approve this Agreement at the
Stockholders Meeting or any postponement or adjournment thereof (in the case
of a termination pursuant to Section 8.1(f)) an Acquisition Proposal shall
have been made known to the Board of Directors of the Company or shall have
been publicly announced or publicly made known to the stockholders of the
Company, and not withdrawn prior to such termination, such breach or such
taking of a vote to approve this Agreement, as applicable, and (B) within
twelve months after such termination, the Company shall have entered into a
definitive agreement with respect to, or shall have consummated, such
Acquisition Proposal, then, in any such event, the Company shall pay to
Parent the Company Termination Fee, such payment to be made upon the earlier
of the Company entering into an agreement providing for, or consummating,
such Acquisition Proposal, by wire transfer of same day funds. For the
purpose of this Section 8.2(b), all references in the term Acquisition
Proposal to "10% or more" will be deemed to be references to "more
than 50%". 

   

 (c) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that the Company shall fail to pay the Company Termination Fee when due, the Company shall reimburse Parent for all reasonable costs and expenses actually incurred or accrued by Parent (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) in connection with any action (including the filing of any lawsuit) taken to collect payment of such amounts, together with interest on such unpaid amounts at the prime lending rate prevailing during such period as published in The Wall Street Journal, calculated on a daily basis from the date such amounts were required to be paid to the date of actual payment. 

  

 SECTION 8.3 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, each party shall bear its own expenses in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company shall bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing, printing and mailing of the Proxy Statement. 

   

 SECTION 8.4 _Procedure for Termination or Amendment_. In order for any amendment or termination of this Agreement to be effective, such amendment or termination requires approval of the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, the Company or Merger Sub, as the case may be (or any authorized committee thereof), if such action is to be taken at any time prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that, after adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company, no amendment may be made which by Law requires the further approval of the stockholders of the Company without such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto. 

   

 SECTION 8.5 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party hereto may (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained 

   ##### 

  

   

herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) subject to the
requirements of applicable Law, waive compliance with any of the agreements
or conditions contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid
if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to
be bound thereby. The failure of any party to assert any rights or remedies
shall not constitute a waiver of such rights or remedies. The waiver of any
such right with respect to particular facts and other circumstances shall not
be deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and circumstances and each
such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any
time and from time to time.

PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
