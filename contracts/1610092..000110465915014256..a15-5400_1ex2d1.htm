 **ARTICLE I. 
PURCHASE AND SALE**

 



 

1.01 _Purchase and Sale of the Purchased Securities._

 



 

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and in reliance upon
the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement, at the

      
 

 



 

Closing, Buyer shall purchase (a) all of the Membership Interests from the

and convey the Membership Interests to Buyer, and (b) all of the Blocker Stock
from the Blocker Sellers, and the Blocker Sellers shall sell, transfer and
convey the Blocker Stock to Buyer, in each case, free and clear of any Liens
other than restrictions on transfer under applicable securities laws.

 



 

1.02 _Purchase Price._

 



 

(a) The aggregate purchase price for the Purchased Securities is (subject to
adjustment pursuant to _Section 1.03_ ) equal to the following: (i)
$210,000,000.00, plus or minus (ii) the Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount
(if applicable), minus (iii) the Closing Indebtedness, minus (iv) the Sellers
Expenses, plus (v) the Cash on Hand Adjustment Amount (the sum of (i) through
(v) above is referred to herein as the " _Closing Cash Purchase Price_ "),
plus (vi) the Contingent Payment, if any, payable to the Sellers pursuant to
_Section 1.04_, plus (vii) the Lion Stock Consideration. The Lion Stock
Consideration, the Closing Cash Purchase Price and the Contingent Payment, are
referred to herein collectively as the " _Purchase Price_."

 



 

(b) The Company shall prepare in good faith and, not less than three Business
Days before the Closing Date, deliver to Buyer (i) an estimated balance sheet
of the Company (the " _Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet_ ") as of the open
of business on the Closing Date, (ii) a certificate, executed by the Company
(the " _Estimated Closing Cash Purchase Price Certificate_ ") setting forth
the Companys good faith estimate as of the open of business on the Closing
Date of (A) the Net Working Capital Adjustment, the Closing Indebtedness, the
Sellers Expenses and the Cash on Hand Adjustment Amount and (B) the Closing
Cash Purchase Price (the " _Estimated Closing Cash Purchase Price_ "). The
Estimated Closing Cash Purchase Price (including the calculations set forth
therein) and the Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet shall be prepared in
accordance with GAAP and (to the extent consistent with GAAP) the Companys
Accounting Practices and Procedures. Following the delivery of the Estimated
Closing Cash Purchase Price Certificate and the Estimated Closing Date Balance
Sheet, for a period of two Business Days thereafter (the " _Pre-Closing Review
Period_ "), upon request by Buyer, the Company shall provide Buyer and its
representatives and accountants with reasonable access, during normal business
hours, to the Companys relevant employees, personnel, contractors, counsel,
representatives, advisors and outside accountants, in each case to the extent
involved with, and to the accounting and financial books and records of the
Company related to, the preparation of the Estimated Closing Cash Purchase
Price Certificate and the Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet and the
calculations set forth therein (including all components thereof). If the
Buyer notifies the Company in writing of any objection to the Estimated
Closing Cash Purchase Price Certificate or the calculations set forth therein
(including all components thereof) during the Pre-Closing Review Period, Buyer
and the Company shall attempt in good faith to resolve any disputes regarding
the applicable component(s) of the Estimated Closing Cash Purchase Price
Certificate and the calculations set forth therein prior to end of the Pre-
Closing Review Period, and to the extent that they are able to resolve any
such disputes, the Company will deliver an updated Estimated Closing Cash
Purchase Price Certificate to the Buyer reflecting the resolution of any such
disputes prior to Closing; provided that the delivery of any such update to
the Estimated Closing Cash Purchase Price Certificate shall not affect or
otherwise delay the Closing. If Buyer and the Company are unable to resolve
all disputes regarding a component of the Estimated Closing Cash Purchase

 



      
 

 



 

Price Certificate prior to Closing, then the amount of such component as set
forth in the Estimated Closing Cash Purchase Price Certificate delivered by
the Company (including any update thereto delivered pursuant to the prior
sentence) shall constitute the amount of such component for all purposes
hereof.

 



 

(c) The Closing Cash Purchase Price shall be paid by Buyer to the Sellers at
the Closing in accordance with _Section 2.02(a)_, and the Lion Stock
Consideration shall be issued to the Sellers at the Closing in accordance with
the Buyer Exchange Documents.

 



 

1.03 _Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment._

 



 

(a) Within 90 days following the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver
to Sellers Representative (i) a balance sheet as of the open of business on
the Closing Date (the " _Closing Date Balance Sheet_ "; such Closing Date
Balance Sheet shall be limited solely to the items related to the Closing
Statement) and (ii) a statement of the Cash on Hand Adjustment Amount (if
any), Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount (if any), the Closing
Indebtedness, and the Sellers Expenses, in each case as of the open of
business on the Closing Date and prepared in accordance with GAAP and (to the
extent consistent with GAAP) the Companys Accounting Practices and
Procedures, along with Buyers calculation of the resulting Closing Cash
Purchase Price based thereon (the " _Closing Statement_ "). Sellers
Representative shall have a period (the " _Review Period_ ") of 30 days from
the delivery of the Closing Statement and Closing Date Balance Sheet to review
such statements. Following the delivery of the Closing Statement and the
Closing Date Balance Sheet, Sellers Representative and its representatives
and accountants shall be entitled to review (and the Buyer shall provide to
Sellers Representative and its representatives and accountants) any working
papers, trial balances, contracts, books, records (including accounting and
financial records) and similar materials, documents or information relating to
the Closing Statement (including all components thereof and calculations
therein) that are reasonably requested by Sellers Representative. Following
the delivery of the Closing Statement and Closing Date Balance Sheet, Buyer,
the Company and the Blocker shall also provide Sellers Representative and its
representatives and accountants with reasonable access, during normal business
hours, to their respective relevant employees, personnel, contractors,
counsel, representatives, advisors, outside accountants, properties, books and
records to the extent involved with or related to the preparation of the
Closing Statement and the calculations set forth therein. If, as a result of
such review, Sellers Representative disagrees with the Closing Statement
and/or the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the calculations set forth therein
(including any components thereof), Sellers Representative shall deliver to
Buyer a written notice of disagreement (a " _Dispute Notice_ ") prior to the
expiration of the Review Period setting forth in reasonable detail the basis
for such dispute, the specific items and amounts in dispute and Sellers
Representatives alternative calculation of the Closing Cash Purchase Price
(including the alternative calculation of each disputed line item set forth in
the Closing Statement).

 



 

(b) If, for any reason, Buyer fails to deliver the Closing Statement within
the time period required by _Section 1.03(a)_ , at Sellers Representatives
option, either (i) the Estimated Closing Cash Purchase Price Certificate
delivered by the Company to Buyer prior to the Closing shall be considered for
all purposes of this Agreement as being the "Closing Statement" delivered by
Buyer pursuant to such Section and Sellers Representative shall have

 



       
 

 



 

all of its rights under this Section 1.03 with respect to such certificate or
(ii) Sellers Representative may prepare and deliver a Closing Statement as if
it were Buyer hereunder within 150 days following the Closing Date, and Buyer
shall have the right to prepare and deliver a Dispute Notice as if it were
Sellers Representative hereunder, and the relevant provisions of this
_Section 1.03_ shall apply _mutatis mutandis_ (including a revised Review
Period) in such circumstance.

 



 

(c) If Sellers Representative either (i) fails to deliver a Dispute Notice to
Buyer prior to the expiration of the Review Period, or (ii) delivers a written
notice to Buyer accepting the Closing Statement, then, in either case, the
amount of the Closing Cash Purchase Price reflected by or contained in the
Closing Statement shall be the Final Closing Cash Purchase Price and shall be
final, binding and conclusive upon the parties.

 



 

(d) If Sellers Representative delivers a Dispute Notice to Buyer prior to the
expiration of the Review Period, then Sellers Representative and Buyer shall
attempt in good faith to resolve such dispute within 30 days from the delivery
of such Dispute Notice. If Sellers Representative and Buyer cannot reach
agreement within such 30 day period, then the dispute shall be promptly
referred to the Philadelphia office of Grant Thornton, LLP unless Buyer and
Sellers Representative jointly select another nationally recognized,
independent certified public accounting firm at such time (the " _Neutral
Accountant_ "). Each party shall thereupon furnish to the Neutral Accountant
such reasonable work papers and other documents and information relating to
the calculation of the Closing Cash Purchase Price as that party desires or as
the Neutral Accountant reasonably requests, and each party will be afforded
the opportunity to present information to the Neutral Accountant and to
discuss the determination of the Closing Cash Purchase Price with the Neutral
Accountant. The Neutral Accountant shall only resolve such contested items
that were properly included by Sellers Representative in a timely Dispute
Notice and will resolve such items as promptly as may be reasonably
practicable. Following such review, the Neutral Accountant shall deliver a
written opinion setting forth its final determination of the Final Closing
Cash Purchase Price, which shall be final, binding and conclusive on the
Sellers and Buyer and shall be used in computing the amount of any adjustment
pursuant to this _Section 1.03_. All fees and expenses of the Neutral
Accountant shall be borne by the party whose estimate of the Purchase Price as
submitted to the Neutral Accountant is farthest from the Final Closing Cash
Purchase Price as finally determined by the Neutral Accountant or if the
Neutral Accountant determines that neither of the parties estimates is
farther from the Final Closing Cash Purchase Price, then such fees, costs and
expenses shall be borne 50% by the Sellers and 50% by Buyer.

 



 

(e) If the Final Closing Cash Purchase Price exceeds the Estimated Closing
Cash Purchase Price, then Buyer shall, within two Business Days of the
determination date, pay to Sellers Representative (for the benefit of the
Sellers) such difference by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated by Sellers Representative in writing.

 



 

(f) If the Estimated Closing Cash Purchase Price exceeds the Final Closing
Cash Purchase Price, Sellers Representative shall pay such deficit to Buyer
from the Sellers Representative Expense Fund within two Business Days of the
determination date to an account designated by Buyer in writing and, in the
event that the Sellers Representative Expense Fund

 



      
 

 



 

is insufficient to pay such deficit, the Sellers shall pay the remaining
amount of such deficit to Buyer by wire transfer of immediately available
funds.

 



 

(g) Any payments made pursuant to _Section 1.03_ shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Closing Cash Purchase Price by the parties for Tax purposes,
unless otherwise required by Law.

 



 

1.04 _Contingent Payments._ As additional consideration for the Purchased
Securities (and subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth below in
this Section 1.04), the Buyer shall issue and/or deliver (or, with respect to
the Contingent Shares, cause its transfer agent to issue and deliver) to the
Sellers (based on their respective Pro Rata Shares as set forth on the Payment
Spreadsheet and subject to Section 1.06) the aggregate number of Contingent
Shares and the aggregate amount of Contingent Cash, if any, determined as set
forth below in this Section 1.04 (the "Contingent Payment"). No fractional
Contingent Share will be issued to any Seller. In the event any Seller would
otherwise receive a fractional Contingent Share, Buyer shall deliver to such
Seller in lieu of any such fractional Contingent Share an amount in cash equal
to the product of (i) such fractional Contingent Share and (ii) the Lion Stock
Price. All matters relating to the Contingent Payment shall be determined in
accordance with GAAP and, to the extent consistent with GAAP, the Companys
Accounting Practices and Procedures, in each case as consistently applied by
the Company prior to the Closing Date. The parties agree that any changes in
GAAP from and after the date hereof shall not affect the calculation of EBITDA
for the Earnout Period or LTM EBITDA.

 



 

(a) _Calculation of Contingent Payment_.

 



 

(i) If the quotient of (A) EBITDA for the Earnout Period _divided by_ (B) LTM
EBITDA is equal to or less than 0.900, then no Contingent Payment will be
delivered to the Sellers Representative under this _Section 1.04_; _or_

 



 

(ii) If the quotient of (A) EBITDA for the Earnout Period _divided by_ (B) LTM
EBITDA is greater than 0.900, but not greater than 1.100, then the Contingent
Payment will consist of a number of Contingent Shares and an amount of
Contingent Cash calculated as follows:

 



 

(x) the quotient of (i) EBITDA for the Earnout Period _divided by_ LTM EBITDA,
_minus_ (ii) 0.900, _divided by_

 



 

(y) 0.2, _multiplied by_

 



 

(z) (1) the Maximum Number of Contingent Shares and (2) the Maximum Amount of
Contingent Cash, as applicable; _or_

 



 

(iii) If the quotient of (A) EBITDA for the Earnout Period _divided by_ (B)
LTM EBITDA is greater than 1.100, then the Contingent Payment will consist of
the Maximum Number of Contingent Shares and the Maximum Amount of Contingent
Cash.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Determination of the Contingent Payment_.

 



 

(i) Within 60 days after the end of the Earnout Period, Buyer shall deliver to
the Sellers Representative a written statement (the " _Earnout Statement_ ")
setting forth its calculation of EBITDA for the Earnout Period and LTM EBITDA
and its calculation of the Contingent Payment (including the number of
Contingent Shares and the amount of Contingent Cash), if any, to be issued and
delivered to the Sellers under this _Section 1.04_.

 



 

(ii) The Sellers Representative shall have 30 days after receipt of the
Earnout Statement (the " _Earnout Review Period_ ") to review the calculations
set forth therein. Prior to the expiration of the Earnout Review Period, the
Sellers Representative may object to the calculations set forth in the
Earnout Statement by delivering a written notice of objection (an " _Objection
Notice_ ") to Buyer. Any Objection Notice shall specify the items disputed by
the Sellers Representative and shall describe in reasonable detail the basis
for such objection, as well as the amounts (whether of EBITDA for the Earnout
Period, LTM EBITDA, or the number of Contingent Shares or amount of Contingent
Cash to be issued or delivered to Sellers) in dispute. If the Sellers
Representative fails to deliver an Objection Notice to Buyer prior to the
expiration of the Earnout Review Period, then the Buyers determination of the
Contingent Payment as set forth in the Earnout Statement shall be final and
binding on the parties hereto. If the Sellers Representative timely delivers
an Objection Notice, Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall negotiate in
good faith to determine any adjustments to EBITDA for the Earnout Period
and/or LTM EBITDA and the number of Contingent Shares and the amount of
Contingent Cash, if any, to be issued or delivered under this _Section 1.04_.
If Buyer and the Sellers Representative are able to reach agreement within 30
days after such an Objection Notice has been given (or such longer period as
they may mutually agree), the Contingent Payment so agreed shall be final and
binding on the parties. If Buyer and the Sellers Representative are unable to
reach agreement within 30 days after such an Objection Notice has been given
(or such longer period as they may mutually agree), then all unresolved
disputed items shall be promptly referred to the Neutral Accountant. The
Neutral Accountant shall be directed to render a written report on the
unresolved disputed items as promptly as practicable, but in no event more
than 30 days after such submission to the Neutral Accountant, and to determine
the Contingent Payment, if any, to be issued or delivered to the Sellers
pursuant to this _Section 1.04_. The Neutral Accountant shall resolve the
disputed items based solely on the applicable definitions and other terms in
this Agreement and the presentations by Buyer and Sellers Representative, and
not by independent review. The resolution of any dispute that is the subject
of an Objection Notice by the Neutral Accountant shall be final and binding on
the parties hereto. The fees and expenses of the Neutral Accountant shall be
split equally between (i) Buyer and (ii) the Sellers Representative (on
behalf of the Sellers). To the extent any portion of the Contingent Payment is
not disputed in the Objection Notice or is otherwise resolved by Buyer and the
Sellers Representative prior to the determination of the final Contingent
Consideration by the Neutral Accountant, Buyer shall issue and deliver (or,
with respect to the Contingent Shares, cause its transfer agent to issue and
deliver) to the Sellers the portion of the Contingent Payment that is not in
dispute.

 



 

(c) _Delivery of Contingent Payment_. The Buyer shall issue and deliver (or,
with respect to the Contingent Shares, cause its transfer agent to issue and
deliver) the Contingent Payment, if any, to the Sellers within two Business
Days following the date upon which the determination of the Contingent Payment
becomes final and binding upon the parties

 



      
 

 



 

as provided in _Section 1.04(b)_ (including any final resolution of any
dispute raised by Sellers Representative in an Objection Notice).

 



 

(d) _Acceleration Events_

 



 

(i) _Change in Control_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if
the Earnout Period has not ended as of the effective time of a Change in
Control, the maximum Contingent Payment shall become due and Buyer shall issue
and deliver (or, with respect to the Contingent Shares, cause its transfer
agent to issue and deliver) the Maximum Number of Contingent Shares and the
Maximum Amount of Contingent Cash to the Sellers immediately prior to the
effective time of the Change of Control and such Contingent Shares shall not
be subject to any contractual restriction on transferability pursuant to this
Agreement or otherwise.

 



 

(ii) _Employment of Founders_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, in the event the employment of either of the Founders with the
Company, the Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates is terminated without
Cause by the Company, the Buyer or any such Affiliate, as the case may be,
prior to the end of the Earnout Period, the Maximum Number of Contingent
Shares and the Maximum Amount of Contingent Cash shall become immediately due
and Buyer shall issue and deliver (or, with respect to the Contingent Shares,
cause its transfer agent to issue and deliver) the Maximum Number of
Contingent Shares and the Maximum Amount of Contingent Cash to the Sellers
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and such Contingent Shares shall not
be subject to any contractual restriction on transferability pursuant to this
Agreement or otherwise.

 



 

(e) _Post-Closing Operation of the Business_.

 



 

(i) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, subsequent to the
Closing, Buyer will have the power and right to control the business and
operations of Buyer (including the Company) in its discretion; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Buyer shall (A) maintain the records of the Company and Buyer
in a manner permitting accurate preparation of financial statements consistent
with this _Section 1.04_ and permitting the good faith determination of the
Contingent Payment as provided in this _Section 1.04_, (B) operate the
business of the Company in good faith and in a manner reasonably intended for
the Sellers to receive the Maximum Number of Contingent Shares and the Maximum
Amount of Contingent Cash; provided that Buyer and its Affiliates shall not be
required to take any action intended to benefit the Company and adversely
impact the business of Buyer or its other Affiliates, and (C) not take any
action that is primarily intended to adversely affect the ability of the
Sellers to earn the Contingent Consideration.

 



 

(ii) Prior to the payment of the Contingent Payment, if any, Buyer shall
deliver to the Sellers Representative, within 45 days after the end of each
quarter during the Earnout Period ( _i.e._ , each of the four, separate three-
month periods during the Earnout Period), a financial report setting forth
Buyers calculation of EBITDA for such quarter in reasonable detail, and Buyer
agrees to promptly provide such supporting documentation as the Sellers
Representative may reasonably request. The Founders, the Company, Buyer and
the Sellers Representative agree to keep each other informed on a timely
basis of any Adjustment

 



      
 

 



 

Event or potential Adjustment Event, and, if requested by the Founders or
Buyer, shall meet on a regular basis to discuss such actual or prospective
Adjustment Events.

 



 

(iii) Nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted as a restriction or
limitation on Buyers right or ability to (w) restructure or materially change
the Company, its operations or its ongoing business practices (as conducted
prior to Closing consistent with past practice) following the Closing, (x)
merge or consolidate the Company or its operations into, or otherwise transfer
or assign the Company or its operations to Buyer or any of Buyers Affiliates
(an " _Affiliate Business_ "), (y) acquire (or to cause the Company to
acquire) by purchase, exchange, merger, asset sale, or otherwise, any other
Person, whether or not engaged in a business similar or related to the Company
(an " _Acquired Business_ "), (z) to transfer or assign to the Company any of
the business, operations or assets of Buyer or its Affiliates (" _Company
Transfers_ "). The Sellers shall not have any rights or interests in or
relating to any such Affiliate Business, Acquired Business, or Company
Transfers. In the event of an Adjustment Event, other than an Adjustment Event
required by a change in Law following the date of this Agreement, for purposes
of the calculation of the Contingent Payment deliverable hereunder, Buyer and
the Sellers Representative shall agree on equitable adjustments in good faith
to EBITDA during the Earnout Period and, as applicable, LTM EBITDA, to exclude
any financial impact (whether positive or negative) of such Adjustment Event
on the operations or financial results of the Company following such
transaction.

 



 

(f) _No Security_. The parties hereto understand and agree that (i) the
Sellers contingent rights to receive the Contingent Payment shall not be
represented by any form of certificate or other instrument, are not
transferable and are unsecured and (ii) no Seller shall have any rights as a
securityholder of Buyer or the Company solely as a result of such Sellers
contingent right to receive any Contingent Payment hereunder. Neither Buyer
nor its Affiliates is making, and the Sellers are not relying upon, any
representations or warranties with respect to the financial performance or
results of operations of the Company following the Closing

 



 

1.05 _Required Withholding._

 



 

Each of Buyer, Sellers Representative and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from any consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement such amounts as are required to be
deducted and withheld under the Code or other applicable Law, and to the
extent required by the Code or other applicable Law, Buyer, Sellers
Representative and Escrow Agent, as applicable, shall remit any such amounts
to the applicable Governmental Entity. Any amounts so deducted and withheld
shall be treated for all purposes as having been paid to the Person in respect
of whom such deduction and withholding was made.

 



 

1.06 _Payments to Sellers_.

 



 

(a) _General_. All payments hereunder to the Sellers (including payments at
Closing pursuant to _Section 2.02(a)_, the issuance of the Lion Stock
Consideration, the payment or issuance of the Contingent Payment and amounts
disbursed after the Closing from the Escrow Fund or pursuant to _Sections
1.03(a)_ and _1.03(e)_ ) will be made in accordance with the Payment
Spreadsheet. For amounts payable to the Sellers after the Closing (including
amounts disbursed

 



      
 

 



 

from the Escrow Fund or pursuant to _Sections 1.03(a)_ or _1.03(e)_ , or the
payment or release of Contingent Payment), Sellers Representative may (at its
option) deposit with the Company or Buyer all or a portion of such amount(s)
that are compensatory in nature and payable to any Seller who is or was an
employee of the Company and is therefore subject to withholding required under
any Tax Law and, if so deposited, the Company, shall promptly make such
payments, net of applicable amounts required to be so withheld, to the
appropriate Sellers. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Blocker Sellers, in the aggregate, will not receive in exchange
for their Blocker Shares a greater proportion of the aggregate consideration
(or a greater portion of the Contingent Consideration or the Lion Stock
Consideration) paid or issued pursuant to this Agreement than they would have
received if the Blocker Sellers held all of the Blockers limited liability
company interests in the Company directly.

 



 

(b) _Payment Spreadsheet._ At least two Business Days prior to the Closing,
the Company will deliver to Buyer a spreadsheet, certified as complete and
correct by the Company, setting forth the aggregate amounts payable to (i)
each Seller at Closing and such Sellers share of the Escrow Fund, the
Contingent Payment and the Lion Stock Consideration and (ii) each recipient of
a Sale Bonus (the " _Payment Spreadsheet_ "). The Payment Spreadsheet will
also set forth the type of consideration ( _i.e._ , Lion Stock or cash)
payable to each Seller. Any Seller who is an employee of the Company shall
only be entitled to receive a redacted version of the Payment Spreadsheet,
which such redacted version shows only the amounts and calculations on the
Payment Spreadsheet applicable to such Seller.

 



 

(c) _Sale of Blocker_. For purposes of this Agreement, it is understood that
each Blocker Seller is selling its shares of capital stock of the Blocker to
Buyer, which shares represent an indirect interest in the membership interests
to be held by Blocker as of the Closing, and each Blocker Seller shall be
entitled to receive the consideration therefor as set forth on the Payment
Spreadsheet (plus any additional consideration equal to the net cash or cash
equivalents, if any, of the Blocker as of the Closing).

 



 

(d) _Accredited Investor_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
only Sellers that are "accredited investors" as defined in Rule 501 of
Regulation D shall be entitled to receive Lion Stock Consideration and, if
applicable, the Contingent Shares. All Sellers that are not "accredited
investors" shall receive all of their consideration hereunder (whether paid at
or after the Closing) in cash, with such payments in lieu of the Lion Stock
Consideration and/or Contingent Shares to be made as set forth on the Payment
Spreadsheet and with Buyers obligations to make cash payments and deliver
Lion Stock Consideration and Contingent Shares hereunder (and under the
Subscription Agreements) being correspondingly adjusted. For the avoidance of
doubt, no such cash payment shall alter the amount of cash payable to any
other Seller hereunder.

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE II. 
CLOSING**

 



 

2.01 _Closing; Financing Delay Event._

 



 

(a) The closing (the " _Closing_ ") of the purchase and sale of the Purchased
Securities hereunder shall take place at the offices of Bass, Berry and Sims
PLC, 150 Third Avenue South, Suite 2800, Nashville, Tennessee, 37201 as soon
as possible, but in no event later than three Business Days after satisfaction
or, to the extent permissible, waiver by the party or parties entitled to the
benefit of the conditions set forth in _Article IX_ (other than conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or, to the extent permissible, waiver of those conditions at the
Closing), or at such other time or place as Buyer and Sellers Representative
may agree; provided, however, that, unless otherwise mutually agreed by Buyer
and Sellers Representative, in no event shall the Closing occur prior to the
first Business Day following the 35th day following the date of this
Agreement.

 



 

(b) Upon the occurrence of a Financing Delay Event, Buyer shall have the
option, exercisable upon written notice (a " _Closing Date Extension Notice_
") to the Sellers Representative (i) within 35 days of the date of this
Agreement, to delay Closing for a reasonable period of time (not to exceed 25
days from the date of such Closing Date Extension Notice) as specified in a
Closing Date Extension Notice (such period being referred to as the " _Initial
Extended Closing Period_ "), for so long as Buyer is proceeding diligently and
in good faith and using its reasonable best efforts to close on the debt
financing in the Debt Commitment Letter (or to obtain substitute financing)
and to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as
possible but in any event within the Initial Extended Closing Period; and (ii)
prior to the expiration of the Initial Extended Closing Period, if a second
Financing Delay Event has occurred during the Initial Extended Closing Period,
to delay Closing for an additional reasonable period of time (not to exceed 30
days) as specified in a Closing Date Extension Notice (such period being
referred to as the " _Second Extended Closing Period_ "), for so long as Buyer
is proceeding diligently and in good faith and using its reasonable best
efforts to obtain debt financing from financing sources, including GE Capital
Finance (" _Lender_ "), and to close the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as soon as possible but in any event within the Second Extended
Closing Period. " _Financing Delay Event_ " means at any time after the date
hereof the Lender notifies Buyer that the Lender will not consummate the
Financing, pursuant to the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter or otherwise or

modified or amended in any respect, and the respective commitments contained
in the Debt Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn or rescinded. Neither
Buyer nor any of its Affiliates is in breach of the Debt Commitment Letter,

7.04 _Notification_.

 



 

(a) During the Interim Period, Buyer or the Company, as the case may be
(either such party, the " _Disclosing Party_ "), shall reasonably promptly

condition that causes or constitutes a breach of any of the representations
and warranties of the Disclosing Party made as of the date of this Agreement,
or (ii) the occurrence after the date of this Agreement of any fact or
condition that would or be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a breach
of any such representation or warranty of the Disclosing Party had that
representation or warranty been made as of the time of the occurrence of, or
following the Disclosing Partys discovery of, such fact or condition (in
either case, (i) or (ii), a " _New Matter_ "). Unless the existence of any New
Matters set forth in any RandW Notification would cause the failure of a
condition set forth in _Section 9.02_ to be satisfied, Buyer shall have no
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Article X_ based on such New
Matters, __provided__ that Buyer may make a claim in respect of such New
Matters following the Closing to the extent permitted under _Article XII_.

 



 

(b) During the Interim Period, Buyer or the Company, as the case may be, shall
notify the other party of the occurrence of any breach of any covenant by such
party in this _Article VII_ (other than the covenants or obligations of the
Company or Buyer, as the case may be, set forth in this _Section 7.04_) such
that the condition in _Section 9.01(b)_ (with respect to Buyer) or the
condition in _Section 9.02(b)_ (with respect to the Company) would not be
satisfied. No notification under this _Section 7.04(b)_ shall be required

(c) The parties agree that for all purposes hereunder, the covenants contained
in _Section 7.04(a)_ and _7.04(b)_ shall not be considered for purposes of
determining whether the condition in _Section 9.01(b)_ or _Section 9.02(b)_
are satisfied.

 



      
 

 



 

7.05 _No Negotiation_. During the Interim Period, the Sellers and the Company

agents of the Sellers and the Company not to, directly or indirectly, solicit,
initiate or encourage any inquiries or proposals from, discuss or negotiate

agreement with, any Person (other than Buyer or any of its Affiliates)
relating to any merger, consolidation, business combination or similar
transaction involving the Company or Blocker or the sale of the business or
assets of the Company (excluding the sale of inventory in the ordinary course
of business) or Blocker, or the sale of any capital stock or any equity
interest of the Company of Blocker. The Company and the Sellers shall notify
Buyer of any such inquiry or proposal within 48 hours of receipt or awareness.

 



 

7.06 _Pre-Closing Financial Statements and Consents_ (a). During the Interim
Period, the Company shall deliver to Buyer within 25 days after the end of
each month a copy of the unaudited monthly financial statements of the Company
as of the end of such month and for the fiscal period then ended prepared in a
manner and containing information consistent with the Companys accounting
practices and procedures in connection with the preparation of the Interim
Financial Statements. The Company will consent, and use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain the consent of any accounting firm of the Company whose
consent is required to provide its consent, for the inclusion of the Financial
Statements and the Audited Financial Statements in any filing of Buyer
required by the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or in any bank information
memorandum, private placement memorandum or offering memorandum reasonably
requested by Buyer.

 



 

7.07 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. During the Interim Period, Sellers, Buyer and
the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions necessary to cause all of the conditions precedent to the
Companys and the Sellers obligations set forth in _Section 9.01_ and
Buyers obligations set forth in _Section 9.02_, respectively, to be
satisfied, to the extent that such partys action or inaction can control or
influence the satisfaction of such conditions. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, (a) prior to the Closing, Buyer shall file a Supplemental
Listing Application with respect to the Lion Stock Consideration and the
Contingent Shares to be issued in Lion Stock in compliance with New York Stock
Exchange rules and within the deadlines required by the New York Stock
Exchange with respect thereto and (b) at the Closing, Buyer shall cause its
transfer agent to issue to the Sellers the Lion Stock Consideration in
accordance with the terms of the Subscription Agreements.

 



 

7.08 _Blocker Covenants_. During the Interim Period, except as required by
Law, the Blocker shall not conduct any commercial business and will not own,
lease or use any asset or incur any liability or obligation of any nature
other than with respect to its ownership of the AIV Fund or otherwise in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents.

 



 

7.09 _Financing Assistance_.

 



 

(a) Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the proceeds of the
Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter
within thirty (30) days after the date hereof or, if applicable, the Extended
Closing Period, including, without limitation, using reasonable best efforts
to: (i) maintain in effect the Debt Commitment

 



      
 

 



 

Letter, (ii) promptly satisfy (or obtain the waiver of) of all conditions
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied on the
Closing Date) to obtaining the Financing set forth therein that are in Buyers
(or its Affiliates) control, (iii) enter into definitive agreements with
respect thereto on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter (including the flex provisions related to the Financing)(or
on terms no less favorable to Buyer, except as agreed by Buyer), and (iv) draw
down and consummate the Financing or any alternative financing at or prior to
the time the conditions set forth in Article IX are satisfied (or reasonably
capable of being satisfied at Closing based on the facts and circumstances).
In the event any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable, on the terms
and conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter (or on terms no less
favorable to Buyer, except as agreed by Buyer), Buyer shall promptly notify
the Company and shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain
alternative and/or supplemental financing (whether in the form of debt, equity
or other financing) from alternative sources in an amount sufficient, when
combined with the funds under other available sources, to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement promptly following the occurrence
of such event but in all cases at or prior to the then-applicable Extended
Closing Period. Upon obtaining any commitment for any such alternative and/or
supplemental financing, such financing shall be deemed to be a part of the
"Financing" and the commitment with respect thereto shall be deemed to be a
part of the "Debt Commitment Letter" for all purposes of this Agreement. Buyer
shall give the Company prompt notice of any material breach, intent not to
proceed or intent to alter the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter by any
party of the Debt Commitment Letter of which Buyer becomes aware.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its
officers, management employees and advisors (including legal and accounting)
of the Company to, provide Buyer with such cooperation and assistance as Buyer
may reasonably request in connection with Buyers financing for the
transactions contemplated hereby. For clarity, such cooperation and
assistance shall be limited to (i) assisting Buyer in the preparation of the
following with respect to information concerning the Company: customary rating
agency presentations, bank information memoranda, lender and investor
presentations, customary pro forma financial information to be included
therein, and similar documents customarily required in connection with a
financing substantially similar to the Financing, including the marketing and
syndication thereof; (ii) furnishing Buyer with such historical financial and
operating data with respect to the Company (including the unaudited balance
sheets and the related combined statements of income and cash flows for the
one-month and the twelve-month period ending January 31, 2015 (prepared
consistent with the Companys accounting practices and procedures in
connection with the preparation of the Interim Financial Statements), Audited
Financial Statements and financial and operating data for the Interim Period),
in each case, as reasonably requested by Buyer within a reasonable period of
time after Buyers request therefor; (iii) furnishing Buyer with the
documentation and other information required by any Governmental Entity under
applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and
regulations, including without limitation, the Patriot Act; (iv) consenting to
the use of its logos in connection with the Financing; and (v) participating
in a reasonable number of meetings (including meetings with prospective
lenders). For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall not be required or
requested to (1) pay any commitment or other similar fee in connection with
the Financing, (2) incur any liability in connection with the Financing, or
(3) execute or

 



      
 

 



 

approve any credit or other agreements, pledge or security documents, or other
certificates, legal opinions or other documents in connection with the
Financing. Buyer shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the
Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred by the Company in connection with the cooperation and assistance
contemplated hereby (including any fees, costs and expenses incurred by the
Company in connection with obtaining the consent of the accounting firm
pursuant to the last sentence of _Section 7.06_), whether or not the Closing
occurs. Buyer acknowledges that nothing in this _Section 7.09(b)_ shall in
any way limit Buyers obligations under this Agreement in the event of a
breach or inaccuracy of _Section 6.09_ or a breach or violation of _Section
7.09(a)_. Further, in no event will any Seller or any of its Affiliates (other
than, after the Closing, the Company) be liable to Buyer or any other Person
for any matter relating to the Financing, including any representation,
warranty, covenant, agreement, undertaking or promise made in connection with
such Financing.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each
of the Parties hereto: (i) agrees that it will not bring or support any Person
in any action, suit, proceeding, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-
party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether
in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any of the Debt Financing Sources
for any portion of the Financing (such financing sources, together with their
respective affiliates, equityholders, members, partners, officers, directors,
employees, agents, advisors and representatives involved in the financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (or, if alternative financing is
being used, pursuant to the commitments with respect thereto), the " _Debt
Financing Sources_ " and each, a " _Debt Financing Source_ ") in any way
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including, but not limited to, any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof
or the financings contemplated thereby, in any forum other than the federal
and New York state courts located in the Borough of Manhattan within the City
of New York; (ii) agrees that, except as specifically set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter, all claims or causes of action (whether at law, in equity,
in contract, in tort or otherwise) against any of the Debt Financing Sources
in any way relating to the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof
or the financings contemplated thereby, shall be exclusively governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of New York,
without giving effect to principles or rules or conflict of laws to the extent
such principles or rules would require or permit the application of laws of
another jurisdiction; and (iii) hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives
any right such party may have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation
(whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise)
directly or indirectly arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt
Commitment Letter or the performance thereof or the financings contemplated
thereby. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
(a) none of the Sellers, the Company, Blocker or Sellers Representative
(collectively, together with any of their respective successors or assigns,
the " _Seller Group_ ") shall have any rights or claims against any Debt
Financing Source, in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or in respect of any oral
representations made or alleged to have been made in connection herewith or
therewith, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the
Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof or the financings
contemplated thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise and (b) no Debt Financing Source shall have any liability (whether
in contract, in tort or otherwise)

 



      
 

 



 

to any member of the Seller Group for any obligations or liabilities of any
party hereto under this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or
by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby or in respect of any oral
representations made or alleged to have been made in connection herewith or
therewith, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the
Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof or the financings
contemplated thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the Debt Financing Sources are intended third-party beneficiaries
of, and shall be entitled to the protections of this provision and the same
shall be enforceable by each Debt Financing Source and its successors and
assigns.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VIII. 
ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS**

 



 

8.01 _Governmental Approvals and Consents._ If any consent, approval or
authorization necessary to preserve any right or benefit under any Contract to
which the Company is a party is not obtained prior to the Closing, the Sellers
shall use commercially reasonable efforts, if requested by Buyer, to cooperate
with Buyer and the Company in attempting to obtain such consent, approval or
authorization as promptly thereafter as practicable.

 



 

8.02 _Press Releases and Announcements._ Prior to the date hereof, Buyer and
Sellers Representative have worked together to develop a mutually acceptable
communications plan regarding communications concerning the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Following the execution hereof, the parties
shall issue a mutually agreeable press release concerning the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Until such press release is made, no party may
make any press release or public announcement without Sellers
Representatives and Buyers prior written consent except as required by Law.
Following the issuance of the mutually agreeable press release contemplated
above, any public announcement or similar publicity with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby that includes any
information concerning such transactions that is not included in the Initial
Press Release will be issued, if at all, at such time and in such manner as
mutually agreed to by Buyer and Sellers Representative; provided, however,
that nothing contained herein will limit Buyer from making any disclosures
that it deems necessary or advisable to be made in filings with the SEC or the
New York Stock Exchange, provided, that to the extent reasonably practicable
or permitted, Sellers Representative shall be provided a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment prior to disclosure.

 



 

8.03 _Further Assurances._ Each party to this Agreement will execute and
deliver such further instruments of transfer and take such additional actions
as any other party may reasonably request to effect, consummate, confirm or
evidence the transfer of Purchased Securities contemplated hereby and by the
other documents contemplated hereunder.

 



 

8.04 _Non-Solicitation, Non-Competition and Confidentiality_.

 



 

(a) _Non-Solicitation_. In consideration of the transactions contemplated
hereby and the payment of the Purchase Price,

 



      
 

 



 

(i) each of the Sellers listed on _Schedule 8.04(a)(i)_ agrees (on behalf of
himself, herself or itself, as applicable) that, during the period beginning
on the Closing Date and ending on the date set forth on _Schedule 8.04(a)(i)_
(the " _Restricted Period_ "), such Seller will not, and will not permit any
of its controlled Affiliates to, directly or indirectly (including by causing,
encouraging, directing or soliciting any other Person to), solicit for the
purpose of offering employment to or hiring (whether as an employee,
consultant or independent contractor) or actually hire any Protected Person;
_provided_ that generalized advertisement of employment opportunities (not
targeted at any Protected Person) shall not be deemed to cause a breach of
this _Section 8.04(a)(i)_; _provided further_ that, notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein, nothing in this Agreement shall prevent any Non-
Controlled Portfolio Company from, directly or indirectly, soliciting or
hiring (including by causing, encouraging, directing or soliciting any other
Person to do the same) the services or assistance of any employee of, or
consultant to, or independent contractor of, the Company, _provided_ that no
representative of Symmetric Capital, LLC or any Symmetric Affiliate is
directly or indirectly involved in such process (including the identification
or solicitation of such employee); and

 



 

(ii) each of the Sellers listed on _Schedule 8.04(a)(ii)_ (each a "
_Restricted Party_ ") agrees that during the applicable Restricted Period,
such Restricted Party will not, directly or indirectly (A) induce, interfere
with or solicit, or attempt to induce, interfere with or solicit, any Person
that is a current or former customer, supplier or other business relation of
the Company or any predecessor thereof into any business relationship that
would reasonably be expected to harm the Business as conducted by the Company
as of immediately prior to the Closing, or (B) in any manner engage in or own,
directly or indirectly, any interest in any business (other than Buyer) that
provides services or products to any current or former customer of the Company
that are competitive with the services or products provided by the Company to
such current or former customers. Nothing in this _Section 8.04(a)(ii)_ shall
prohibit any Restricted Party from being a passive owner of less than 3% of
any class of the outstanding capital stock of a corporation that is publicly
traded, so long as such Restricted Party has no direct or indirect
participation in the business of such corporation.

 



 

(b) _Non-Competition_. In consideration of the transactions contemplated
hereby and the payment of the Purchase Price, each Restricted Party agrees
that during the Restricted Period, such Restricted Party will not, and will
not permit any of its Affiliates to, within or with respect to the
geographical area of the United States and anywhere else the Company operates
or plans to operate as of the Closing Date (the " _Restricted Area_ "),
directly or indirectly (other than with respect to Buyer or any of its
Affiliates), own, operate, lease, manage, control, consult with, advise,
expressly permit such Restricted Partys name to be used by, provide services
for, or in any manner engage in (x) any business (including by any Restricted
Party or in association with any Person) that creates, designs, invents,
engineers, develops, sources, markets, manufactures, distributes or sells any
product or provides any service in or into the Restricted Area that may be
used as a substitute for or otherwise competes with any product or service of
the Business, the Company or its predecessors carried out during the period
commencing two years prior to the Closing Date and ending on the Closing Date,
or (y) any activity that is in competition with, the Business as conducted by
the Company as of immediately prior to the Closing. Nothing in this _Section
8.04(b)_ shall prohibit any Restricted Party from being a passive owner of
less than 3% of any class of the outstanding capital stock

 



      
 

 



 

of a corporation that is publicly traded, so long as such Restricted Party has
no direct or indirect participation in the business of such corporation.

 



 

(c) _Confidentiality_. From and after the Closing for a period of five (5)
years, each Seller will (i) treat and hold as confidential all Confidential
Information and shall refrain from using any Confidential Information except
as otherwise expressly permitted by this _Section 8.04(c)_ or, if applicable,
as reasonably required in connection with performance of such Sellers duties
as a manager, officer or employee of the Company, and (ii) deliver promptly to
Buyer or destroy, at the request of Buyer, all tangible embodiments (and all
copies) of Confidential Information which are in such Sellers possession or
under such Sellers control; _provided_ , that such Seller (A) shall be
permitted to retain a copy of the Confidential Information for the purpose of
complying with applicable Law, (B) may maintain one copy of such materials for
record retention purposes, and (C) shall not be required to destroy, delete,
or modify any secure backup tapes or other secure media made pursuant to
automated archival processes in the ordinary course of business. In the event
that any Seller is compelled by Law to disclose Confidential Information or
the fact that Confidential Information has been made available to such Seller
by the Company, such Seller agrees to provide Buyer with prompt written notice
of such request, to the extent such notice can be given, and Buyer and/or the
Company may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive
compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. If a protective order or
other remedy is not obtained, or Buyer and/or the Company waives compliance
with the provisions of this Agreement, such Seller agrees to furnish only that
portion of Confidential Information and other information that is legally
required and that such Seller will use his, her, or its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment
will be accorded to that portion of Confidential Information and other
information that is being disclosed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (I)
Confidential Information may be used by such Seller for purposes relating to
such Sellers ownership of the Company or the Blocker prior to the Closing
(including Taxes), (II) any Seller that is a Symmetric Affiliate may disclose
Confidential Information related to the performance of such Sellers direct or
indirect investment in the Company (including the Companys financial
performance prior to and as of the Closing) on a confidential basis to such
Sellers or its Affiliates partners, officers, directors, members, managers,
employees and potential investors, and (III) no Seller (or any Affiliate
thereof) will be in breach of this _Section 8.04(c)_ by reason of its use of
information of a general nature, such as general knowledge, ideas, concepts,
know-how, professional skills, work experience or techniques retained in the
memory of the Seller (or any of its Affiliates).

 



 

(d) _Remedy for Restricted Party s Breach_. Each Seller acknowledges and
agrees that in the event of a breach by such Seller of any of the provisions
of this _Section 8.04_, monetary damages may be inadequate and Buyer may have
no adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, in the event of any such breach, Buyer
and its successors or assigns may and shall be entitled, in addition to any
other rights and remedies existing in their favor, to seek to enforce their
rights and such Sellers obligations hereunder by an Action or Actions for
specific performance, injunctive and/or other relief, without any requirement
of proving actual damages or posting any bond or other security. Obtainment of
such an injunction by Buyer shall not be considered an election of remedies or
a waiver of any right by Buyer to assert any other remedies Buyer has at Law
or in equity. No waiver of any breach or violation hereof shall be implied
from the forbearance or failure by Buyer to take action hereon.

 



       
 

 



 

(e) _Modification_. If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction
declares that any term or provision of this _Section 8.04_ is invalid or
unenforceable, the parties agree that the court making the determination of
invalidity or unenforceability will have the power to reduce the scope,
duration, or area of the term or provision, to delete specific words or
phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a
term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision,
and this Agreement will be enforceable as so modified after the expiration of
the time within which the judgment may be appealed.

 



 

8.05 _Sellers  Release._

 



 

(a) Except as provided in _Section 8.05(c)_ below, as of the Closing, each
Seller on behalf of itself and any Person who may be bound by it
(collectively, the " _Releasing Parties_ "), irrevocably, unconditionally and
completely releases the Company, Buyer, and each of their respective officers,
directors, partners, members, managers, shareholders, Subsidiaries, agents,
attorneys, employees, predecessors, successors, heirs, and assigns

controversies, cross-claims, counter-claims, debts, compensatory damages,
liquidated damages, punitive or exemplary damages, other damages, claims for
costs and attorneys fees, or Liabilities of any nature whatsoever in law and
in equity, both past and present (from the beginning of the world through the

against any of the Released Parties which such Releasing Party, or any
officer, director, manager, trustee, spouse, heir, executor, administrator,
successor or assign of such Releasing Party, has or may have, which arise out
of or are connected with the Company, or any predecessor thereto (other than
those arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document), whether arising under any federal, state or local civil
or human rights law, or under any other local, state, or federal law,
regulation or ordinance, or under any public policy, contract or tort, or
under common law; or any claim for breach of contract, infliction of emotional
distress, defamation, or any claim for costs, fees, or other expenses,
including attorneys fees incurred in these matters (all of the foregoing
collectively referred to herein as such Releasing Partys " _Released Claims_
").

 



 

(b) Each Releasing Party represents that he, she or it has made no assignment
or transfer of any Released Claim. Each Releasing Party acknowledges and
intends that his, her or its execution and delivery of this release shall be
effective as a bar to each and every one of the Released Claims, and expressly
consents and agrees that this release shall be given full force and effect
according to each and all of its express terms and provisions, including those
relating to unknown and unsuspected Released Claims (notwithstanding any state
statute that expressly limits the effectiveness of a general release of
unknown, unsuspected and unanticipated Released Claims), if any, as well as
those relating to any other Released Claims hereinabove mentioned or implied.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding the release provided in this _Section 8.06_, nothing
herein shall operate to impair the rights and obligations under, or prevent
the Releasing Party from asserting any claim against (i) any Released Party
that such Releasing Party may have, if any, arising under this Agreement or
any other Transaction Document and any and all claims, rights and remedies
hereunder or thereunder, whether at law or in equity or otherwise; (ii) the

 



      
 

 



 

Company that such Releasing Party may have, if any, arising in connection with
unpaid wages, Benefit Plans or other compensation due such Releasing Party for
the portion of then-current pay period immediately prior to the Closing, (iii)
any ordinary course expense reimbursement amounts owing to any individual or
entity from the Company for expenses incurred prior to the Closing Date; or
(iv) the Company that such Releasing Party may have, if any, arising under the
certificate of formation of the Company, the LLC Agreement or any Contract
between the Releasing Party and the Company, in connection with a claim
brought against the Releasing Party by a third party in connection with the
Releasing Partys service as a manager or officer of the Company.

 



 

8.06 _Employee Benefits_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Closing for a period of at least 12 months, Buyer will
provide employees of the Company who continue to remain employed with the
Company or Buyer (or any of its Affiliates) after the Closing and the Founders
(the " _Continuing Employees_ ") with (i) an aggregate compensation
arrangement that is no less favorable than the aggregate annual compensation
paid by the Company to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the date
hereof (excluding any Sale Bonus or other compensation paid to the Continuing
Employees in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby) and (ii)
with other benefits that are substantially similar in the aggregate to the
benefits provided by the Company to such Continuing Employees immediately
prior to the date of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Subject to the consent of the applicable insurer, if the Continuing
Employees participate in any Benefit Plan of Buyer, Buyer will use
commercially reasonable efforts (including with respect to obtaining the
consent of the applicable insurer) to (i) cause any pre-existing conditions or
limitations and eligibility waiting periods under any group health plans of
Buyer or its Affiliates to be waived with respect to the Continuing Employees
and their eligible dependents to the extent not prohibited by applicable Law,
(ii) give each Continuing Employee credit for the plan year in which the
Closing occurs towards applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits
for medical expenses incurred prior to the Closing for which payment has been
made and (iii) give each Continuing Employee service credit for such
Continuing Employees employment with the Company for purposes of vesting and
eligibility but not for purposes of benefit accrual to participate under each
applicable Buyer benefit plan, as if such service had been performed with
Buyer, except to the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits. For
clarity, following the Closing, the Company will honor any accrued vacation of
the Continuing Employees as of the Closing Date.

 



 

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to (i) be treated as an
amendment of any employee benefit plan, (ii) prevent Buyer, the Company or any
of their respective Affiliates from amending or terminating any of their
benefit plans in accordance with their terms (subject to _Section 8.07(a) and
(b)_), (iii) prevent Buyer, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates,
after the Closing, from terminating the employment of any Continuing Employee,
or (iv) create any third-party beneficiary rights in any employee of the
Company, any beneficiary or dependent thereof, or any collective bargaining
representative thereof, with respect to the compensation, terms and conditions
of employment and/or benefits that may be provided to any Continuing Employee
by Buyer, the Company or any of their

 



      
 

 



 

respective Affiliates or under any benefit plan which Buyer, the Company or
any of their respective Affiliates may maintain.

expense, a six (6) year prepaid "tail" policy (the " _Tail Policy_ ") for the
existing directors and officers liability insurance maintained for the

occurring prior to the Closing. Buyer shall not, and shall not permit the
Company or any other Affiliate to, take any action to amend, modify or
terminate the Tail Policy during the term thereof.

 



 

(c) The provisions of this _Section 8.08_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and enforceable by, each Indemnified Person and such Indemnified Persons
estate, heirs and representatives, and nothing herein shall affect any
indemnification rights that any Indemnified Person or such Indemnified
Persons estate, heirs and representatives may have under any Indemnification
Document or otherwise.

 



 

(d) The obligations of the Company under this _Section 8.07_ shall continue
in full force and effect for a period commencing as of the Closing and ending

_Section 8.07_ asserted or made within such period shall continue until the
final disposition of such claim.

 



 

8.08 _Books and Records._

 



 

After the Closing until the seventh-anniversary of the Closing (or such later
date to the extent any indemnification claim hereunder remains outstanding)
Sellers Representative and its accountants, lawyers and representatives shall
be entitled at all reasonable times to have reasonable access to and to be
provided copies of the books and records and other information of the Company
and the Blocker and reasonable access to any personnel of the Company
reasonably requested by such Persons, in each case for any purpose relating to
the Sellers ownership of the Company and the Blocker prior to the Closing,
including the preparation of Tax Returns; provided, that (i) Sellers
Representative agrees that such access will give due regard to

 



      
 

 



 

minimizing interference with the operations, activities and employees of the
Company, (ii) such access and disclosure would not violate the terms of any
agreement to which Buyer or the Company is bound or violate any applicable
Law, (iii) such access and disclosure would not jeopardize any attorney-client
or other privilege, (iv) neither the Company nor Buyer shall be required to

8.09 _Blocker Name Change; Blocker Cash._

 



 

Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the acquisition of the Blocker shall not
grant to it any rights in the name "Symmetric Capital", "Symmetric Partners"
or any abbreviations or derivations thereof. Buyer shall refrain from using

Closing, change the legal name of the Blocker to a name that is not
confusingly similar to such name. To the extent not otherwise disbursed to the

 **ARTICLE XI. 
TAX MATTERS**

 



 

11.01 _Tax Matters._

 



 

The following provisions will govern the allocation of responsibility as
between Buyer and the Sellers for certain Tax matters following the Closing
Date:

 



 

(a) _Tax Indemnification_.

 



 

(i) The Members, severally, but not jointly, with respect to the Company but
not the Blocker , and the B-Fund with respect to the Blocker but not the
Company, will indemnify the Company, the Blocker and Buyer and hold them
harmless from and against, without duplication, any loss, claim, Liability,
expense, or other damage attributable to (A) all Taxes (or the non-payment
thereof) of the Company or the Blocker, as the case may be, for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period; (B) all Taxes of any Relevant Group of which the Company
or the Blocker (or any predecessor of the Company or the Blocker) is or was a
member on or prior to the Closing Date, including pursuant to Section 1.1502-6
of the Treasury Regulations or any analogous or similar state, local, or
non-U.S. Law or regulation; (C) any and all Taxes of any Person (other than
the Company or the Blocker) imposed on the Company or the Blocker as a
transferee or successor, by

 



      
 

 



 

Contract, pursuant to any law, rule, or regulation, or otherwise; and (D) all
Taxes for which the Sellers are liable pursuant to _Section 11.01(f)_.

 



 

(ii) The Members and the B-Fund, as applicable, will pay to Buyer the amount
of any Taxes which are the responsibility of the Members or the B-Fund, as the
case may be, pursuant to this _Section 11.01_ within ten Business Days before
the later of (A) the date such Taxes are payable by Buyer, the Company or the
Blocker and (B) Buyers demand for such payment from Sellers Representative.
The indemnification obligations of the Members and the B-Fund under this
_Section 11.01(a)_ shall survive until the date that is 60 days after the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.

 



 

(iii) In no event shall the Members or the Blocker Sellers be responsible
under this _Article XI_ for Taxes that are taken into account in the Net
Working Capital as of the Closing and thus accounted for in the calculation of
the Estimated Closing Cash Purchase Price or the Final Closing Cash Purchase
Price, or for Taxes for any taxable period or portion thereof beginning after
the Closing Date.

 



 

(b) _Straddle Period_. For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any
Taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (a "
_Straddle Period_ "), the amount of any real property, personal property or
other ad valorem Taxes for the Straddle Period which relates to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period will be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire
Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number
of days in the Straddle Period that occur on or before the Closing Date and
the denominator of which is the total number of days in such Straddle Period,
and the amount of other Taxes of the Company or the Blocker for a Straddle
Period which relate to the Pre-Closing Tax Period will be determined based on
an interim closing of the books as of the close of business on the Closing
Date.

 



 

(c) _Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns_.

 



 

(i) The parties intend that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
are properly characterized for U.S. federal and applicable state income tax
purposes as set forth in this _Section 11.01(c)_. The purchase by Buyer of
Membership Interests from the Members constitutes a sale or exchange of 50% or
more of the total interest in Company capital or profits, and accordingly the
taxable year of the Company will close at the end of the day on the Closing
Date pursuant to Section 708 of the Code. Buyer shall file a consolidated
federal income tax return that includes Blocker for the taxable period of the
Blocker starting with the day next following the Closing Date. Accordingly,
the taxable year of the Blocker will close for federal income Tax purposes at
the end of the day on the Closing Date. No election under Sections 336(e) or
338 of the Code (relating to stock purchases treated as asset acquisitions) or
under Reg. §1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii) (relating to ratable allocation elections)
shall be made with respect to the Blocker. Neither the Company nor the Blocker
shall engage in any transactions on the Closing Date after the Closing outside
the ordinary course of business other than the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. For income Tax purposes, (i) the payment by Buyer to the
Company pursuant to _Section 2.02(a)(ii)_ shall be treated as a payment to
the Sellers

 



      
 

 



 

as part of the consideration for the Purchased Securities and a contribution
of such payment by the Sellers to the Company as a capital contribution, (ii)
all Sale Bonuses together with the employer portion of any employment Taxes
payable in respect of the foregoing shall be deemed to have been paid by the
Company in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date and (iii) the
payments by Buyer of Sellers Expenses pursuant to _Section 2.02(a)(iv)_
shall be treated as a payment to the Sellers of an amount of cash equal to
Sellers Expenses as part of the consideration for the Purchased Securities
and a payment in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date by Sellers of
the Sellers Expenses incurred by the Sellers, and a contribution to the
capital of the Company of the Sellers Expenses incurred by the Company,
followed by the payment of such Sellers Expenses by the Company in the
taxable period ending on the Closing Date. The Sellers, the Company, the
Blocker and Buyer shall (A) treat and report the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement in all respects consistently with the provisions of this
_Section 11.01(c)_ for purposes of any federal, state, local or foreign Tax
and (B) not take any actions or positions inconsistent with the obligations of
the parties set forth herein.

 



 

(ii) The Company or the Blocker, as applicable shall prepare or cause to be
prepared all income and franchise Tax Returns of the Company, the AIV Fund and
the Blocker, respectively, for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (each such income
Tax Return a " _Pre-Closing Income Tax Return_ "), and the Members, in the
case of the Company, or the B-Fund, in the case of the Blocker, as applicable,
shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes required to be paid with respect to
such Pre-Closing Income Tax Returns in accordance with _Section
11.01(a)(ii)_. Each Pre-Closing Income Tax Return shall be prepared in a
manner consistent with the prior practice of the Company, the AIV Fund, and
the Blocker, as applicable, subject to compliance with the other provisions of
this _Section 11.01_, and, in any event, with applicable Law. The Members,
the AIV Fund, and Blocker shall report, on their respective income Tax
Return(s), any income, gain, loss, deduction or other tax items for such
periods in a manner consistent with the Schedule K-1s filed with the Pre-
Closing Income Tax Returns of the Company and the AIV Fund, as applicable.
Buyer shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Sellers Representative for
review and comment, each such Pre-Closing Income Tax Return at least forty-
five (45) days prior to the due date of such Pre-Closing Income Tax Return.
Sellers Representative shall provide written comments to Buyer within ten
(10) days of receipt of such Pre-Closing Income Tax Returns. Buyer shall make
all changes reasonably requested by Sellers Representative following which
Buyer shall cause the Company and the Blocker to provide an officer of the
Company or the Blocker, as applicable, to sign, and shall file, each such Pre-
Closing Income Tax Return. Sellers Representative shall reimburse Buyer for
any reasonable third-party costs incurred by Buyer or the Company for the
preparation of the Pre-Closing Income Tax Returns by the Boston office of
McGladrey, LLP.

 



 

(iii) Buyer will prepare or cause to be prepared, and timely file or cause to
be timely filed, all Tax Returns for the Company or the Blocker, as applicable
(other than Pre-Closing Income Tax Returns), which are due after the Closing
Date for any Tax period beginning on or before the Closing Date (each such Tax
Return, a " _Pre-Closing Period Tax Return_ "). Each such Pre-Closing Period
Tax Return shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the prior practice of
the Company or the Blocker, as applicable to the extent such practice is
consistent with the other provisions of this _Section 11.01_ and, in any
event, with applicable Law. Buyer shall submit each Pre-Closing Period Tax
Return to Sellers Representative for review and comment at least twenty (20)
days prior to the due date thereof, except where such twenty (20)-

 



      
 

 



 

day period is not practical, in which case as soon as practical after the
preparation of such Pre-Closing Period Tax Return. Within ten (10) days of
receiving a draft of such Pre-Closing Period Tax Return (except in the case of
a Pre-Closing Period Tax Return where such ten (10)-day period is not
practical, in which case as soon as practical after the receipt of such Pre-
Closing Period Tax Return), Sellers Representative shall provide written
comments to Buyer. If Buyer disagrees with the comments of Sellers
Representative, then the parties shall attempt to resolve any dispute through
good-faith negotiation and if, within seven (7) days, the parties are unable
to resolve their dispute, then they shall submit such dispute to the Neutral
Accountant for resolution in accordance with the procedures of _Section
1.03_. In no event shall the provision of comments by Sellers Representative
prevent Buyer from timely filing any such Pre-Closing Period Tax Return and,
in the event that the Neutral Accountant has not yet resolved any such dispute
prior to the deadline for filing such Pre-Closing Period Tax Return (including
any extensions), Buyer shall be entitled to file such Pre-Closing Period Tax
Return as prepared by Buyer subject to amendment to reflect the determination
of the Neutral Accountant.

 



 

(iv) All Tax refunds and overpayments relating to Taxable periods or any
portion thereof ending on or before the Closing Date, whether received in cash
or applied as a credit against a tax liability, shall be solely for the
benefit of the Members or the Blocker Sellers, as applicable, and Buyer shall
cause the same to be paid promptly to Sellers Representative when received in
cash or applied as a credit against a tax liability. Any such payment to
Sellers Representative shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price. No Pre-Closing Income Tax Return or Pre-Closing Period Tax Return shall
be amended without the prior written consent of Sellers Representative, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

 



 

(d) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. Each party hereto will, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates to, provide to each of the other parties hereto
such cooperation and information as any of them reasonably may request in
filing any Tax Return, determining a Liability for Taxes or in conducting any
audit or other Tax Proceeding. Such cooperation and information shall include
providing copies of all relevant portions of relevant Tax Returns, together
with relevant accompanying schedules and relevant work papers, relevant
documents relating to rulings or other determinations by Taxing Authorities
and relevant records concerning the ownership and Tax basis of property, which
any such party may possess. The Sellers shall turn over to Buyer copies of all
Tax Returns, schedules and work papers, and all material records and other
documents in their possession, relating to Taxes of the Company, the AIV Fund
and the Blocker. Buyer agrees that, before discarding or destroying any books
and records relating to Taxes of the Company or the Blocker, as applicable,
for any Pre-Closing Tax Period with respect to which the statute of
limitations on assessment has not expired under applicable Law (giving effect
to all extensions and waivers), Buyer shall provide Sellers Representative
with a reasonable opportunity to take possession of such books and records.

 



 

(e) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. All Tax allocation, Tax sharing, Tax indemnity
and other similar agreements and powers of attorney with respect to or
involving the Company or the Blocker in effect prior to the Closing shall be
terminated as of the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, neither the
Company nor the Blocker shall be bound thereby or have any Liability
thereunder.

 



       
 

 



 

(f) _Certain Taxes and Fees_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other similar Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording
charges and other similar fees and charges (including any penalties and
interest) incurred in connection with consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any
Taxes on or measured by income or gain) shall be paid 50% by Buyer and 50% by
the Sellers when due.

 



 

(g) _Section 754 Election_. The Members, the Blocker and Buyer agree that the
Company will make an election under Section 754 of the Code effective for the
taxable period ending on the Closing Date on the Companys United States
federal Tax Return for the period ending on the Closing Date, or if such an
election was made with respect to a prior taxable year, which election has not
been revoked or otherwise terminated as of the Closing Date, then a protective
Section 754 election shall be made on such federal Tax Return. The portion of
the Purchase Price attributable to the purchase of the Membership Interests
shall be allocated to the corresponding assets of the Company in an amount
equal to the adjusted Tax basis for each such asset as of the Closing Date and
the balance shall be allocated to goodwill.

 



 

(h) _Tax Proceedings_.

 



 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 12.05_ of this
Agreement, this _Section 11.01(h)_ shall apply to Third-Party Claims relating
to Taxes.

 



 

(ii) After the Closing, Buyer shall promptly notify Sellers Representative in
writing of any Tax assessment or the commencement of any Tax audit,
examination, or proceeding proposed by any Taxing Authority relating to Taxes
or Tax Returns of the Company or the Blocker for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a
Straddle Period (a " _Tax Proceeding_ "); provided, however, that Buyers
failure to so notify Sellers Representative shall not relieve Sellers of any
liability for any Taxes resulting from such Tax Proceeding except to the
extent that such failure materially impairs the ability of Sellers
Representative to successfully contest such Taxes.

 



 

(iii) Sellers Representative shall promptly notify Buyer in writing of any
Tax Proceeding relating to the Company. Sellers Representative will provide
Buyer with copies of all written communications between the Taxing Authority
and Sellers Representative concerning such Tax Proceeding promptly upon
receipt or dispatch of the same.

 



 

(iv) Notices required to be given by or to Buyer, the Sellers or Sellers
Representative shall include copies of any notice or other document received
from any Taxing Authority in respect of any such asserted Tax liability.

 



 

(v) In the case of a Tax Proceeding that relates to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period, or in the case of a Tax Proceeding that relates to any Straddle Period
for which Tax indemnity in an amount of more than $5,000 may be sought from
the Sellers pursuant to this Agreement or which could result in a Tax
liability in an

 



 



 



      
 

 



 

amount of more than $5,000 for any of the Sellers, Sellers Representative
shall have the right to control the conduct of such Tax Proceeding, at the
cost and the expense of the Sellers, provided, however, that Sellers
Representative shall not have the right to control any Tax Proceeding for a
Straddle Period (and Buyer shall control such Tax Proceeding) if Buyer
reasonably determines that, in the event of an adverse resolution of such Tax
Proceeding, the amount of any increase in Tax for the portion of such Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date is likely to be less than any increase in
Tax for the portion of such Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date.

 



 

(vi) Whichever of Sellers Representative and Buyer controls a Tax Proceeding
shall (A) keep the other of them fully apprised of the status of, and all
developments in (including all communications with the relevant taxing
authority concerning), such Tax Proceeding, and (B) shall afford the other of
them full opportunity to participate (at such others own expense) in the
conduct of such Tax Proceeding, including, without limitation, the right to
participate in conferences with the taxing authority and submit pertinent
supporting material; provided that, a failure by Buyer with respect to such
obligations will not relieve any Seller of any liability that it may have to
Buyer, except to the extent that Seller is materially prejudiced by such
failure. Neither Sellers Representative nor Buyer shall settle or compromise
any Tax Proceeding for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period without
prior written consent of the other of them, which consent shall not be
unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld.

 



 

(i) _Value of Basis-Step Up for Purposes of Determining the Allocation of
Consideration Among the Sellers_. Sellers Representative and Buyer agree to
assign a value to the basis step-up for Tax purposes arising from Buyers
acquisition of the Membership Interests, which value will be used solely for
purposes of allocating the consideration among the Sellers. Such assigned
value shall not be considered an agreement, admission or acknowledgement of
the value of the basis step-up for Tax purposes arising from Buyers
acquisition of the Membership Interests in the event of any disagreement or
dispute to which Buyer, the Blocker, the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates is a party.

 



 

11.02 _Treatment of Indemnification Payments._

 



 

Each party will treat all payments made pursuant to this _Article XI_ as
adjustments to the Purchase Price for all purposes.

 



 

11.03 _Other Rights and Remedies Not Affected; No Double Recovery._

 



 

The indemnification rights under this _Article XI_ are independent of and in
addition to such rights and remedies as the parties may have under _Article
XII_ for any misrepresentation, breach of warranty or failure to perform any
agreement or covenant contained in this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, none of the Buyer Indemnitees shall be entitled to (i)
a duplicative recovery for the same Loss with respect to Taxes under _Article
XI_ and _Article XII_ or (ii) a recovery for a Loss with respect to Taxes to
the extent such Taxes were included in

 



      
 

 



 

the calculation of the Estimated Closing Cash Purchase Price or the Final
Closing Cash Purchase Price.

 



 

 **ARTICLE XII. 
INDEMNIFICATION**

12.02 _Indemnification by the Sellers._

 



 

(a) From and after the Closing each Seller shall, severally in proportion to
such Sellers Pro Rata Share, and not jointly, indemnify and hold Buyer, the
Company, the Blocker and each of their respective Affiliates, Subsidiaries,
employees, agents, representatives, successors and assigns (collectively, the
" _Buyer Indemnitees_ ") harmless from and against any and all Losses
resulting from or arising out of:

 



 

(i) the breach of any representation or warranty concerning the Company set
forth in Article IV, any Schedule related thereto, or the Companys Secretary
Certificate or the certificate delivered by the Company pursuant to _Section
2.02(b)(xiv)_;

 



 

(ii) any violation by the Company of any covenant or other agreement contained
in this Agreement or any Schedule to be performed by the Company prior to the
Closing pursuant to the terms hereof or thereof;

 



 

(iii) any Sellers Expenses and any Closing Indebtedness of the Company, in
each case to the extent not included in the calculation of the Final Closing
Cash Purchase Price; or

 



      
 

 



 

(iv) any claim by or on behalf of any holder or former holder or purported
holder of Purchased Securities, in their capacity as such, with respect to any
inaccuracy or omission in the Payment Spreadsheet or any claim by any Person
that it is entitled to receive any amounts in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement other than as set forth in the Payment
Spreadsheet;

 



 

 _provided_ that the Buyer Indemnitees shall not be entitled to a duplicative
recovery for the same Loss with respect to Taxes under Articles XI and XII.

 



 

(b) From and after the Closing, each Seller is solely responsible for and
shall indemnify and hold the Buyer Indemnitees harmless from and against, any
and all Losses resulting from or arising out of: (i) any breach by such Seller
of any representation or warranty concerning such Seller contained in _Article
III_ of this Agreement or any Schedule related thereto; (ii) any violation by
such Seller of any covenant or other agreement contained in this Agreement or
any Schedule related thereto that is required to be performed by such Seller
prior to the Closing pursuant to the terms hereof or thereof; or (iii) any
violation by such Seller of any covenant or other agreement contained in this
Agreement or in any Schedule related thereto that is required to be performed
from and after the Closing pursuant to the terms hereof and thereof.

 



 

(c) From and after the Closing, the B-Fund shall indemnify and hold Buyer
Indemnitees harmless from and against any and all Losses resulting from or
arising out of: (i) any breach by the Blocker of any representation or
warranty concerning the Blocker contained in _Article V_ of this Agreement,
any Schedule related thereto or the Blockers Secretarys Certificate; (ii)
any violation by the Blocker of any covenant or other agreement contained in
this Agreement or any Schedule related thereto that is required to be
performed by the Blocker prior to the Closing pursuant to the terms hereof or
thereof; or (iii) any Indebtedness of the Blocker existing immediately prior
to the Closing not otherwise paid in full at or prior to the Closing.

 



 

(d) The Sellers shall not be liable for any Loss or Losses pursuant to
_Section 12.02(a)(i)_, _Section 12.02(a)(ii), Section 12.02(b)(i)_, _Section
12.02(b)(ii)_, _Section 12.02(c)(i)_ or _Section 12.02(c)(ii)_ (" _Buyer
Warranty Losses_ ") (other than with respect to Fundamental Representations
and Extended Exposure Representations) and no claim for Buyer Warranty Losses
shall be made (i) with respect to any single Loss (or series of related or
similar Losses) of less than $25,000, (ii) unless and until the aggregate
amount of all Buyer Warranty Losses incurred by the Buyer Indemnitees
(excluding Losses for which indemnification would not be available as a result
of clause (i) above) exceeds $2,000,000 (the " _Threshold_ "), in which case
the Sellers shall be liable for the full amount of the Buyer Warranty Losses
in excess of the Threshold, and (iii) to the extent that Buyer Warranty Losses
exceed $10,000,000 (the " _Cap_ ") in the aggregate. The Sellers shall not be
liable for any Buyer Warranty Losses with respect to breaches of the Extended
Exposure Representations to the extent that such Buyer Warranty Losses exceed
the Extended Exposure Rep Cap. The Sellers shall not be liable for any Buyer
Warranty Losses with respect to breaches of the Fundamental Representations to
the extent that such Buyer Warranty Losses exceed the Closing Cash Purchase
Price actually received by them. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitation
on Losses set forth in this _Section 12.02(d)_ shall not apply to any Losses
pursuant to _Section 12.02(a)(i)_ arising from fraud

 



      
 

 



 

related to the representations and warranties of the Company or any Losses
pursuant to _Sections 12.02(a)(iii)_ , _12.02(a)(iv)_ , _12.02(b)(iii)_ , or
_12.02(c)(iii)_ , provided that no Seller shall be liable for any Losses under
Section 12.02 or otherwise to the extent such Losses exceed the portion of the
Closing Cash Purchase Price actually received by such Seller.

 



 

(e) Buyers right to make claims under this _Article XII_ and _Section
11.01_, shall be further subject to the following limitations and conditions:

 



 

(i) None of Buyer, the Company or the Sellers may assign their rights in the
Escrow Fund or any interest therein without the prior written consent of
Buyer, the Company and Sellers Representative.

 



 

(ii) No Buyer Indemnitee shall, directly or indirectly, (A) initiate any claim
for indemnification under _Section 12.02(a)_ or _Section 11.01_ unless such
claim is brought against all of the Sellers or (B) offer to compromise any
claim for indemnification under _Section 12.02(a)_ or _Section 11.01_ unless
the same offer is made to all of the Sellers.

 



 

(iii) No claim for indemnification shall be made with respect to Losses
arising out of any breach of the representations or warranties contained in
_Article IV_ or otherwise to the extent there has been a corresponding
reduction in the calculation of the Estimated Closing Cash Purchase Price or
the Final Closing Cash Purchase Price.

 



 

(iv) Except as otherwise provided herein, no Seller shall be liable for any
Loss under _Section 12.02(a)_ or _Section 11.01_ in excess of such Sellers
Pro Rata Share of each such Loss, and the Buyer Indemnitees shall not be
entitled to recover from any Seller any claim for indemnification in an amount
greater than the Closing Cash Purchase Price actually received by such Seller
_minus_ all amounts previously paid by or on behalf of such Seller to or on
behalf of a Buyer Indemnitee pursuant to this Agreement. For purposes of the
Sellers indemnification obligations hereunder, a Sellers " _Pro Rata Share_
" shall be as set forth on the Payment Spreadsheet, it being understood and
agreed that with respect to any indemnification obligations hereunder of the
Sellers with respect to _Section 12.02(a)(i)_ for any breach of any Extended
Exposure Representation or Fundamental Representation contained in Article IV,
in each case that is not paid out of the Escrow Fund, the Pro Rata Share of
the Majority Sellers shall equal 100% of Losses subject to indemnification
under 12.02(a)(i) in excess of the Cap.

 



 

12.03 _Indemnification by Buyer._

 



 

(a) Buyer shall indemnify and hold each Seller, its Affiliates, employees,
agents, representatives, successors and assigns (the " _Seller Indemnitees_ ")
from and against any and all Losses based upon, resulting from or arising out
of:

 



 

(i) the breach of any representation or warranty by Buyer contained in this
Agreement, any Schedule related thereto, the Buyers Secretary Certificate or
the certificate delivered by Buyer pursuant to _Section 2.02(a)(vii)_;

 



 

(ii) any breach of any covenant or other agreement by Buyer contained in this
Agreement or any Schedule; and

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) any breach of any covenant or other agreement by the Company or the
Blocker contained in this Agreement, any Schedule related thereto or the
Registration Rights Agreement, in each case that is required to be performed
following the Closing.

 



 

(b) Buyer shall not be liable for any Loss or Losses pursuant to _Section
12.03(a)(i)_ or _12.03(a)(ii)_ (" _Seller Warranty Losses_ ") (other than
with respect to Extended Exposure Representations and Fundamental
Representations) (i) unless and until the aggregate amount of all Seller
Warranty Losses incurred by the Seller Indemnitees exceeds the Threshold, in
which case Buyer shall be liable for all Seller Warranty Losses including the
Threshold, and (ii) to the extent that Seller Warranty Losses exceed the Cap
in the aggregate. Buyer shall not be liable for any Seller Warranty Losses
with respect to breaches of the Extended Exposure Representations to the
extent that such Seller Warranty Losses exceed the Extended Exposure Rep Cap.
Buyer shall not be liable for any Seller Warranty Losses with respect to
Fundamental Representations to the extent that such Seller Warranty Losses
exceed $105,000,000. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitation on Losses
set forth in this _Section 12.03(b)_ shall not apply to any Losses pursuant
to _Section 12.03(a)(i)_ arising from fraud related to the representations
and warranties of Buyer or any Losses pursuant to _Section 12.03(a)(iii)_.

 



 

12.04 _Time Limitations; Extended Exposure Rep Cap._

 



 

(a) No claim for breach of any representation or warranty, or any covenant or
agreement to be performed prior to, or as of the Closing shall be brought
after the applicable date set forth in _Section 12.01_, except for any claim
(i) of which the Buyer Indemnitee notifies Sellers Representative of a claim
(specifying the factual basis of the claim in reasonable detail to the extent
known by such Buyer Indemnitee and a good faith estimation of the Losses with
respect thereto) on or before the expiration date of the applicable survival
period set forth in _Section 12.01_ that relates to the alleged breached
representation, warranty or covenant in question, (ii) of which the Seller
Indemnitee notifies Buyer of a claim (specifying the factual basis of the
claim in reasonable detail to the extent known by such Seller Indemnitee and a
good faith estimation of the Losses with respect thereto) on or before the
expiration date of the applicable survival period set forth in _Section
12.01_ that relates to the alleged breached representation, warranty or
covenant in question, or (iii) that is brought by an Indemnitor during the
Response Period as a counterclaim to a claim brought in accordance with the
preceding clauses (i) or (ii).

 



 

(b) If an Indemnitee delivers to an Indemnitor, before expiration of a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, a proper notice of claim for
indemnification in accordance with the terms of this Agreement based upon a
breach of such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, then the
applicable representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall survive
until, but only for purposes of, the final resolution of the matter covered by
such notice.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Extended Exposure Rep
Cap with respect to the Sellers shall decrease over time such that if a claim
for breach of an Extended Exposure Representation is brought by a Buyer
Indemnitee in accordance with the provisions of Article XII,

 



      
 

 



 

(i) from and after the Closing and prior to the one-year anniversary of the
Closing Date, the Extended Exposure Rep Cap for all such claims made during
such period is $45,000,000 _minus_ all Buyer Warranty Losses for which the
Sellers are liable pursuant to _Section 12.02(a)(i) and (a)(ii)_ and which
are paid prior to the one-year anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Year 1
Amount_ ");

 



 

(ii) from and after the one-year anniversary of the Closing Date and prior to
the two-year anniversary of the Closing Date, the Extended Exposure Rep Cap
for all such claims made during such period shall be the Year 1 Amount _minus_
the greater of (x) $7,500,000 or (y) all Buyer Warranty Losses for which the
Sellers are liable pursuant to _Section 12.02(a)(i) and (a)(ii)_ and which
are paid from and after the one-year anniversary of the Closing Date and prior
to the two-year anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Year 2 Amount_ ");

 



 

(iii) from and after the two-year anniversary of the Closing Date and prior to
the three-year anniversary of the Closing Date, the Extended Exposure Rep Cap
for all such claims made during such period shall be the Year 2 Amount _minus_
the greater of (x) $7,500,000 or (y) all Buyer Warranty Losses for which the
Sellers are liable pursuant to _Section 12.02(a)(i) and (a)(ii)_ and which
are paid from and after the two-year anniversary of the Closing Date and prior
to the three-year anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Year 3 Amount_ ");

 



 

(iv) from and after the three-year anniversary of the Closing Date and prior
to the four-year anniversary of the Closing Date, the Extended Exposure Rep
Cap for all such claims made during such period shall be the Year 3 Amount
_minus_ the greater of (x) $7,500,000 or (y) all Buyer Warranty Losses for
which the Sellers are liable pursuant to _Section 12.02(a)(i) and (a)(ii)_
and which are paid from and after the three-year anniversary of the Closing
Date and prior to the four-year anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Year 4
Amount_ ");

 



 

(v) from and after the four-year anniversary of the Closing Date and prior to
the five-year anniversary of the Closing Date, the Extended Exposure Rep Cap
for all such claims made during such period shall be the Year 4 Amount _minus_
the greater of (x) $7,500,000 or (y) all Buyer Warranty Losses for which the
Sellers are liable pursuant to _Section 12.02(a)(i) and (a)(ii)_ and which
are paid from and after the four-year anniversary of the Closing Date and
prior to the five-year anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Year 5 Amount_
"); and

 



 

(vi) from and after the five-year anniversary of the Closing Date and prior to
the six-year anniversary of the Closing Date, the Extended Exposure Rep Cap
for all such claims made during such period shall be the Year 5 Amount _minus_
the greater of (x) $7,500,000 or (y) all Buyer Warranty Losses for which the
Sellers are liable pursuant to _Section 12.02(a)(i) and (a)(ii)_ and which
are paid from and after the five-year anniversary of the Closing Date and
prior to the six-year anniversary of the Closing Date;

 



 

In determining the applicable Extended Exposure Rep Cap at any given time
applicable to any claim made for any breach of an Extended Exposure
Representation, the measurement date shall be the date on which a Notice of
Claim is received by Sellers Representative with respect thereto. For the
avoidance of doubt, the aggregate liability of the Sellers with respect to all
breaches of the Extended Exposure Representations shall never exceed an amount
equal to (x) $45,000,000, _minus_ (y) any Buyer Warranty Losses for which the
Sellers are liable pursuant to

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 12.02(a)(i) and (a)(ii)_ (other than any Buyer Warranty Loss for
which the Sellers are liable arising from any breach of any Extended Exposure
Representation). With respect to the Extended Exposure Rep Cap applicable to
claims brought by a Seller Indemnitee against Buyer, the provisions of this
_Section 12.04(c)_ shall apply _mutatis mutandis_.

 



 

12.05 _Indemnification Procedures for Third-Party Claims._

 



 

(a) In the event that an Indemnitee receives notice of the assertion of any
claim or the commencement of any Action by a third party in respect of which
indemnification may be sought under the provisions of this _Article XII_ ("
_Third-Party Claim_ "), the Indemnitee shall promptly notify the Indemnitor in
writing (" _Notice of Claim_ ") of such Third-Party Claim. Failure or delay in
notifying the Indemnitor will not relieve the Indemnitor of any liability it
may have to the Indemnitee, except and only to the extent that such failure or
delay causes actual harm to or otherwise prejudices the Indemnitor with
respect to such Third-Party Claim. The Notice of Claim shall set forth the
amount, if known, or, if not known, a good faith estimate of the foreseeable
amount of claimed Losses (which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final
amount of such Losses) and a description in reasonable detail of the basis for
such Third-Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of any
claim for indemnification hereunder by or against one or more Seller(s),
Sellers Representative shall act on behalf of such Seller(s) for the purposes
of this _Section 12.05_ and any actions taken (or not taken) by Sellers
Representative on behalf of any such Seller shall be binding on such Seller as
an Indemnitor or Indemnitee, as the case may be, hereunder. All notices to any
Seller under this _Section 12.05_ may be provided by Buyer to Sellers
Representative in lieu of providing such notice to any specific Seller.

 



 

(b) Subject to the further provisions of this _Section 12.05_, the Indemnitor
will have sixty (60) days from the date on which the Indemnitor receives the
Notice of Claim (the " _Response Period_ ") to notify the Indemnitee that the
Indemnitor wishes to assume the defense or prosecution of such Third-Party
Claim and any litigation resulting therefrom with counsel of its choice
(reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee) (a " _Third-Party Defense_ "). The
Indemnitee will reasonably cooperate with the Indemnitor during such Response
Period (including providing such information and documents relating to such
Third-Party Claim as the Indemnitor may reasonably request) as Indemnitor
determines whether it wishes to assume such Third-Party Defense. Further,
during the Response Period, the Indemnitor and Indemnitee shall reasonably
cooperate with one another with respect to any answers, filings, notices or
responses required with respect to such Third Party Claim, and the Indemnitee
shall not make any material admission of any legal liability, fault or
wrongdoing in connection with such matter. If the Indemnitor assumes the Third
Party Defense in accordance with the preceding sentence, the Indemnitor shall
be conclusively deemed to have acknowledged that the Third Party Claim is
within the scope of its indemnity obligation hereunder and shall hold the
Indemnitee harmless from and against the full amount of any Losses resulting
therefrom (subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including
the limitations set forth herein). Any Indemnitee shall have the right to
employ separate counsel, at its own expense, in any such Third-Party Defense
and to participate therein.

 



 

(c) The Indemnitor will not be entitled to assume the Third-Party Defense if:

 



      
 

 



 

(i) the Third-Party Claim seeks, in addition to or in lieu of monetary
damages, any injunctive or other equitable relief (except where such non-
monetary relief is merely incidental to a primary claim or claims for monetary
damages);

 



 

(ii) the Third-Party Claim relates to or arises in connection with any
criminal Proceeding, Action, indictment, allegation or investigation;

 



 

(iii) the Third-Party Claim relates to or arises in connection with any Action
relating to Environmental Requirements;

 



 

(iv) the Third-Party Claim seeks monetary damages in excess of the limitations
set forth in this Agreement;

 



 

(v) under applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict on any
significant issue exists between the Indemnitee and the Indemnitor in respect
of the Third-Party Claim;

 



 

(vi) the Indemnitor has failed or is failing to vigorously prosecute or defend
such Third-Party Claim; or

 



 

(vii) the Indemnitor fails to provide reasonable assurance at the time of the
assumption to the Indemnitee of its financial capacity to prosecute the Third
Party Defense and provide indemnification in accordance with the provisions of
this Agreement.

 



 

(d) If by reason of a Third-Party Claim in respect of which the Indemnitor is
liable for any indemnification hereunder, a Lien, attachment, garnishment or
execution is placed upon any of the property or assets of the Indemnitee, the
Indemnitor, if it desires to exercise its right to assume such Third Party
Defense, must furnish a satisfactory indemnity bond to obtain the prompt
release of such Lien, attachment, garnishment or execution.

 



 

(e) If the Indemnitor assumes a Third-Party Defense, it will take reasonably
necessary steps in the defense, prosecution, or settlement of such claim or
litigation and will hold all Indemnitees harmless from and against all Losses
caused by or arising out of such Third-Party Claim for which the Indemnitor is
liable pursuant to the terms and conditions of this _Article XII_, subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the limitations set forth
herein. Further, the Indemnitor will not consent to the entry of any judgment
or enter into any settlement on behalf of the Indemnitee except with the
written consent of the Indemnitee (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , that the consent of the Indemnitee shall
not be required if all of the following conditions are met: (i) the terms of
the judgment or proposed settlement include as an unconditional term thereof
the giving to the Indemnitee(s) by the third party of a release of the
Indemnitee(s) from all liability in respect of such Third-Party Claim, (ii)
there is no finding or admission of any violation of Law by the Indemnitees
(or any Affiliate thereof), and (iii) the primary form of relief is monetary
damages which are paid in full by the Indemnitor. The Indemnitor shall conduct
the defense of the Third-Party Claim actively and diligently, and the
Indemnitee will provide reasonable cooperation in the defense of the Third-
Party Claim. So long as the Indemnitor is reasonably conducting the Third-
Party Defense in good faith, the Indemnitee will not consent to the entry of
any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third-Party
Claim, nor will the

 



      
 

 



 

Indemnitee take any action with respect to such Third-Party Claim or the
defense thereof without the prior written consent of the Indemnitor (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Indemnitee shall have the right to pay or settle any such Third-Party
Claim; _provided_ , that in such event it shall waive any right to
indemnification therefor by the Indemnitor for such claim unless the
Indemnitor shall have consented in writing to such payment or settlement.

 



 

(f) In the event that (i) an Indemnitee gives Notice of Claim to the
Indemnitor and the Indemnitor fails or elects not to assume a Third-Party
Defense which the Indemnitor had the right to assume under this _Section
12.05_, or (ii) the Indemnitor is not entitled to assume the Third-Party
Defense pursuant to this _Section 12.05_, the Indemnitee shall defend,
conduct and control the Third-Party Defense, with counsel of its choice,
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the limitations set
forth herein at the Indemnitees sole cost and expense unless prompt written
notice of such Third-Party Claim was not provided to the Indemnitee by the
Indemnitor. In each case, the Indemnitee shall conduct the Third-Party Defense
actively and diligently and any Indemnitor shall have the right to employ
separate counsel, at its own expense, in any such Third-Party Defense and to
participate therein, and the Indemnitee shall keep the Indemnitor reasonably
informed of the progress of any such Third-Party Defense. Further, the
Indemnitee will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement with respect to such Third-Party Claim except with the written
consent of the Indemnitor (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed); _provided_ , that the consent of the Indemnitor shall not be
required if all of the following conditions are met: (A) the terms of the
judgment or proposed settlement include as an unconditional term thereof the
giving to the Indemnitor(s) by the third party of a release of the Indemnitor
from all liability in respect of such Third-Party Claim, (B) there is no
finding or admission of any violation of Law by the Indemnitor (or any
Affiliate thereof) and (C) the primary form of relief is monetary damages
which are paid in full by the Indemnitee (subject to Indemnitees rights to
seek indemnification pursuant to this Article XII, subject to the limitations
with respect thereto, for any such amounts paid).

to cooperate and to cause its employees to cooperate with and assist the
Indemnitee or the Indemnitor, as the case may be, in connection with any
Third-Party Defense, including attending conferences, discovery proceedings,
hearings, trials and appeals and furnishing records, information and
testimony, as may reasonably be requested; _provided_ that each party shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts, in respect of any Third-Party Claim
of which it has assumed the defense, to preserve the confidentiality of all
Confidential Information and the attorney-client and work-product privileges.

 



 

12.06 _Indemnification Procedures for Non-Third-Party Claims._

 



 

(a) In the event of a claim that does not involve a Third-Party Claim being
asserted against him, her or it, the Indemnitee shall send a Notice of Claim
to the Indemnitor. The Notice of Claim shall set forth the amount, if known,
or, if not known, a good faith estimate of the amount of claimed Losses (which
estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such Losses) and a
description in reasonable detail of the basis for such claim. The Indemnitor
will have 30 days from receipt of such Notice of Claim to dispute the claim
and

 



      
 

 



 

will reasonably cooperate and assist the Indemnitee in determining the
validity of the claim for indemnification. During such 30-day period, the
Indemnitee shall allow the Indemnitor and its professional advisors to
investigate the matter or circumstance alleged to give rise to the claim, and
whether and to what extent any amount is payable in respect of the claim and
the Indemnitee shall provide such information, documentation and access to its
senior level employees with respect thereto, as the Indemnitor or any of its
professional advisors may reasonably request. If the Indemnitor does not give
written notice to the Indemnitee that it disputes such claim within 30 days
after its receipt of the Notice of Claim, the claim specified in such Notice
of Claim will be conclusively deemed a Loss subject to indemnification
hereunder (and the limits set forth herein). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Sellers Representative shall act on behalf of the Sellers for the purposes of
this _Section 12.06_ and any actions taken (or not taken) by Sellers
Representative on behalf of any Seller(s) shall be binding on such Seller(s)
as an Indemnitor or Indemnitee, as the case may be, hereunder. All notices to
any Seller under this _Section 12.06_ may be provided by Buyer to Sellers
Representative in lieu of providing such notice to any specific Seller.

 



 

(b) In the event that (i) any pending claim for indemnification pursuant to
_Section 12.06(a)_ has not been resolved by the later of (A) the 24-month
anniversary of the date of this Agreement and (B) 90 days after the date on
which the amount of Losses sought to be indemnified pursuant to such pending
claim are reasonably known and determinable (the " _Outside Indemnification
Date_ ") and (ii) Buyer has not commenced a cause of action in court with
respect to such pending claim in accordance with _Section 12.05_ (whether
before, on or after the Outside Indemnification Date), Sellers Representative
shall have the right (but not the obligation) pursuant to the procedures set
forth in this _Section 12.06(b)_ to seek an expedited determination of
whether a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement has
occurred or is continuing and/or the effect of such breach on the obligations
of the indemnifying party (including the amount of the Losses, if any,
associated therewith) and/or the rights of the indemnified party hereunder. At
Sellers Representatives written election, the parties shall submit such
dispute or controversy to binding arbitration in Wilmington, Delaware under
the then effective JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the "
_JAMS Rules_ "); each party shall bear its own costs and shall pay one-half of
the fees and expenses of the Arbitrator in connection with any such
arbitration. Such arbitration shall be initiated by written notice by Sellers
Representative to Buyer and delivery to JAMS pursuant to the JAMS Rules. Buyer
and Sellers Representative each shall select one independent arbitrator
expert in the subject matter of the dispute, as determined in the sole
discretion of the selecting party. Such arbitrators shall select a third
independent arbitrator expert in the subject matter of the dispute, as
determined in the sole discretion of the initial two arbitrators, and the
three arbitrators so selected shall resolve the matter according to the
procedures set forth in this _Section 12.06(b)_ (collectively, the "
_Arbitrator_ "). The arbitration determination shall be in writing and shall
specify the factual and legal basis for the determination. The determination
rendered by the Arbitrator shall be final and binding. It is the intent of the
parties that any arbitration shall be concluded as quickly as reasonably
practicable. The Arbitrator shall use commercially reasonable efforts to issue
a final determination within a period of twenty (20) Business Days after
closure of the proceedings. Failure of the Arbitrator to meet the time limits
of this _Section 12.06(b)_ shall not be a basis for challenging the
determination. Judgment on the Arbitrators determination may be entered in
any court having jurisdiction. This clause shall not preclude parties from
seeking provisional

 



      
 

 



 

remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction or any
other remedy permitted by _Section 12.12_. Neither Buyer nor any Affiliate of
Buyer shall commence any cause of action against the indemnifying party with
respect to the claim that is the subject of the arbitration initiated pursuant
to this _Section 12.06(b)_ during the pendency of such arbitration or after
the resolution thereof.

 



 

12.07 _Determination of Losses._

 



 

Losses for which any Indemnitor has liability hereunder shall be determined by
a final, non-appealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction, by
arbitration pursuant to the terms of _Section 12.06_, by written agreement of
Buyer and Sellers Representative or as otherwise expressly set forth in
_Article XI_, _Section 12.05(a)_ and _Section 12.06(b)_. In determining the
amount of any Losses for which a Buyer Indemnitee is entitled to assert a
claim for indemnification hereunder, the amount of any such Losses shall be
determined after deducting therefrom the amount of any insurance proceeds
(after giving effect to any applicable deductible or retention and expenses
incurred by the Buyer Indemnitee in connection with recovering such insurance
proceeds) and recoveries from other third parties, in each case, actually
received by the Buyer Indemnitee and the Company in respect of such Losses
(which proceeds and recoveries Buyer agrees to use commercially reasonable
efforts to pursue and obtain) and the amount of any refund of Taxes paid (or
reduction in the amount of Taxes which otherwise would have been paid) with
respect to the taxable year during which the event giving rise to a claim
under _Article XI_ or _Article XII_ occurred or the taxable year in which
payment under _Article XI_ or _Article XII_ was made, as result of a
deduction or credit resulting from such event or payment, or, in each case,
the immediately succeeding taxable year (assuming for this purpose that any
such deduction or credit was treated as the last item used in calculating such
Taxes). If an indemnification payment is received by a Buyer Indemnitee, and
any Buyer Indemnitee or the Company later receives insurance proceeds, other
third-party recoveries or Tax benefit as described in the prior sentence in
respect of the related Losses, Buyer or the Company shall as promptly as
practicable pay to Sellers Representative, for the benefit of the Sellers, a
sum equal to the lesser of (a) the actual amount of such insurance proceeds,
third-party recoveries or Tax benefits or (b) the actual amount of the
aggregate indemnification payments previously paid by any Seller or Sellers
Representative, on behalf of the Sellers, with respect to such Losses. All
parties shall use commercially reasonably efforts to mitigate the amount of
Losses for which they may be entitled to indemnification hereunder.

 



 

12.08 _Effect of Investigation; Waiver; Materiality._

 



 

(a) An Indemnitees right to indemnification hereunder based upon any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Indemnitor will not be
affected by any investigation (including any environmental investigation or
assessment) conducted, any knowledge acquired at any time (whether obtained
prior to or after the Closing Date), or any waiver by the Indemnitee of any
condition, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of any representation or
warranty of, or compliance with, such representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement. The representations and warranties and indemnification rights
associated therewith are meant to allocate risk among the parties, and,
therefore, any investigation by such party shall be for its own protection
only and shall not affect or impair any right or remedy hereunder.

 



       
 

 



 

(b) Each Seller acknowledges and agrees that, upon and following the Closing,
neither the Company nor the Blocker shall have any Liability or obligation to
indemnify or hold harmless or otherwise pay, reimburse or make any Seller
whole for or on account of any indemnification or other claims made by any
Buyer Indemnitee hereunder. No Seller will have a right of contribution,
indemnification, claim under the Companys or the Blockers (as the case may
be) organizational documents, or any other form of remuneration against the
Company in respect of such indemnification, except as provided in _Section
8.08_.

 



 

(c) For purposes of calculating the amount of Losses resulting from or arising
out of any breach of such representation or warranty for which indemnification
would be available under Section 12.02(a)(i) or 12.03(a)(i) and for
determining whether any such breach exists, such representations and
warranties, any Schedule related thereto, the Companys Secretary Certificate
or the Buyers Secretarys Certificate shall be deemed to have been made
without any qualifications as to materiality and, accordingly, all references
herein and therein to "material," "in all material respects," "Material
Adverse Effect" and similar qualifications as to materiality shall be deemed
to be deleted therefrom; provided that this Section 12.08(c) shall not apply (
_i.e._ , such qualifiers shall not be disregarded for purposes of) to the
following: Section 4.05, Section 4.06, Section 4.07(a), Section 4.08, Section
4.09(a) and (c), Section 4.11 (in the phrase " any other information
technology software or systems material to the operation of the Business "),
Section 4.15(k), Section 4.23, Section 4.28(b) (last sentence only), Section
4.29(b) (last sentence only), Section 4.32 (first sentence only), Section
6.07, or the definition of any capitalized terms (such as "Material Contract",
"Material Supplier", "Material Third-Party Payor" or "Material Adverse
Effect").

 



 

12.09 _Subrogation_.

 



 

Upon any indemnification payment to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement, the
Sellers Representative shall be entitled to exercise, and shall be subrogated
to, any rights and remedies (including rights of indemnity, rights of
contribution and other rights of recovery) that Buyer or any of its Affiliates
may have against any insurer or other Person in respect of Losses to which
such payment relates, except to the extent that the pursuit of any such
remedies via subrogation against any non-insurer would materially and
adversely affect the Company, __provided__ that the Sellers Representative
shall be fully subrogated to any rights and remedies that Buyer might have
with respect to any indemnification payment made on account of an Extended
Exposure Representation without regard to such exception. Buyer shall execute
all instruments as the Sellers Representative may reasonably request for the
purpose of enabling the Sellers Representative to perfect or exercise the
right of subrogation of the Sellers Representative under this _Section
12.09_.

 



 

12.10 _Setoff Rights._

 



 

Subject in all instances to _Section 12.13_, upon written notice to Sellers
Representative specifying in reasonable detail the basis therefor (including
and providing for a cure period (if curable) of at least ten Business Days),
if a Seller has not satisfied any indemnification obligation conclusively owed
by him, her or it hereunder (absent no fault of Buyer), Buyer may set off the
indemnification amount to which Buyer is entitled from such Seller against the
Contingent Payment otherwise payable by Buyer to -such Seller under Section
1.04 of this Agreement. Any

 



      
 

 



 

Contingent Consideration subject to setoff hereunder shall be valued based on
the average of the closing price of Lion Stock on the New York Stock Exchange
for the ten trading days ending on the last day of such cure period. Neither
the exercise of, nor the failure to exercise such right of setoff will
constitute an election of remedies or limit Buyer in any manner in the
enforcement of any other remedies against such Seller that may be available to
Buyer.

 



 

12.11 _Treatment of Indemnification Payments._

 



 

Each party will treat all payments made pursuant to this _Article XII_ as
adjustments to the Purchase Price for all purposes to the extent allowed by
applicable Law.

 



 

12.12 _Exclusive Remedy._

 



 

All representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this
Agreement are contractual in nature only and subject to the sole and exclusive
remedies set forth herein. The remedies provided in _Article XI_ and this
_Article XII_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Buyer
Indemnitees and the Seller Indemnitees and their respective heirs, successors
and assigns after the Closing with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including any breach or non-performance of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein.
Following the Closing, no Buyer Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee shall bring
any claim with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, other than (i) a claim of
fraud against the party that committed such fraud, (ii) an indemnification
claim made by Buyer on behalf of the Buyer Indemnitees in accordance with
_Section 12.02(a)_, (iii) an indemnification claim made by Buyer on behalf of
the Buyer Indemnitees against a particular Seller in accordance with _Section
12.02(b_), (iv) an indemnification claim made by Buyer on behalf of the Buyer
Indemnitees against a particular Blocker Seller in accordance with _Section
12.02(c)_, (v) an indemnification claim made by Sellers Representative on
behalf of Seller Indemnitees against Buyer in accordance with _Section 12.03_
or (vi) a claim made by Buyer on behalf of the Buyer Indemnitees or made by
Sellers Representative on behalf of Seller Indemnitees for equitable relief
in accordance with _Section 8.4(d)_ or _Section 15.17_. The provisions of
this _Article XII_ constitute an integral part of the consideration given by
Buyer pursuant to this Agreement and were specifically bargained for and
reflected in the total amount of the Purchase Price payable in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby. For the avoidance of doubt, noting in
this _Section 12.12_ shall limit or impair any rights of a Seller from and
after the Closing as a stockholder of Buyer.

 



 

12.13 _Payment of Indemnification_.

 



 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Article XII_, any
indemnification obligations of a Seller to the Buyer Indemnitees pursuant to
_Section 12.02(a)_ must first be drawn from such Sellers Pro Rata Share of
the Escrow Fund. Thereafter, subject to _Section 12.02(e)(iv)_, each Seller
will be solely liable, severally but not jointly, for its Pro Rata Share of
any remaining indemnification obligations to the Buyer Indemnitees pursuant to
this Agreement, subject to the limitations contained herein.

 



      
 

 



 

12.14 _No Other Representations or Warranties; Independent Investigation_.

 



 

(a) Buyer represents, warrants, covenants and agrees, on behalf of itself and
the other Buyer Indemnitees, as follows:

 



 

(i) None of the Company, Sellers Representative, any of the Sellers or any of
their respective Affiliates, members, managers, investors, partners,
stockholders, directors, officers, employees or advisors have made, nor has
any Buyer Indemnitee relied on, any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement, express or implied, with respect to the Company, the Blocker, the
Business, the transactions contemplated hereby or the accuracy or completeness
of any information furnished or made available to Buyer or any of its
Affiliates, other than those representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements explicitly set forth in this Agreement, the Companys Secretarys
Certificate, the Blockers Secretarys Certificate or the certificate
delivered pursuant to _Section 2.02(b)(xv)_.

 



 

(ii) Without limiting the generality of _Section 12.12(a)_, Buyer agrees that
no representation or warranty, express or implied, is made with respect to any
financial projections or budgets that have been provided or otherwise made
available to Buyer or its lending sources for the Financing, and neither Buyer
nor any of its Affiliates or financing sources has relied upon any
representation or warranty, express or implied, with respect to any
projections, forecasts, budgets or other forward looking statements concerning
the Company or the Business.

 



 

(iii) Buyer (i) is a sophisticated party and understands the merits and risks
of consummating the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) has been given
adequate access to such information about the Company, the Blocker and the
Business as Buyer has requested, and (iii) has made its own investigation
into, and based thereon has formed an independent judgment concerning, the
Company, the Blocker and the Business.

 



 

(b) Each Seller represents, warrants, covenants and agrees, on behalf of
itself and not on behalf of any other Person that none of Buyer or any of its
respective Affiliates, members, managers, investors, partners, stockholders,
directors, officers, employees or advisors have made, nor has such Seller or
any of its Affiliates relied on, any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement, express or implied, with respect to Buyer, the transactions
contemplated hereby or the accuracy or completeness of any information
furnished or made available to such Seller or any of its Affiliates, other
than those representations, warranties, covenants and agreements explicitly
set forth in this Agreement or any certificate delivered by the Company in
connection herewith. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither
such Seller nor any of its Affiliates has relied upon any representation or
warranty, express or implied, with respect to any projections, forecasts,
budgets or other forward looking statements concerning Buyer.

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE XIII. 
SELLERS REPRESENTATIVE**

 



 

13.01 _Designation._

 



 

Symmetric Capital, LLC (" _Sellers  Representative_") is hereby designated by

(a) _Authority_. Each of the Sellers, by the execution of this Agreement,
hereby irrevocably appoints Sellers Representative as the agent, proxy and

hereunder to such Seller and each other Seller, (iii) to execute such further
instruments of assignment as Buyer shall reasonably request, (iv) to execute

indemnification referred to herein or the Escrow Agreement, including, without
limitation, the power to compromise on behalf such Seller of any claim made by
such Seller, to bring, respond to, and transact matters of litigation, (viii)
to execute and deliver on behalf of each Seller all ancillary agreements,
certificates, statements, notices, approvals, extensions, waivers,
undertakings, amendments and other documents Sellers Representative deems
appropriate in connection with responding to, compromising or settling any
claims made by a Seller, (ix) to receive funds for, and cause the disbursement
of funds from, the Escrow Fund, and (x) to do or refrain from doing each and
every act and exercise any and all rights which such Seller or the Sellers
collectively are permitted or required to do or exercise under this Agreement.
Each of the Sellers agrees that such agency and proxy are coupled with an
interest, are therefore irrevocable without the consent of Sellers
Representative and shall survive the death, incapacity, bankruptcy,
dissolution or liquidation of any Seller. All decisions and actions by
Sellers Representative (to the extent authorized by this Agreement) shall be
binding upon all of the Sellers, and no Seller shall have the right to object,
dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same. Each Seller agrees that Buyer
shall be entitled to rely on any action taken by Sellers Representative, on
behalf of such Seller, pursuant to this _Section 13.02_ (an " _Authorized
Action_ "), and that each Authorized Action shall be binding on each Seller as
fully as if such Seller had taken such Authorized Action. Sellers
Representative shall not be liable to any Seller for any error of judgment, or
any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken, under this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement. Sellers Representative may consult with legal counsel,
independent public accountants or other experts selected by him, her, or it
and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good
faith by him, her or it in accordance with the advice of such counsel,
accountants or experts. By executing and delivering this Agreement, each
Seller agrees that it shall indemnify (based on its Pro Rata Share) and hold
Sellers Representative harmless from any and all liability, loss, cost,
damage or expense (including attorneys fees) reasonably incurred or suffered
as a result of the performance of his, her, or its duties under this
Agreement, except such that arises from the gross negligence, willful
misconduct or fraud of Sellers Representative.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Successor_. Within 15 days after the death, incapacity or resignation of
Sellers Representative, or his, her, or its successor as Sellers
Representative, a majority-in-interest of the holders of the Companys
membership interests immediately prior to the Closing shall appoint a
successor Sellers Representative (for this purpose, treating the Blocker
Sellers as if they held their indirect interests in the Company directly).

 



 

13.03 _Sellers  Representative Expense Fund._

 



 

Sellers Representative shall use the Sellers Representative Expense Fund to
(a) make any payments required to be made for the account of the Sellers
pursuant to this Agreement, (b) pay any Sellers Expenses not otherwise paid
at the Closing and (c) pay all costs and expenses incurred by or on behalf of
Sellers Representative, in its capacity as such, including all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with any pending or threatened dispute or
claim with respect to this Agreement or any other Transaction Document or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. In the event the fees and
expenses incurred by Sellers Representative in performing its duties under
this Agreement and the ancillary agreements contemplated hereby exceed the
Sellers Representative Expense Fund, the excess amount shall be the
responsibility of the Sellers. The Sellers Representative Expense Fund shall
be held by Sellers Representative in a segregated bank account. The Sellers
Representative Expense Fund shall be held or disbursed, in whole or in part,
as determined by Sellers Representative; provided that Sellers
Representative shall retain or cause to be retained in the Sellers
Representative Expense Fund an amount equal to at least $2,000,000 until such
time as the Sellers have no obligation to pay any amounts pursuant to Section
1.03(f) hereof. The retention by Sellers Representative of any amounts in the
Sellers Representative Expense Fund shall not be used as evidence that the
Sellers have any liability hereunder. Any amounts received by Sellers
Representative, in its capacity as such, including any amounts released from
the Escrow Fund, may be used at Sellers Representatives discretion to
increase the Sellers Representative Expense Fund. If Sellers Representative
determines to release all or a portion of the Sellers Representative Expense
Fund, such amounts shall be distributed to the Sellers in accordance with
Section 1.06(a). For tax purposes, the Sellers Representative Expense Fund
shall be treated as having been received and voluntarily set aside by the
Sellers at the Closing.

respect to this Agreement. This Agreement may be amended or terminated, and
any provision of this Agreement may be waived, without the consent of any
Person who is not a party to the Agreement.

 



 

15.15 _Schedules._

 



 

The representations and warranties contained in _Article III_, _Article IV_,
_Article V_ and _Article VI_ are qualified by reference to the Disclosure
Schedules. The parties hereto agree that the Disclosure Schedules are not
intended to constitute, and shall not be construed as constituting,
representations or warranties of the Company, the Sellers, the Blocker or
Buyer except as and to the extent expressly provided in this Agreement. Each
party acknowledges that (a) the Disclosure Schedules may include items or
information that the other parties are not

 



      
 

 



 

required to disclose under this Agreement, (b) inclusion of information in the
Disclosure Schedules shall not be construed as an admission that such
information is material to the Company, the Sellers, the Blocker or Buyer, (c)
headings have been inserted on the individual Schedules included in the
Disclosure Schedules for the convenience of reference only and shall not
affect the construction or interpretation of any of the provisions of the
Agreement or the Disclosure Schedules and (d) information contained in various
schedules contained in the Disclosure Schedules or Sections and subsections of
the Schedules contained in the Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed to qualify
each Section of this Agreement to which such information is applicable
(regardless of whether or not such Section is qualified by reference to a
Schedule), so long as application to such Section is reasonably discernible
from the reading of such disclosure. No information set forth in the
Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed to broaden in any way the scope of the
Companys representations and warranties. The inclusion of an item on the
Disclosure Schedules is not evidence of the materiality of such item for
purposes of this Agreement or otherwise, or that such item is a disclosure
required under the Agreement. Any description of any agreement, document,
instrument, plan, arrangement or other item set forth on the Disclosure
Schedules is a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by the terms of
such agreement, document, instrument, plan, arrangement or item, copies of
which have been Made Available to Buyer. No disclosure on the Disclosure
Schedules relating to any possible breach or violation of any agreement,
Governmental Order or Law shall be construed as an admission or indication
that any such breach or violation exists or has actually occurred, or shall
constitute an admission of liability to any third party.

 



 

15.16 _Certain Releases and Waivers_.

 



 

(a) Buyer (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates) hereby irrevocably
acknowledges and agrees that: (i) each of Sellers Representative and the
Sellers shall have the right to retain Choate, Hall and Stewart LLP and Wilson
Elser Moskowitz Edelman and Dicker (the " _Designated Firms_ ") to represent its
or their interests in any dispute arising under or in connection with this
Agreement or any other Transaction Document, any agreement entered into
pursuant to this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby (a "
_Dispute_ "); (ii) Buyer (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates) irrevocably
waives, consents to and covenants not to assert any objection, based on
conflict of interest or otherwise, to any representation of Sellers
Representative or any Seller by the Designated Firms in any Dispute; (iii) all
communications between or among any of the Sellers, the Company, Sellers
Representative or any of their respective Affiliates, directors, managers,
officers, employees, agents or representatives, on the one hand, and one or
more of the Designated Firms, on the other hand, made solely in connection
with the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and closing under, or
any dispute arising in connection with, this Agreement, any other Transaction
Document or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (the "
_Protected Seller Communications_ "), shall be deemed to be privileged and
confidential communications; (iv) all rights to such Protected Seller
Communications, and the control of the confidentiality and privilege
applicable thereto, shall be retained by Sellers Representative; and (v) to
the extent Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Company) should
discover in its possession after the Closing any Protected Seller
Communications, it shall take reasonable steps to preserve the confidentiality
thereof and promptly deliver the same to Sellers Representative, keeping no
copies, and shall not by reason thereof assert any loss of confidentiality or
privilege protection.

 



       
 

 



 

(b) Effective upon the Closing, the LLC Agreement shall be terminated in its
entirety and, except as otherwise set forth herein, all rights and obligations
of the Members thereunder shall cease. Effective upon the Closing, each Member
hereby acknowledges that such Member is not entitled to any distribution from
the Company pursuant to the LLC Agreement (including any tax distributions,
return of capital or other distributions) except for the amounts payable by
Buyer to the Sellers as set forth on the Payment Spreadsheet; provided, that
notwithstanding Section 33 of the LLC Agreement, only the following sections
of the LLC Agreement shall survive such termination: Section 8 ( _Limited
Liability_ ), Section 29 ( _Reliance_ ), Section 30 ( _Indemnification_ )
and Section 31 ( _Exculpation_ ).

 



 

(c) Effective upon the Closing, each of the Company and Buyer voluntarily,
knowingly and irrevocably releases and forever discharges each of the Members
(including GP) and their respective officers, directors, managers, employees,
shareholders (including B-Fund and GP, in the case of the Blocker) and
Affiliates (collectively, the " _Member Released Parties_ ") from any and all
actions, agreements, amounts, claims, damages, expenses, liabilities and
obligations of every kind, nature or description, arising or existing prior to
the Closing, whether absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, known
or unknown, (i) with respect to the Sellers, insofar as the same relate solely
to such Sellers ownership of Purchased Securities or such Sellers status as
a "Member" pursuant to the LLC Agreement, and (ii) with respect to the Blocker
Sellers, insofar as the same relate solely to its ownership of Purchased
Securities issued by the Blocker, in each case except for any rights of Buyer
or the Company under this Agreement or any agreement entered into in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(d) Following the Closing, the Company covenants not to bring any Action
against any Member Released Party for any distribution to such Member Released
Party in its capacity as a "Member" pursuant to the LLC Agreement.

 



 

15.17 _Specific Performance_.

 



 

In addition to any and all other remedies that may be available at law in the
event of any breach of this Agreement, Sellers Representative, the Company
and Buyer shall be entitled to specific performance of the agreements and
