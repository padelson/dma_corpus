 Section 2.10 _Payment for Shares_. 

  

 (a) At least ten Business Days prior to the Effective Time, the Acquiror shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ") pursuant to a paying agent agreement (the " _Paying Agent Agreement_ ") providing for, among other things, the matters set forth in this Section 2.10 and otherwise reasonably satisfactory to the Company. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Acquiror shall deposit or shall cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent for the benefit of any holder of Common Shares, Preferred Shares and Options, as applicable, the consideration to which such parties shall be entitled at the Effective Time pursuant to Sections 2.7(a), 2.7(b) and 2.9. Such funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent as provided for in the Paying Agent Agreement, as the case may be, pending payment therefor by the Paying Agent to Stockholders. Earnings from such investments shall be the sole and exclusive property 

  ##### 

  

    

of the Acquiror, and no part thereof shall accrue to the benefit of the
holders of Common Shares, Preferred Shares or Options. 

   

 (b) At least two Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Acquiror shall provide to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, evidenced outstanding Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") and whose Shares will be converted into the right to receive the consideration described in Section 2.7(a) or Section 2.7(b), (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as the Acquiror may reasonably specify) (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment therefor. Following the Effective Time, upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or such other agent or agents as may be appointed by the Acquiror, together with a Letter of Transmittal duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (as promptly as reasonably practicable on or after the Closing Date), (A) in the case of Certificates representing Common Shares, an amount in cash equal to (1) the Per Share Merger Consideration multiplied by (2) the number of Common Shares formerly represented by such Certificate and (B) in the case of Certificates representing Preferred Shares, an amount in cash equal to (1) the Liquidation Preference Per Share multiplied by the number of Preferred Shares represented by such Certificate (2) plus the Per Share Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of Preferred Shares formerly represented by such Certificate, in each case without interest, and such Certificate shall, upon such surrender, be cancelled. If any Certificate, together with a duly executed and completed Letter of Transmittal, is delivered to the Paying Agent or such other agent prior to the Effective Time, then the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive such payment on the Closing Date. If payment in respect of any Certificate is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name such Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer, that the signatures on such Certificate or any related stock power shall be properly guaranteed and that the Person requesting such payment shall have established to the satisfaction of the Acquiror and the Paying Agent that any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate have been paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.10 and the Letter of Transmittal, any Certificate (other than Certificates representing Shares described in Sections 2.7(c) and (d) and any Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed, at any time after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration or the Liquidation Preference Per Share payable with respect thereto, in cash, without interest, as contemplated herein. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, on the Closing Date, the Company shall (and Acquiror shall cause the Company) to pay up to $2,500,000 of the Merger Consideration to employees of the Company as directed by the Company in writing at any time prior to the date that is two Business Days prior to the Closing Date, and the Merger Consideration, for purposes of calculating the Per Share Merger Consideration, shall be deemed to be reduced by such amount. 

   

 (c) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of any shares of capital stock thereafter on the records of the Company. If, after the Effective Time, a Certificate (other 

  ##### 

  

    

than representing Shares described in Sections 2.7(c) and (d)) is presented
to the Surviving Corporation, it shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided
in this Section 2.10. 

   

 (d) All cash paid upon conversion of the Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates shall cease to have any rights with respect to Shares represented thereby, except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable Law. 

   

 (e) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Surviving Corporation shall pay or cause to be paid in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Per Share Merger Consideration or the Liquidation Preference Per Share, as applicable, payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.10(b) for Shares represented thereby; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent may, in their discretion, require the delivery of a reasonably satisfactory bond or indemnity. 

   

 (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.10, to the fullest extent permitted by law, none of the Paying Agent, the Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 

   

 Section 2.11 _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required or reasonably believes it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of applicable tax Law. To the extent that such amounts are so withheld or paid over to or deposited with the relevant Governmental Authority by the Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the applicable Person in respect to which such deduction and withholding was made.

 Section 5.12 _Indemnification and Insurance_. 

  

 (a) The Acquiror and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses now existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers or employees, as the case may be, of the Company or the Company Affiliates as provided in their respective certificates of incorporation or bylaws or other similar constituent documents or in any agreement shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect.

 (b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and the Acquiror shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds in respect of each of the foregoing) each current and former director, officer or employee of the Company or any of the Company Affiliates (each, together with such Persons heirs, executors or administrators, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") against any costs or expenses (including advancing reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by Law), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any Action, arising out of, relating to or in connection with any such Persons service as a director or officer of the Company or any of the Company Affiliates or services performed in connection with such Persons serving as an officer or director or other fiduciary in any entity if such service was at the request or for the benefit of the Company, in each case, at or prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected without the Surviving Corporations prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (selected by a plurality of the applicable Indemnified Parties and reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation) for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction with respect to any single such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, unless the use of one counsel for such Indemnified Parties would present such counsel with a conflict of interest that would make such joint representation inappropriate. It shall be a condition to the advancement of any amounts to be paid in respect of legal and other fees and expenses that the Surviving Corporation receive an undertaking by the Indemnified Party to repay such legal and other fees and expenses paid in advance if it is ultimately 

  ##### 

  

    

determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified
under applicable Law. In the event of any such Action, the Surviving
Corporation shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnified Party in the
defense of any such Action. 

   

 (c) The Company shall obtain prior to the Effective Time "tail" insurance policies with a claims period of at least six years from the Effective Time with respect to directors and officers liability insurance of the type and with an amount of coverage as are no less favorable than those of the directors and officers liability insurance maintained as of the date hereof by the Company and the Company Affiliates (the " _Current Policies_ "), and with such other terms as are no less favorable in the aggregate than those of the Current Policies; _provided_  that, in satisfying such obligation, the Company shall not be obligated to pay aggregate premiums in excess of 300% of the aggregate per annum amount that the Company paid for such coverage under the Current Policies in the last full year prior to the date hereof, it being understood and agreed that the Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation shall nevertheless be obligated to provide such coverage as may be obtained for such amount. 

   

 (d) The Acquiror shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 5.12. 

   

 (e) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have under the certificates of incorporation or bylaws or other constituent documents of the Company or any of the Company Affiliates or the Surviving Corporation, any other indemnification arrangement, the DGCL or otherwise. The provisions of this Section 5.12 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and expressly are intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties. 

   

 (f) In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.12. 

   

 Section 5.13 _Section 280G Stockholder Approval_. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to have, prior to the Closing, submitted to a vote of the Companys stockholders for their determination in accordance with Section 280G(b)(5)(A)(ii) of the Code all payments or benefits to John J. Arlotta, Jacqueline Odergard and Carl Fink that, in the absence of such a vote, would reasonably be expected to result in the loss of deduction with respect to such payments as a result of Section 280G of the Code such that, if such a stockholder vote is taken, no such payments will be subject to the excise tax provided for under Section 4999 of the Code.
