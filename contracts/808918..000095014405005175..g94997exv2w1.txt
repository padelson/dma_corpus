and deliver to Purchaser, or to aid and assist in the collection of or
reducing to possession by Purchaser, of the applicable Purchased Assets, or
to vest in Purchaser good and marketable title to the Purchased Assets.
Additionally, Sellers agree, for a period of two years after the Closing,
upon the written request of Purchaser (with Purchaser being required in any
such instance to reimburse Sellers for their out-of-pocket costs, including
the cost of any temporary employees or the overtime costs of regular
employees), to assist Purchaser in compiling historical information for any
financing of the U.S. Business (including the compilation of financial

obligations imposed by law, including the provision of audited financial
statements for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004 in accordance
with GAAP; provided, however, that (a) Sellers and their Affiliates shall
receive indemnities reasonably acceptable to them to protect them from any
and all Liabilities arising from or related to the   -5-   provision and
use of such information (except to the extent that any such Liabilities
result from Sellers\' breach of any representations or warranties under this
Agreement) and (b) the requirements on Sellers and their Affiliates pursuant
to this sentence shall not require the performance of tasks that unreasonably
interfere with the ordinary course performance of the regular employment
duties of the employees of Sellers and their Affiliates.  1.4 ASSIGNMENT OF
CONTRACTS, RIGHTS, ETC.   Anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby shall not constitute an agreement (whether by operation of Law or
otherwise) or attempted agreement to transfer, sublease or assign any
Contract, or any Proceeding or right with respect to any benefit or
obligation arising thereunder or resulting therefrom, or any Permit, if an
attempted transfer, sublease or assignment thereof, without the required
consent of any other party thereto, would constitute a breach thereof or in
any way adversely affect the rights or increase the obligations of Purchaser
or Sellers thereunder and consent to transfer has not been obtained. The
parties shall use reasonable commercial efforts to obtain the consent of
any such third party to any of the foregoing to the transfer or assignment
thereof to Purchaser in all cases in which such consent is required for such
transfer or assignment; provided, however, the expenditure of out-of-pocket
costs or other out-of-pocket economic concessions shall not be required by
Sellers. If such consent is not timely obtained, the parties shall enter into
such commercially reasonable cooperative arrangements (at no additional
material costs to Sellers) to provide for Purchaser the benefits and
obligations thereunder (at the ongoing expense of Purchaser, with such
ongoing expense not to exceed the ongoing expense that would have been
incurred under such consent, including maintaining any corporate "group" cost
allocations in a manner consistent with past practice) and any and all rights
of Sellers thereunder against the other party thereto. If any such
arrangement is not commercially reasonably practicable, then such Contract,
Proceeding or Permit, as the case may be, shall be deemed to be an Excluded
Asset or an Excluded Liability, as the case may be.   ARTICLE 2   ASSUMED

deemed to have contributed to a condition existing on or before the  Closing
Date if there is no Purchaser Environmental Knowledge of such  condition,
provided, however, that Purchaser shall be deemed to have  contributed to
such condition if there is Purchaser Environmental  Knowledge of such
condition, and Purchaser shall have failed to provide  timely notification of
such condition to Sellers.   (c) For convenience of reference, the
Liabilities not being assumed by Purchaser pursuant to Section 2.2(b) of this
Agreement are hereinafter collectively called the "Excluded Liabilities" in
this Agreement.   (d) For sake of clarity, the parties hereto provide the
following example to illustrate the effect of events, facts and circumstances
that exist on or before the Closing Date and after the Closing Date. If a
personal injury claim is made after the Closing Date related to the operation
of any Facility, then to the extent the claim relates to actions on or prior
to the Closing Date, the Sellers would be responsible for any Liabilities
attributable to that time period, and to the extent the claim relates to
actions after the Closing Date; the Purchaser would be responsible for any
Liabilities attributable to that time period; it being the intention of the
parties that the mere existence of the event, fact or circumstance on or
prior to the Closing Date shall not result in the Liability being solely that
of the Sellers.   ARTICLE 3   PURCHASE PRICE  3.1 PURCHASE PRICE.  
The aggregate consideration to be paid at the Closing by Purchaser to Sellers
for the Purchased Assets shall be $28,000,000 (the "Purchase Price"). The
Purchase Price will be paid as provided in Section 3.2 and shall be
subject to adjustments as provided in Sections 3.3 and 3.4.  3.2 PAYMENT OF
PURCHASE PRICE AT CLOSING.   At the Closing, subject to the satisfaction of
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Purchase Price shall be paid
by Purchaser to Sellers by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
the account designated by Sellers. The Closing shall be deemed effective as
of 24:00 on the Closing Date/00:00 the day after the Closing Date German
Time.  3.3 INVENTORY PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENT.   (a) On or as promptly as
practicable after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall take, using either
Transferred Employees or a third-party entity reasonably acceptable to
Sellers, a physical count of the Inventory (and a simultaneous physical
identification of the Finished Goods). Representatives of Sellers shall be
given an opportunity in all reasonable respects and in good faith to (i)
observe, along with their accountants, such taking of the Inventory (and such
physical identification of the Finished Goods) and (ii) to conduct test
counts of the Inventory (and such   -10-   physical identification of the
Finished Goods) and in connection with such test counts Purchaser agrees not
to release an area from the process until such opportunity to take test
counts has been provided to Sellers. Following preparation of an inventory
report, Sellers shall be given an opportunity in all reasonable respects to
review the inventory report and work papers.   (b) Within forty-five (45)
days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare and deliver, or cause to
be prepared and delivered, to Sellers a statement as of the Closing Date
(collectively, the "Initial Inventory Statement", and in its final and
binding form as determined pursuant to this Section 3.3(b), the "Final
Inventory Statement") setting forth the aggregate value of Inventory as of
the Closing Date (the "Applicable Inventory"). Unless otherwise agreed upon,
the Initial Inventory Statement and the Final Inventory Statement shall be
prepared in accordance with GAAP, except with respect to the valuations to be
applied to the Supplied Production Components and WIP as set forth in the
respective definitions of such terms. The Initial Inventory Statement shall
become final and binding upon the parties on the tenth Business Day following
receipt thereof by Sellers unless Sellers give written notice of their
disagreement (with such notice so timely delivered referred to herein as
a "Notice of Disagreement") to Purchaser prior to such date in accordance
with Section 13.7 hereof. Any Notice of Disagreement shall specify in
reasonable detail the basis and amount of any disagreement. In the event of a
Notice of Disagreement, then the Initial Inventory Statement (as revised in
accordance with clause (x) or (y) below) shall only become final and binding
upon the parties on the earlier of (x) the date the parties hereto resolve
any differences they have with respect to any matter specified in the Notice
of Disagreement or (y) the date any matters in dispute are resolved by
an accounting firm jointly selected by Purchaser and Sellers or, if the
parties are unable to agree, an independent accounting firm jointly selected
by Purchaser\'s, on the one hand, and Sellers\', on the other hand,
independent accounting firms (such firm, the "Accounting Firm"). During the
thirty (30) days immediately following the delivery of a Notice of
Disagreement, Purchaser and Sellers shall seek in good faith to resolve in
writing any differences which they may have with respect to any matter
specified in the Notice of Disagreement. At the end of such 30-day period, or
such longer period as may be mutually agreed, either Purchaser, on the one
hand, or Sellers, on the other hand, shall submit for review and resolution
by the Accounting Firm any and all matters which remain in dispute and are
related to the matters included in the Notice of Disagreement, and the
Accounting Firm shall make a final determination with respect to the dispute,
which determination shall be binding on the parties. In making
such determination: (i) the Accounting Firm shall determine only those
matters which remain in dispute and which were included in the Notice of
Disagreement and (ii) the scope of any dispute shall be limited as to whether
the calculation in dispute under the Notice of Disagreement was done in
accordance with this Section 3.3. The Final Inventory Statement shall become
final and binding on Purchaser and Sellers on the date the Accounting Firm
delivers the Final Inventory Statement to the parties. Each party shall pay
its own fees and expenses incurred in connection with any Notice of
Disagreement; provided, that the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm
pursuant to this Section 3.3 shall be borne one-half each by Purchaser, on
the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand.   (c) Within two (2) Business
Days after the date the Final Inventory Statement becomes final and binding
pursuant to Section 3.3(b), Purchaser will reduce Sellers\' accounts payable
balance due to Purchaser pursuant to the Manufacturing and Distribution
Agreements   -11-   (and issue a credit to be utilized immediately
against any such future accounts payable balance if the existing accounts
payable balance is not of sufficient size) in an aggregate amount equal to
the value of the Applicable Inventory set forth in the Final Inventory
Statement; provided, however, that if Sellers provide a Notice of
Disagreement and certain amounts in the Initial Inventory Statement are
undisputed, then Purchaser shall make a partial adjustment for such
undisputed amounts within five (5) Business Days after such Notice
of Disagreement and a final adjustment within two (2) Business Days after the
Final Inventory Statement becomes final and binding pursuant to Section
3.3(b).  3.4 ADJUSTMENT FOR PREPAYMENTS, ETC.   At least five (5) Business
Days prior to Closing, Sellers shall provide Purchaser with an officer\'s
certificate certifying in good faith the amount of their prepayments, prepaid
expenses, advances, credits from suppliers and deposits actually with or paid
to third parties (the "Prepayment Certification"), together with reasonable
supporting documentation from such third parties. At the Closing, Purchaser
shall pay to Sellers (by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account designated by Sellers), the aggregate amount reflected in the
Prepayment Certification (the "Adjustment Payment")). If the Prepayment
Certification is not acceptable to Purchaser, the Purchaser shall give
written notice of its disagreement to Seller in accordance with Section 13.7
hereof. Any such notice of disagreement shall specify in reasonable detail
the basis and amount of any disagreement. During the thirty (30) days
immediately following the delivery of such notice of disagreement,
the parties shall seek in good faith to resolve in writing any differences
which they may have with respect to any matter specified in such notice
of disagreement. If at the end of such thirty (30) day period, such
disagreement remains unresolved, then the Accounting Firm shall resolve any
such dispute in a commercially reasonable manner and the Accounting Firm
shall make a final determination with respect to any such dispute, which
determination shall be binding on the parties. If such final determination
indicates that the amount paid by Purchaser at Closing for Sellers\'
prepayments, prepaid expenses, advances, credits from suppliers and deposits
actually with or paid to third parties exceeded the actual amount of such
items, within two (2) Business Days of the Accounting Firm providing written
notice to Sellers of the such final determination, Sellers shall pay to
Purchaser (by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
designated by Purchaser) the aggregate amount of any such overpayment. If
such final determination indicates that the amount paid by Purchaser at
Closing for Sellers\' prepayments, prepaid expenses, advances, credits from
suppliers and deposits actually with or paid to third parties was less than
the actual amount of such items, within two (2) Business Days of
the Accounting Firm providing written notice to Purchaser of the such
final determination, the Purchaser shall pay to Sellers (by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to the account designated by Sellers) the
aggregate amount of any such underpayment. Each party shall pay its own fees
and expenses incurred in connection with any dispute relating to the
Prepayment Certification; provided, that the fees and expenses of the
Accounting Firm pursuant to this Section 3.4 shall be borne one-half each by
Purchaser, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand.  3.5 ALLOCATION
OF PURCHASE PRICE.   Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall prepare an allocation schedule allocating the aggregate
deemed sales price payable hereunder as determined by   -12-   applying
Federal Income Tax principles among the Purchased Assets in accordance with
applicable Law (the "Allocation Schedule"), subject to the consent
of Sellers, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The
Allocation Schedule shall be binding on all parties for all applicable
purposes, including tax purposes, and no party shall file any Tax Returns or
take any other action which is inconsistent with the Allocation Schedule. The
parties acknowledge and agree that the making of a protective election out of
the installment method shall not be a breach of this Agreement, including
this Section 3.5.   ARTICLE 4   THE CLOSING  4.1 THE CLOSING.   The

expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.   -13-    (c) Each Seller

under this Section 7.4 with respect to such Superior Proposal, if any. In the

another business or substantial assets, then Sellers, collectively, shall be
entitled to a minimum recovery from Purchaser or Glenayre of the Termination
Fee; provided, however, that if the Termination Fee has been paid pursuant to
the Share Purchase Agreement, then no Termination Fee shall be due under this
Agreement. The foregoing is not intended to be, and shall not be construed
as, a limitation in any manner on the rights and remedies that may be pursued

or other equitable remedy as an appropriate remedy for any such
breach.  7.5 PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS.   Each party agrees that, except (a) as

other member of the Universal Music Group shall, from and after the Closing
until the date on which the U.S. Manufacturing and Distribution Agreements
expire or terminate (unless, in the case of termination, termination is a
result of the failure of Sellers to comply with the terms thereof, in which
event the period shall be the original expiration date of the U.S.
Manufacturing and Distribution Agreements) (the "Seller Restricted Period"),
directly or indirectly, engage in any of the Seller Restricted Activities or
have or Beneficially Own a Material Interest in any business or Person that
(i) manufactures Products or physical format successors or replacements for
the Products, or (ii) physically distributes Products or physical format
successors or replacements for the Products, in each of clauses (i) and (ii),
within any Restricted Territory. The activities described in clauses (i) and
(ii) are referred to herein as the "Seller Restricted Activities."   (i)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, this  Section 7.6(c) shall
not prohibit or restrict Sellers or any of their  Affiliates from having or
Beneficially Owning a Material Interest or  engaging in any business (A)
which creates or sells custom compilations of  music (including through
retail outlets, over the Internet or kiosk sales)  or consumer selected
locally burned Products; (B) which is primarily a  record club; (C) which is
a Joint Venture (as defined and set forth in any  of the Manufacturing and
Distribution Agreements), but not beyond the  respective terms for such Joint
Ventures as set forth in their respective  Organizational Documents; (D)
which is a Seller Permitted Joint Venture on  the Effective Date; or (E)
which distributes product by physical means for  orders placed by electronic
means (e.g., over the Internet, radio,  television, etc.), nor shall this
Section 7.6(c) prohibit or restrict  Sellers or their Affiliates from
continuing or entering into manufacturing  or distribution agreements as
permitted   -32-    under any of the Manufacturing and Distribution
Agreements (including new  PandD; Agreements (as defined in the Manufacturing
and Distribution  Agreements) with third parties). The ability of Sellers or
their  Affiliates to have or Beneficially Own a Material Interest or engage
in  the enumerated businesses of this Section 7.6(c)(i) shall in no way
limit  their obligations to divest any Competing Business or such Material 
Interest as contemplated by Section 7.6(c)(iii).   (ii) For purposes of
clarity, this Section 7.6 (c) shall not  prohibit or restrict Sellers or any
of their Affiliates from having or  Beneficially Owning a Material Interest
or engaging in any business not  constituting a Seller Restricted Activity,
including any business (A)  which produces or distributes product by non-
physical means, or delivers  music or other audio and/or visual works by
electronic means (e.g., over  the Internet, radio, television, etc.), (B)
which promotes (including  through the promotional distribution of) Products;
(C) which is part of  the Seller Core Business or (D) which licenses master
recordings to third  parties.   (iii) This Section 7.6(c) shall not
prohibit or restrict  Sellers or any of their Affiliates from acquiring or
agreeing to acquire  an interest in any Person or business (a "Seller
Acquired Business") which  is engaged in whole or in part in a Seller
Restricted Activity (for  purposes of this Section 7.6(c), the portion of
such Seller Acquired  Business which is engaged in a Seller Restricted
Activity is a "Competing  Business") provided any such Seller or Affiliate
disposes, terminates or  dissolves or otherwise divests of such Competing
Business (or its Material  Interest therein) as soon as reasonably
practicable, and in any event  prior to the eighteen month anniversary of the
acquisition by such Seller  or Affiliate of such Competing Business. At the
time a Seller Permitted  Joint Venture which is not owned by Seller on the
Closing Date (a "New  Venture") fails to satisfy the criteria set forth in
the definition of  Seller Permitted Joint Venture, such Seller or Affiliate
shall be  obligated to dispose, terminate, dissolve or otherwise divest
itself of  such New Venture. If such Seller or Affiliate determines that it
will  dispose of (rather than terminate) such Competing Business (or
Material  Interest) or New Venture, it will provide Purchaser an opportunity
to  purchase the Competing Business (or Material Interest) or New Venture 
(provided as to any New Venture, Seller may comply with any restrictions  on
transfer or sale in such New Venture\'s organizational documents, e.g. 
requiring a first offer to other equity holders or to the venture). If 
Purchaser wishes to pursue such an acquisition, it shall notify such  Seller
or Affiliate within thirty (30) Business Days of such Seller\'s  notice, and
such Seller or Affiliate will thereafter provide Purchaser  with an exclusive
right of first negotiation for a period of thirty (30)  Business Days from
the date of Purchaser\'s notice. If the parties are  unable to agree to
mutually acceptable terms within such thirty (30)  Business Day period, such
Seller or Affiliate shall be free to dispose of  such Competing Business (or
Material Interest) or New Venture to a third  party for the purchase price
and other terms and conditions last offered  by such Seller or Affiliate in
the course of such failed negotiations with  Purchaser (the "Seller\'s Last
Offer") or for a purchase price and other  terms and conditions that are more
favorable to such Seller or Affiliate  and less favorable to Purchaser than
the Seller\'s Last Offer. Prior to  consummating any such disposition, such
Seller or Affiliate shall, upon  request of Purchaser, provide Purchaser with
reasonable supporting  documentation with respect to the terms and conditions
of any such  disposition to a third party in order   -33-    to
demonstrate such Seller\'s or Affiliate\'s compliance with the provisions  of
the preceding sentence. Notwithstanding any other provision of this 
Agreement, any disposition or attempted disposition by such Seller or 
Affiliate of such Competing Business (or Material Interest) or New Venture 
on terms that are not more favorable to such Seller or Affiliate and less 
favorable to Purchaser than the Seller\'s Last Offer ("Seller Reduced 
Terms") shall be subject to the rights of Purchaser hereunder and  Purchaser
shall have a right of first refusal to purchase such Competing  Business (or
Material Interest) or New Venture on such Seller Reduced  Terms. Purchaser
shall have a period of fifteen (15) Business Days from  date Purchaser
receives notice of such disposition or proposed disposition  within which to
exercise such right of first refusal by providing written  notice to such
Seller or Affiliate.   (iv) Sellers each specifically agree that this
covenant is an  integral part of the inducement of Purchaser to enter into
this Agreement  and that Purchaser shall be entitled to injunctive relief in
addition to  all other legal and equitable rights and remedies available to
it in  connection with any breach by Sellers or either of their applicable 
Affiliates of any provision of this Section 7.6(c) and that,  notwithstanding
the foregoing, no right, power, or remedy conferred upon  or reserved or
exercised by Purchaser in this Section 7.6(c) is intended  to be exclusive of
any other right, power or remedy, each and every one of  which (now or
hereafter existing at law, in equity, by statute or  otherwise) shall be
cumulative and concurrent. The covenants contained in  this Section 7.6(c)
shall be construed as a series of separate covenants,  one for each county or
state of the United States (together, the  "Restricted Territory").   (d)
Sellers and Purchaser each acknowledge and recognize that Sellers are
retaining, and will conduct, certain operations related to the sales,
marketing and promotion of Products and further acknowledge and
recognize that these lines of business may be substantially affected if
Purchaser or its Affiliates were to use the assets and good will that it is
acquiring from Sellers and its Affiliates to compete against Sellers in these
lines of business in the United States. Accordingly, in consideration of the
premises contained herein and the consideration to be received hereunder, and
in consideration of and as an inducement to Sellers to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates
with operations in any segment of the music industry shall from and after the
Closing until the date in which the Manufacturing and Distribution Agreements
expire or terminate (unless, in the case of termination, termination is a
result of the failure of Purchaser to comply with the terms thereof) (the
"Purchaser Restricted Period"), directly or indirectly, engage in the Seller
Core Business or have or Beneficially Own a Material Interest in any business
or Person in the following lines of business: (i) sales of Product (i.e.,
solicitation of wholesale and/or retail purchasers of Product) but not
including rack jobbing; (ii) marketing and advertising of Product; (iii)
content acquisition (whether directly (e.g., as a producer of music) or
indirectly (e.g., by acquisition of record labels)); (iv) the provision of
credit and collection services to the owners, producers or distributors of
Product other than in connection with the services provided by Purchaser to
Sellers and their Affiliates after Closing; (v) account executive services;
(vi) catalog program management; (vii) special markets sales; (viii) field
marketing and merchandising; or (ix) the facilitation, for itself or
third parties, of the electronic distribution of music or other audio and/or
visual content but not including backroom services relating to such
electronic distribution; in each of clauses (i) through (ix), within any
Restricted Territory. The business operations   -34-   described in
clauses (i) through (ix) is the "Seller Core Business". For purposes of this
Section 7.6(d), Purchaser\'s "Affiliates" shall include only (i) those
entities controlled by Purchaser or (ii) entities which control
Purchaser (directly or indirectly) (each, a "Purchaser Parent") or which are
controlled by a Purchaser Parent. Purchaser shall deliver a side letter to
Sellers from each member of senior management of Purchaser in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit 7.6.   (i) Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, this  Section 7.6(d) shall not prohibit or restrict
Purchaser from having or  Beneficially Owning an interest in any Purchaser
Permitted Joint Venture  or owning, managing, controlling, or participating
in any business that  provides: (A) rack jobbing; (B) content protection and
anti-piracy  measures for Products; (C) backroom services; or (D) those
services to be  performed by Purchaser under the Manufacturing and
Distribution  Agreements. The ability of Purchaser or its Affiliates to have
or  Beneficially Own a Material Interest or engage in the enumerated 
businesses of this Section 7.6(d)(i) shall in no way limit their  obligations
to divest any Competing Business or such Material Interest as  contemplated
by Section 7.6(d)(ii);   (ii) This Section 7.6(d) shall not prohibit or
restrict  Purchaser from acquiring or agreeing to acquire an interest in any
Person  or business (a "Purchaser Acquired Business") which is engaged in
whole or  in part in a Seller Core Business (for purposes of this Section
7.6(d),  the portion of such Purchaser Acquired Business which is engaged in
a  Seller Core Business is a "Seller Competing Business") provided
Purchaser  disposes, terminates or dissolves, or otherwise divests of such
Seller  Competing Business (or its Material Interest therein) as soon as 
reasonably practicable, and in any event prior to the eighteen month 
anniversary of the acquisition by Purchaser of such Seller Competing 
Business. At the time a Purchaser Permitted Joint Venture fails to satisfy 
the criteria set forth in the definition of Purchaser Permitted Joint 
Venture, Purchaser or its Affiliate shall be obligated to dispose, 
terminate, dissolve or otherwise divest itself of such Purchaser Permitted 
Joint Venture. If Purchaser determines that it will dispose of (rather  than
terminate) such Seller Competing Business (or Material Interest) or 
Purchaser Permitted Joint Venture, it will provide Sellers an opportunity  to
purchase the Seller Competing Business (or Material Interest) or  Purchaser
Permitted Joint Venture. If either Seller wishes to pursue an  acquisition of
the Seller Competing Business (or Material Interest) or  Purchaser Permitted
Joint Venture, it shall notify Purchaser or such  Affiliate within thirty
(30) Business Days of such Purchaser\'s notice, and  Purchaser or such
Affiliate will thereafter provide Sellers with an  exclusive right of first
negotiation for a period of thirty (30) Business  Days from the date of such
Seller\'s notice. If the parties are unable to  agree to mutually acceptable
terms within such thirty (30) Business Day  period, Purchaser Affiliate shall
be free to dispose of such Seller  Competing Business (or Material Interest)
or Purchaser Permitted Joint  Venture to a third party for the purchase price
and other terms and  conditions last offered by Purchaser or such Affiliate
in the course of  such failed negotiations with Seller (the "Purchaser\'s
Last Offer") or for  a purchase price and other terms and conditions that are
more favorable to  such Purchaser or Affiliate and less favorable to Seller
than the  Purchaser\'s Last Offer. Prior to consummating any such
disposition, such  Purchaser or Affiliate shall, upon request of Seller,
provide Seller with  reasonable supporting documentation with respect to the
terms and  conditions of any such disposition to a third party in order
to   -35-    demonstrate such Purchaser\'s or Affiliate\'s compliance
with the provisions  of the preceding sentence. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this  Agreement, any disposition or attempted disposition by
such Purchaser or  Affiliate of such Seller Competing Business (or Material
Interest) or  Purchaser Permitted Joint Venture on terms that are not more
favorable to  such Purchaser or Affiliate and less favorable to Seller than
the  Purchaser\'s Last Offer ("Purchaser Reduced Terms") shall be subject to
the  rights of Seller hereunder and Seller shall have a right of first
refusal  to purchase such Seller Competing Business (or Material Interest)
or  Purchaser Permitted Joint Venture on such Purchaser Reduced Terms.
Seller  shall have a period of fifteen (15) Business Days from date Seller 
receives notice of such disposition or proposed disposition within which  to
exercise such right of first refusal by providing written notice to  such
Purchaser or Affiliate; and   (iii) Purchaser specifically agrees that this
covenant is an  integral part of the inducement of Sellers to enter into this
Agreement  and that Sellers shall be entitled to injunctive relief in
addition to all  other legal and equitable rights and remedies available to
each in  connection with any material breach by Purchaser of any provision of
this  Section 7.6(d) and that, notwithstanding the foregoing, no right,
power,  or remedy conferred upon or reserved or exercised by Sellers in
this  Section 7.6(d) is intended to be exclusive of any other right, power
or  remedy, each and every one of which (now or hereafter existing at law,
in  equity, by statute or otherwise) shall be cumulative and concurrent.
The  covenants contained in this Section 7.6(d) shall be construed as a
series  of separate covenants, one for each Restricted Territory.   (e)
Neither Sellers nor any of their Affiliates with operations in any segment of
the music industry shall during the Seller Restricted Period, solicit, employ
or offer to employ any employee of the U.S. Business who is, at the time of
the solicitation, employment or offer, employed by Purchaser or one of its
Affiliates in a management capacity. Neither Purchaser nor any of
its Affiliates (as such term is used in Section 7.6(d)) shall during the
Purchaser Restricted Period, solicit, employ or offer to employ any employee
of Sellers or their Affiliates who is, at the time of solicitation,
employment or offer, employed by Sellers or one of their Affiliates. Nothing
in this Section 7.6(e) shall prohibit the placement of advertising or other
solicitation materials which are not specifically targeted at the other\'s
employees (e.g., postings to an on-line employment site, newspaper
advertising are not prohibited).   (f) It is the desire and intent of the
parties that the provisions of this Section 7.6 be enforced to the fullest
extent permissible under the Laws and public policies applied in each
jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought. Accordingly, if any particular
provision of this Section 7.6 shall be adjudicated to be invalid or
unenforceable, such provision shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary
in order that such provision be valid and enforceable, such amendment to
apply only with respect to the operation of such provision of this Section
7.6 in the particular jurisdiction in which such adjudication is made.  
-36-   7.7 NOTICE OF CHANGES.   (a) On or prior to the Closing Date,
Sellers will promptly notify Purchaser in writing of any event related to the
U.S. Business which has had or would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.   (b) Each party shall immediately notify the other
parties in writing upon the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event,
which occurrence or failure to occur would be reasonably likely to cause any
representation or warranty of such party that is contained in this Agreement
or any Related Document to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at
any time from the date of this Agreement to the Closing as if such
representation and warranty were made at such time. In addition, each party
shall immediately notify the other parties in writing in the event it
reasonably believes that any condition set forth in Article 8 cannot be
satisfied.   (c) The parties agree that notification pursuant to this
Section 7.7 shall not impact the rights and remedies of any party under this
Agreement and such notification shall not be deemed to cure a breach by any
party hereunder.  7.8 REPAIR OF DAMAGE; CONDEMNATION.   (a) In the event
that prior to the Closing there is any "Non-Material" (as defined in
subsection (c) hereof) damage to the Purchased Assets, or any part thereof,
other than ordinary wear and tear, at Sellers\' option either (i) Sellers
shall at their cost and in a good and workmanlike manner repair or replace
such damage after the Closing, or (ii) Purchaser shall accept such Purchased
Assets in their then-current condition, with an abatement or reduction in the
Purchase Price in the amount necessary to fully repair and restore such
damaged Purchased Assets, and Purchaser and Sellers shall proceed with the
Closing.   (b) In the event that prior to the Closing, any Non-Material
portion of the Purchased Assets is subject to a taking, Purchaser shall
accept the Purchased Assets in their then-current condition and proceed with
the Closing, in which case Purchaser shall be entitled to an assignment of
all of Sellers\' rights to any award in connection with such taking. In the
event of any such Non-Material taking, Sellers shall not compromise, settle
or adjust any claims to such award without Purchaser\'s prior written
consent.   (c) For the purposes of this Section 7.8, damage to the
Purchased Assets or a taking of a portion thereof shall be deemed to be "Non-
Material" if the reasonably estimated cost of restoration or repair of such
damage or the amount of the condemnation award with respect of such taking
shall not exceed $300,000.   (d) Sellers agree to give Purchaser prompt
notice of any taking, damage or destruction of the Purchased Assets prior to
the Closing.  7.9 AFFILIATE AGREEMENTS AND INTERCOMPANY ACCOUNTS.   Other
than as expressly provided in this Agreement or any Related Document, each
Seller agrees to cause (a) all agreements between or among a Seller and any
of its Affiliates that relate exclusively to the U.S. Business, and which are
listed in Section 5.11(d) of the Seller Disclosure   -37-   Schedule, to
be terminated and to be of no further force or effect upon or prior to the
consummation of the Closing, and (b) any and all intercompany receivable and
payable balances owing by, between or among a Seller and any of
its Affiliates that relate to the U.S. Business to be terminated and to be of
no further force or effect upon or prior to the consummation of the
Closing.  7.10 SERVICES AND PERIOD PAYABLES; CERTAIN TAXES.   All of the
services and period payables for the U.S. Business for items set forth in
Section 7.10 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule and all personal or real
property taxes (and any other Taxes charged based on the ownership of
the Assets and not operation, activities, receipts or other income of the
U.S. Business) and similar ad valorem obligations levied with respect to any
of the Purchased Assets (collectively, the "Apportioned Payables") shall be
apportioned between Purchaser, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other
hand, based on the number of days relating to a particular Apportioned
Payable that relates to the period prior to the Closing (the "Pre-Closing
Period") and the number of days relating to a particular Apportioned Payable
on and after the Closing Date (the "Post-Closing Period"). Sellers shall be
liable for the proportionate amount of all Apportioned Payables that are
attributable to the Pre-Closing Period, and Purchaser shall be liable for the
proportionate amount of all Apportioned Payables that are attributable to the
Post-Closing Period. Upon receipt of any bill relating to any Apportioned
Payable, the party that receives such bill shall present a statement to the
other party setting forth the amount for which such other party is
responsible, together with such supporting evidence as is reasonably
necessary to calculate the pro-ration amount. The pro-ration amount shall be
paid by the party owing it to the other party within fifteen (15) days after
delivery of such statement. In the event that either Sellers or
Purchaser shall make any payment for which the other party is responsible
pursuant to this Section 7.10, such Person shall be entitled to be reimbursed
for the amount of such payment and the other party shall make such
reimbursement promptly but in no event later than fifteen (15) days after the
presentation of a statement setting forth the amount of reimbursement to
which the presenting party is entitled, together with such supporting
evidence as is reasonably necessary to calculate the amount of such
reimbursement.  7.11 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.   (a) Remediation. Purchaser
will provide Sellers with prompt written notice of the discovery of
conditions that are potentially part of Sellers\' Environmental Obligations
under Section 2.2(b)(xii) hereof. Sellers shall remain responsible for the
cost and performance of Remediation Measures solely to the extent that such
Remediation Measures are required by any Governmental Entity under
Environmental, Health and Safety Laws, including Environmental, Health
and Safety Laws amended or enacted after Closing, and are part of
Sellers\' Environmental Obligations or Sellers\' obligations under Article 11
hereof. In the event of a Third Party Claim seeking the performance of
remediation measures, Purchaser shall comply with the notice requirements of
Section 11.3(a) of this Agreement. In addition to performing tasks that are
part of Sellers\' Environmental Obligations, Sellers may undertake such
Remediation Measures as they reasonably determine are required under
Environmental, Health and Safety Law or which they otherwise reasonably
believe are appropriate but they shall not be obligated to do so under the
terms hereof. In undertaking such Remediation Measures, Sellers shall not
unreasonably interfere with the operation of the U.S. Business and Purchaser
shall   -38-   reasonably cooperate with Sellers to facilitate Seller\'s
performance and completion of such Remediation Measures, including, allowing
reasonable access to the Facilities to Sellers and Sellers\' consultants and
contractors. Neither of Sellers shall have any responsibility for the cost or
performance of Remediation Measures undertaken by Purchaser or any Affiliate
of Purchaser, except to the extent Purchaser is entitled to indemnification
under Article 11. With respect to any Remediation Measure undertaken by
Sellers pursuant to the second sentence of this paragraph, Sellers shall be
deemed to have discharged such undertaking and its obligations with respect
thereto whenever it has paid the cost of such Remediation Measure and it has
received written notice from the pertinent Governmental Entity or Entities
that no further material Remediation Measures are then required. Before
submitting plans or reports to Governmental Authorities, Sellers will give
Purchaser an opportunity to comment on such reports and plans, and will make
reasonable good faith efforts to consider and address such comments.
Purchaser shall not have the rights of approval over such plans or
reports.   (b) Purchaser Covenants. With respect to Sellers\' rights
and obligations in respect of Remediation Measures, Purchaser agrees as
follows:   (i) It will grant to Sellers any easements or licenses (in 
recordable form, and in form and substance reasonably acceptable to  Sellers)
as reasonably necessary to allow Sellers and their  representatives,
contractors and agents, at reasonable times and upon  reasonable notice, to
use all facilities or equipment located at the  Facilities (at Sellers\' sole
cost and risk, and subject to the  availability of such facilities and
equipment after accounting for  Purchaser\'s reasonable, good faith needs)
and install equipment for the  purpose of performing the Remediation
Measures, and to carry out its  rights and obligations under this Section
7.11, and it will not relocate,  disturb or interfere with such equipment or
the performance of such  Remediation Measures in compliance with the
provisions of this Section  7.11;   (ii) It will provide Sellers and their
representatives,  contractors and agents with reasonable access to
environmental and other  relevant records (other than those which are
privileged) respecting the  site as reasonably necessary for the purpose of
carrying out such  Remediation Measures and will provide Sellers with copies
of all material  correspondence and communications with Governmental Entities
about such  Remediation Measures;   (iii) It will not submit, or cause to
be submitted, to any  Governmental Entity any information or comments
concerning any Remediation  Measures undertaken by Sellers except for
information routinely submitted  to Governmental Entities or as may be
otherwise required by Environmental,  Health and Safety Law; and   (iv)
Except as set forth on Section 7.11(b)(iv) of the Seller  Disclosure
Schedule, it will consult with Sellers in good faith prior to  extracting,
excavating or removing any soil or groundwater at any of the  Facilities or
otherwise disturbing or disrupting the same or undertaking  any activities or
construction that would disturb or disrupt any asbestos  containing materials
at any building included in the Facilities, and will  otherwise make
reasonable efforts to avoid taking any action, and will  take reasonable
steps to cause others to avoid taking any action, that  will increase or  
-39-    accelerate any of Sellers\' obligations hereunder including with
respect to  Remediation Measures.   (c) Information. Prior to the date
hereof, Purchaser has provided Sellers with correct and complete copies of
all studies and reports on the environmental condition of the Real Property,
including any Phase I and Phase II studies of the Facilities, completed by or
on behalf of Purchaser.  7.12 SELLERS ACCESS TO RECORDS.   Purchaser shall
maintain the books and records included in the Purchased Assets in accordance
with applicable Law and, in any case, for not less than seven (7) years
following the Closing Date. Following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
promptly provide such copies of the books and records included in the
Purchased Assets as Sellers shall reasonably request, provided that, from and
after the Closing Date, Sellers shall reimburse Purchaser for its out-of-
pocket costs incurred in connection therewith.  7.13 FINANCIAL
ASSURANCES.   (a) In the event, as of the end of any fiscal quarter period
of Purchaser that ends prior to the Expiration Date, the Consolidated
Interest Coverage Ratio for the four (4) fiscal quarters then ended
(calculated on a pro forma basis taking into account any acquisitions made by
Purchaser and its Affiliates including the assumption or retirement of
interest-bearing debt in connection therewith) is less than 1.0, then
Purchaser shall deliver, within 10 days of the date on which the Financial
Certificate is required to be delivered to Universal Music Group, Inc. in
accordance with Section 7.13(e), a security deposit in the amount of Five
Million Dollars ($5,000,000) (the "Security Deposit"), as security for the
full and faithful performance by Purchaser of its Applicable Obligations. The
Security Deposit shall be in the form of an unconditional, clean and
irrevocable letter of credit ("Letter of Credit") issued by and drawable upon
any commercial bank with offices in the City of New York having a net worth
of not less than $500,000,000. The Letter of Credit shall (i) name Universal
Music Group, Inc. as beneficiary, (ii) permit multiple drawings, (iii) be in
the amount of the Security Deposit, and (iv) be automatically self-renewing,
without amendment until the final date of any of the Manufacturing and
Distribution Agreements (the "Expiration Date"). If the Letter of Credit is
not renewed at least 60 days prior to the expiration thereof, Universal Music
Group, Inc. may draw upon the Letter of Credit and hold the proceeds thereof
as security for the performance of the Applicable Obligations.   (b)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Purchaser is required at any time to
deliver the Security Deposit and if as of the end of any subsequent fiscal
quarter period, the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio for the four
(4) fiscal quarters then ended (calculated on a pro forma basis taking into
account any acquisitions made by Purchaser and its Affiliates including the
assumption or retirement of interest-bearing debt in connection therewith) is
equal to or greater than 1.0, then Purchaser shall no longer be obligated to
provide the Security Deposit with respect to the past failure to meet the
required Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio. In such event, Universal Music
Group, Inc. shall (i) return to Purchaser the Letter of Credit then held by
Universal Music Group, Inc. and (ii) if Universal Music Group, Inc. shall
have properly drawn upon such Letter of Credit in accordance with this
Section 7.13, return to Purchaser that   -40-   portion, if any, of the
proceeds of the Letter of Credit remaining in Universal Music Group, Inc.\'s
possession after application of such proceeds to any Applicable Obligations
not paid by Purchaser.   (c) Purchaser agrees that in the event Purchaser
fails to pay any of its Applicable Obligations, Universal Music Group, Inc.
may draw upon the Letter of Credit (or the proceeds thereof) in an amount
equal to the amount of the Applicable Obligations not so paid by
Purchaser.   (d) On the Expiration Date, to the extent Universal Music
Group, Inc. holds all or any portion of the Security Deposit: (i) Universal
Music Group, Inc. shall return to Purchaser the Letter of Credit (or the
proceeds thereof) then held by Universal Music Group, Inc. or (ii) if
Universal Music Group, Inc. shall have properly drawn upon such Letter of
Credit in accordance with this Section 7.13, then Universal Music Group, Inc.
shall return to Purchaser that portion, if any, of the proceeds of the Letter
of Credit remaining in Universal Music Group, Inc.\'s possession after
application of such proceeds to any Applicable Obligations not paid by
Purchaser.   (e) Purchaser shall be required to deliver to Universal Music
Group, Inc. within forty-five (45) days after the end of each fiscal quarter,
either (i) an officer\'s certificate (the "Financial Certificate"), signed by
a financial officer of Purchaser, which shall state the Consolidated
Interest Coverage Ratio for such previous fiscal quarter, and such
certificate shall have appended thereto calculations which set forth
Purchaser\'s calculation of the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio with
respect to such fiscal quarter, or (ii) an officer\'s certificate delivered
by Purchaser or the parent of Purchaser to its primary lender with a credit
facility having a borrowing amount of no less than $25 million, which states
that Purchaser or the parent of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries are in
compliance with the consolidated interest coverage ratio contained in such
credit facility, provided, however, such consolidated interest coverage ratio
is calculated on a basis that is no less restrictive to the borrowing party
than the calculation of Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio under this
Agreement. If Purchaser complies with this covenant through delivery of the
certificate set forth in subsection (i) hereof, then Seller shall have the
right to audit the records of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries with respect
to the calculation of the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio. If
Purchaser complies with this covenant through delivery of the certificate by
the primary lender as set forth in subsection (ii) hereof, then Purchaser
shall, or shall cause its parent to, instruct its primary lender to send
Seller copies of any correspondence related to the consolidated interest
coverage ratio in the credit facility and instruct the primary lender to
permit Seller to review any audit performed by the primary lender related to
the consolidated interest coverage ratio.   (f) Sellers acknowledge that
the obligations of Purchaser under this Section 7.13 are coextensive with the
obligations of the Purchaser under the Share Purchase Agreement with respect
to Section 6.13 thereof and that if two Security Deposits shall be required
to be delivered at one time, under this Agreement and the Share Purchase
Agreement, the maximum amount that may be drawn upon such Security Deposits
in the aggregate shall be $5 million.   -41-   7.14 RECEIVABLES.   Set
forth in Section 7.14 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule is a list of accounts
receivables due to the Sellers from third parties identified in Section 7.14
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (the "Third Party Receivables").
Section 7.14 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule shall be updated immediately
prior to the Closing Date to reflect the estimated accounts receivable as of
such date and Sellers shall deliver a final listing within thirty (30) days
after the Closing. Purchaser agrees to exercise commercially reasonable
efforts to collect the Third Party Receivables on behalf of Sellers for a
period of ninety (90) days after the Closing Date; provided, however, that
Purchaser shall not be required to commence litigation or grant any
accommodation (financial or otherwise), or incur any other liability or
obligation in connection with such collection. Any payments received by
Purchaser or its successors and assigns after the Closing Date from any
client, customer or other party who is an obligor on any Third Party
Receivable (an "Account Party") shall, unless any such Account Party objects
or specifies otherwise, be applied to the oldest remaining undisputed Third
Party Receivables from such Account Party. Purchaser shall not agree to set-
off or otherwise discount any uncollected Third Party Receivables
without Sellers\' approval in their absolute and sole discretion. Upon
Purchaser\'s receipt of payments on account of any Third Party Receivables,
Purchaser shall remit such amounts to Sellers each thirty (30) days after the
Closing Date by wire transfer of immediately available funds. If ninety (90)
days after the Closing Date the full amount of the Third Party Receivables
has not been collected from any Account Party, then Purchaser shall turn over
to Sellers all evidence of and documents pertaining to any unpaid Third Party
Receivables in Purchaser\'s possession. After such ninety (90) day period,
Sellers and any designee shall be free to institute such collection efforts,
including, without limitation, initiating such legal proceedings with respect
thereto as they shall determine; provided that Sellers and any such designee
shall exercise reasonable care to avoid unnecessary damage to Purchaser\'s
relationships with such clients, customers and other obligors.  7.15
DISCLOSURE SCHEDULES.   Each of Sellers and Purchaser will promptly notify
the other of any changes or additions to the Seller Disclosure Schedule or
the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule, as applicable, by the delivery of updates
thereof, if any, as of a reasonably current date prior to the Closing but not
later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing. Such update will
constitute a part of the Seller Disclosure Schedule or the Purchaser
Disclosure Schedule, as applicable, from and after the date of delivery
unless otherwise noted in this Agreement.  7.16 EXPENSES   Whether or not
the Closing contemplated hereunder occurs, except as otherwise provided by
this Agreement, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party
incurring such expenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, costs associated with
preliminary title reports and title policies shall be borne by Sellers up to
the costs that would have been incurred were the title policies standard
coverage policies of title insurance, and the remaining costs, if
any, including costs for extended coverage, surveys and any endorsements will
be borne by Purchaser.   -42-    ARTICLE 8   EMPLOYEE MATTERS  8.1
EMPLOYEES.   (a) Section 5.15(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule lists
those employees of the U.S. Business to which Purchaser agrees to make offers
of Comparable Employment to be effective on either (i) the Closing Date or
(ii) the later of the Closing Date or if the Secondment Agreements are
entered into by Purchaser and Sellers, the date on which the Secondment
Agreement terminates or expires (the effective date of any employees\' offer
shall be the "Employment Date"). Purchaser shall provide Sellers with prior
written notice of its intent to make such offers of Comparable Employment,
which notice shall include the names of such employees. Purchaser will offer
employment to all employees of Sellers set forth in Section 5.15(a) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule. From the date hereof until the date which is
thirty (30) days after the Employment Date, none of Sellers nor any of their
respective Affiliates with operations in any segment of the music industry
shall interfere with Purchaser\'s ability to make offers of Comparable
Employment to the employees listed in Section 5.15(a) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule or the ability of any of Sellers\' employees to accept
such offers. Subject to applicable Law, Purchaser shall have
reasonable access to the employees of the U.S. Business for the purpose of
making offers of Comparable Employment. Each such employee who accepts
Purchaser\'s offer of employment and is hired by Purchaser as of the
Employment Date shall at such time become a "Transferred Employee."   (b)
Purchaser shall recognize the service time of all Transferred Employees, as
said service time is reflected in Section 5.15(a) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule for purposes of eligibility to participate and vest in Purchaser\'s
employee benefit plans. Purchaser agrees to give the Transferred Employees
full credit for the accrued vacation, sick time, holiday pay and personal
days earned or accrued by them during, and to which they are entitled as a
result of, their employment by Sellers, by allowing such Transferred Employee
such accrued vacation, sick time, holiday pay and personal days as to which
such Transferred Employees would have been entitled at the Employment
Date under the policies of Sellers if such Transferred Employees had
remained employees of Sellers, and, upon termination of employment, by making
full payment to such Transferred Employees of the accrued vacation, sick
time, holiday pay and personal days that such employees would have received
had they taken such accrued vacation, sick time, holiday pay and personal
days at their final rate of pay. Purchaser shall recognize the vesting
schedule for any portion of the 401(k) account of a Transferred Employee
which is unvested and will continue to vest such amounts in accordance with
the vesting schedule.   (c) Except as may be required by law or by any union
agreements as a result of a change in position, Purchaser shall not reduce
the salary of a Transferred Employee, as said salary is reflected in Section
5.15(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, for a period of twelve (12) months
from the Closing Date, to the extent such Transferred Employee remains
employed by Purchaser. Purchaser shall provide the same severance
compensation and substantially the same severance benefits, and shall
recognize service time of each Transferred Employee, as provided by Sellers
for a period of twelve (12) months from the Closing Date.   -43-    (d)
Purchaser will continue the employment of all management personnel identified
in Section 8.1(d) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule for a minimum of twelve
(12) consecutive months after the Closing Date on terms no less favorable
than would constitute terms of Comparable Employment for each management
person listed in Section 8.1(d) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, except for
any individual management person who is terminated for cause during such time
period.   (e) Purchaser shall cause each of the Transferred Employees who
was a participant in the Sellers\' 401(k) to be eligible to participate as of
the Closing Date in a plan ("Purchaser\'s 401(k)") qualifed under section
401(a) of the Code that includes a cash or deferred arrangement under Section
401(k) of the Code. Purchaser\'s 401(k) shall include such provisions as are
necessary to permit Purchaser\'s 401(k) to accept a plan-to-plan transfer of
assets and liabilities (including without limitation participant loans) from
Sellers\' 401(k) to Purchaser\'s 401(k) attributable to the account balances
in Sellers\' 401(k) of the Transferred Employees and to accept direct
rollovers by Transferred Employees with respect to eligible rollover
distributions from any other Employee Plan which is qualified under section
401(a) of the Code and which is maintained by Sellers or any of Sellers\'
ERISA Affiliates. With respect to the account balances of Transferred
Employees transferred to Purchaser\'s 401(k), Purchaser\'s 401(k) shall
contain the same "section 411(d)(6) protected benefits," within the meaning
of section 411(d)(6) of the Code and the regulations thereunder, and the same
vesting provisions, as Sellers\' 401(k) applicable to such transferred
account balances, except to the extent that such "section 411(d)(6) protected
benefits," and/or vesting provisions may be unilaterally eliminated or
reduced by a plan sponsor in connection with a plan-to-plan transfer. Sellers
shall, or shall cause one of their ERISA Affiliates, to assign the
sponsorship of the Kings Mountain 401(k) to Purchaser, or one of Purchaser\'s
ERISA Affiliates, at the Closing Date. Purchaser, or one of its ERISA
Affiliates shall be solely responsible for all benefits accrued under the
Kings Mountain 401(k) after the Closing Date.   (f) Purchaser shall provide
to Sellers evidence satisfactory to Sellers that Purchaser\'s 401(k) is
qualified under section 401(a) of the Code ("Evidence"). For such purposes, a
favorable determination letter issued by the Internal Revenue Service that
Purchaser\'s 401(k) is so qualified or the adoption by Purchaser of a
standardized prototype plan which has received a favorable opinion letter
from the Internal Revenue Service that it is so qualified shall be deemed
satisfactory. Within 10 business days of Sellers\' receipt of the Evidence,
Purchaser and Sellers shall each timely file a Form 5310-A with respect to
the proposed transfer of assets and liabilities of Sellers\'
401(k) attributable to the Transferred Employees, and Sellers shall provide
all requisite notices to the Transferred Employees of the transfer, including
a notice of any "blackout period." The transfer date shall be the date agreed
upon by Purchaser and Sellers and, in the absence of such agreement, it shall
be the first day of the third calendar month following the calendar month of
Sellers\' receipt of the Evidence. Purchaser shall be responsible for
"mapping" the investments of the account balances of Transferred Employees in
Sellers\' 401(k) to the investment options available under Purchaser\'s
401(k), with the objectives of minimizing both the duration of any "blackout
period" and the extent to which account balances in Sellers\' 401(k) are
required to be liquidated. Purchaser shall be responsible for setting up on
its payroll system repayment of participant loans included in the transferred
account balances of the Transferred Employees.   -44-   8.2 LIABILITIES
RELATED TO EMPLOYMENT AND BENEFITS.   Except as otherwise expressly provided
in Section 8.1(d), nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to limit
Purchaser\'s authority to terminate any Transferred Employee at any time
after the Employment Date. All U.S. Business Employees who are not
Transferred Employees shall remain the sole responsibility of Sellers.
Additionally, as provided in Section 2.2(b)(ix) of this Agreement, and except
as provided in Section 8.3 of this Agreement, Sellers will at all times
before and after the Closing Date be solely responsible for
Liabilities incurred prior to the Closing Date which arise from or are
related to Sellers\' or their Subsidiaries\' failure to comply with all Laws
concerning the hiring and retention of U.S. Business Employees which relate
to wages, hours, equal opportunity, collective bargaining, employment
standards, employment classifications, working conditions, immigration,
disability, the payment of social security and other taxes, or any other
employment-related Law. Each Transferred Employee shall be entitled to
benefits under the employee benefit plans of Purchaser under the terms of
each such plan.  8.3 WARN ACT.   (a) Purchaser will be solely responsible
for obligations (including notice) under the WARN Act that arise based in any
part on events that occur on or after the Closing Date with respect to any
Transferred Employee or arising as a result of any breach of Purchaser\'s
obligations under Section 8.1(a); provided that Purchaser shall have a right
of indemnity against Sellers to the extent that WARN Act Liability results,
in whole or in part, from a breach of Sellers\' representations under Section
5.15(d) or Seller\'s obligations pursuant to Section 8.4.   (b) Sellers
will be solely responsible for obligations under the WARN Act with respect to
the any employee of the U.S. Business that is not a Transferred Employee,
except to the extent provided in Section 8.3(a).   (c) Except as set forth
in Section 8.3(c) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, Sellers shall not cause
any "plant closing" or "mass layoff" with respect to the U.S. Business within
the meaning of the WARN Act between the date hereof and the Closing Date.
Sellers shall update Section 5.15(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule within
three days of the Closing Date to reflect any employee of the U.S. Business
who suffered a "separation from employment" or "employment loss" as those
terms are defined by the WARN Act.  8.4 LAYOFF BY SELLERS.   Neither
Seller shall, on or within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, provide
notice of or otherwise effectuate a "Plant Closing" or "Mass Layoff", as
those terms are defined for purposes of the WARN Act, affecting in whole or
in part any facility, site of employment, operating unit or employee of such
Seller; provided that such Sellers\' performance of its duties under
Section 8.3 of this Agreement shall not constitute a violation of this
Section 8.4.  8.5 HEALTH BENEFITS.   Purchaser shall provide the
Transferred Employees a program of health care, life insurance, and
disability benefits which is substantially comparable in the aggregate to the
program of health care, life insurance, and disability benefits currently
provided by Sellers or   -45-   their pertinent Affiliates, as the case
may be, provided, however, that such health care, life insurance, and
disability benefits shall be immediately available to the Transferred
Employees as of the Employment Date, and the Transferred Employees shall
become as of the Employment Date participants thereunder, without regard to
any applicable waiting period or any limitation with respect to preexisting
conditions except insofar as such waiting period or limitation gives full
credit to such Transferred Employees for the period of time during which he
or she was employed by Sellers and their Affiliates. Purchaser shall be
responsible for all legally mandated continuation coverage for all
Transferred Employees and their covered dependents who have a loss of health
care coverage due to a qualifying event on or occurring following the Closing
Date. Sellers shall be responsible for all legally mandated
continuation coverage for all employees of Sellers who are not Transferred
Employees and their covered dependents who have a loss of health care
coverage due to a qualifying event occurring on or before the Closing
Date.  8.6 WORKER\'S COMPENSATION CLAIMS.   Sellers shall be responsible
and liable for the expense of all worker\'s compensation claims that arise
out of any illness or injury sustained by any Transferred Employee on or
before the Closing Date. Purchaser shall be liable for the expense of all
worker\'s compensation claims that arise out of any illness or injury
sustained by any Transferred Employee after the Closing Date.   ARTICLE

reasonably necessary for the filing of all Tax Returns, the making of an

transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne one-half by
Purchaser, on the one hand, and one-half by Sellers, on the other hand.
Purchaser and Sellers shall cooperate in providing each other with
any appropriate resale exemption certifications and other similar

shall do so, and the other party shall cooperate with respect thereto as
necessary to complete the calculation and payment of all applicable Transfer
Taxes.   (c) All payments hereunder shall be made free and clear and
without the withholding of any Taxes, except to the extent required by

contained in this Agreement giving effect,  subject to Section 10.2(a), to
any supplements to the Seller Disclosure  Schedule;   (iii) the breach or
violation of or failure to perform any  agreement, undertaking, obligation or
covenant of Sellers contained in  this Agreement;   (iv) any Excluded

responsibility of Sellers  pursuant to Sections 7.10 or 9.2 hereof.  
-52-    (b) From and after the Closing, subject to the further terms of
this Article 11, Purchaser Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify Seller
Indemnified Persons for, and hold them harmless from and against, any and all
Seller Losses arising from or in connection with any of the following:  
(i) the untruth, inaccuracy or breach of any representation or  warranty of
Purchaser contained in this Agreement giving effect to any  supplement to the
schedules hereto;   (ii) the breach of any agreement, undertaking,
obligation or  covenant of Purchaser contained in this Agreement;   (iii)
any Assumed Liability;   (iv) the assertion of any Losses against any

Purchaser  pursuant to Sections 7.10 or 9.2 hereof.  11.2 ASSERTION OF
CLAIMS.   No claim shall be brought under Section 11.1 hereof unless the
Indemnified Persons, or any of them, at any time prior to the applicable
Survival Date, give the Indemnifying Persons (a) written notice of the
existence of any such claim, specifying the nature and basis of such claim
and the amount thereof, to the extent known or ascertainable, or (b) written
notice pursuant to Section 11.3 of any Third Party Claim, the existence of
which might reasonably be expected to give rise to such a claim; provided,
however, that no delay on the part of the Indemnified Persons in notifying
any Indemnifying Persons shall relieve the Indemnifying Persons from any
Liability hereunder unless (and then solely to the extent) the Indemnifying
Person thereby is materially prejudiced by the delay. Upon the giving of such
written notice as aforesaid, the Indemnified Persons, or any of them, shall
have the right to commence legal proceedings subsequent to the Survival Date
(for a period up to ninety (90) days after the Survival Date) for the
enforcement of their rights under Section 11.1 with respect to the matters
indicated in such notice.  11.3 NOTICE AND DEFENSE OF THIRD PARTY
CLAIMS.   The obligations and Liabilities of an Indemnifying Person with
respect to Losses resulting from the assertion of Liability by third parties
(including any Governmental Entity) (each, a "Third Party Claim") shall be
subject to the following additional terms and conditions (provided, however,
that subparagraphs (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this Section 11.3 shall not
apply to Third Party Claims seeking the performance of remediation measures,
which are subject to the procedures set forth in Section 7.11 of this
Agreement):   (a) The Indemnified Persons, or any one of them, shall
promptly give written notice to the Indemnifying Persons, or any of them, of
any Third Party Claim which might give   -53-   rise to any Loss by the
Indemnified Persons, stating the nature and basis of such Third Party Claim,
and the amount thereof to the extent known; provided, however, that no delay
on the part of the Indemnified Persons in notifying any Indemnifying Persons
shall relieve the Indemnifying Persons from any Liability or obligation
hereunder unless (and then solely to the extent) the Indemnifying Person
thereby is materially prejudiced by the delay. Such notice shall
be accompanied by copies of all relevant documentation with respect to such
Third Party Claim, including any summons, complaint or other pleading which
may have been served, any written demand or any other document or instrument
or other documents received and the Indemnified Person shall otherwise make
available to the Indemnifying Person all relevant information material to the
defense of such claim and within such Indemnified Person\'s possession.  
(b) The Indemnifying Persons shall have the right to assume the defense of
any Third Party Claim at their own expense and by their own counsel, which
counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified
Persons; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Persons shall not have the
right to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim upon receipt of a
written notice from an Indemnified Person that: (i) the Indemnified Persons
shall have been advised by counsel that there are one or more legal or
equitable defenses available to them which are different from or in addition
to those available to the Indemnifying Persons and representation of both
parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to the actual or
potential differences between them, (ii) such action could have a material
effect on the business, operations, assets, properties, prospects or
relationships of the Indemnified Persons, or (iii) the Indemnifying Persons
shall not have assumed the defense of the Third Party Claim in a timely
fashion such that the Indemnified Person has suffered material prejudice.  
(c) If the Indemnifying Persons shall assume the defense of a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Persons shall not be responsible for any legal
or other defense costs subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Persons
in connection with the defense thereof. If the Indemnifying Persons do not
assume the defense of any Third Party Claim or are otherwise restricted from
so assuming by the proviso to the first sentence of Section 11.3(b),
the Indemnifying Persons shall nevertheless be entitled to participate in
such defense with their own counsel and at their own expense. If the defense
of a Third Party Claim is assumed by the Indemnified Persons, the Indemnified
Persons shall not be entitled to settle such Third Party Claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnifying Persons, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.   (d) If the Indemnifying Persons assume
the defense of a Third Party Claim, (i) the Indemnified Persons shall be
entitled to participate in such defense with their own counsel at their own
expense and (ii) the Indemnifying Persons shall not make any settlement of
any claims without the written consent of the Indemnified Persons, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.   (e) The
Indemnifying Person may assume and control, or bear the costs, of any defense
of a Third Party Claim, subject to its reservation of a right to contest the
Indemnified Person\'s right to indemnification hereunder, provided that the
Indemnifying Person gives the Indemnified Person notice of such reservation
within fifteen (15) days of the date of the written notice of the Third Party
Claim.   -54-   11.4 SURVIVAL.   The representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing until the date that is
18 months after the Closing; provided, however, that (a) the representations
and warranties contained in Sections 5.1, 5.2, 5.4 and the first sentence of
Section 5.8(a)(1) of this Agreement, shall survive the termination of this
Agreement indefinitely, (b) the representations and warranties contained in
(i) Sections 5.6 and (ii) Section 5.16, shall survive the Closing Date until
sixty (60) days following the expiration of the respective statutes of
limitation applicable to the matters covered thereby and (c) the
representations and warranties contained in Section 5.17 and the indemnities
for Sellers\' Environmental Obligations, shall survive the Closing until the
date that is seven (7) years after the Closing (the representations and
warranties listed in the foregoing clauses (a), (b) and (c) (the "Excluded
Representations"). The covenants and other agreements of the parties
contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing Date until they are
fully performed. For convenience of reference, the date upon which
any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein
shall terminate is referred to herein as the "Survival Date". Subject to the
specific provisions of this Article II, indemnification claims made hereunder
shall be made on or before the applicable Survival Date for such claim as
provided in this Section 11.4.  11.5 LIMITS ON INDEMNIFICATION.   (a) No
amount shall be payable by any Indemnifying Person pursuant to Section
11.1(a)(i) of this Agreement or Section 10.1(a)(i) of the Share Purchase
Agreement, on the one hand, or Section 11.1(b)(i) of this Agreement
or Section 10.1(b)(i) of the Share Purchase Agreement, on the other hand,
unless the aggregate amount of Losses indemnifiable under such sections
exceeds $400,000 (the "Threshold Amount"), in which event the right to be
indemnified shall apply to the full amount of such Losses in excess of the
Threshold Amount; provided, however, that individual claims resulting from a
breach of Section 5.8(b) of $5,000 or less shall not be aggregated for
purposes of calculating the Threshold Amount or the Losses in excess of the
Threshold Amount. Purchaser shall not be entitled to recover any amounts
under Article 11 from Sellers if the basis for any claim for indemnity is or
has been the basis for any claim under the Manufacturing and Distribution
Agreements. The parties agree that the same claim shall not be permitted to
be brought under both this Agreement and any Related Document.   (b)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (i) the
maximum amount of aggregate indemnifiable Losses which may be recovered from
any Indemnifying Person pursuant to Section 11.1(a)(i) of this Agreement or
Section 10.1(a)(i) or of the Share Purchase Agreement, on the one hand, or
Section 11.1(b)(i) of this Agreement or Section 10.1(b)(i) of the
Share Purchase Agreement, on the other hand, shall be an amount equal to
$8,000,000 in the aggregate and a maximum of $4,000,000 under each of this
Agreement and the Share Purchase Agreement, and (ii) the maximum amount of
the aggregate indemnifiable Losses which may be recovered from Seller
Indemnifying Persons pursuant to Section 11.1(a)(ii), and 11.1(a)(vi) of this
Agreement shall be an amount equal to the aggregate Purchase Price paid under
this Agreement, as finally adjusted in accordance with Article 3, plus the
aggregate amount of the credits issued under Section 10.8 of the U.S. CD
Manufacturing Agreement and 10.8 of the U.S. Distribution Agreement.   
-55-    (c) It is understood by the parties hereto that the limitations
set forth in Section 11.5(a) or Section 11.5(b) do not apply to, and will not
limit in any manner, Purchaser\'s or Sellers\' right to indemnification
pursuant to any other provision of Article 11 of this Agreement or Article X
of the Share Purchase Agreement. It is further understood by the parties
hereto that the limitations set forth in Section 11.5(a) or Section 11.5(b)
do not apply to, and will not limit in any manner, Purchaser\'s right to
indemnification with respect to any breaches of representations and
warranties which do not exceed the Closing Threshold and, therefore, do not
cause a failure of the condition in Section 10.2(a).   (d) In computing
Losses, such amounts shall be computed net of any related recoveries the
Indemnified Person has received from insurance policies, or other related
payments received from third parties, and net of any Tax benefits that
actually reduce cash taxes by the Indemnified Person. If an Indemnified
Person is entitled to receive an insurance recovery or related payment from a
third party with respect to any Loss and receives any amounts after payment
by the Indemnifying Party of such Loss or actually reduces cash taxes as a
result of any such Loss, then the Indemnified Person shall reimburse the
Indemnifying Party for any such amount.   (e) In computing Losses that
result from the untruth, inaccuracy or breach of any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement that is qualified by materiality or
Material Adverse Effect, the related "Losses" shall be deemed to be the
entire value associated with the untruth, inaccuracy or breach once such
representation or warranty has been determined to be untrue, inaccurate or
breached. For illustration purposes solely, and without the dollar values
expressed in this paragraph being probative in any way with respect to the
intent of the parties with respect to the definition of Material
Adverse Effect and materiality, if (i) a Material Adverse Effect is deemed to
be valued at $250,000; and (ii) a breach of a representation has resulted in
"Losses" of $250,001, then the applicable "Losses" associated with such
breach shall be deemed to be $250,001 (and not $1.00).   (f) Absent fraud
or unless otherwise specifically provided herein, the sole remedy for damages
of a party hereto for any breach of the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement shall be the remedies
contained in Article 11.   (g) Any conversions between United States dollars
and another currency shall be based on the average of the exchange rates for
such conversion published in the Wall Street Journal on each of the five (5)
Business Days preceding the day on which such conversion is to be calculated
for purposes of carrying the terms of this Agreement. If the Wall Street
Journal is not published on a Business Day in question, then the exchange
rate published in the New York Times on such Business Day shall be used or,
if neither is published on such Business Day, then the exchange rate quoted
on such Business Day, or quoted the nearest Business Day preceding such
Business Day, by Citibank, N.A. (or its successor), in New York City, New
York, shall be used.   -56-   11.6 INDEMNIFICATION PAYMENTS.   Once a
Loss is finally adjudicated to be payable pursuant to this Article 11, the
Indemnifying Person shall satisfy its obligations within fifteen
(15) Business Days of such final, nonappealable adjudication by wire transfer
of immediately available funds. The parties hereto agree that should
an Indemnifying Person not make full payment within such fifteen (15)
Business Day period, that any amount payable shall accrue interest,
compounded annually, calculated from the date of final, nonappealable
adjudication until such payment has been made, at a rate of 6% per annum. The
parties hereto agree that any indemnification payment pursuant to this
Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.  
ARTICLE 12   TERMINATION; EFFECT OF TERMINATION  12.1 TERMINATION.  
This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the consummation of the
Closing by:   (a) the mutual written consent of Sellers and Purchaser;
or   (b) Purchaser, if there has been a material breach by Sellers of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this
Agreement which is not cured by Sellers within ten (10) days after written
notice thereof; or   (c) Sellers, if there has been a material breach by
Purchaser of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in
this Agreement which is not cured by Purchaser within ten (10) days after
written notice thereof; or   (d) Purchaser, if the conditions set forth in
Sections 10.1 or 10.2 (other than those conditions which by their nature are
to be satisfied as part of the Closing) shall not have been satisfied or
waived on or prior to July 31, 2005; or   (e) Sellers, if the conditions
set forth in Sections 10.1 or 10.3 (other than those conditions which by
their nature are to be satisfied as part of the Closing) shall not have been
satisfied or waived on or prior to July 31, 2005; or   (f) Purchaser, or
Sellers, if any permanent injunction or other Order of a court or other
competent authority preventing the Closing shall have become final and
nonappealable; or   (g) either Seller, if a Seller concurrently enters into
a definitive agreement for a Superior Proposal in accordance with, or has
otherwise complied with, all provisions of Section 7.4 hereof and
concurrently with such termination, Seller shall have paid to Purchaser the
Termination Fee; or   (h) either Seller or Purchaser, if a Termination Fee
has been paid by Sellers\' Affiliate upon the termination of the Share
Purchase Agreement by Sellers\' Affiliate.  provided, however, that no
party shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement if such party\'s breach
of this Agreement has prevented the satisfaction of a condition. Any
termination pursuant to this Section 12.1 (other than a termination pursuant
to Section 12.1(a)) shall be effected by written notice from the party or
parties so terminating to the other parties hereto, which notice shall
specify the section of this Agreement pursuant to which this Agreement is
being terminated.   -57-   12.2 EFFECT OF TERMINATION.   In the event
of the termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 12.1, this
Agreement shall be of no further force or effect, except for the
last sentence of Section 7.1, Section 7.5, this Section 12.2 and Article 13,
each of which shall survive the termination of this Agreement. Without
limiting the rights of the parties pursuant to Section 13.13, if there shall
have occurred an intentional or willful breach by any party of any one or
more representations and warranties or covenants in this Agreement and as a
result thereof this Agreement is terminated by Sellers, on the one hand, or
Purchaser, on the other hand, pursuant to Sections 12.1(b), (c), (d) or (e),
respectively, then the remedies shall not be limited by the provisions of
this Agreement.   ARTICLE 13   MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS  13.1
AMENDMENT.   This Agreement shall not be altered or otherwise modified or
amended except pursuant to an instrument in writing signed by Purchaser and
Sellers. No waiver by any party of any default, misrepresentation, or breach
of warranty or covenant hereunder, whether intentional or not, shall be
deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation, or
breach of warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in any way any rights
arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence.  13.2 ENTIRE
AGREEMENT.   This Agreement and the other agreements and documents
referenced herein (including, the schedules and the exhibits attached hereto)
contain all of the agreements among the parties hereto with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby and supersede all prior agreements,
understandings and negotiations, oral and written, among the parties with
respect thereto.  13.3 SEVERABILITY.   It is the desire and intent of the
parties that the provisions of this Agreement be enforced to the fullest
extent permissible under the Law and public policies applied in each
jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought. Accordingly, in the event that
any provision of this Agreement would be held in any jurisdiction to be
invalid, prohibited or unenforceable for any reason, such provision, as to
such jurisdiction, shall be ineffective, without invalidating the remaining
provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of
such provision in any other jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
such provision could be more narrowly drawn so as not to be invalid,
prohibited or unenforceable in such jurisdiction, it shall, as to
such jurisdiction, be so narrowly drawn, without invalidating the
remaining provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or
enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.  
-58-   13.4 BENEFITS OF AGREEMENT.   All the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and
their respective successors and permitted assigns. This Agreement shall not
be assignable by any party hereto without the consent of the other parties
hereto; provided, however, that anything contained herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, Purchaser may, without the prior written consent of any
other party, assign any or all of their rights and interests hereunder to any
lender providing financing to Purchaser or to any Affiliate of Purchaser. No
assignment shall relieve the assignor of any of its obligations hereunder.
Sellers agree that, if either Seller is acquired (or any portion of either
Seller is acquired in a transaction that purports to transfer such Sellers\'
rights and/or obligations under this Agreement), any acquiring Person (or
such transferee) must agree in writing to be bound by the obligations of
Sellers, as applicable, under this Agreement or any Related Document prior to
such acquisition (or transfer) becoming effective. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Sellers agree to remain liable for their respective obligations
hereunder regardless of whether such entity (or portion thereof) is acquired
(or transferred). Except as specifically set forth herein, no Person other
than Sellers, Purchaser and their respective successors and permitted assigns
shall have any rights under this Agreement.  13.5 FEES AND EXPENSES.  
Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the parties hereto
shall each bear their own expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement

WARRANTIES   All covenants hereunder shall be given independent effect so
that if a certain action or condition constitutes a default under a certain
covenant, the fact that such action or condition is permitted by another
covenant shall not affect the occurrence of such default, unless expressly
permitted under an exception to such initial covenant; provided that if a
certain action requires consent with respect to a certain conduct hereunder
and the party required to grant consent to such action in order for the other
party to avoid a breach of such covenant grants such consent in accordance
with the requirements of this Agreement, such granted consent shall be deemed
granted as well hereunder with respect to any additional covenant for which a
consent would be required in order to avoid a covenant breach. In addition,
all representations and warranties hereunder shall be given independent
effect so that if a particular representation or warranty is breached, the
fact that another representation or warranty concerning the same or similar
subject matter is not breached shall not affect a breach of the particular
representation and warranty hereunder.  13.12 INTERPRETATION;
