vii  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of April 21, 2013 (this "
_Agreement_ "), is entered into by and among MET-PRO CORPORATION, a
Pennsylvania corporation (the " _Company_ "), CECO ENVIRONMENTAL CORP., a
Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), MUSTANG ACQUISITION INC., a Delaware
corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger
Sub_"), and MUSTANG ACQUISITION II INC., a Delaware corporation and a direct
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Successor Sub_ "). The Company, Parent,
Merger Sub and Successor Sub are herein referred to collectively as the "
_Parties_ " and each individually as a " _Party_."

 

WITNESSETH

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub have
determined that it is in the best interests of their respective stockholders
that the Company, Parent and Merger Sub enter into a business combination
pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the "
_First Step Merger_ "), with the Company continuing as the surviving
corporation in the First Step Merger and as a direct wholly owned subsidiary
of Parent (the " _First Step Surviving Corporation_ ");

WHEREAS, the Parties have determined that immediately following the
effectiveness of the First Step Merger, and in pursuance of the overall plan
to combine the business activities of the Company and Parent, the First Step
Surviving Corporation shall be merged with and into Successor Sub (the "
_Second Step Merger_ " and, together with the First Step Merger, the "
_Mergers_ "), with Successor Sub continuing as the surviving entity in the
Second Step Merger and as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the "
_Surviving Entity_ ");

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub
and Successor Sub have determined that the Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated hereby are consistent with, and in furtherance of, their
respective business strategies and goals and have each adopted and approved
this Agreement and the Mergers upon the terms and conditions set forth
herein;

WHEREAS, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the
Mergers shall be treated as a single integrated transaction, as contemplated
and described in Rev. Rul. 2001-46, 2001-2 C.B. 321, and shall qualify as a
reorganization within the meaning of, and as contemplated by, Section
368(a)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively, the " _Code_ ");

WHEREAS, the Parties recognize that if the Mergers do not so qualify as a
reorganization, the First Step Merger and the Second Step Merger will be
treated as separate transactions for U.S. federal income tax purposes not
subject to the "integration doctrine" pursuant to Rev. Rul. 90-95, 1990-2 C.B.
67; and

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, certain
shareholders of Parent are executing Lock-Up Agreements in the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the " _Lock-Up Agreements_ "), which Lock-Up Agreements
shall become effective only upon the First Step Effective Time, and a Voting
Agreement in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ (the " _Voting
Agreement_ "), which Voting Agreement shall become effective upon execution of
this Agreement.

 



1 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and
agreements herein contained, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the Parties hereby
agree as follows:

4 ARTICLE II

_EFFECT OF THE MERGERS ON CAPITAL STOCK_

_OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS _

Section 2.1 Conversion of Company Capital Stock. At the First Step Effective
Time, by virtue of the First Step Merger and without any further action on the
part of Parent, Merger Sub, Successor Sub, the Company or the holders of any
of the shares of any capital stock of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or
Successor Sub:

(a) All Common Shares, $0.10 par value, of the Company (the " _Company Common
Stock_ ") held in treasury or owned directly by the Company, any Subsidiary
of the Company, Merger Sub, Successor Sub or Parent (other than shares held in
trust accounts, managed accounts and similar accounts) shall cease to exist,
and such shares, including any certificates therefore, shall automatically be
cancelled and retired, shall not represent capital stock of the First Step
Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Entity, and shall not be exchanged for
the Merger Consideration. Shares of Company Common Stock that are canceled
and retired pursuant to this _Section 2.1(a)_ are hereinafter referred to as
" _Excluded Shares_ "; and

(b) Each share of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares) issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the First Step Effective Time shall be
converted into and become the right to receive the following consideration:

(i) Each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which an election to
receive cash (a " _Cash Election_ ") has been properly made pursuant to
_Section 2.2(c) _and not lost, revoked or changed pursuant to _Section
2.2(e) _(each a " _Cash Electing Company Share_ ") shall (subject to 
_Section 2.3_) be converted into the right to receive $13.75 in cash without
interest (such per share amount is hereinafter referred to as the " _Cash
Consideration_ ").

 

(ii) Each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which an election to
receive stock consideration (a " _Stock Election_ ") has been properly made
pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_ and not lost, revoked or changed pursuant to
_Section 2.2(e)_ (each a " _Stock Electing Company Share_ ") shall (subject
to  _Section 2.3_) be converted into the right to receive the number of
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Parent (the " _Parent Common Stock_ ") determined
by dividing (A) $13.75 by (B) the Parent Trading Price (such quotient,
calculated to the nearest one ten-thousandth, the " _Exchange Ratio_"),
subject to adjustment in accordance with _Section 2.1(d)_ (such per share
amount, together with any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.1(d)_, is hereinafter referred to as
the " _Parent Common Stock Consideration_ "); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
(x) if the number determined by dividing $13.75 by the Parent Trading Price is
less than or equal to 1.0000, the Exchange Ratio shall be 1.0000 and (y) if
the number determined by dividing $13.75 by the Parent Trading Price is
greater than or equal to 1.3520, the Exchange Ratio shall be 1.3520. Without
limiting the foregoing, without the prior written consent of Parent, in no
event shall the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
pursuant to this _Article II_ exceed 9,650,000 shares. As used in this
Agreement, the term " _Parent Trading Price_ " means the volume weighted
average trading price of a share of Parent Common Stock on the NASDAQ Global
Market (" _NASDAQ_ ") for the fifteen (15) consecutive trading days ending on
the trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date, as calculated by
Bloomberg Financial LP under the function "VWAP".

 

(iii) Each share of Company Common Stock that is not (A) an Excluded Share or
(B) a share of Company Common Stock with respect to which a Cash Election or
a Stock Election has been properly made pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_ and not
lost, revoked or changed pursuant to _Section 2.2(e)_ (each, a " _Non-
Electing Company Share_ ") shall be converted into the right to receive the
Cash Consideration or the Parent Common Stock Consideration, as determined
pursuant to _Section 2.3_.

(c) Effective as of the First Step Effective Time, each share of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First Step
Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares) shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of

 



5  certificates or evidence of shares in book-entry form which immediately
prior to the First Step Effective Time evidenced such shares of Company Common
Stock (each a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor upon
surrender of such Certificate in accordance with _Section 3.2_. For purposes
of this Agreement, the term " _Merger Consideration_ " with respect to a
given share of Company Common Stock shall mean either the Cash Consideration
(with respect to a share of Company Common Stock representing the right to
receive the Cash Consideration) or the Parent Common Stock Consideration
(with respect to a share of Company Common Stock representing the right to
receive the Parent Common Stock Consideration).

 

(d) _No Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
(including any certificates or scrips representing fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock) shall be issued in respect of shares of Company Common
Stock that are to be converted in the First Step Merger into the right to
receive shares of Parent Common Stock. Each holder of a Certificate
(other than holders of Certificates representing Excluded Shares) shall be
entitled to receive, in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock to
which such holder would otherwise have been entitled pursuant to _Sections
2.1(b)_ and  _2.3_ , an amount in cash (without interest), rounded to the
nearest whole cent, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the
fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise
be entitled (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock
held by such holder immediately prior to the First Step Effective Time, such
holders unrevoked Cash Elections and Stock Elections and the provisions of
_Section 2.3_) by (ii) the Parent Trading Price. For purposes of determining
any fractional shares interest, to the extent practicable, all shares of
Company Common Stock owned by a holder of record of Company Common Stock
(other than holders of Excluded Shares) shall be combined so as to calculate
the maximum number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to such
holder of record of Company Common Stock (other than holders of Excluded
Shares). For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent practicable, the amount of
cash per share of Company Common Stock to be paid to any holder of record
pursuant to this _Section 2.1(d)_ shall not exceed the Parent Trading Price.

(e) _Adjustments_. If, on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
First Step Effective Time, Parent splits, combines into a smaller number of
shares, or issues by reclassification any shares of Parent Common Stock, then
the Parent Common Stock Consideration and any dependent items shall be
appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of Company Common Stock the
same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action,
and as so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event, be the Parent
Common Stock Consideration or other dependent item, as applicable, subject to
further adjustment in accordance with this _Section 2.1(e)_. 

Section 2.2 Election Procedures.

(a) Promptly after the execution of this Agreement, Parent shall designate and
appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as
exchange agent hereunder (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose of
exchanging Certificates.

(b) Parent shall prepare and file as an exhibit to the Registration Statement
a form of election, and other appropriate and customary transmittal materials,
in such form and containing such provisions as Parent and the Company shall
mutually agree consistent with the terms of this Agreement (collectively, the
" _Form of Election_ "). The Form of Election shall permit each Person who, at
or prior to the Election Deadline, is a record holder (or, in the case of
nominee record holders, the beneficial owner, through proper instructions and
documentation) of any share of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded
Shares) to specify the number of such holders shares of Company Common Stock
with respect to which such holder makes a Cash Election and/or the number of
such holders shares of Company Common Stock with respect to which such holder
makes a Stock Election. The Form of Election shall specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the completed Form of Election and any
Certificates to the Exchange Agent. The Company shall mail, or cause to be
mailed, reasonably in advance of the Election Deadline, the Form of Election
to all Persons who are record holders of shares of Company Common Stock as of
the record date for the Company Stockholders Meeting. The Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to make, or cause to

 



6  be made, the Form of Election available to all Persons who become holders of
record (or beneficial owners) of shares of Company Common Stock during the
period between the record date for the Company Stockholders Meeting and the
close of business on the last Business Day immediately preceding the Election
Deadline. As used in this Agreement, " _Election Deadline_ " means 5:00 p.m.,
Eastern time, on the date that is three (3) Business Days immediately
preceding the Closing Date (or on such other date as the Parties mutually
agree).

 

(c) Any such election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent
shall have received at its designated office, by the Election Deadline, a
Form of Election properly completed and signed and accompanied by Certificates
representing the shares of Company Common Stock to which such Form of Election
relates (or customary affidavits and indemnifications regarding the loss or
destruction of such Certificates or by an appropriate guarantee of delivery of
such Certificates as set forth in such Form of Election from a firm that is an
"eligible guarantor institution" (as defined in Rule 17Ad-15 under
the Exchange Act); _provided_ , that such Certificates are in fact delivered
to the Exchange Agent by the time set forth in such guarantee of delivery).
Holders of record of shares of Company Common Stock who hold such shares as
nominees, trustees or in other representative capacities may submit multiple
Forms of Election; _provided_ that each such Form of Election covers all of
the shares of Company Common Stock held by each such nominee, trustee or
representative for a particular beneficial owner. Any share of Company Common
Stock (other than Excluded Shares) with respect to which a proper Cash
Election or Stock Election has not been made as aforesaid shall be deemed to
be a Non-Electing Company Share. After a Cash Election or a Stock Election is
properly made with respect to any share of Company Common Stock, no further
registration of transfers of such share shall be made on the stock transfer
books of the Company, unless and until such Cash Election or Stock Election
is properly revoked.

(d) Parent and the Company shall publicly announce the anticipated date of the
Election Deadline at least five (5) Business Days prior to the anticipated
Closing Date. If the Closing Date is delayed to a subsequent date, the
Election Deadline shall be similarly delayed to a subsequent date, and Parent
and the Company shall promptly announce any such delay and, when determined,
the rescheduled Election Deadline.

(e) Any Cash Election or Stock Election may be revoked or changed with
respect to all or any portion of the shares of Company Common Stock subject
thereto (but only in whole share amounts) by the holder who submitted the
applicable Form of Election by such holder submitting to the Exchange Agent a
written notice of such revocation or change and such written notice is
actually received by the Exchange Agent at or prior to the Election Deadline.
In addition, all Cash Elections and Stock Elections shall automatically
be revoked if this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Article IX_.
If a Cash Election or Stock Election is properly and timely revoked or changed
with respect to any shares of Company Common Stock, the Certificate or
Certificates relating to such revoked or changed Form of Election shall be
promptly returned to the holder or representative that submitted the same to
the Exchange Agent, except to the extent (if any) a subsequent Cash Election
and/or Stock Election is properly made with respect to any or all of the
shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate or
Certificates.

(f) The good faith determination of the Exchange Agent (or the joint
determination of Parent and the Company, in the event that the Exchange Agent
declines to make any such determination) shall be conclusive and binding as to
whether or not Cash Elections and Stock Elections shall have been properly
made, revoked or changed pursuant to this _Section 2.2_ and as to when Cash
Elections, Stock Elections, revocations and changes were received by the
Exchange Agent. The Exchange Agent shall have reasonable discretion to
disregard immaterial defects in the Forms of Election. Neither the Exchange
Agent, Parent nor the Company shall be under any obligation to notify any
Person of any defect in a Form of Election. The Exchange Agent (or Parent and
the Company jointly, in the event that the Exchange Agent declines to make the
following computations) shall also make all computations as to the proration
contemplated by _Section 2.3_, and absent manifest error such
computations shall be conclusive and binding on Parent, the Company and all
holders of Company Common Stock. The Exchange Agent may, with the written
agreement of Parent and the consent of the Company (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), make any rules that are
consistent with this _Section 2.2_ for the implementation of the Cash
Elections and Stock Elections provided for in this Agreement and shall be
necessary or desirable to effect the Cash Elections and Stock Elections.

 



7 Section 2.3 Proration. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary:

(a) With respect to all shares of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded
Shares) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First Step Effective
Time:

(i) a number of shares of Company Common Stock equal to the quotient obtained
by dividing (A) an amount equal to (1) the product of (x) $7.25 multiplied by
(y) the number of Fully Diluted Shares as of immediately prior to the First
Step Effective Time minus (2) the aggregate amount of the Equity Award
Consideration, by (B) the Cash Consideration (such number of shares, rounded
down to the nearest whole number, the " _Cash Conversion Number_ "), shall be
converted into the right to receive an amount per share equal to the Cash
Consideration; and

(ii) the remainder of the shares of Company Common Stock shall be converted
into the right to receive the Parent Common Stock Consideration per share.

(b) If the aggregate number of Cash Electing Company Shares (such number of
shares, the " _Cash Election Number_ ") equals or exceeds the Cash Conversion
Number, then:

(i) all Stock Electing Company Shares and all Non-Electing Company Shares
shall be converted into the right to receive the Parent Common Stock
Consideration per share; and

(ii) the number of Cash Electing Company Shares of each shareholder of the
Company that shall be converted into the right to receive an amount per share
equal to the Cash Consideration shall be equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (A) the number of Cash Electing Company Shares of such shareholder
by (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Cash Conversion Number and
the denominator of which is the Cash Election Number, and the remaining
number of each such holders Cash Electing Company Shares shall be converted
into the right to receive the Parent Common Stock Consideration per share.

(c) If the Cash Election Number is less than the Cash Conversion Number (such
difference between the Cash Election Number and the Cash Conversion Number,
the " _Shortfall Number_ "), then: 

(i) all Cash Electing Company Shares shall be converted into the right to
receive an amount per share equal to the Cash Consideration; and

(ii) the Stock Electing Company Shares and the Non-Electing Company Shares
shall be treated in the following manner:

(A) if the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the aggregate number of
Non-Electing Company Shares, then (x) all Stock Electing Company Shares shall
be converted into the right to receive the Parent Common Stock Consideration
per share and (y) the number of Non-Electing Company Shares of each
shareholder of the Company that shall be converted into the right to receive
an amount per share equal to the Cash Consideration shall be equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (1) the number of Non-Electing Company Shares
of such shareholder by (2) a fraction, the numerator of which is the
Shortfall Number and the denominator of which is the aggregate number of Non-
Electing Company Shares, and the remaining number of such holders Non-
Electing Company Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the
Parent Common Stock Consideration per share; or

(B) if the Shortfall Number exceeds the aggregate number of Non-
Electing Company Shares, then (x) all Non-Electing Company Shares shall be
converted into the right to receive an amount per share equal to the Cash
Consideration and (y) the number of Stock Electing Company Shares of each
shareholder of the Company that shall be converted into the right to receive
an amount per share equal to the Cash Consideration shall be equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (1) the number of Stock Electing Company
Shares of such shareholder by (2) a fraction, the numerator of which is the
amount by which the Shortfall Number exceeds the aggregate number of Non-
Electing Company Shares and the denominator of which is the aggregate number
of Stock Electing Company Shares, and the remaining number of such holders
Stock Electing Company Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the
Parent Common Stock Consideration per share.

 



8 Section 2.4 Effect of the First Step Merger on Capital Stock of Merger Sub.
At the First Step Effective Time, each share of Common Stock, no par value,
of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First Step
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one (1) fully paid share of
common stock, par value $0.10 per share, of the First Step Surviving
Corporation and constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the
First Step Surviving Corporation.

Section 2.5 Treatment of Company Equity Awards.

(a) As of the First Step Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock or other right to purchase shares of Company Common Stock
under any Company Equity Plan (each a " _Company Option_ "), to the extent it
is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior thereto, shall become fully
vested as of the First Step Effective Time and shall by virtue of the First
Step Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of any Company
Option be automatically cancelled and the holder thereof will receive, as
soon as reasonably practicable following the First Step Effective Time a cash
payment (without interest) with respect thereto equal to the product of (i)
the excess, if any, of the Cash Consideration over the exercise price per
share of such Company Option and (ii) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock issuable upon exercise of such Company Option (collectively, the "
_Option Consideration_ "). As of the First Step Effective Time, all Company
Options, whether or not vested or exercisable, shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically cease to exist, and each holder of a Company Option
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive the Option Consideration; _provided_ that, if the exercise price
of any such Company Option is equal to or greater than the Cash Consideration,
such Company Option shall be cancelled without any payment being made in
respect thereof. The Option Consideration shall in all cases be paid in cash
and shall not be subject to the proration contemplated by _Section 2.3_.

(b) As of the First Step Effective Time, each restricted stock unit granted
under any Company Equity Plan (each a " _Company RSU_ " and, together with the
Company Options, the " _Company Equity Awards_ ") which is outstanding
immediately prior thereto shall become fully vested as of the First Step
Effective Time. Each Company RSU shall by virtue of the First Step Merger and
without any action on the part of any holder of any Company RSU be
automatically cancelled, and the holder thereof will receive, as soon as
reasonably practicable following the First Step Effective Time, a cash payment
(without interest) with respect thereto equal to the product of (i) the
aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU
and (ii) the Cash Consideration (collectively, the " _RSU Consideration_ "
and, together with the Option Consideration, the " _Equity Award
Consideration_ "). As of the First Step Effective Time, all Company RSUs that
are outstanding immediately prior thereto, whether or not vested, shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically cease to exist, and each holder
of a Company RSU shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the RSU Consideration. The RSU Consideration shall in all
cases be paid in cash and shall not be subject to the proration contemplated
by  _Section 2.3_.

(c) Amounts payable pursuant to this _Section 2.5_ shall be reduced by such
amounts as the Exchange Agent, the First Step Surviving Corporation, the
Surviving Entity or Parent is required to deduct and withhold pursuant to
_Section 3.7_. Payment of any amounts to be paid pursuant to this _Section
2.5_ may be made through the Surviving Entitys payroll.

Section 2.6 No Dissenters Rights. The Company and the Board of Directors of
the Company shall take all such corporate and organizational action as may be
necessary to ensure that holders of shares of Company Common Stock shall not
be entitled to exercise dissenters or appraisal rights under Section 1571
of Pennsylvania Law pursuant to the exception set forth in Section 1571(b)(1)
of Pennsylvania Law.

Section 2.7 Effect of the Second Step Merger on Capital Stock of the First
Step Surviving Corporation. At the Second Step Effective Time, each share of

Corporation issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Second Step
Effective Time shall be cancelled and extinguished for no consideration.
Immediately after the completion of the Second Step Merger, Parent shall own
all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity
interests of the Surviving Entity.

 



9 ARTICLE III

_EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES FOR MERGER CONSIDERATION_

Section 3.1 Delivery of the Merger Consideration. Prior to the First Step
Effective Time (and, with respect to Parent Common Stock, from time to time
after the First Step Effective Time as applicable), Parent shall deposit with
the Exchange Agent, pursuant to an agreement providing for the matters set
forth in this _Article III_ and such other matters as may be appropriate and
the terms of which shall be mutually acceptable to Parent and the Company, an
amount in cash and certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock
sufficient to effect the conversion of each share of Company Common Stock
(other than Excluded Shares) into the applicable Merger Consideration pursuant
to this Agreement.

 

Section 3.2 Exchange Procedures.

(a) Promptly after the First Step Effective Time, but in any event not more
than five (5) Business Days after the First Step Effective Time, Parent shall
take all steps reasonably necessary to cause the Exchange Agent to mail to
each holder of record of Non-Electing Company Shares as of immediately prior
to the First Step Effective Time (each such holder, a " _Non-Electing Company
Holder_ "), subject to _Section 2.3_, (i) a letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
each Certificate representing any Non-Electing Company Shares held by such
Non-Electing Company Holder shall pass, only upon delivery of the completed
letter of transmittal and such Certificate to the Exchange Agent and shall be
in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company shall
mutually agree) for return to the Exchange Agent and (ii) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of each such Certificate in exchange for the
total amount of Merger Consideration that such Non-Electing Company Holder is
entitled to receive in exchange for such holders Non-Electing Company Shares
in the First Step Merger pursuant to this Agreement (including cash in lieu of
a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to be paid pursuant to _Section
2.1(d)_, if any). Such instructions shall be reasonable and consistent with
the provisions of this Agreement and shall be in customary form and upon
customary terms for transactions similar to the First Step Merger; _provided_
, _however_ , that prior to the First Step Effective Time, Parent shall afford
the Company a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such
transmittal materials and obtain the Companys approval of such materials,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. In
the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that
is not registered in the stock transfer records of the Company, the
appropriate Merger Consideration may be paid or issued, as appropriate, to a
transferee if the Certificate representing such shares of Company Common
Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents
required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any
applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. From and after the First Step
Effective Time, until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.2_,
each Certificate representing Non-Electing Company Shares held by a Non-
Electing Company Holder shall be deemed to represent only the right to receive
the total amount of Merger Consideration to which such Non-Electing Company
Holder is entitled in exchange for such Non-Electing Company Shares as
contemplated by _Article II_.

(b) Upon surrender by a Non-Electing Company Holder to the Exchange Agent of
all Certificates representing such holders Non-Electing Company Shares,
together with a letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be
required pursuant to such instructions, each Non-Electing Company Holder shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (and the Exchange Agent shall
mail to such Non-Electing Holder within ten (10) Business Days following such
surrender): (i) a certificate (or certificates in the aggregate) representing
the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, into which such
holders shares of Company Common Stock represented by such holders properly
surrendered Certificates were converted in accordance with _Article II_ , and
such Certificates so surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled, and (ii) a
check in an amount of U.S. dollars (after giving effect to any required
withholdings pursuant to _Section 3.7_) equal to (A) the amount of cash
(consisting of the Cash Consideration and cash in lieu of a fractional share
of Parent Common Stock to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.1(d)_), if any, into
which such holders shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
holders properly surrendered Certificates were converted in accordance with
_Article II_ , plus (B) any cash dividends and other distributions that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 3.3_.

 



10 (c) As of the First Step Effective Time, each Person who immediately prior
thereto was a shareholder of the Company who properly made and did not revoke
or change a Cash Election and/or a Stock Election shall be entitled to receive
in exchange for such shareholders Electing Company Shares (and the Exchange
Agent shall mail to such former shareholder within ten (10) Business Days
following the First Step Effective Time, unless such former shareholder is
also a Non-Electing Company Holder, in which case the Exchange Agent shall
include in its mailing to such former shareholder pursuant to _Section
3.2(b)_): (i) a certificate (or certificates in the aggregate) representing
the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, into which such
holders shares of Company Common Stock represented by such holders properly
surrendered Certificates were converted in accordance with _Article II_ , and
such Certificates so surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled, and (ii) a
check in an amount of U.S. dollars (after giving effect to any required
withholdings pursuant to _Section 3.7_) equal to (A) the amount of cash
(consisting of the Cash Consideration and cash in lieu of a fractional share
of Parent Common Stock to be paid pursuant to  _Section 2.1(d)_), if any,
into which such holders shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
holders properly surrendered Certificates were converted in accordance with
_Article II_ , plus (B) any cash dividends and other distributions that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 3.3_.

 

Section 3.3 Dividends and Distributions. No dividends or other distributions
with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the
First Step Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate until such Certificate is surrendered as provided in this _Article
III_ or _Section 2.2(c)_. Subject to the effect of applicable Laws,
following such surrender, there shall be paid, without interest, to the record
holder of the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange for shares of
Company Common Stock represented immediately prior to the First
Step Effective Time by such Certificate (a) when any payment or distribution
of a certificate representing any share(s) of Parent Common Stock is made to
such holder pursuant to _Section 3.2(b)_ or _(c)_ , all dividends and
other distributions payable in respect of such Parent Common Stock with a
record date after the First Step Effective Time and a payment date on or prior
to the date of such surrender and not previously paid and (b) on the
appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable with
respect to such Parent Common Stock with a record date after the First Step
Effective Time but prior to surrender and with a payment date subsequent to
such surrender. For purposes of dividends and other distributions in respect
of Parent Common Stock, all shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued
pursuant to the First Step Merger shall be entitled to dividends and other
distributions on or in respect of Parent Common Stock pursuant to
the immediately preceding sentence as if issued and outstanding as of the
First Step Effective Time.

Section 3.4 Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares. From and
after the First Step Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of
shares of Company Common Stock on the records of the Company. After the First
Step Effective Time, the holders of Certificates shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such shares, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration and such dividends and other distributions on or in respect of
Parent Common Stock as provided herein or as otherwise provided by applicable
Law. If, after the First Step Effective Time, any Certificates are presented
to the Exchange Agent, the First Step Surviving Corporation or the
Surviving Entity for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in _Article II_.

Section 3.5 Termination of Fund; No Liability. At any time following twelve
(12) months after the First Step Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to
require the Exchange Agent to deliver to Parent (a) certificates representing
shares of Parent Common Stock and (b) cash held by the Exchange Agent for
payment of Cash Consideration and cash payments in lieu of fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock, in each case, for which the Exchange Agent shall not
have been obligated to deliver to holders of Certificates pursuant to
_Section 3.2_. Thereafter, holders of Certificates shall be entitled to look
only to Parent, which shall thereafter act as the Exchange Agent (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws), as general creditors of
Parent with respect to the delivery of the Merger Consideration (including
payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock) upon due
surrender of the Certificates held by such holders of Certificates. None of
Parent, the First Step Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Entity or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person for any Merger Consideration
delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat
or similar Law from and after the date that any such Law shall become
applicable to the Merger Consideration.

 



11 Section 3.6 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that
any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of
an affidavit attesting to that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if requested by Parent, the delivery by such
Person of a bond (in such amount as Parent or the Surviving Corporation may
reasonably direct) as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the
Exchange Agent, Parent, the First Step Surviving Corporation or the Surviving
Entity on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate a certificate representing shares of Parent Common
Stock and/or deliver a check for Cash Consideration, and pay the cash in lieu
of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled, which constitute the total amount of Merger Consideration
deliverable in respect of such Certificate as determined in accordance with
_Article II_ , together with any cash dividends and other distributions to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 3.3_.

Section 3.7 Withholding Taxes. Parent or the Exchange Agent will be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby to any holder of
Company Common Stock or Company Equity Awards such amounts as Parent, or any
Affiliate thereof, or the Exchange Agent are required to deduct and withhold
and remit to the appropriate Taxing authority with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code, or any applicable provision of U.S. federal,
state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law. To the extent that such amounts are properly
withheld by Parent or the Exchange Agent and paid over to the
appropriate Taxing authority, such withheld amounts will be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company
Common Stock or Company Equity Awards in respect of whom such deduction and
withholding were made by Parent or the Exchange Agent.

Section 3.8 Adjustments to Prevent Dilution. Without limiting the other
provisions of this Agreement, in the event that the Company changes the
number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the
First Step Effective Time as a result of a reclassification, stock split
(including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution,
recapitalization, merger, subdivision, issuer tender or exchange offer, or
other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration and the Equity Award
Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change.

Except as set forth in (a) the disclosure schedule of the Company delivered
to Parent concurrently herewith (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ "), with
specific reference to the Section of this Agreement to which the information
stated in such Company Disclosure Schedule relates, or another Section of the
Company Disclosure Schedule to the extent that it is readily apparent on the
face of such disclosure that such disclosure is applicable to such other
Section of this Agreement or (b) the Companys filings with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") pursuant to the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act since February 1, 2010 and publicly available prior to the date
of this Agreement (excluding (x) any disclosures set forth in any section of
any such filings entitled "Risk Factors," "Forward-Looking Statements" or
"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" or any
other disclosures contained or referenced therein regarding information,
factors or risks that are predictive, cautionary or forward-looking in nature
and (y) any exhibits or other documents appended thereto or incorporated by
reference therein), it being understood that any matter disclosed in any such

to the extent that it is readily apparent on the face of such disclosure in

in _Section 4.3_, _Section 4.7(b)_, _Section 4.8 _and  _Section 4.14 _of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, respectively), the Company hereby represents
and warrants to Parent, Merger Sub and Successor Sub as follows:

Section 4.1 Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries. Each of the Company
and each of its Subsidiaries is an entity duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize that concept)
under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, and has the requisite
corporate, limited liability company or similar organizational power and
authority and is in possession of all franchises, grants, authorizations,
licenses, permits, easements, consents, certificates, approvals and orders ("
_Approvals_ ") as are necessary to own, lease and operate the properties it
purports to own, operate or lease and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted, except where the failure to be in good standing or to have
such Approvals would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign entity to do business,
and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of its
properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its activities
makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for such failures to
be so duly qualified or licensed and in good standing that would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect. A true and complete list of all of the Companys
Subsidiaries, together with the jurisdiction of organization of each
Subsidiary and the percentage of each Subsidiarys outstanding capital stock
or ownership interests owned by the Company or another Subsidiary, is set
forth in _Section 4.1_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Except as set
forth in _Section 4.1_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company does
not directly or indirectly own any equity or similar interest in, or any
interest convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for, any equity or
similar interest in, any corporation, partnership, joint venture or other
business association or entity, excluding securities in any publicly traded
company held for investment and comprising less than two percent (2%) of the
outstanding stock of such company.

Section 4.2 Articles of Incorporation; Bylaws; Minute Books. The Company has
made available to Parent complete and correct copies of its Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws, each as amended to date, and the Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws (or equivalent organizational documents) of each of
its Subsidiaries, each as amended to date (the " _Subsidiary Documents_ ").
Such Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws and Subsidiary Documents are in full
force and effect. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in
violation of any of the provisions of its Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws
or Subsidiary Documents, except for immaterial violations of the Subsidiary
Documents. Except as set forth in  _Section 4.2_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the Company has made available to Parent complete and correct copies
of the minute books of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries, which contain
true, complete and correct records in all material respects of all meetings

and other material corporate actions held or taken since January 31, 2010 of
their respective shareholders, 

 



13  members, partners or other equity holders and Boards of Directors or other
governing bodies (including committees of their respective Boards of Directors
or other governing bodies) through the date hereof.

or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any
shares of its capital stock, voting securities or equity interests, other than

charges or other encumbrances of any nature whatsoever.

(b) As of the Closing, the only shares of capital stock or warrants, options,
convertible securities, exchangeable securities or other rights to acquire

part by the value of capital stock of the Company) that shall be issued
or outstanding shall be shares of Company Common Stock, Company Stock Options
and Company RSUs representing in the aggregate not more than 15,100,000 Fully

Agreement) is advisable and in the best interests of the Companys
stockholders. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered
by the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery

other similar Laws, now or hereafter in effect, relating to creditors rights
generally and (b) equitable remedies of specific performance and injunctive
and other forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and

consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification
to, any Governmental Authority, except (i) for applicable requirements of the

such consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings
or notifications, would not prevent or materially delay consummation of the

reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect.

(or if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement,
then on the date of such filing) contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. There are no
outstanding or unresolved comments in comment letters received from the SEC

respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of its operations and
cash flows for the periods indicated, except that the unaudited interim
financial statements included therein were or are subject to normal and
recurring year-end adjustments as permitted by GAAP. The books and records of
the Company and its Subsidiaries have been, and are being, maintained in all
material respects in accordance with GAAP and any other applicable legal and
accounting requirements and reflect only actual transactions. As of the date
of this Agreement, Marcum LLP has not resigned or been dismissed as
independent public accountants of the Company as a result of or in connection
with any disagreements with the Company on a matter of accounting principles
or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure. 

(c) The Company has established and maintains "disclosure controls and
procedures" (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act)
that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that material information
(both financial and non-financial) relating to the Company and its
Subsidiaries required to 

 



16  be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files with the SEC is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated
and communicated to the Companys principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding disclosure and to make the certifications of
the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer of the
Company required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("
_Sarbanes-Oxley_ ") with respect to such reports. For purposes of this
Agreement, "principal executive officer" and "principal financial officer"
shall have the meanings given to such terms in Sarbanes-Oxley.

(d) The Company has established and maintains a system of "internal control
over financial reporting" (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the
Exchange Act). Such internal controls are designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of the Companys financial reporting and
the preparation of the Companys financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP. Since January 31, 2010 through the date of this
Agreement, the Companys principal executive officer and principal financial
officer have not been required under any applicable Law to disclose to the
Companys auditors or audit committee any, and to the Companys Knowledge
there are not (and during such period there have been no), (i) significant
deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
controls which are reasonably likely to adversely affect in a material
respect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information or (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in internal
controls. The Company has made available to Parent a summary of any such
disclosure regarding material weaknesses and fraud made by management to the
Companys auditors and audit committee since January 31, 2010. For purposes of
this Agreement, a "significant deficiency" in controls means an internal
control deficiency that adversely affects an entitys ability to initiate,
authorize, record, process, or report external financial data reliably in
accordance with GAAP. A "significant deficiency" may be a single deficiency
or a combination of deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood
that a misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements that is more
than inconsequential will not be prevented or detected. For purposes of this
Agreement, a "material weakness" in internal controls means a significant
deficiency, or a combination of significant deficiencies, that results in more
than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or
interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected.

(e) The conduct of the Companys business, as currently conducted or as
proposed to be conducted in the future, does not and will not require the
Company or any of its Affiliates to make any disclosure, filing or report or
submit any filing or report to the SEC pursuant to Section 13(p) of the
Exchange Act or any of the rules or regulations promulgated under or pursuant
to Section 13(p) of the Exchange Act. Without limiting the foregoing, no
Conflict Minerals are necessary to the functionality or production of or are
used in the production of any product of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any product currently proposed to be manufactured by the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries or on its behalf in the future. For
purposes of this Agreement, " _Conflict Minerals_ " means: (i)
columbitetantalite (coltan), cassiterite, gold, wolframite, or their
derivatives, which originate in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or a
country that shares an internationally recognized border with the Democratic
Republic of the Congo; and (ii) any other mineral or its derivatives, the
exploitation and trade of which is determined by the Secretary of State of the
United States to be financing conflict in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo or a country that shares an internationally recognized border with the
Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Employee Plan intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code and each

favorable determination letter from the IRS, and nothing has occurred which
may reasonably be expected to impair such determination; (vii) all
contributions required to be made to any Company Employee Plan pursuant to
Section 412 of the Code, or the terms of the Company Employee Plan or any
collective bargaining agreement, have been made on or before their due dates;
(viii) with respect to each Company Employee Plan, no "reportable event"
within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA (excluding any such event for
which the 30 day notice requirement has been waived under the regulations to
Section 4043 of ERISA) nor any event described in Section 4062, 4063 or 4041
of ERISA has occurred, in each case, that would reasonably be expected to
result in, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect; (ix)
neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred, nor reasonably
expects to incur, any liability under Title IV of ERISA (other than liability
for premium payments to the PBGC arising in the ordinary course); and (x)
there is not, has not been and will not be any violation of the deduction
limitations imposed by Section 162(m) of the Code pursuant to or in connection

(c)  _Section 4.13(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true
and complete list of each current or former employee, officer or director of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who holds (i) any Company Options as of
the date hereof, together with the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Option, the exercise price of such Company Option (to
the extent determined as of the date hereof), whether such Company Option is

Section 422(b) of the Code (an " _ISO_ "), and the expiration date of such
Company Option; (ii) any other right, directly or indirectly, to acquire the
Company Common Stock (including Company RSUs), together with the number of

complete and accurate list of each Company Employee Plan that is a
"nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of

no failures to operate such Company Employee Plan in compliance with or to
have such Company Employee Plan in documentary compliance with the applicable
provisions of Section 409A of the Code and the final regulations promulgated
thereunder (collectively, " _Section 409A_ "), which such failures would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect. With respect to each such Company Employee Plan that is not
intended to be subject to Section 409A because it is not a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan under Section 409A and the regulations thereunder
or is otherwise exempt from its application, all the conditions required to
retain such treatment remain in effect and are not reasonably expected to
change so as to subject such Company Employee Plan to Section 409A. None of
the Company or its Subsidiaries (x) have failed to report to any
Governmental Authority any corrections made or Taxes due as a result of a
failure to comply with Section 409A, which such failure would reasonably be
expected to result in, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect nor (y) have any indemnity or gross-up obligation for any Taxes or
interest imposed or accelerated under Section 409A or Section 280G of the
Code.

(f) _Section 4.13(f)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
complete and accurate list of all Company Employee Plans maintained outside
the jurisdiction of the United States, or that covers any employee who
performs services outside of the United States, listed separately by
applicable country or jurisdiction (such Company Employee Plans, the "
_Non-U.S. Company Employee Plans_ "). Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing representations, with respect to each Non-U.S. Company Employee
Plan, (i) such Non-U.S. Company Employee Plan has been established, maintained
and administered in material compliance with its terms and all applicable
Laws; (ii) to the extent required to be funded such Non-U.S. Company Employee
Plan is fully funded, and with respect to all other Non-U.S. Company Employee
Plans, adequate reserves therefore have been established on the accounting
statements of the Company or the applicable Subsidiary; and (iii) no material
liability or obligation of the Company or its Subsidiaries exists with respect
to such Non-U.S. Company Employee Plans that has not been disclosed on
_Section 4.13(f)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

(g) Any individual who performs services for the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than through a contract with an organization other than
such individual) and who is not treated as an employee of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries for federal income tax purposes by the Company is not an
employee for such purposes. No individual classified as a non-employee,
including any independent contractor, leased employee or consultant, for
purposes of receiving employee benefits, regardless of treatment for other
purposes, is eligible to participate in, or receive benefits under,
any Company Employee Plan that does not specifically provide for their
participation.

the ESOP were acquired by the ESOP in a transaction pursuant to Section 1042
of the Code; (ii) allocations to participants were made in accordance with

respects; (iii) all Company contributions to the ESOP were deductible under
Section 404 of the Code for the year made; (iv) the voting requirements of the
ESOP (including under Section 409(e) of the Code) and the valuation
requirements of Section 408(e) of ERISA have always been complied with in all
material respects and will be complied with in all material respects through
the Closing, including in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; and (iv) the Company has provided Parent with ESOP
contribution and allocation schedules for the

 



21  last five years of contributions, ESOP appraisals for the last three years,
ESOP fairness opinions, ESOP voting procedures, account diversification
documentation, distribution forms and notices, committee and trustee minutes
and consents, repurchase liability studies, nondiscrimination tests for the
last five years.

 

(i) _Section 4.13(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth, as of
the date hereof, a true and complete list of: (i) each material payment
(including any bonus, severance, unemployment compensation, deferred
compensation, golden parachute payment or "parachute payment" within the
meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code) that shall become due to any
current or former employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary under any
Company Employee Plan as a result of the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; (ii)
any increase in any material respect of any material benefit otherwise
payable under any Company Employee Plan that would become effective pursuant
to the terms thereof because of the execution and delivery of this Agreement
or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; or (iii) any
acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such material benefits
under any Company Employee Plan that would become effective pursuant to the
terms thereof because of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. The consummation of the
First Step Merger will not result in any denial of any federal income tax
deduction under Section 280G of the Code with respect to any Company Employee
Plan, which such denial would reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

by Parent, its Subsidiaries, Merger Sub, Successor Sub, or any of their
respective Affiliates, stockholders, controlling persons or representatives,
that are not expressly set forth in  _Article V_ , whether or not such
representations, warranties or statements were made in writing or orally. The
Company acknowledges and agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, Parent, its Subsidiaries, Merger Sub, Successor Sub, and
their respective Affiliates, stockholders, controlling persons and
representatives, shall have no liability or responsibility whatsoever to the
Company or its Affiliates, stockholders, controlling persons or
representatives on any basis (including in contract or tort, under federal or
state securities Laws or otherwise) based upon any information (including any
statement, document or agreement delivered in connection with this Agreement
and any financial statements and any projections, estimates or other forward-
looking information) provided or made available (including in any data room,
management presentation, information or descriptive memorandum or supplemental
information), or oral or written statements made (or any omissions
therefrom), to the Company or its Affiliates, stockholders, controlling

31 ARTICLE V

_REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES_

_OF PARENT, MERGER SUB AND SUCCESSOR SUB_

Except as set forth in (a) the disclosure schedule of Parent delivered to the
Company concurrently herewith (the " _Parent Disclosure Schedule_ "), with
specific reference to the Section of this Agreement to which the information
stated in such Parent Disclosure Schedule relates, or another Section of the
Parent Disclosure Schedule to the extent that it is readily apparent on the
face of such disclosure that such disclosure is applicable to such other
Section of this Agreement or (b) Parents filings with the SEC pursuant to the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act since January 1, 2010 and publicly
available prior to the date of this Agreement (excluding (x) any disclosures
set forth in any section of any such filings entitled "Risk Factors,"
"Forward-Looking Statements" or "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk" or any other disclosures contained or referenced therein
regarding information, factors or risks that are predictive, cautionary or
forward-looking in nature and (y) any exhibits or other documents appended
thereto or incorporated by reference therein), it being understood that any
matter disclosed in any such filings shall be deemed to be disclosed for
purposes of this _Article V_ only to the extent that it is readily apparent
on the face of such disclosure in such filing that such disclosure is
applicable to a Section of this _Article V _(other than, in each case, any
matters required to be disclosed for purposes of _Section
5.3_ (Capitalization), _Section 5.7(b)_ (Financial Statements) or _Section
5.8_ (Absence of Certain Changes or Events), which matters shall be
specifically disclosed in _Section 5.3_, _Section 5.7(b)_ or  _Section
5.8_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, respectively), Parent, Merger Sub and
Successor Sub hereby represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

Section 5.1 Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries. Each of Parent and
its Subsidiaries is an entity duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize that concept) under
the Laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, has the requisite corporate,
limited liability company or similar organizational power and authority and is
in possession of all Approvals as are necessary to own, lease and operate the
properties it purports to own, operate or lease and to carry on its business
as it is now being conducted, except where the failure to be in good standing
or to have such Approvals would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Each of
Parent and each of its Subsidiaries, including each of Merger Sub and
Successor Sub, is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign entity to do
business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character
of its properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its
activities makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for such
failures to be so duly qualified or licensed and in good standing that would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect. A true and complete list of all of Parents
Subsidiaries, together with the jurisdiction of organization of each
Subsidiary and the percentage of each Subsidiarys outstanding capital stock
or ownership interests owned by Parent or another Subsidiary, is set forth in
_Section 5.1_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule. Except as set forth in 
_Section 5.1_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, Parent does not directly or
indirectly own any equity or similar interest in, or any interest convertible
into or exchangeable or exercisable for, any equity or similar interest in,
any corporation, partnership, joint venture or other business association or
entity, excluding securities in any publicly traded company and comprising
less than two percent (2%) of the outstanding stock of such company.

 

Section 5.2 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. Parent has made available
to the Company complete and correct copies of its Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws, each as amended to date, and the Subsidiary
Documents of each of its Subsidiaries, including each of Merger Sub and
Successor Sub, each as amended to date. Such Certificate of Incorporation,
Bylaws and Subsidiary Documents are in full force and effect. Neither Parent
nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of any of the provisions of its
Certificate

of Incorporation or Bylaws or Subsidiary Documents, except for immaterial
violations of the Subsidiary Documents.

Section 5.3 Capitalization. The authorized capital stock of Parent consists
exclusively of (a) 100,000,000 shares of Parent Common Stock and (b) 10,000
shares of Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per

 



32  share, none of which Preferred Stock is issued, outstanding or reserved for
issuance as of the date hereof. As of April 19, 2013, (i) 17,871,922 shares of
Parent Common Stock were issued and outstanding, all of which are validly

treasury, (ii) 82,200 shares of Parent Common Stock were held by Subsidiaries
of Parent, (iii) 1,231,151 shares of Parent Common Stock were reserved for
issuance pursuant to stock options, shares of restricted stock or other
similar rights granted under the Parent incentive plans and agreements listed

"), and 2,204,626 shares of Parent Common Stock remained available for future
issuance under the Parent Equity Plans, and (iv) 27,527 shares of Parent
Common Stock were held of record by the Parents Employee Stock Purchase
Plan. Except as set forth in this _Section 5.3_ or _Section 5.3_ or _5.13_
of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, and other than employee and director stock
options, shares of restricted stock or other similar rights issued pursuant
to the shareholder approved plans identified on _Section 5.3_ of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule, there are no options, warrants, convertible securities or
other similar rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments of any
character relating to the issued or unissued capital stock of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries or obligating Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to issue or
sell any shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests in, Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries. All shares of Parent Common Stock subject to issuance
as aforesaid, upon issuance on the terms and conditions specified in the
instruments pursuant to which they are issuable, shall be duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Except as disclosed in Section
5.3 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, there are no obligations, contingent or
otherwise, of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem
or otherwise acquire any shares of Parent Common Stock or the capital stock
or other equity interests of any Subsidiary or to provide funds to or make any
investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in any
such Subsidiary or any other entity. There are not, and since July 30, 2003
there have not been, any preemptive rights with respect to the Parent Common
Stock. Except as set forth in _Sections 5.1_ and _5.3_ of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule, all of the outstanding shares of capital stock or other
equity interests of each of Parents Subsidiaries are duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and all such shares or other equity
interests are owned by Parent or another Subsidiary of Parent free and clear
of all security interests, liens, claims, pledges, agreements, limitations in
Parents voting rights, charges or other encumbrances of any nature
whatsoever.

 

Section 5.4 Authority Relative to this Agreement. Parent, Merger Sub and
Successor Sub have all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and to perform their respective obligations hereunder
and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and

by the holders of shares of Parent Common Stock entitled to vote in
accordance with Delaware Law and Parents Certificate of Incorporation and

binding obligation of each of Parent, Merger Sub and Successor Sub,
enforceable against each of Parent, Merger Sub and Successor Sub in accordance
with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exceptions.

Schedule, the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent, Merger Sub

Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws or Subsidiary Documents of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries, (ii) assuming compliance with the matters referred to in
_Section 5.5(b)(i)-(iv)_ below, conflict with or violate in any material
respect any Law applicable to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or by which
its or their respective properties are bound or affected, or (iii) result

 



33  in any breach of or constitute a default (or an event which with or without
notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) under, or impair
Parents or any of its Subsidiaries rights or alter the rights or
obligations of any third party under, or give to others any rights of
termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of any Parent Material

properties or assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, any
note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit,
franchise or other instrument or obligation to which Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or its
or any of their respective properties are bound or affected, except for any
such breaches, defaults, liens or other occurrences with respect to clause
(iii) above that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent, Merger Sub and
Successor Sub does not, and the performance of this Agreement by Parent,
Merger Sub and Successor Sub will not, require any consent, approval,
authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification to, any

such consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings
or notifications, would not prevent or materially delay consummation of the
issuance of Parent Common Stock or the Mergers, or otherwise prevent or
materially delay Parent, Merger Sub or Successor Sub from performing their
respective obligations under this Agreement, or would not otherwise reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect.

Section 5.6 Compliance; Permits.

 

(a) Except as disclosed in _Section 5.6(a)_ of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is in conflict with, or

easements, variances, exemptions, consents, certificates, orders and approvals
from Governmental Authorities that are necessary for the operation of the
business of Parent and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Parent Permits_

Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 5.7 SEC Filings; Financial Statements.

(a) Parent has filed all forms, reports and other documents required to be
filed with the SEC since December 31, 2009 and has made available to the
Company (i) its Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal years ended
December 31, 2009, December 31, 2010, December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2012,
respectively, (ii) all proxy statements relating to Parents meetings of
stockholders (whether annual or special) held since December 31, 2009, (iii)
all other reports or registration statements filed by Parent with the SEC
since December 31, 2009, and (iv) all amendments and supplements to the
foregoing filed by Parent with the SEC since December 31, 2009 (collectively,
the " _Parent SEC Reports_ "). The Parent SEC Reports (A) were prepared in all
material respects in accordance with the requirements of the Securities Act or
the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and (B) did not at the time they were
filed (or if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this
Agreement, then on the date of such filing) contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a 

 



34  material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. There are no outstanding or unresolved comments in
comment letters received from the SEC with respect to the Parent SEC Reports.
To the Knowledge of Parent, none of the Parent SEC Reports is subject to
ongoing SEC review. Parent is and has been since December 31, 2009 in
compliance in all material respects with the applicable listing and corporate
governance rules and regulations of the NASDAQ. None of the Parent
Subsidiaries is required to file any forms, reports or other documents
with the SEC.

(b) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each case,
any related notes thereto) contained in or incorporated by reference into the
Parent SEC Reports was prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as may be indicated
in the notes thereto), and each fairly presents in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of Parent and its Subsidiaries as at the
respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of its operations and
cash flows for the periods indicated, except that the unaudited interim
financial statements included therein were or are subject to normal and
recurring year-end adjustments as permitted by GAAP. The books and records of
Parent and its Subsidiaries have been, and are being, maintained in all
material respects in accordance with GAAP and any other applicable legal and
accounting requirements and reflect only actual transactions. As of the date
of this Agreement, BDO USA, LLP has not resigned or been dismissed as
independent public accountants of Parent as a result of or in connection with
any disagreements with Parent on a matter of accounting principles or
practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure.

(c) Parent has established and maintains "disclosure controls and procedures"
(as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) that are
designed to provide reasonable assurance that material information (both
financial and non-financial) relating to Parent and its Subsidiaries required
to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information
is accumulated and communicated to Parents principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure and to make the
certifications of the principal executive officer and the principal financial
officer of Parent required by Sarbanes-Oxley with respect to such reports.

 

(d) Parent has established and maintains a system of "internal control over
financial reporting" (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the
Exchange Act). Such internal controls are designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of Parents financial reporting and the
preparation of Parents financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP. Since December 31, 2009 through the date of this
Agreement, Parents principal executive officer and principal financial
officer have not been required under any applicable Law to disclose to
Parents auditors or audit committee any, and to Parents Knowledge there are
not (and during such period there have been no), (i) significant deficiencies
(as defined in _Section 4.7(d)_) or material weaknesses (as defined in 
_Section 4.7(d)_) in the design or operation of internal controls which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect in a material respect Parents ability
to record, process, summarize and report financial information or (ii)
any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in internal controls. Parent has made
available to the Company a summary of any such disclosure regarding material
weaknesses and fraud made by management to Parents auditors and audit
committee since December 31, 2009.

Section 5.8 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except as set forth in
_Section 5.8_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule or in the Parent SEC Reports
filed with the SEC since December 31, 2012 and publicly available prior to the
date of this Agreement, and except for the transactions contemplated hereby,
since December 31, 2012, Parent has conducted its business in the ordinary
course consistent with past practice and there has not occurred: (a) any
Material Adverse Effect; (b) any amendments or changes in the Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws of Parent; (c) any damage to, destruction or loss of
any asset of Parent (whether or not covered by insurance) that would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material

 



35  Adverse Effect; (d) any material change by Parent in its accounting methods,
principles or practices; or (e) any material revaluation by Parent of any of
its assets, including writing down the value of inventory or writing off
notes or accounts receivable other than in the ordinary course of business.

 

Section 5.9 No Undisclosed Liabilities. Except as disclosed in _Section 5.9_
of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries
has any liabilities (absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise, and whether
due or to become due), except liabilities (a) disclosed in Parents audited
balance sheet (including any related notes thereto) as of December 31, 2012
included in the Parent SEC Reports filed and publicly available prior to the
date of this Agreement (the " _Recent Parent Balance Sheet_ "), (b) incurred
in the ordinary course of business and not required under GAAP to be
reflected on the Recent Parent Balance Sheet, (c) incurred since December 31,
2012, in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, or (d)
reasonably incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(a) _Section 5.10(a)_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of
each contract, agreement, arrangement or other commitment, as of the date

guarantee, loan or credit agreement, security agreement or other contract

area); or (vi) that relates to any material litigation or settlement
(collectively, the " _Parent Material Contracts_ "). Parent has heretofore
made available to the Company correct and complete copies of each Parent
Material Contract in existence as of the date hereof, together with any and
all amendments and supplements thereto and material "side letters" and similar
documentation relating thereto.

 

(b) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor to the Knowledge of
Parent, any other party to any Parent Material Contract is in material breach
of or material default under the terms of any Parent Material Contract.
Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written notice of
termination or written notice that it is in breach of or default under the
terms of any Parent Material Contract where such breach or default would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Except as would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, each Parent Material
Contract is a valid and binding obligation of Parent or the Subsidiary which
is party thereto and, to the Knowledge of Parent, of each other party thereto,
and is in full force and effect, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity
Exceptions. Except as set forth on  _Section 5.10(b)_ of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule, no approval, consent or waiver of any Person is needed in
order that any Parent Material Contract continue in full force and effect
following the consummation of the Mergers, except for approvals, consents or
waivers the failure of which to obtain would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

Section 5.11 Absence of Litigation. Except as set forth in _Section 5.11_ of
the Parent Disclosure Schedule, there are no claims, actions, suits or
proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened and to the
Knowledge of Parent, there are no investigations or audits pending or
threatened against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or any properties or
rights of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, before any court, arbitrator or
other Governmental Authority that would reasonably be expected to result,
individually or in the aggregate, in a Material Adverse Effect. Neither Parent
nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective businesses or 

 



36  properties are subject to or bound by any injunction, order, judgment,
decree or regulatory restriction of any Governmental Authority that would
reasonably be expected to result in a liability that would have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

Section 5.12 Registration Statement; Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus. None
of the information supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of Parent for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Registration Statement will, at
the time the Registration Statement becomes effective under the Securities
Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by or on
behalf of Parent for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Joint

statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. The information provided by Parent for the Registration

relating solely to the Company) will comply as to form in all material
respects with the provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no representation or warranty is made by Parent, Merger Sub
or Successor Sub with respect to statements made or incorporated by

pension benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA), all material

employee of or consultant to Parent or any ERISA Affiliate, as well as each
plan with respect to which Parent or an ERISA Affiliate could incur liability
under Section 4069 (if such plan has been or were terminated) or Section

schedules and attachments, filed with respect to each Parent Employee Plan
required to make such a filing and (iii) the most recent actuarial valuation

this _Section 5.13(a)_, the term "material," used with respect to any Parent
Employee Plan, shall mean that Parent or an ERISA Affiliate has incurred or
may incur obligations in an annual amount exceeding $150,000 with respect to
such Parent Employee Plan.

(b) Except as set forth in _Section 5.13(b)_ of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule and except as provided in any COBRA Benefits, (i) none of the Parent
Employee Plans promises or provides retiree medical or other retiree welfare
benefits to any person, (ii) none of the Parent Employee Plans is a
"multiemployer plan" as such term is defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA; (iii)
there have been no "prohibited transactions," as such term is defined in
Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, with respect to any Parent
Employee Plan that could reasonably be expected to result in, individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect; (iv) with respect to all Parent
Employee Plans, there have not been any violations of, or failures to comply
with, the applicable requirements prescribed by any and all Laws (including
ERISA and the Code) currently in effect with respect thereto (including all
applicable requirements for notification to participants or the Department of
Labor, the PBGC, the IRS or Secretary of the Treasury) that would reasonably
be expected to result in, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect, (v) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries have performed all
material obligations required to be performed by them under, are not in any
material respect in default under or violation of, and have no Knowledge of
any default or violation by any other party to, any of the Parent Employee
Plans;

 



37  (vi) each Parent Employee Plan intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of
the Code and each trust intended to qualify under Section 501(a) of the Code
is the subject of a favorable determination letter from the IRS, and nothing
has occurred which may reasonably be expected to impair such determination;
(vii) all contributions required to be made to any Parent Employee Plan
pursuant to Section 412 of the Code, or the terms of the Parent Employee Plan
or any collective bargaining agreement, have been made on or before their due
dates; (viii) with respect to each Parent Employee Plan, no "reportable event"
within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA (excluding any such event for
which the 30 day notice requirement has been waived under the regulations to
Section 4043 of ERISA) nor any event described in Section 4062, 4063 or 4041
of ERISA has occurred, in each case, that would reasonably be expected to
result in, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect; (ix)
neither Parent nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred, nor reasonably expects to
incur, any liability under Title IV of ERISA (other than liability for
premium payments to the PBGC arising in the ordinary course); and (x) there is
not, has not been and will not be any violation of the deduction limitations
imposed by Section 162(m) of the Code pursuant to or in connection with any
Parent Employee Plan that would reasonably be expected have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

(c) _Section 5.13(c)_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and
complete list of (i) all employment agreements with officers of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries; and (ii) all material severance agreements, programs and
policies of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries with or relating to its
employees.

(d) _Section 5.13(d)_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete
and accurate list of each Parent Employee Plan that is a "nonqualified
deferred compensation plan" (as defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code).
With respect to each such Parent Employee Plan, there have been no failures to
operate such Parent Employee Plan in compliance with or to have such Parent
Employee Plan in documentary compliance with the applicable provisions of
Section 409A, which such failures would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. With respect to
each such Parent Employee Plan that is not intended to be subject to Section
409A because it is not a nonqualified deferred compensation plan under Section
409A and the regulations thereunder or is otherwise exempt from its
application, all the conditions required to retain such treatment remain
in effect and are not reasonably expected to change so as to subject such
Parent Employee Plan to Section 409A. None of Parent or its Subsidiaries (x)
have failed to report to any Governmental Authority any corrections made or
Taxes due as a result of a failure to comply with Section 409A, which such
failure would reasonably be expected to result in, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect nor (y) have any indemnity or gross-up
obligation for any Taxes or interest imposed or accelerated under Section
409A or Section 280G of the Code.

(e) _Section 5.13(e)_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
complete and accurate list of all Parent Employee Plans maintained outside the
jurisdiction of the United States, or that covers any employee who performs
services outside of the United States, listed separately by applicable
country or jurisdiction (such Parent Employee Plans, the " _Non-U.S. Parent
Employee Plans_ "). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing
representations, with respect to each Non-U.S. Parent Employee Plan, (i) such
Non-U.S. Parent Employee Plan has been established, maintained and
administered in material compliance with its terms and all applicable Laws;
(ii) to the extent required to be funded such Non-U.S. Parent Employee Plan
is fully funded, and with respect to all other Non-U.S. Parent Employee

such purposes. No individual classified as a non-employee, including any
independent contractor, leased employee or consultant, for purposes of

eligible to participate in, or receive benefits under, any Parent Employee
Plan that does not specifically provide for their participation.

where the Parent Entities have not filed Tax Returns) any written notice of
deficiency or proposed adjustment for any material amount of Tax proposed,
asserted, or assessed by any Taxing authority against any Parent Entity
exceeding the amount reserved on the face of, rather than in any notes

assessed against or agreed to by the Parent Entities with respect to other
Tax Returns. None of the Parent Entities has waived any statute of limitations
in respect of any Taxes or agreed to a Tax assessment or deficiency.

(d) Each Parent Entity has complied in all material respects with all
applicable Laws relating to the withholding of Taxes and the payment thereof
to appropriate authorities, including Taxes required to have been withheld

Entity that is a member of the consolidated federal income Tax group of which
Parent is the common parent) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or
any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law, or as a transferee or
successor, by contract or otherwise.

(f) During the five-year period ending on the date hereof, none of the Parent
Entities was a distributing corporation or a controlled corporation in a
transaction intended to be governed by Section 355 of the Code.

 

(g) Since January 1, 2011, Parent has made no redemptions of shares of its
capital stock nor made any other distributions to shareholders, other than
regular quarterly dividends, stock repurchases under its stock repurchase
program, and a private repurchase from an officer, as disclosed in the Parent

Code or any comparable provision under state or foreign Tax Laws as a result
of transactions or events occurring prior to the Closing.

one hand, and the provider or providers

 



41  of the Debt Financing, on the other hand). As of the date hereof, no event
has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent under any term, or a
failure of any condition, of the Debt Commitment Letter. Neither Parent,
Merger Sub nor Successor Sub has reason to believe that Parent would be unable
to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of the Debt Commitment

Successor Subs Financing (as hereinafter defined) or any action or inaction
by Parent, Merger Sub and/or Successor Sub not done in good faith),

with respect to the current Parent Material Contracts pursuant to which
Parent and/or its Subsidiaries will receive (or are expected to receive), in

sale and use, except where the failure to receive such governmental approvals
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect. All products and services that Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries produces or performs under contracts in which Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries commits to deliver products or perform services that are
designed, manufactured, labeled and/or performed so as to comply with any
industry and/or governmental standards and specifications or Laws or orders
currently in effect have been designed, manufactured, labeled and/or performed

failures to comply as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 5.24 Customer and Supplier Relations. Parent has not received any
written notice and has no Knowledge to the effect that any of Parents ten

Effect. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is in material breach or
default, and neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries have taken any action
or failed to take any action which, with or without notice or the lapse of
time, or both, would constitute such a material breach or default, or permit

of the Parent Policies.

Section 5.26 No Other Representations or Warranties. Except for the
representations and warranties set forth in _Article IV_ , the Company has

Section 6.2 No Solicitation.

(a) Promptly following the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall, and

following the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall deliver a written
notice to each such Person to the effect that, subject to the provisions of
this _Section 6.2_, the Company is ending all discussions and negotiations
with such Person with respect to any Competing Proposal, effective on and from
date of this Agreement, and the notice shall also request such Person to

books, records or employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries, in each such
case regarding or in a manner intending to facilitate the making of any
proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Competing Proposal; _provided_ that, in the case of the foregoing clauses (i)
and (ii), the Company may respond to an unsolicited inquiry or proposal by
informing the applicable third party that the Company has entered into this
Agreement and is subject to the restrictions set forth in this Agreement;
(iii) enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, term

and after the date hereof until the earlier of the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with _Article IX_ or the Closing, neither the Board
of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw (or
change, amend, modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent, Merger Sub or
Successor Sub), or publicly propose to withdraw (or change, amend, modify or
qualify in a manner adverse to Parent, Merger Sub or Successor Sub), the
Company Board Recommendation; (ii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose
to approve or recommend, a Competing Proposal; or (iii) publicly make any
communication inconsistent with the Company Board Recommendation (any action
described in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) being referred to as a " _Change of
Recommendation_ ").

(d) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in _Section 6.2(b)_, if at any
time on or after the date hereof and prior to the receipt of the Company
Stockholders Approval, the Company (or any of the Company Representatives)
receives a Competing Proposal (in circumstances not involving a material
breach of, or any action that is materially inconsistent with, this _Section
6.2_) that constitutes or the Board of Directors of the Company reasonably
believes could be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, then the Company
may (i) furnish non-public information to the third party making such
Competing Proposal, if and only if, (A) prior to so furnishing such
information, the Company and such third party execute a confidentiality
agreement that contains confidentiality and standstill provisions that are no
less favorable to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement and that does not contain any provision calling for any exclusive
right to negotiate with such Person or prohibiting the Company from
satisfying its obligations under this Agreement (an " _Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement_ "), and (B) the Company provides to Parent any non-
public information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries that is
provided or made available to any such third party (or its representatives)
which had not previously been provided or made available to Parent within
twenty-four (24) hours after the Company provides or makes such non-public
information available to such third party; and (ii) engage in discussions or
negotiations with such third party with respect to the Competing Proposal;
_provided_ that on a reasonable and timely basis following the Company taking
such actions as described in clauses (i) or (ii) above, the Company shall
provide written notice to Parent of such Competing Proposal; _provided
further_ that (x) such notice to Parent shall identify the Person making,
and indicate in reasonable detail the terms and conditions of, such Competing
Proposal, and (y) thereafter, the Company shall provide to Parent, on a
reasonable and timely basis, copies of any proposed written agreements
received in connection with such Competing Proposal (including any material
amendments or modifications thereto). Upon Parents written request (which may
be made via e-mail), the Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed of the
status and details of any Competing Proposal.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Board of
Directors of the Company may, at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholders Approval, if the Company receives a Competing Proposal (in
circumstances not involving a material breach of, or any action that is
materially inconsistent with, this _Section 6.2_) that the Board of
Directors of the Company concludes in good faith constitutes a Superior
Proposal:

(A) effect a Change of Recommendation; and/or

(B) terminate this Agreement;

_provided_ , _however_ , that the Board of Directors may not terminate this
Agreement in accordance with the foregoing clause (B) except in connection
with entering into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Board of Directors may not effect
a Change of Recommendation pursuant to the foregoing clause (A) or terminate
this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (B) unless:

(x) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least
four (4) Business Days in advance of such Change of Recommendation or such
termination (the " _Notice Period_ "), of its intention to effect a Change of
Recommendation in response to such Superior Proposal, or to terminate
this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement for such Superior
Proposal, pursuant to this _Section 6.2(e)_, which notice shall specify the
material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal (including the
identity of the Person making such Superior Proposal);

 



49 (y) the Company and the Company Representatives shall have negotiated with
Parent in good faith during the Notice Period to make such adjustments in the
terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Competing Proposal ceases
to constitute a Superior Proposal; and

 

(z) the Board of Directors determines in good faith that the failure to effect
such Change of Recommendation in response to such Superior Proposal, or to
terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement for such
Superior Proposal, would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
Pennsylvania Law (after taking into consideration any adjustments in the
terms and conditions of this Agreement definitively offered by Parent
pursuant to the foregoing clause (y)). Each time the financial or other
material terms of a Superior Proposal subject to this clause (e) are amended,
the Company shall be required to notify Parent as promptly as reasonably
practicable of such amended terms and conditions, and the Notice Period shall
be extended an additional one (1) Business Day from the date of Parents
receipt of such information.

 

(f) For purposes of this Agreement:

(i) " _Competing Proposal_ " means any bona fide proposal, offer or indication
of interest made by a third party, from the date hereof through the date on
which the Company obtains the Company Stockholders Approval, relating to any
direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of 20% or more (by value) of the
assets, net revenues, or net income of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, or 20% or more of the combined voting power of the shares of
Company Common Stock, any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated
would result in any Person beneficially owning 20% or more of the combined
voting power of the shares of Company Common Stock or any merger,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in which the other party thereto or its shareholders would own
20% or more of the combined voting power of the parent entity resulting from
any such transaction, other than transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a Competing Proposal not solicited or
initiated in material breach of _Section 6.2(a)_ or _(b) _that the Board of
Directors of the Company in good faith determines would, if consummated,
result in a transaction that is (A) more favorable to the Companys
shareholders from a financial point of view than the transactions contemplated
hereby, after taking into account any changes to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement definitely offered by Parent during the Notice Period and (B)
reasonably capable of being consummated on the terms proposed, taking into
account all financial aspects and conditions to closing; _provided_ that, for
purposes of the definition of "Superior Proposal," the references to "20% or
more" in the definition of Competing Proposal shall be deemed to be references
to "50% or more". 

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Board of Directors of the Company from (i) complying with its disclosure
obligations under Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, (ii)
making a statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule
14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to a Competing Proposal
or (iii) making any disclosure to its shareholders where the failure to make
such disclosure would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board
of Directors of the Company to the Companys shareholders under Pennsylvania
Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) any such disclosure relating to a
Competing Proposal (other than a "stop, look and listen communication" of the
type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) or a disclosure which expresses no view of
the Competing Proposal except that it is pending further consideration by the
Company) shall be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation, unless the Board of
Directors of the Company expressly publicly reaffirms the Company Board
Recommendation in connection with such disclosure; and (B) nothing in this
_Section 6.2(g)_ shall be deemed to permit the Company or the Board of
Directors of the Company (or any committee thereof) to make a Change of
Recommendation, except to the extent and under the circumstances permitted by
_Section 6.2(e)_.

 

Section 6.3 Conduct of Business by Parent Pending the First Step Merger.
Parent covenants and agrees that, except as contemplated by this Agreement,
during the period from the date of this Agreement and continuing until the
earlier of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article IX_
or the Closing, 

 



50  unless the Company shall otherwise consent in writing (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Parent shall, in all
material respects, conduct its business and shall cause the businesses of its
Subsidiaries to be conducted only in, and Parent and its Subsidiaries shall
not take any action except in, the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice; and Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
preserve substantially intact the business organization of Parent and its
Subsidiaries, to keep available the services of the present officers, key
employees and key consultants of Parent and its Subsidiaries and to preserve
the present relationships of Parent and its Subsidiaries with customers,
suppliers and other Persons with which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has
material business relations or take any actions which would reasonably be
expected to interfere with or delay the consummation of the Mergers or
otherwise breach this Agreement. By way of amplification and not limitation,
except as contemplated by this Agreement, neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall, during the period from the date of this Agreement and
continuing until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Article IX_ or the Closing, directly or indirectly do any of
the following without the prior written consent of the Company (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed in the case of
_Section 6.3(c)_ below) regardless of whether any of the following may have
been undertaken by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of
business prior to the date hereof (except to the extent specifically
indicated herein):

(a) amend or otherwise change its Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or,
except in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, amend
or otherwise change the Subsidiary Documents of any of Parents Subsidiaries;

 

(b) engage in any material repurchase of, or any recapitalization or other
material change, restructuring or reorganization with respect to, Parent
Common Stock, including payment of any dividend or other distribution in
respect to shares of Parent Common Stock (other than Parents regular
quarterly cash dividends, issuances under its Dividend Reinvestment Plan and
issuances pursuant to its employee stock purchase plan, each materially
consistent with past practice);

(c) issue, sell, pledge, dispose of or encumber, or authorize the issuance,
sale, pledge, disposition or encumbrance of, shares of capital stock of any
class, or any options, warrants, convertible securities or other rights of any

ownership interest (including any phantom interest) in Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, except for (i) issuances of shares of Parent Common Stock or
equity awards convertible into or exercisable for shares of Parent Common
Stock pursuant to any of the Parent Employee Plans referenced in _Section
5.13(a)_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, (ii) issuances of shares of Parent
Common Stock upon the exercise of any stock options or warrants outstanding

issuances of shares of Parent Common Stock under the Companys Dividend
Reinvestment Plan, (iv) issuances of shares of Parent Common Stock to
the extent permitted pursuant to _Section 6.3(e)_ below, and (v) issuances
of the Parent Common Stock Consideration to former holders of Company Common
Stock in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement;

(d) take any action to materially change income tax credit recognition
policies or procedures or accounting policies or procedures (including

and collection of accounts receivable), except as may be appropriate to
conform to changes in regulatory accounting requirements or GAAP; 

(e) (i) acquire (by merger, consolidation, or acquisition of stock or assets)
any corporation, partnership or other business organization or division

(other than loans or advances to or from direct or indirect wholly
owned Subsidiaries and letters of credit issued in the ordinary course of
business operations in connection with customer contracts, consistent with
past practice). For purposes

 



51  of this _Section 6.3(e)_, the Companys consent shall not be deemed
unreasonably withheld if the action (A) could reasonably be expected to have
an adverse impact upon Parent, Merger Sub or Successor Subs ability to close
on the Debt Financing (or any alternative financing) or (B) could reasonably
be expected to dilute the Parent Common Stock Consideration to be received by
the holders of Company Common Stock as of the First Step Effective Time;

(f) enter into or adopt a plan or agreement of complete or partial
liquidation, dissolution, restructuring, recapitalization, merger,
consolidation or other reorganization (other than transactions exclusively

(g) fail to maintain in full force and effect material insurance policies
covering Parent and its Subsidiaries and their respective properties, assets
and businesses in a form and amount consistent with past practices;

of Parent (or any such Persons immediate family members or Affiliates or
associates, as applicable), except if the action is approved by the Board of
Directors of Parent or its Compensation or Audit Committee; or

 

(i) take, or agree in writing or otherwise resolve to take, any of the actions
described in _Section 6.3(a)-(h) _above, or any action which would make any
of the representations or warranties of Parent contained in this Agreement
untrue or incorrect in any material respect or prevent Parent from performing
or cause Parent not to perform its covenants hereunder. 

Section 6.4 Recommendation of the Board of Directors of Parent. Unless the
Company shall have effected a Change of Recommendation, the Board of
Directors of Parent shall recommend the approval of the issuance of Parent

withdraw or modify the Parent Board Recommendation.

Time any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their
respective Affiliates, directors or officers, should be discovered by the
Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to

Agreement pursuant to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and each of the
Company and Parent shall include in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus the

Certificate or Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws to effect the Mergers.

 

Section 7.3 New York Stock Exchange Delisting; Deregistration. Prior to the
Closing, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use commercially
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause

listing of the Company Common Stock from the NYSE and the deregistration of
the Company Common Stock under the Exchange Act promptly after the First Step

Section 7.4 Notification of Certain Matters. Each of the Company and Parent
shall give prompt notice to the other of, along with copies of any and all
documents reasonably pertaining to, the following:

(a) the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event whose occurrence or
nonoccurrence would be reasonably likely to cause either (i) any
representation or warranty of such Party contained in this Agreement to be
untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at any time from the date hereof
to the First Step Effective Time, or (ii) directly or indirectly, any
Material Adverse Effect on such Party; and

(b) any material failure of such Party to comply with or satisfy any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant
to this _Section 7.4_ shall not (x) cure any breach of, or non-compliance
with, any other provision of this Agreement or (y) limit or otherwise affect
the remedies available to the Party receiving such notice.

Section 7.5 Access to Information.

(a) From and after the date hereof until the earlier of the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with _Article IX_ or the Closing, the Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries, and its and their officers,

auditors, counsel and agents of Parent reasonable access at all reasonable
times to the Companys and its Subsidiaries officers, employees, auditors,
counsel, agents, properties, offices and other facilities and to all of their
respective books and records, and shall make available to Parent all
financial, operating and other data and information (except for documents or
information relating to the Companys consideration, evaluation, assessment
and/or negotiation of this Agreement or the Mergers or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any Competing Proposal or Superior Proposal
(except as otherwise required pursuant to _Section 6.2_)) as Parent
may reasonably request and as will not unreasonably interfere with the
ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries in any material
respect. From time to time as reasonably requested by Parent or the Company,
Parent will consult with the Chief Executive Officer and/or the Chief
Financial Officer of the Company regarding the scope of access to information
contemplated by this _Section 7.5_, and the Parties will agree on the
appropriate level of detail and scope of access required by and consistent
with this _Section 7.5_. No investigation pursuant to this _Section 7.5(a)_
shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by the
Company herein or the conditions to the obligations of the Parties hereto
under this Agreement, or limit or otherwise affect the remedies available to
Parent, Merger Sub or Successor Sub pursuant to this Agreement.

 



54 (b) In the event Parent learns of a breach by the Company of this _Section
7.5_, Parent shall provide the Company with written notice and the Company
shall have the opportunity to cure such breach within five (5) days of receipt
of such notice from Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) if such breach
is not reasonably capable of being cured within such five (5) day period, and
the Company diligently works to effect a cure, then the Company will have such
additional time as is reasonably necessary to cure the breach, and (ii) if
such breach is not predominantly within the Companys control, then the
Company shall not be liable for breach of this _Section 7.5_ so long as the
Company has used commercially reasonable efforts to cause the other party or
parties having control over such breach to cure same. The Company shall only
be liable for breaches of this _Section 7.5_ that are not cured in accordance
with this _Section 7.5(b)_.

 

(c) Parent agrees that all information so received from the Company or its
Subsidiaries shall be deemed received pursuant to the confidentiality
agreement letter, dated as of April 11, 2012, between the Company and Parent
(the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") and the two Common Interest and
Confidentiality Agreements, each dated as of February 13, 2013, between the
Company and Parent (collectively, the " _Common Interest Agreements_ ").

Section 7.6 Public Announcements.

(a) The initial press release with respect to the Mergers, this Agreement and
the other transactions contemplated hereby shall be a joint press release to
be reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Thereafter, none of the
Parties shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or other
public announcement (to the extent not previously issued or made in
accordance with this Agreement) with respect to the Mergers, this Agreement or
the other transactions contemplated hereby without the prior consent of the
other Parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), subject to _Section 6.2_ hereof and as may be contemplated by
other provisions of this Agreement and also except as may be required by Law
or by any applicable listing agreement with NASDAQ or the NYSE,
as applicable, as determined in the good faith judgment of the Party
proposing to make such release (in which case such Party shall not issue or
cause the publication of such press release or other public announcement
without prior consultation with the other Party).

(b) Reasonably in advance of each of the Companys quarterly earnings releases
or announcements during the period from the date hereof until the earlier of
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article IX_ or the
Closing, the Company shall provide Parent and its financial advisors with
proposed drafts of all Company SEC filings, press releases, conference call
scripts and similar materials relating to such earnings release or
announcement. The Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on such materials prior to their public filing or other
release.

Section 7.7 Commercially Reasonable Efforts.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the Parties
shall cooperate with the other Party and use (and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to use) its commercially reasonable efforts to promptly (i) take,
or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, all things,
necessary, proper or advisable to cause the conditions to Closing to
be satisfied as promptly as commercially practicable and to consummate and
make effective, as promptly as commercially practicable, the transactions
contemplated hereby, including preparing and filing promptly and fully all
documentation to effect all necessary filings, notices, petitions,
statements, registrations, submissions of information, applications and other
documents (including any required or recommended filings under Antitrust
Laws), and (ii) obtain all approvals, consents, registrations, permits,
authorizations and other confirmations from any Governmental Authority or
third party necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Mergers and the
other transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(b) Each of the Parties shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i)
cooperate in all reasonable respects with each other in connection with any
filing or submission with a Governmental Authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and in connection with any
investigation or

 



55  other inquiry by or before a Governmental Authority relating to such
transactions, including any proceeding initiated by a private party, and (ii)
keep the other Parties reasonably informed in all material respects and on a
reasonably timely basis of any material communication received by such Party
from, or given by such Party to, any Governmental Authority and of any
material communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by
a private party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated
hereby. Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information,
each of the Parties shall have the right to review in advance, and to the
extent practicable each will consult the other on, all the information
relating to the other Parties and their respective Subsidiaries, as the case
may be, that appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted
to, any third party and/or any Governmental Authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby.

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of the
Parties shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such
objections, if any, as may be asserted by a Governmental Authority or other
Person with respect to the Mergers or the other transactions
contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of
this Agreement, neither the Company nor Parent shall, without the other
partys prior written consent, commit to any divestiture transaction or agree
to any restriction on its business, and nothing in this _Section 7.7_ shall
(i) limit any applicable rights a Party may have to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Article IX_ so long as such Party has up to then complied in all
material respects with its obligations under this _Section 7.7_; (ii)
require Parent to offer, accept or agree to (A) dispose or hold separate any
part of its or the Companys businesses, operations, assets or product lines
(or a combination of Parents and the Companys respective businesses,
operations, assets or product lines), (B) not compete in any geographic area
or line of business, and/or (C) restrict the manner in which, or whether,
Parent, the Company, the First Step Surviving Corporation, the Surviving
Entity or any of their Affiliates may carry on business in any part of the
world; or (iii) require any Party to contest or otherwise resist any
administrative or judicial action or proceeding, including any proceeding by
a private party, challenging the Mergers or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Law.

Section 7.8 Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance.

(a) As of the First Step Effective Time, the indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation provisions contained in the Articles of Incorporation
and Bylaws of the First Step Surviving Corporation shall be at least as
favorable to individuals who are now, or have been at any time prior to the
date hereof or who become prior to the Closing Date, a director, officer,
agent or employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries or otherwise entitled to
compulsory indemnification under the Companys or such Subsidiarys Bylaws or
Articles of Incorporation or Subsidiary Documents (an "Indemnified Party"), as
those contained as of the date hereof in the Bylaws and Articles of
Incorporation or Subsidiary Documents of the Company or such Subsidiary,
respectively, and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified, and,
together with all indemnification contracts between the Company and any
Indemnified Party set forth on _Section 7.8(a)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, shall be observed and complied with in all material respects, for a
period of six years from and after the Closing Date.

 

(b) For six years from and after the First Step Effective Time, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law, Parent and the First Step Surviving
Corporation (the " _Indemnifying Parties_ ") shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless each Indemnified Party who was a director or officer of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof against all losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, fees and actual expenses, amounts paid in settlement,
judgments and fines that may be imposed upon or incurred by such Indemnified
Party in connection with any threatened, pending or completed action, suit
or proceeding (whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative),
threatened or initiated by reason of any actions or omissions in their
capacity as a director or officer occurring at or prior to the First Step
Effective Time (including in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement), unless the action or omission giving rise to the claim for
indemnification is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have
constituted willful misconduct or recklessness. In addition, the Indemnifying
Parties shall advance all expenses actually incurred by each such

 



56  Indemnified Party who was a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as of the date hereof for any legal or other out-of-pocket
expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with
investigating or defending any such losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
fees, out-of-pocket expenses, judgments and fines within ninety (90) days
after the receipt by Parent of a statement or statements from such
Indemnified Party requesting such advance or advances from time to time,
subject to Parents receipt of a written undertaking by such Indemnified Party
to promptly repay such legal and other fees and expenses paid in advance if it
is ultimately determined in a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be
indemnified hereunder or under applicable Law. As soon as practicable after
receipt by any Indemnified Party entitled to indemnification under this
_Section 7.8(b)_ of notice of the commencement of any action, suit or
proceeding specified in this _Section 7.8(b)_, such Indemnified Party shall
notify Parent in writing of the commencement or threat thereof; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the omission to so notify Parent shall not relieve Parent
from its obligations under this _Section 7.8_, unless Parent shall have been
prejudiced by the omission or delay in notification. With respect to any such
action, suit or proceeding as to which such Indemnified Party notifies Parent
of the commencement or threat thereof, Parent may participate therein at its
own expense and, to the extent that it desires, Parent shall be entitled to
assume the defense thereof, with counsel selected by Parent to the reasonable
satisfaction of such Indemnified Party; _provided_ that Parent shall not be
entitled to assume the defense of any action, suit or proceeding brought by
or on behalf of Parent or as to which such Indemnified Party shall have
reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of interest in the conduct
of the defense of such action, suit or proceeding. After notice from Parent
to such Indemnified Party of its election to assume the defense thereof,
Parent shall not be liable to such Indemnified Party under this _Section 7.8_
for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified
Party in connection with the defense thereof, other than as provided below.
The applicable Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ his or her own
counsel in such action, but the fees and expenses of such counsel incurred
after notice from Parent of its assumption of the defense thereof shall be at
the expense of such Indemnified Party, unless (i) the employment of counsel by
such Indemnified Party shall have been authorized by Parent; (ii) such
Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a
conflict of interest between Parent and such Indemnified Party in the conduct
of the defense of such action, suit or proceeding; or (iii) Parent shall not
in fact have employed counsel to assume the defense of such action, suit or
proceeding. So long as the Indemnifying Party is not in breach of this
_Section 7.8_, such Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement
effected without Parents prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed).

(c) Parent shall cause to be obtained, at no cost to the Indemnified
Parties, promptly but no later than thirty (30) days following the First Step
Effective Time, a purchase of an extended reporting discovery period
containing a claims period not less than six years from the First Step
Effective Time with respect to directors and officers liability insurance
in amount and scope at least as favorable as the Companys existing policies
for claims arising from facts or events that occurred at or prior to the First
Step Effective Time;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Parent
be required to expend pursuant to this Section 7.8 more than an amount equal
to 250% of the current annual premiums paid by the Company for such insurance.

 

(d) This _Section 7.8_ shall survive the consummation of the Mergers and
continue in full force and effect and, from and after the First Step
Effective Time, is intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party as a third-party beneficiary.

(e) In the event that the First Step Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger (including pursuant to the Second Step
Merger) or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then in each such case, proper provision
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the First Step Surviving
Corporation or Parent or the acquirer of the properties and assets thereof, as
the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this  _Section
7.8_.

 



57 (f) The indemnification provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of
any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant
to Law, contract or otherwise.

(g) Parent shall pay all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including
reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by the persons referred to in
this _Section 7.8_ in connection with the successful enforcement of their
rights provided in this  _Section 7.8_, as determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction. The burden of proving that indemnification is not
appropriate shall be on Parent.

Section 7.9 Employee Matters.

(a) Parent hereby agrees that, immediately following the First Step Effective
Time, subject to the terms of _Section 7.9(c)_, it shall, or it shall cause
the First Step Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Entity, as applicable
to, (i) provide, for a period of six (6) months after the Closing, each
employee of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries as of the First Step
Effective Time (each, an " _Employee_ ") with at least the same level of base
salary (excluding equity compensation) as was provided to each such Employee
immediately prior to the First Step Effective Time, but only so long as they
remain employed by the First Step Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Entity
or Parent, and (ii) provide, through and including December 31, 2013, the
Employees (for so long as they remain employed by the First Step Surviving
Corporation, the Surviving Entity or Parent) with the same health and welfare
employee benefits arrangements as were provided to each such Employee
immediately prior to the First Step Effective Time, excluding (for the
avoidance of doubt) equity-based plans or arrangements, retirement plans or
arrangements not generally available to all Employees and any employee benefit
plans or arrangements that provide for acceleration of benefits, change of
control payments and/or termination in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the above, from
and after the First Step Effective Time, Parent shall cause the First Step
Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Entity, as applicable, and its
Subsidiaries to honor in accordance with their terms, (A) all employment
agreements and change in control agreements listed on _Section 7.9_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, except in the event the individuals covered under
such agreements enter into new agreements with Parent that supersede or change
the terms of such employment agreements and change-in-control agreements
listed on _Section 7.9(a)(A)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, (B) for a
period of twelve (12) months following the First Step Effective Time, the
Companys severance plan listed on  _Section 7.9(a)(B)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule and (C) for the duration of each such agreement, those
severance agreements listed on _Section 7.9(a)(C)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule.

 

(b) Employees shall receive credit for purposes of eligibility to participate,
vesting, benefit accrual and eligibility to receive benefits, but excluding
benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan (other than a plan
into which was merged a Company defined benefit plan) or equity-based plans,
under any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement established
or maintained by Parent, the First Step Surviving Corporation or the
Surviving Entity under which the Employee may be eligible to participate on or
after the First Step Effective Time to the same extent recognized by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to its own Employees under
comparable plans immediately prior to the First Step Effective Time, but which
shall not result in the duplication of benefits thereunder.

 

(c) The provisions of this _Section 7.9_ are for the sole benefit of the
Parties to this Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is
intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any Person (including
for the avoidance of doubt any present or former employees or directors,
consultants or independent contractors of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or on or after the First
Step Effective Time, the First Step Surviving Corporation, the Surviving
Entity or any of their Subsidiaries), other than the Parties hereto and their
respective permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other
rights or remedies (with respect to the matters provided for in this _Section
7.9_) under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement. Nothing contained
in this  _Section 7.9_ shall (i) be treated as an amendment to any Company
Employee Plan, or (ii) obligate Parent, the First Step Surviving Corporation,
the Surviving Entity or any of their Affiliates to retain the employment of
any particular employee or, except to the extent provided in

 



58   _Section 7.9(a)(A)-(C)_, maintain any particular plan, contract,
arrangement, commitment or understanding or prevent Parent, the First Step
Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Entity or any of their Affiliates from
amending or modifying any particular plan, contract, arrangement, commitment
or understanding in accordance with its terms and applicable Law.

Section 7.10 Stock Exchange Listing. Parent shall use all reasonable efforts
to obtain, prior to the First Step Effective Time, the approval for listing on
the NASDAQ, effective upon official notice of issuance, of the shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued at the First Step Effective Time pursuant to
_Articles II_ and _III_.

Section 7.11 No Shelf Registration. Parent shall not be required to amend or
maintain the effectiveness of the Registration Statement for the purpose of
permitting resale of the shares of Parent Common Stock received pursuant
hereto by the Persons who may be deemed to be "affiliates" of the Company or
Parent within the meaning of Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act.

 

Section 7.12 Qualification as Reorganization for U.S. Federal Income Tax
Purposes.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, each Party hereto shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Mergers to qualify as a reorganization under
the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code, and shall not, without the prior
written consent of the other Parties to this Agreement, intentionally take any
actions, intentionally cause any actions to be taken or intentionally omit to
take any action which such action or omission could prevent the Mergers from
qualifying as such a reorganization. In furtherance of the foregoing, if
either the Company or Parent concludes that it would be preferable
for Successor Sub to be organized as a limited liability company (rather than
a corporation), then (i) prior to the Closing, Parent shall cause Successor
Sub to be converted into a limited liability company in accordance with
Delaware Law and the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act and (ii) the
Parties will make appropriate conforming amendments to this Agreement to
reflect the status of Successor Sub and the Surviving Entity as a limited
liability company.

 

(b) Parent and the Company shall cooperate with each other and use reasonable
commercial efforts to obtain on or about the Closing Date the opinion of Fox
Rothschild LLP, special counsel to the Company, and the opinion of Barnes and
Thornburg LLP, special counsel to Parent (each such counsel, " _Tax Counsel_
"), substantially to the effect that, on the basis of the facts,
representations and assumptions set forth in such opinion, (i) the combined
effect of the Mergers will be to cause the Mergers to qualify as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and (ii)
the Company, Merger Sub, Successor Sub and Parent each will be a "party to
the reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code.

(c) Parent and the Company shall cooperate with each other and use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain for inclusion in the Registration
Statement and any amendment thereto, an opinion from each Tax Counsel, in
such form as each Tax Counsel may deem appropriate, as to the tax consequences
of the contemplated Mergers as may be required by the SEC in connection with
the filing of such Registration Statement or any amendment thereto.

 

(d) It is agreed that Parent, Merger Sub, Successor Sub and the Company shall
each provide reasonable cooperation to each Tax Counsel in rendering their
opinions pursuant to _Sections 7.12(b)_ and _7.12(c)_ , which shall include
the provision of certificates setting forth data and such other information as
may be requested by such Tax Counsel including, but not limited to such
information as may be necessary or appropriate to make a reasonable assessment
as to compliance with the continuity of interest requirement under Section
368(a) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.
Neither Company nor Parent presently knows of any reason why the Company or
Parent, as applicable, will not be able to deliver such certificates.

(e) If the tax opinion of both of the Tax Counsel referred to in _Section
7.12(b) _is obtained (and remains in effect) by the Closing Date, then each of
the Parties shall report the Mergers for U.S. federal income tax purposes as
a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. However,
for the avoidance of

 



59  doubt, obtaining the tax opinions of either or both of the Tax Counsel
referred to in _Section 7.12(b) _shall not be a condition to any Partys
obligation to consummate the Mergers or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

Section 7.13 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the First Step Effective Time, the
Company shall take all such reasonable steps as may be required (to the extent
permitted under applicable Law) to cause any dispositions of shares of Company
Common Stock or Company Equity Awards (including derivative securities with
respect to such shares) that are treated as dispositions under Rule 16b-(3)
promulgated under the Exchange Act and resulting from the transactions
contemplated by _Article II_ by each individual who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-(3) promulgated under the Exchange
Act.

Section 7.14 Financing.

(a) Parent, Merger Sub and Successor Sub acknowledge and agree that the
Company and its Affiliates and its and their respective representatives shall
not, prior to the First Step Effective Time, incur any liability to any Person
under any financing that Parent, Merger Sub and Successor Sub may raise in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
cooperation provided pursuant to this _Section 7.14_ or _Section 7.15_ and
that Parent, Merger Sub and Successor Sub shall, on a joint and several
basis, indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Affiliates and its and
their respective representatives from and against any losses, damages, claims,
costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the
Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, and any
information utilized in connection therewith.

(b) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and Successor Sub shall use its reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the
proceeds of the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in the
Debt Commitment Letter (as amended, modified, supplemented or replaced in
accordance with the terms hereof), including: (i) entering into definitive
agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contained in the
Debt Commitment Letter as promptly as practicable after the date hereof;
_provided_ that, subject to the provisions of this _Section 7.14_, Parent,
Merger Sub and Successor Sub may replace or amend the Debt Commitment Letter;
(ii) satisfying, or causing their representatives to satisfy, on a timely
basis all conditions applicable to Parent, Merger Sub, Successor Sub or their
respective representatives that are within their respective control in such
definitive agreements; (iii) complying with its affirmative and negative
covenants set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter; and (iv) using commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the lenders and any other Persons providing the
Debt Financing to fund the Debt Financing at the Closing.

(c) Parent shall not agree to any amendments or modifications to, or grant
any waivers of, any condition or other provision under the Debt Commitment
Letter without the prior written consent of the Company, which may be
unreasonably refused if such amendments, modifications or waivers would in any
material respect adversely delay or impact the ability of Parent to
consummate the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent may amend or modify the Debt
Commitment Letter without the consent of the Company to add or replace
lenders, lead arrangers, syndication agents or similar entities that had not
executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof so long as such
addition or replacement is not reasonably expected to (i) delay or
prevent the Closing or (ii) make the funding of the Debt Financing (or
satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing) less likely to
occur. Parent shall not release or consent to the termination of the
obligations of the lenders under the Debt Commitment Letter, except for
assignments and replacements of an individual lender under the terms of or in
connection with the syndication of the Debt Financing or as otherwise
expressly contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or this  _Section
7.14_; _provided_ , in each case, that in no event shall Parent, Merger Sub or
Successor Sub be obligated or required to initiate any claim, actions, suits
or proceedings against any Person party to the Debt Commitment Letter or any
of the Financing Agreements. The parties to the Debt Commitment Letter (other
than Parent) and any such additional or replacement lenders are referred to in
this Agreement collectively as the " _Financing_  

 



60   _Sources_ ," and each Affiliate and controlling Person thereof, together
with each of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents,
advisors, attorneys and other representatives are referred to in this
Agreement as the " _Financing Source Related Parties_."

(d) In the event that any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable
in the manner or from the sources contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter,
(i) Parent shall within three days thereof so notify the Company in writing
and (ii) Parent, Merger Sub and Successor Sub shall use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to arrange and obtain, and to negotiate and
enter into definitive agreements with respect to, alternative financing from
alternative financial institutions in an amount sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event (and in any event no later than the
Closing Date). The definitive agreements entered into pursuant to the first
sentence of this _Section 7.14(d)_ or _Section 7.14(b)(i)_ are referred to
in this Agreement, collectively, as the " _Financing Agreements_."

 

(e) Parent shall (i) promptly furnish to the Company complete, correct and
executed copies of the Financing Agreements and copies of any and all
material written documentation pertaining to the availability of the Debt
Financing (or any alternative financing), (ii) give the Company written notice
within three days of any withdrawal, termination, amendment, supplement
or modification of the Debt Commitment Letter or any alternative financing
commitment, of any developments, facts or circumstances that reasonably could
be concluded to result in the inability of Parent to satisfy on a timely basis
any term or condition of the Debt Commitment Letter required to be satisfied
by Parent, or of any material breach or material threatened breach by any
party of any of the Debt Commitment Letter, any alternative financing
commitment, the Financing Agreements, or any alternative financing agreement
of which Parent, Merger Sub or Successor Sub becomes aware or any termination
thereof, and (iii) otherwise keep the Company reasonably informed of the
status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing (or any alternative
financing).

Section 7.15 Financing Cooperation.

 

(a) Prior to the First Step Effective Time, the Company shall and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to cooperate, and shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause its officers, employees, representatives, auditors and
advisors, including legal and accounting advisors, to cooperate, in connection
with the arrangement of the Debt Financing, any debt payoff and/or
any defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of existing indebtedness of the
Company and/or any Company Subsidiary, in each case, as may be reasonably
requested by Parent and as will not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries in any material respect,
including: (i) participating in a reasonable number of meetings, drafting
sessions, rating agency presentations, due diligence sessions, and "road show"
and other customary marketing presentations; (ii) making available to any
financing sources as promptly as practicable pertinent information in writing
regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries as is reasonably requested in
connection with the Debt Financing; (iii) assisting any financing sources in
the preparation of (A) one or more customary offering documents, information
memoranda and/or documents in connection with the Debt Financing and (B)
materials for rating agency presentations; (iv) executing and delivering
customary pledge and security documents or other financing documents, a
certificate of the chief financial officer of the Company with respect to
solvency of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis
to the extent reasonably required in connection with the Debt Financing, and
other customary certificates or documents and back-up therefor and legal
opinions as may be reasonably requested by Parent and otherwise facilitating
the pledging of collateral, all such obligations under any such agreements to
be subject to the Closing; (v) taking all reasonably required corporate
actions, subject to the consummation of the Mergers, to permit the
consummation of the Debt Financing; (vi) providing authorization letters to
any financing sources authorizing the distribution of information to
prospective lenders and containing customary representations to the arranger
of any financing that the information contained in any offering document or
information memorandum relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries does not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; (vii) using
commercially

 



61  reasonable efforts to cooperate with Parent and Parents efforts to obtain
customary consents, landlord waivers and estoppels, non-disturbance
agreements, non-invasive environmental assessments, legal opinions, surveys
and title insurance (including providing reasonable access to Parent and its
representatives to all of the Companys Owned Real Property and all real
property that the Company or any or any Company Subsidiary leases, subleases
or otherwise uses or occupies, or has the right to use or occupy, pursuant to
a Lease) as reasonably requested by Parent; (viii) taking all actions
reasonably necessary to permit the prospective lenders involved in the Debt
Financing to evaluate the Companys and each Company Subsidiarys current
assets, cash management and accounting systems, policies and procedures
relating thereto for the purpose of establishing collateral arrangements to
the extent customary and reasonable; (ix) requesting customary payoff
letters, lien terminations and instruments of discharge to be delivered at
Closing to allow for the payoff, discharge and termination in full on the
Closing Date of all indebtedness and liens under the Companys financing
facilities and arrangements, as reasonably requested by Parent; (x) making
available to Parent and its financing sources promptly all documentation and
other information required by any Governmental Authority with respect to the
Debt Financing under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering
rules and regulations; and (xi) cooperating reasonably with the financing
sources due diligence of the Company and its Subsidiaries, to the extent
customary and reasonable. Parent shall, promptly upon termination of this
Agreement (if any), reimburse the Company for all reasonable, documented out-
of-pocket expenses and costs incurred in connection with the Companys or its
Affiliates obligations under this _Section 7.15_.

(b) In addition, prior to the First Step Effective Time, the Company shall:
(i) use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause Marcum LLP, independent
accountants of the Company, to provide a letter or letters containing
statements and information of the type ordinarily included in accountants
"comfort letters" to underwriters with respect to financial statements and
certain financial information used in connection with the Debt Financing; (ii)
use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide customary representation
letters and other authorizations or information to Marcum LLP, to enable them
to provide the foregoing "comfort letters"; (iii) use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of Marcum LLP for the inclusion of
its reports on the Company in any document or documents to be used in
connection with the Debt Financing; and (iv) cause the appropriate
representatives of the Company to execute and deliver any
definitive financing documents or other certificates or documents as may be
reasonably requested by Parent for delivery at the consummation of the Debt
Financing.

(c) All non-public or other confidential information provided or made
available by the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of the Company
Representatives pursuant to this _Section 7.15_ shall be kept confidential
in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement and the Common Interest
Agreements; _provided_ that Parent, Merger Sub and Successor Sub shall be
permitted to disclose such information to potential sources of capital,
rating agencies, prospective lenders and investors and their respective
representatives as reasonably required in connection with the Debt Financing
so long as such Persons agree to be bound by the confidentiality and non-
disclosure provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement or other customary
confidentiality undertakings no less restrictive than the confidentiality and

(d) In the event Parent learns of a breach by the Company of this _Section

shall have the opportunity to cure such breach within five (5) days of receipt
of such notice from Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) if such breach
is not reasonably capable of being cured within such five (5) day period, and
the Company diligently works to effect a cure, then the Company will have such
additional time as is reasonably necessary to cure the breach, and (ii) if
such breach is not predominantly within the Companys control, then the
Company shall not be liable for breach of this _Section 7.15_ so long as the
Company has used commercially reasonable efforts to cause the other party or
parties having control over such breach to cure same. The Company shall only
be liable for breaches of this _Section 7.15_ that are not cured in
accordance with this _Section 7.15(d)_.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither the

notify the other of any stockholder litigation against it or any of its
directors or officers arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the
Mergers or the other transactions contemplated hereby and shall keep the other
reasonably informed regarding any such stockholder litigation. Each of Parent

Stock in reliance on the provisions of Rule 144 promulgated under the
Securities Act, such Person shall furnish the Parent with a certificate
containing factual representations as reasonably requested by Parent to
support such Persons reliance on Rule 144 and to support such Persons
reliance on any exemptions under any applicable state securities Laws relating
to the registration or qualification of securities for sale. Upon receipt
of such certificate, and assuming that all other conditions to reliance on
Rule 144 and such exemptions under any applicable state Laws relating to the
registration or qualification of securities for sale have been satisfied,
Parent shall (a) cause its counsel to deliver a legal opinion stating that
the proposed sale or other disposition of such securities may be effected
without registration under the Securities Act and will not result in any
violation of any applicable state securities Laws relating to the
registration or qualification of securities for sale, and (b) after receipt of
such legal opinion, take such actions as are reasonably necessary to effect
such transfer of such securities.

 

Section 7.18 No Adverse Effect if Corporate Tax. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, if any Income Tax is imposed on any of
Parent, Company, Merger Sub or Successor Sub as a result of the Mergers, then
Parent and Successor Sub shall solely bear such Tax, and the imposition of

warranty or covenant by any Party to this Agreement. This _Section 7.18_
shall survive the consummation of the Mergers.

Stockholders Approval, if any such amendment or waiver shall by applicable
Law or in accordance with the rules and regulations of the NYSE require
further approval of the stockholders of the Company, the effectiveness of
such amendment or waiver shall be subject to the approval of the stockholders
of the Company. At any time prior to the First Step Effective Time, any Party
may, subject to applicable Law, (a) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of any other Party, (b) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or acts of any other Party or (c) waive

[LETTERHEAD OF SIGNATORY IF APPLICABLE] 

April 21, 2013

Met-Pro Corporation

160 Cassell Road

 

Harleysville, Pennsylvania 19438

Ladies and Gentlemen:

In connection with the Agreement and Plan of Merger, of even date herewith (as
the same may be amended from time to time, the " _Merger Agreement_ "),
entered into by and among Met-Pro Corporation, a Pennsylvania corporation (the
" _Company_ "), CECO Environmental Corp., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_
"), Mustang Acquisition Inc., a Delaware corporation, and Mustang Acquisition
II Inc., a Delaware corporation, the undersigned, a holder of Parent Common
Stock, hereby agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Lock-Up
Agreement (this " _Agreement_ "), effective upon the closing of the First
Step Merger (the " _Closing_ "). Terms used but not defined herein shall have
the meanings ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement.

 

To induce the Company to enter into the Merger Agreement and to effect the
Closing, the undersigned agrees that the undersigned will not, for a period
commencing on the Closing Date and ending one hundred eighty (180) days after
the Closing Date (the " _Lock-Up Period_ "), (1) offer, pledge, sell, contract
to sell, grant any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or
contract to sell, or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, or (2)
enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole
or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of any shares of
Parent Common Stock, or any options or warrants to purchase any shares of
Parent Common Stock, or any securities convertible into, exchangeable for or
that represent the right to receive shares of Parent Common Stock, whether
owned as of the Closing Date or thereafter acquired during the Lock-Up
Period, owned directly by the undersigned (including holding as a custodian)
or with respect to which the undersigned has beneficial ownership within the
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(collectively, the " _Undersigned s Shares_"), whether any such transaction
described in clause (1) or (2) above is to be settled by delivery of the
Undersigneds Shares or such other securities, in cash or otherwise. The
foregoing restrictions are expressly agreed to preclude the undersigned from
engaging in any hedging or other transaction during the Lock-Up Period that is
designed to or that reasonably could be expected to lead to or result in a
sale or disposition of the Undersigneds Shares even if such shares would be
disposed of by someone other than the undersigned. Such prohibited hedging or
other transactions would include, without limitation, any short sale or any
purchase, sale or grant of any right (including, without limitation, any put
or call option) with respect to any of the Undersigneds Shares or with
respect to any security that includes, relates to, or derives any significant
part of its value from such shares.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement will not prohibit the
undersigned from (a) exercising options and/or warrants owned by the
undersigned as of the Closing Date that are exercisable for shares of Parent
Company Stock, it being understood, acknowledged and agreed that the shares of
Parent Common Stock acquired by the undersigned in connection therewith shall
be subject to this Agreement; (b) entering into a plan adopted pursuant to
Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, to the
extent that such plan does not allow for any transaction restricted by this
Agreement during the Lock-Up Period; or (c) making (i) bona fide gifts of the
Undersigneds Shares to family members or family trusts, (ii) any transfer by
will or intestacy in case of death or (iii) any transfer of the Undersigneds
Shares for estate planning purposes to persons immediately related to such
transferor by blood, marriage or adoption, or any trust solely for the benefit
of such transferor and/or the persons described in the preceding clause,
provided, however, that with respect to each of the transfers described in
clause (c) of this sentence, prior, and as a condition precedent, to such
transfer, the transferee, or the trustee or legal guardian on behalf of any
transferee, agrees in writing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. For
purposes hereof, "immediate family" shall mean any relationship by blood,
marriage or  adoption, not more remote than first cousin (including, without limitation,
lineal descendants, stepchildren, father, mother, brother, sister of the
undersigned or the undersigneds spouse). In addition to the foregoing, in
the event the undersigned is an entity rather than an individual, this
Agreement will not prevent any transfer of any or all of the Undersigneds
Shares to the stockholders of such entity, if it is a corporation, to the
members of such entity, if it is a limited liability company, or to the
partners of such entity, if it is a partnership; provided, however, that in
each such case, it shall be a condition to the transfer that such
transferee agrees in writing prior to such transfer to be bound by the terms
of this Agreement.

In addition, the undersigned agrees that the undersigned will not, during the
Lock-Up Period, make any demand for or exercise any right with respect to, the
registration of any of the Undersigneds Shares or any securities convertible
into, exercisable for, or exchangeable for the Undersigneds Shares.

The undersigned also agrees and consents to the entry of stop transfer
instructions with the Parents transfer agent and registrar relating to the
transfer of the Undersigneds Shares, except in compliance with the
restrictions described above. In furtherance of the foregoing, Parent and its
transfer agent are hereby authorized to decline to make any transfer of
securities if such transfer would constitute a violation or breach of this
Agreement. Except for that certain Voting Agreement between the undersigned
and the Company, dated as of the date hereof, the undersigned now has, and,
except as contemplated and permitted by the third paragraph of this Agreement,
for the duration of this Agreement will have, good and marketable title to the
Undersigneds Shares, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances and
claims whatsoever.

The undersigned understands that the Company will proceed to effect the
Closing of the Mergers in reliance upon this Agreement. This Agreement is
irrevocable, may not be amended or modified in any manner, and shall be
binding upon the undersigned and the heirs, personal representatives,
successors and assigns of the undersigned. Moreover, the
undersigned understands and agrees that the Company is relying upon the
accuracy, completeness, and truth of the undersigneds representations,
warranties, agreements, and certifications contained in this Agreement. The
undersigned further understands and agrees that the Closing of the Mergers is
intended to and will provide material economic benefit to the undersigned.

If for any reason the Merger Agreement shall be terminated prior to the
Closing of the Mergers, this Agreement shall terminate, cease to be of any
further force or effect, and the undersigned and the Undersigneds Shares
shall be released from any and all obligations hereunder.

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws
of the State of Delaware, regardless of the Laws that might otherwise govern
under applicable principles of conflicts of law thereof.

Stock other than (i) the Original Shares and (ii) any options, warrants or
other rights to acquire any additional shares of Parent Common Stock or any
security exercisable for or convertible into shares of Parent Common Stock,
set forth on the signature page of this Agreement (collectively, " _Options_
").

(c) Such Stockholder has full corporate power and authority and legal
capacity to enter into, execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform
fully such Stockholders obligations hereunder (including the proxy described

and delivered by such Stockholder and constitutes the legal, valid and binding
obligation of such Stockholder, enforceable against such Stockholder in
accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exceptions.

(d) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement by such Stockholder,
the consummation by such Stockholder of the transactions contemplated hereby
or compliance by such Stockholder with any of the provisions hereof will
conflict with or result in a breach, or constitute a default (with or without

loan or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease or other
agreement, instrument or Law applicable to such Stockholder or to such
Stockholders property or assets.

 

(e) No consent, approval or authorization of, or designation, declaration or

Shares, and to cause any holder of record of Shares to vote or execute a
written consent or consents if stockholders of Parent are requested to vote
their shares through the execution of an action by written consent in lieu of
any such annual or special meeting of stockholders of Parent: (i) in favor of
the issuance by Parent of the Parent Common Stock Consideration to be issued
in connection with the Closing of the Mergers and any other action required to
consummate the Mergers that may be submitted to a vote of the stockholders of
Parent, at every meeting (or in connection with any action by written
consent) of the stockholders of Parent at which such matters are considered
and at every adjournment or postponement thereof; (ii) against (1) any action,
proposal, transaction or agreement which could reasonably 

 



80  be expected to result in a breach of any covenant, representation or
warranty or any other obligation or agreement of Parent, Merger Sub or
Successor Sub under the Merger Agreement or of Stockholder under this
Agreement and (2) any action, proposal, transaction or agreement that could
reasonably be expected to impede or materially interfere with, delay,
discourage, adversely affect or inhibit the timely consummation of
the Mergers or the fulfillment of Parents, the Companys, Merger Subs or
Successor Subs conditions under the Merger Agreement or change in any manner
the voting rights of any class of shares of Parent (including by way of
any amendments to Parents Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws).

its sole discretion and without any other limitation on those matters other
than those set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) that are at any time or from time
to time presented for consideration to Parents stockholders generally. For
the avoidance of doubt, clauses (i) and (ii) shall not apply to votes, if any,
solely on the election or removal of directors as recommended by Parents
Board of Directors.

 

(b) Each Stockholder hereby appoints the Company and any designee of the
Company, and each of them individually, its proxies and attorneys-in-fact,
with full power of substitution and resubstitution, to vote or act by written
consent during the term of this Agreement with respect to the Shares, but only
to the extent provided in and with respect to the matters described in 
_Section 3(a)_. This proxy and power of attorney is given to secure the
performance of the duties of each Stockholder under this Agreement. Each
Stockholder shall take such further action or execute such other instruments
as may be reasonably necessary to effectuate the intent of this proxy. This
proxy and power of attorney granted by each Stockholder shall be irrevocable
during the term of this Agreement, shall be deemed to be coupled with an
interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable proxy, is intended to be
irrevocable during the term of this Agreement in accordance with the
provisions of Section 212 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, and shall
revoke any and all prior proxies granted by each Stockholder with respect to
the Shares (but only with respect to the matters set forth in _Section
3(a)_); provided that each Stockholder may grant subsequent proxies with
respect to any matter other than those specified in  _Section 3(a)_. The
power of attorney granted by each Stockholder herein is a durable power of
attorney and shall survive the dissolution, bankruptcy, death or incapacity of
Stockholder. The proxy and power of attorney granted hereunder shall
terminate automatically upon the termination of this Agreement.



   4. | _No Voting Trusts or Other Arrangement_. 
---|--- 

Each Stockholder agrees that such Stockholder will not, and will not permit
any entity under such Stockholders control to, deposit any of the Shares in a
voting trust, grant any proxies with respect to the Shares or subject any of
the Shares to any arrangement with respect to the voting of the Shares, in
each case, that would be inconsistent with _Section 3_ above, other than
agreements entered into with Parent.

 



   5. | _Transfer and Encumbrance_. 
---|--- 
 

Each Stockholder agrees that during the term of this Agreement, Stockholder
shall not Transfer any of the Shares or enter into any contract, option or
other agreement with respect to, or consent to, a Transfer of, any of the
Shares or such Stockholders economic interest therein. Any attempted Transfer
of Shares or any interest therein in violation of this  _Section 5_ shall be
null and void.

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement
will not prohibit any Stockholder from (a) exercising options and/or warrants
owned by such Stockholder that are exercisable for shares of Parent Company
Stock, it being understood, acknowledged and agreed that the shares of
Parent Common Stock acquired by such Stockholder in connection therewith
shall be subject to this Agreement as "Shares"; (b) entering into a plan
adopted pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, to the extent that such plan does not allow for any Transfer of
Shares during the term of this Agreement; or (c) making (i) bona fide gifts of
such Stockholders Shares to family members or family trusts, (ii) any
transfer by will or intestacy in case of death or (iii) any Transfer of such
Stockholders Shares for estate planning purposes to persons immediately
related to such transferor by blood, marriage or adoption, or any trust solely
for the benefit of such transferor and/or the persons described in the
preceding clause, provided, however,

 



81  that with respect to each of the Transfers described in clause (c) of this
sentence, prior, and as a condition precedent, to such transfer, the
transferee, or the trustee or legal guardian on behalf of any transferee,
agrees in writing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. For purposes
hereof, "immediate family" shall mean any relationship by blood, marriage or
adoption, not more remote than first cousin (including, without limitation,
lineal descendants, stepchildren, father, mother, brother, sister of the
applicable Stockholder or the applicable Stockholders spouse). In addition to
the foregoing, in the event a Stockholder is an entity rather than
an individual, this Agreement will not prevent any transfer of any or all of
such Stockholders Shares to the stockholders of such entity, if it is a
corporation, to the members of such entity, if it is a limited liability
company, or to the partners of such entity, if it is a partnership; provided,
however, that in each such case, it shall be a condition to the transfer that
such transferee agrees in writing prior to such transfer to be bound by the
terms of this Agreement.

 



   6. | _Additional Shares_. 
---|--- 

Each Stockholder agrees that all shares of Parent Common Stock that such
Stockholder purchases, acquires the right to vote or otherwise acquires

be subject to the terms of this Agreement and shall constitute Shares for all
purposes of this Agreement.



   7. | _Termination_. 
---|--- 

This Agreement shall terminate upon the earliest to occur of (a) the
Effective Time, (b) the date on which the Merger Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms, and (c) the mutual agreement of the Company and the
Stockholders to terminate this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i)
_Section 12_ shall survive the termination of this Agreement, and (ii) the
termination of this Agreement shall not relieve the Stockholders from any
liability for any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation, warranty, or
covenant contained in this Agreement.



   8. | _No Agreement as Director or Officer_. 
---|--- 

Each Stockholder makes no agreement or understanding in this Agreement in
Stockholders capacity as a director or officer of Parent or any of its
subsidiaries (if Stockholder holds such office), and nothing in this
Agreement: (a) will limit or affect any actions or omissions taken by
Stockholder in Stockholders capacity as such a director or officer, including
in exercising rights under the Merger Agreement, and no such actions
or omissions shall be deemed a breach of this Agreement or (b) will be
construed to prohibit, limit or restrict Stockholder from exercising
Stockholders fiduciary duties as an officer or director to Parent or its
stockholders.

 



   9. | _Specific Performance_. 
---|--- 
 

Each party hereto acknowledges that it may be difficult to measure in money
the damage to the other party if a party hereto fails to comply with any of
the obligations imposed by this Agreement and that, in the event of any such
failure, the other party may not have an adequate remedy at law or damages.
Accordingly, each party hereto agrees that each other party may
seek injunctive relief or other equitable remedies, in addition to remedies
at law or damages, for any such failure. Each party hereto agrees that it will
not seek, and agrees to waive any requirement for, the securing or posting of
a bond in connection with the other partys seeking or obtaining such
equitable relief.



   10. | _Entire Agreement_. 
---|---

parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and contains the
entire agreement between and among the parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof. This Agreement may not be amended or supplemented, and no
provisions hereof may be modified or waived, except by an instrument in
writing signed by each of the parties hereto. No waiver of any provisions
hereof by any party shall be deemed a waiver of any other provisions hereof
by such party, nor shall any such waiver be deemed a continuing waiver of any
provision hereof by such party.

 



82 ---|---

shall be in writing and shall be deemed given in accordance with the Merger

(b) waive any defense or objection to proceeding in such court, including
those objections and defenses based on an alleged lack of personal

that all directions issued by any such court, including all injunctions and
other decrees, will be binding and enforceable in all jurisdictions and
countries. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any

RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL ACTION ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO
REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,

unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of this
Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any
other jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the parties hereto shall negotiate in

"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation." Unless the context otherwise
requires, "or" is not exclusive. The definitions contained in this Agreement
are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and
to the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term.

"Company").

ARTICLE 2: The address of the registered office of the Company in the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is [ ].

ARTICLE 3: The Company is incorporated under the provisions of the
Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law of 1988, as amended (the "BCL").

 

ARTICLE 4: The Company is organized on a stock share basis, and the aggregate
number of shares of stock which the Company shall have authority to issue is
One Hundred (100), each share to be designated as a Common Share and to have a
par value of Ten Cents ($0.10).

ARTICLE 5: The following provisions of the BCL shall not apply to the
Company:

(a) Section 2538 (relating to approval of transactions with interested
shareholders);

(b) Subchapter 25E (relating to control transactions); and

 

(c) Subchapter 25G (relating to control share acquisitions).

ARTICLE 6: Any action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the
shareholders or of a class of shareholders may be taken without a meeting upon
the consent of shareholders who would have been entitled to cast the minimum
number of votes that would be necessary to authorize the action at a meeting
at which all shareholders entitled to vote thereon were present and voting,
subject to compliance with the BCL.

 

ARTICLE 7: The Board of Directors is expressly authorized from time to time to
adopt, amend and repeal the Bylaws of the Company or any provision
thereof and to adopt new Bylaws. The Bylaws may be amended and repealed, and
new Bylaws may be adopted, by the shareholders only if approved by the
affirmative vote of at least 80% of the outstanding shares entitled to vote at
any regular or special meeting duly convened after written notice to the
shareholders that the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is to
consider the amendment or repeal of the Bylaws.

ARTICLE 8: Special meetings of shareholders of the Company may be called only
by the Board of Directors pursuant to the terms of the Bylaws, or the Chairman
of the Board, and may not be called by any other person or persons.

ARTICLE 9: The number of directors of the Company shall be such as from time
to time shall be fixed by, or in the manner provided in the Bylaws, but shall
not be less than two. Election of directors need not be by ballot unless the

filled in the manner provided in the Bylaws.

ARTICLE 10:

 

(a) (1) A director of the Company shall stand in a fiduciary relation to the
Company and shall perform his or her duties as a director, including the
directors duties as a member of any committee of the Board of Directors upon
which the director may serve, in good faith, in a manner the director
reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the Company, and with such
care, including reasonable inquiry, skill and diligence, as a person of
ordinary prudence would use under similar circumstances. In performing his or
her duties, a director shall be entitled to rely in good faith on information,
opinions, reports or statements, including financial statements and other
financial data, in each case prepared or presented by any of the following:
(i) one or more officers or employees of the Company whom the director
reasonably believes to be reliable and competent in the matters presented;

the director reasonably believes to be within the professional or expert
competence of such persons; or (iii) a committee of the Board of  Directors upon which the director does not serve, duly designated in
accordance with law, as to matters within its designated authority, which
committee the director reasonably believes to merit confidence. A director
shall not be considered to be acting in good faith if the director has
knowledge concerning the matter in question that would cause the directors
reliance to be unwarranted.

 

(2) In discharging the duties of their respective positions, the Board of
Directors, committees of the Board of Directors and individual directors may,
in considering the best interests of the Company, consider the effects of any
action upon employees, suppliers and customers of the Company and communities
in which offices or other establishments of the Company are located, and
all other pertinent factors. The consideration of these factors shall not
constitute a violation of Article 10(a)(1) hereof.

actions taken as a director or any failure to take any action shall be
presumed to be in the best interests of the Company.

monetary damages for any action taken, or any failure to take any action,
unless: (i) the director has breached or failed to perform the duties of his
or her office under Article 10(a)(1) through Article 10(a)(3) hereof; and (ii)
the breach or failure to perform constitutes self-dealing, willful misconduct
or recklessness.

(5) The provisions of Article 10(a)(4) hereof shall not apply to: (i) the
responsibility or liability of a director pursuant to any criminal statute;
or (ii) the liability of a director for the payment of taxes pursuant to
local, state or federal law.

(b) Neither any amendment nor repeal of this Article 10, nor the adoption of
any provision of these Articles of Incorporation inconsistent with this
Article 10, shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this Article 10 in
respect of any matter occurring, or any action or proceeding accruing or
arising or that, but for this Article 10, would accrue or arise, prior to such

indemnified by the Company to the fullest extent allowed by the BCL against
all liabilities and expenses imposed upon or incurred by that person in
connection with any proceeding in which that person may be made, or
threatened to be made, a party, or in which that person may become involved by
reason of that person being or having been a director or officer of or serving
or having served in any capacity with any other enterprise at the request of
the Company, whether or not that person is a director or officer or continues
to serve the other enterprise at the time the liabilities or expenses are
imposed or incurred.

 

(b) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Company is
authorized to provide indemnification of (and advancement of expenses to)
agents of the Company (and any other persons to which Pennsylvania law permits
the Company to provide indemnification) through By-law provisions, agreements
with such agents or other persons, votes of shareholders or
disinterested directors or otherwise, in excess of the indemnification and
advancement otherwise permitted by the BCL subject only to limits created by
applicable Pennsylvania law (statutory or non-statutory), with respect to
actions for breach of duty to the Company, its shareholders and others.

(c) Neither any amendment nor repeal of this Article 11, nor the adoption of
any provision of these Articles of Incorporation inconsistent with this
Article 11, shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this Article 11 in respect
of any matter occurring, or any action or proceeding accruing or arising or
that, but for this Article 11, would accrue or arise, prior to such
amendment, repeal or adoption of an inconsistent provision.

without the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as the board of directors may from
time to time determine or the business of the corporation may require.

ARTICLE II

 

MEETINGS OF SHAREHOLDERS

Section 1\. All meetings of the shareholders shall be held at such place
within or without the Commonwealth, as may be from time to time fixed or
determined by the board of directors. One or more shareholders may
participate in a meeting of the shareholders by means of conference telephone
or other electronic means, including, without limitation, the Internet.

Section 2\. An annual meeting of the shareholders, commencing with the year
2013, shall be held on April 1, if not a legal holiday and, if a legal
holiday, then on the next secular day following at such location as may be
specified by the board of directors, when they shall elect by a plurality vote
a board of directors, and transact such other business as may properly be
brought before the meeting.

 

Section 3\. Special meetings of the shareholders, for any purpose or purposes,
unless otherwise prescribed by statute or by the articles of incorporation,
may be called at any time by the president, or a majority of the board of
directors, or by shareholders entitled to cast at least twenty percent of the
votes that all shareholders are entitled to cast at the particular meeting,
upon written request delivered to the secretary of the corporation. Such
request shall state the general nature of the business to be transacted at the
proposed meeting. Upon receipt of any such request, it shall be the duty of
the secretary to fix the time of the meeting which, if the meeting is called
pursuant to a statutory right, shall be held not more than sixty days after
the receipt of the request. If the secretary shall neglect to fix the time of
the meeting, the person or persons calling the meeting may do so.

Section 4\. Written notice of every meeting of the shareholders shall
be given by or at the direction of the secretary or other authorized person
to each shareholder entitled to vote thereat at least five days prior to the
meeting, unless a greater period of notice is required by law. If the

shareholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or by proxy, shall
have power, except as otherwise provided by statute, to adjourn the meeting to
such time and place as they may determine, but in the case of any meeting
called for the election of directors, such meeting may be adjourned only from
day to day or for such longer periods not exceeding fifteen days each as the
holders of a majority of the shares present in person or by proxy shall
direct. Those shareholders entitled to vote who attend a meeting called for

quorum for the purpose of acting upon the matter. At any adjourned meeting at
which a quorum shall be present or represented any business may be transacted

not manifestly unreasonable and as otherwise provided by law. A shareholder
may vote in person or by proxy authorized in accordance with law.

Section 9\. Any action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the
shareholders or of a class of the shareholders may be taken without a meeting

of the shareholders who would have been entitled to vote at a meeting for
such purpose shall be filed with the secretary of the corporation.

Any action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the shareholders
or of a class of the shareholders may be taken without a meeting upon the
consent of shareholders who would have been entitled to cast the minimum
number of votes that would be necessary to authorize the action at a meeting
at which all shareholders entitled to vote thereon were present and voting.
The consents shall be filed with the secretary of the corporation. Such action
shall not become effective until after at least ten days notice of such
action shall have been given to each shareholder of record entitled to vote
thereon who has not consented thereto.

Section 3\. The business of the corporation shall be managed by its board of

be held at such time and place as shall be fixed by the shareholders at the
meeting at which such directors were elected and no notice of such meeting
shall be necessary to the newly elected directors in order legally to

as may be otherwise specifically provided by statute or by the articles of
incorporation. If a quorum shall not be present at any meeting of directors,
the directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time,
without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be

extent provided in such resolution or in these bylaws, shall have and
exercise all of the powers and authority of the board of directors in the
management of the business and affairs of the corporation except as otherwise
restricted by law. In the absence or disqualification of any member of
such committee or committees, the member or members thereof present at any
meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not he, she or they

NOTICES

 

Section 1\. Notices to directors and shareholders shall be given to the person

mail, postage prepaid, or courier service, charges prepaid, to his or her
postal address appearing on the books of the corporation or, in the case of

of notice. Notice in the manner set forth above shall be deemed to have been
given to the person entitled thereto when deposited in the United States mail
or with a courier service for delivery to that person. However, if this
corporation is not a closely held corporation and notice of any regular or
special meeting of the shareholders (or any other notice required to be given

by mail at least twenty days prior to the day named for the meeting or any
corporate or shareholder action specified in the notice, such notice may be
sent by any class of postpaid mail.

Notice may also be given by facsimile transmission, e-mail or other electronic
communication to the persons facsimile number or address for e-mail or other
electronic communications supplied by him or her to the corporation for the
purpose of notice. Such facsimile or electronic notice shall be deemed given
to the person entitled thereto when sent. A notice of meeting shall specify the day and hour and geographic location, if

SHARES

 

Section 1\. The shares of the corporation shall be represented by a
certificate or shall be uncertificated if so provided for in these bylaws.

the secretary or an assistant secretary or the treasurer or an assistant
treasurer and shall be sealed with the corporate seal which may be
facsimile, engraved or printed. Each certificate shall state: (1) that the
corporation is incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania; (2) the name of the person to whom issued; and (3) the number
and class of shares and the designation of the series, if any, that the
certificate represents.

Section 2\. Where a certificate is signed by a transfer agent or an assistant
transfer agent or a registrar, the signature of any president, vice-president,
treasurer, assistant treasurer, secretary or assistant secretary may be
facsimile. In case any officer or officers who have signed, or whose
facsimile signature or signatures have been used on, any such certificate or
certificates shall cease to be such officer or officers of the corporation,
whether because of death, resignation or otherwise, before such certificate
or certificates have been delivered by the corporation, such certificate or
certificates may nevertheless be adopted by the corporation and be issued and  delivered as though the person or persons who signed such certificate or
certificates or whose facsimile signature or signatures have been used thereon
had not ceased to be such officer or officers of the corporation.

Section 3\. Upon surrender to the corporation or the transfer agent of the
corporation of a certificate for shares duly endorsed or accompanied by
proper evidence of succession, assignment or authority to transfer, it shall
be the duty of the corporation to issue a new certificate to the person
entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate and record the transaction upon
its books.

Section 4\. The board of directors may fix a time prior to the date of
any meeting of shareholders as a record date for the determination of the
shareholders entitled to notice of, or to vote at, the meeting, which time,
except in the case of an adjourned meeting, shall be not more than ninety days
prior to the date of the meeting of shareholders. Only shareholders of record
on the date fixed shall be so entitled notwithstanding any transfer of shares
on the books of the corporation after any record date fixed as provided
herein. The board of directors may similarly fix a record date for the
determination of shareholders of record for any other purpose. When a
determination of shareholders of record has been made as provided in this
section for purposes of a meeting, the determination shall apply to
any adjournment thereof unless the board fixes a new record date for the
adjourned meeting.

ARTICLE VII

 

LIABILITY OF DIRECTORS

Section 1\. A director of the corporation shall stand in a fiduciary relation
to the corporation and shall perform his or her duties as a director,
including the directors duties as a member of any committee of the board of
directors upon which the director may serve, in good faith, in a manner the
director reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation,
and with such care, including reasonable inquiry, skill and diligence, as a
person of ordinary prudence would use under similar circumstances. In
performing his or her duties, a director shall be entitled to rely in good
faith on information, opinions, reports or statements, including financial
statements and other financial data, in each case prepared or presented by
any of the following: (a) one or more officers or employees of the corporation
whom the director reasonably believes to be reliable and competent in the
matters presented; (b) legal counsel, public accountants or other persons as
to matters which the director reasonably believes to be within the
professional or expert competence of such persons; or (c) a committee of the
board of directors upon which the director does not serve, duly designated in
accordance with law, as to matters within its designated authority, which
committee the director reasonably believes to merit confidence. A director
shall not be considered to be acting in good faith if the director has
knowledge concerning the matter in question that would cause the directors
reliance to be unwarranted.

 

Section 2\. In discharging the duties of their respective positions, the board
of directors, committees of the board of directors and individual directors
may, in considering the best interests of the corporation, consider the
effects of any action upon employees, suppliers and customers of the
corporation and communities in which offices or other establishments of the
corporation are located, and all other pertinent factors. The consideration
of these factors shall not constitute a violation of Section 1 above.

Section 3\. Absent breach of fiduciary duty, lack of good faith or self-
dealing, actions taken as a director or any failure to take any action shall
be presumed to be in the best interests of the corporation.

Section 4\. A director of the corporation shall not be personally liable, as
such, for monetary damages for any action taken, or any failure to take any
action, unless: (a) the director has breached or failed to perform the duties
of his or her office under Sections 1 through 3 above; and (b) the breach or
failure to perform constitutes self-dealing, willful misconduct or
recklessness.

Section 5\. The provisions of Section 4 above shall not apply to: (a) the
responsibility or liability of a director pursuant to any criminal statute; or
(b) the liability of a director for the payment of taxes pursuant to local,
state or federal law. ARTICLE VIII

INDEMNIFICATION OF OFFICERS, DIRECTORS EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS

Section 1\. The corporation shall indemnify any director or officer, and may
indemnify any other employee or agent, who was or is a party to, or is
threatened to be made a party to, or who is called as a witness in connection
with, any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit or proceeding,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, including an action
by or in the right of the corporation, by reason of the fact that such person
is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or
was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee
or agent of another domestic or foreign corporation, for profit or not-for-
profit, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise,
against expenses, including attorneys fees, judgments, fines and amounts
paid in settlement, actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in
connection with such action, suit or proceeding unless the act or failure to
act giving rise to the claim for indemnification is determined by a court to
have constituted willful misconduct or recklessness.

Section 2\. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or
granted pursuant to, this ARTICLE VIII shall not be deemed exclusive of any
other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses
may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement, contract, vote of shareholders or
directors or otherwise, both as to action in his or her official capacity and
as to action in another capacity while holding such office. It is the policy
of the corporation that indemnification of, and advancement of expenses to,
directors and officers of the corporation shall be made to the fullest extent
permitted by law. To this end, the provisions of this ARTICLE VIII shall be
deemed to have been amended for the benefit of directors and officers of the
corporation effective immediately upon any modification of the Pennsylvania
Business Corporation Law of 1988, as amended (the " _BCL_ ") or any
modification, or adoption of any other law that expands or enlarges the power
or obligation of corporations organized under the BCL to indemnify, or advance
expenses to, directors and officers of corporations.

Section 3\. The corporation shall pay expenses incurred by an officer or
director, and may pay expenses incurred by any other employee or agent, in
defending an action, or proceeding referred to in this ARTICLE VIII in
advance of the final disposition of such action or proceeding upon receipt of
an undertaking by or on behalf of such person to repay such amount if it shall
ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified
by the corporation.

Section 4\. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or
granted pursuant to, this ARTICLE VIII shall, unless otherwise provided when
authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a
director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the
heirs, executors and administrators of such person.

Section 5\. The corporation shall have the authority to create a fund of any
nature, which may, but need not, be under the control of a trustee, or
otherwise secure or insure in any manner, its indemnification obligations,
whether arising under these bylaws or otherwise. This authority shall include,
without limitation, the authority to: (a) deposit funds in trust or in
escrow; (b) establish any form of self-insurance; (c) secure its indemnity
obligation by grant of a security interest, mortgage or other lien on the
assets of the corporation; or (d) establish a letter of credit, guaranty or
surety arrangement for the benefit of such persons in connection with the
anticipated indemnification or advancement of expenses contemplated by this
ARTICLE VIII. The provisions of this ARTICLE VIII shall not be deemed to
preclude the indemnification of, or advancement of expenses to, any person who
is not specified in Section 1 of this ARTICLE VIII but whom the corporation
has the power or obligation to indemnify, or to advance expenses for, under
the provisions of the BCL or otherwise. The authority granted by this Section
5 shall be exercised by the board of directors of the corporation.

Section 6\. The corporation shall have the authority to enter into a separate
indemnification agreement with any officer, director, employee or agent of the
corporation or any subsidiary providing for such indemnification of such
person as the board of directors shall determine up to the fullest extent
permitted by law.

 

Section 7\. As soon as practicable after receipt by any person specified in
Section 1 of this ARTICLE VIII of notice of the commencement of any action,
suit or proceeding specified in Section 1 of this ARTICLE VIII, such  person shall, if a claim with respect thereto may be made against the
corporation under this ARTICLE VIII, notify the corporation in writing of the
commencement or threat thereof; however, the omission so to notify the
corporation shall not relieve the corporation from any liability under this
ARTICLE VIII unless the corporation shall have been prejudiced thereby or from
any other liability which it may have to such person other than under this
ARTICLE VIII. With respect to any such action as to which such person notifies
the corporation of the commencement or threat thereof, the corporation may
participate therein at its own expense and, except as otherwise provided
herein, to the extent that it desires, the corporation, jointly with any
other indemnifying party similarly notified, shall be entitled to assume the
defense thereof, with counsel selected by the corporation to the reasonable
satisfaction of such person. After notice from the corporation to such person
of its election to assume the defense thereof, the corporation shall not be
liable to such person under this ARTICLE VIII for any legal or other expenses
subsequently incurred by such person in connection with the defense thereof
other than as otherwise provided herein. Such person shall have the right to
employ his or her own counsel in such action, but the fees and expenses of
such counsel incurred after notice from the corporation of its assumption of
the defense thereof shall be at the expense of such person unless: (a) the
employment of counsel by such person shall have been authorized by the
corporation; (b) such person shall have reasonably concluded that there may
be a conflict of interest between the corporation and such person in the
conduct of the defense of such proceeding; or (c) the corporation shall not in
fact have employed counsel to assume the defense of such action.

 

Section 8\. The corporation shall have the power to purchase and maintain
insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee
or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the
corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another domestic or
foreign corporation for profit or not-for-profit, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against
such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out
of his or her status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the
power to indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of
this ARTICLE VIII.

ARTICLE IX
