comment on the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents (including any amendments

lesser of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that, when added to
the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or Merger Sub at
the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option, constitutes one share more than
ninety percent (90%) of the sum of (x) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock outstanding immediately after the issuance of all shares of Company
Common Stock subject to the Top-Up Option plus (y) all shares of Company
Common Stock which the Company may be required to issue on or prior to the

options, convertible or exchangeable securities or other rights to acquire
Company Common Stock, regardless of the conversion or exercise price or other
terms and conditions thereof, or (ii) the aggregate number of shares of
Company Common Stock that the Company is authorized to issue under the Company
Articles of Incorporation but that are not issued and outstanding (and are not
subscribed for or committed to be issued) at the time of exercise of the Top-
Up Option.

(b) The Top-Up Option may be exercised by Parent or Merger Sub, in whole or
in part, only once, within thirty (30) Business Days following the Acceptance
Time and prior to the earlier to occur of (x) the Effective Time and (y) the

Stock pursuant thereto, the Short-Form Threshold shall be reached. The
aggregate purchase price payable for the shares of Company Common Stock being
purchased by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to the Top-Up Option shall be
determined by multiplying the number of such shares by the Offer Price.

wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account or accounts of
the Company as the Company may designate in writing, provided that such
account or accounts shall be at a bank or other financial institution
acceptable to Parent.

the closing of the purchase of such shares of Company Common Stock by Parent
or Merger Sub is to take place ( _provided_ that the time of such closing
shall be within two (2) Business Days of the delivery of such notice). At the
closing of the purchase of such shares of Company Common Stock, Parent or
Merger Sub shall cause to be delivered to the Company the consideration
required to be delivered in exchange for such shares, and the Company shall

Common Stock accept the Offer, tender their shares of Company Common Stock to
Merger Sub pursuant to the Offer and, if required by the MGBCL, approve this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and

that such recommendation was made subject to the understanding that it may be

The Company hereby consents to the inclusion of the foregoing determinations,
approvals and recommendations in the Offer Documents.

Entity and disseminated to the Company Shareholders, in each case as and to
the extent required by applicable securities Laws. The Company shall provide
Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the Schedule 14D-9 (including any amendments thereto) required to

Act, in any case prior to the filing thereof with the SEC, and the Company
shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by
Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel. The Company shall provide to Parent,

extent reasonable and appropriate.

(c) _Company Information_. In connection with the Offer, the Company shall,
or shall cause its transfer agent to, promptly following a request by Parent,
furnish Parent at Parents cost and expense with such information as Parent or
its Representatives may reasonably 

 



18  request in order to disseminate and otherwise communicate the Offer to the

the most recent practicable date, of the Company Shareholders, mailing labels
and any available listing or computer files containing the names and addresses
of all record and beneficial holders of Company Common Stock, and lists of
security positions of Company Common Stock held in stock depositories
(including updated lists of shareholders, mailing labels, listings or files of
securities positions). Subject to any and all applicable Laws, and except for
such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any
other documents necessary to consummate the Offer and the Merger, Parent and
Merger Sub shall (and shall cause their respective officers, directors,
agents, representatives, employees, attorneys, accountants and other advisors
to):

 

(i) hold in confidence the information contained in any such lists of
shareholders, mailing labels and listings or files of securities positions on
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the NDA;

_Section 9.2_ hereof, upon the Companys request, deliver (and shall use
their respective reasonable efforts to cause their Representatives to deliver)
to the Company any and all copies and any extracts or summaries from such
information then in their possession or control.

Section 2.4 _Company Board of Directors and Committees_.

(a) _Composition of Company Board and Board Committees_. Effective upon the
initial acceptance for payment by Merger Sub of shares of Company Common
Stock pursuant to the Offer (the " _Acceptance Time_ ," the use of which term
herein shall not, unless the context otherwise requires, depend upon whether
Parent shall exercise its rights under this _Section 2.4(a)_) and from time
to time thereafter, subject to Parent depositing the payment for such shares
with the depositary agent for the Offer and subject to _Section 2.4(b)_,
Parent shall be entitled to designate up to such number of directors on the
Company Board equal to the product (rounded up to the next whole number)
obtained by multiplying (x) the number of directors on the Company Board
(giving effect to any increase in the number of directors pursuant to this
_Section 2.4_) and (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
shares of Company Common Stock held by Parent and Merger Sub (giving effect to
the shares of Company Common Stock purchased pursuant to the Offer and, if
the Top-Up Option is exercised, the shares of Company Common Stock purchased
upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option), and the denominator of which is the
total number of then outstanding shares of Company Common Stock.
Promptly following a request by Parent, the Company shall cause the
individuals so designated by Parent to be elected or appointed to the Company
Board, including (at the election of Parent) either by increasing the size of
the Company Board or by seeking and accepting or otherwise securing the
resignations of such number of then incumbent directors as is necessary to
enable the individuals so designated by Parent to be elected or appointed to
the Company Board (the date on which the majority of the Companys directors
are designees of Parent that have been effectively elected or appointed to the
Company Board in accordance herewith, the " _Board_

 



19   _Appointment Date_ "). From time to time after the Acceptance Time, subject
to Parent depositing the payment for such shares with the depositary agent for
the Offer and subject to  _Section 2.4(b)_, the Company shall take all
action necessary to cause the individuals so designated by Parent to
constitute substantially the same percentage (rounding up where appropriate)
as is on the Company Board on each committee of the Company Board to the
fullest extent permitted by all applicable Laws, including the rules of the
NYSE. Solely for the purposes of this _Section 2.4_, any and all members of
the Company Board immediately prior to such appointments by Parent who remain
on the Company Board after such appointments by Parent shall be referred to as
" _Continuing Directors_ ".

(b) _Independent Directors_. In the event that Parents designees are elected
or appointed to the Company Board pursuant to _Section 2.4(a)_, until the
Effective Time, the Company Board shall have at least three (3) directors who
are considered independent directors within the meaning of rules of the NYSE
(" _Independent Directors_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that after the
Acceptance Time, the Company shall, upon Parents request, take all action
necessary to elect to be treated as a "controlled company" for purpose of
Section 303A of the NYSE rules and make all necessary filings and disclosures
associated with such status (which for the avoidance of doubt shall not
eliminate the obligations under this _Section 2.4(b)_ to have Independent
Directors); _provided_ , _further_ , that in the event the number of
Independent Directors shall be less than three (3) at any time after the
Acceptance Time but prior to the Effective Time, the remaining Independent
Director(s) shall be entitled to designate persons to fill such vacancies who
shall be deemed to be Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement
or, if no other Independent Director then remains, the other directors shall
designate directors to fill such vacancies who shall not be shareholders or
Affiliates of Parent or Merger Sub, and such Persons shall be deemed to be
Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement.

(c) _Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act_. The Companys obligation to appoint
Parents designees to the Company Board pursuant to _Section 2.4(a)_ hereof
shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all action required
pursuant to this _Section 2.4_ and Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule
14f-1 promulgated thereunder in order to fulfill its obligations under this
_Section 2.4_, and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with
respect to the Company and its directors and officers as is required under
such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its obligations under
this _Section 2.4_. Parent shall provide to the Company in writing, and be
responsible for any information with respect to itself and its nominees,
directors, officers and Affiliates, required by such Section 14(f) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The provisions of this
_Section 2.4_ are in addition to, and shall not limit, any right that Merger
Sub, Parent or any affiliate of Merger Sub or Parent may have (with respect to
the election of directors or otherwise) under applicable Laws as a holder or
beneficial owner of shares of Company Common Stock.

(d) _Required Approvals of Continuing Directors_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth in this Agreement, in the event that Parents designees
are elected or appointed to the Company Board prior to the Effective Time
pursuant to _Section 2.4(a)_ hereof and there shall be any Continuing
Directors, the approval of a majority of such Continuing Directors (or the
sole Continuing Director if there shall be only one (1) Continuing Director)
shall be required in order to, prior to the Effective Time, (i) amend or
terminate this Agreement,

 



20  or agree or consent to any amendment or termination of this Agreement, in
any case on behalf of the Company, (ii) extend the time for performance of, or
waive, any of the obligations or other acts of Parent or Merger Sub under
this Agreement, (iii) waive any of the Companys rights under this Agreement,
(iv) amend or otherwise modify, in a manner adverse to the Company
Shareholders in any material respect, the Company Articles of Incorporation
or Company By-laws or (v) make any other determination with respect to any
action to be taken or not to be taken by or on behalf of the Company relating
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Offer and the Merger.

_however_ , that at the Effective Time the articles of incorporation of the

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

Section 4.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or their respective shareholders, the following shall occur:

(a) _Conversion Generally_. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) any
shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled pursuant to _Section 4.1(b)_
and (ii) Dissenting Shares) shall be converted, subject to _Section 4.1(d)_,
into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Offer

 



22  Price, payable to the holder thereof, without interest (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common
Stock shall cease to be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and each Certificate or book-entry which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration
therefor.

(b) _Cancellation of Certain Shares_. Each share of Company Common Stock held
by Parent, Merger Sub, any other Subsidiary of Parent, any Company Subsidiary
or in the treasury of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof and no
payment shall be made with respect thereto.

(c) _Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and be exchanged for one newly and validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

(d) _Change in Shares_. Without duplication to the effects of _Section
2.1(c)_ hereof, the Merger Consideration shall be adjusted appropriately to
reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend
(including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company
Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with
respect to Company Common Stock occurring or with a record date on or after
the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

 

Section 4.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. At the Closing, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, with a bank or trust company designated by Parent and reasonably
satisfactory to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit of the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with
this _Article IV_ , through the Paying Agent, cash in U.S. dollars in an
amount sufficient to pay the aggregate amount of the Merger Consideration
payable in connection with the Merger (such cash being hereinafter referred to
as the " _Exchange Fund_ ") payable pursuant to _Section 4.1_ in exchange for
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock. The Paying Agent shall, and
Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to, deliver the Merger Consideration
contemplated to be paid pursuant to _Section 4.1_ out of the Exchange Fund.
The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by
Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that: (i) no such investment or losses
thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to the holders of
Company Common Stock; and (ii) such investments shall be in obligations of or
guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency or instrumentality
thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of
America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by
Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion
(based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then
publicly available). Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income
produced by, such investments shall be payable to the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable pursuant to _Section
4.1_ shall be promptly returned to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, in
each case as directed by Parent. In the event that the Exchange Fund shall be
insufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration

 



23  payable in connection with the Merger when any payment thereof is required,
Parent shall promptly deposit or cause to be deposited additional funds in the
amount of such insufficiency. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any
other purpose.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time (but in no
event later than three (3) Business Days following the Effective Time), Parent
shall instruct the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the "
_Certificates_ ") and whose shares of Company Common Stock have been converted
into the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 4.1_ (i)
a letter of transmittal in customary form and with such other provisions as
Parent and the Company may reasonably agree (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Paying Agent together with such letter of transmittal,
properly completed and duly executed, and such other customary documents as
may be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, and
the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
Promptly following the Effective Time (but in no event later than five (5)
Business Days following the Effective Time), to the extent consistent with the
Paying Agents standard procedures, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to
issue and deliver the Merger Consideration to holders of uncertificated
shares of Company Common Stock represented by book-entry (the " _Book-Entry
Shares_ ") (either directly or through the Depository Trust Company), without
each holder of Book-Entry Shares being required to deliver a Certificate or
any executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent, and such Book-Entry
Shares shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on
any Merger Consideration payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common
Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the
Merger Consideration may be issued to a transferee if the
Certificate representing such shares of Company Common Stock is presented to
the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect
such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have
been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 4.2_, each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration or the
right to demand to be paid the "fair value" of the shares represented thereby
as contemplated by _Section 4.3_.

(c) _Further Rights in Company Common Stock_. All Merger Consideration paid
in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common
Stock.

 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for six (6)
months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving
Corporation upon demand, and any holders of Company Common Stock who have not
theretofore complied with this _Article IV_ shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Corporation for the Merger Consideration, without any interest
thereon.

 



24 (e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation
shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any cash
from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

(f) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable and customary
amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate,
the Paying Agent will, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to, issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration without any interest thereon.

(g) _No Further Dividends_. No dividends or other distributions with respect
to capital stock of the Surviving Corporation with a record date on or after
the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificates.

 

(h) _Withholding_. Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold or cause to be deducted
and withheld from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent are required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or
any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law, with respect to the making
of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld, such
deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction
and withholding was made.

Section 4.3 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, any shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and are held by a
shareholder (each, a " _Dissenting Shareholder_ ") who is entitled to
exercise, and properly exercises, dissenters rights with respect to such
shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of
Sections 351.447 and/or 351.455, as applicable, of the MGBCL (collectively,
the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or exchangeable for
or represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration (except as provided
in this _Section 4.3_). Any such Dissenting Shareholder shall be entitled to
receive payment of the fair value of such shares of Company Common Stock held
by such Dissenting Shareholder in accordance with Section 351.447 and/or
351.455, as applicable, of the MGBCL, unless and until such
Dissenting Shareholder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses such
shareholders right to appraisal. If any Dissenting Shareholder shall have
effectively withdrawn (in accordance with the MGBCL) or lost the right to
dissent, then as of the later of the Effective Time or the occurrence of such
event, the Dissenting Shares held by such Dissenting Shareholder shall be
cancelled and converted into and represent the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 4.1_. The Company shall not, except with
the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make (or cause or permit to
be made on its behalf) any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, or otherwise negotiate with, any Dissenting

  



25  Shareholder regarding its exercise of dissenters rights prior to the
Effective Time. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any such
demands prior to the Effective Time and Parent shall have the right to
participate in and control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
any exercise by any Company Shareholder of dissenters rights. For the
avoidance of doubt, it is acknowledged and agreed that, for all
purposes under Section 351.447 and/or 351.455, as applicable, of the MGBCL
and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the fair value of the
Dissenting Shares shall be determined without regard to the Top-Up Option or
the shares of Company Common Stock issued pursuant to the Top-Up Option.

Section 4.4 _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed (after giving effect to the items
contemplated by this _Article IV_ ) and thereafter there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock theretofore
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time on the records of the
Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates shall
cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock
except as otherwise provided herein or by Law.

Section 4.5 _Company Options and Company Stock Units_.

 

(a) _Rollover of Company Options __._ Except to the extent otherwise elected
by the holder pursuant to  _Section 4.5(b)_, at the Effective Time, without
any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of
the Company Options, each Company Option that is outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall
(i) fully vest and become exercisable and (ii) be converted into an option to
acquire a number of Parent American Depositary Shares equal to the product
(rounded down to the nearest number of whole shares) of (A) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company Option immediately prior
to the Effective Time and (B) the Option Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price
per share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to (x) the exercise
price per share of such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time, divided by (y) the Option Exchange Ratio; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the exercise price and the number of Parent American Depositary Shares
purchasable pursuant to the Company Options (as converted) shall be subject to
such adjustments as reasonably agreed to by Parent and the Company are
necessary for the foregoing conversion to satisfy the requirements of
Sections 409A, 422 and 424 of the Code and Treasury Regulation Section
1.424-1. Except as specifically provided above, following the Effective Time,
each Company Option shall continue to be governed by the same terms and
conditions as set forth in the applicable Company Stock Plan and any
agreements thereunder as were applicable immediately prior to the Effective
Time. In addition to the foregoing, Parent shall assume the Company Stock
Plans, and the number and kind of shares available for issuance under the
Company Stock Plans shall be converted into American Depositary Shares of
Parent in accordance with the provisions of each applicable Company Stock
Plan. Promptly following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall
deliver written notice to each holder of a Company Option informing such
holder of the effect of the Merger on the Company Options.

 

(b) _Elective Cashout of Company Options_. The Company shall permit each
holder of Company Options to elect in writing, no later than five (5)
Business Days prior to the Effective Time, to receive, with respect to all or
a portion of such Company Options (whether

 



26  vested or unvested), a payment in cash in U.S. Dollars at the Effective Time
equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to the Company Options with respect to which such election is made
and (ii) the excess of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per
share of Company Common Stock under such Company Option. Any election pursuant
to this _Section 4.5(b)_ shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent
and shall release all rights the holder may have with respect to the Company
Options for which an election is made, other than to receive the payment
specified in this _Section 4.5(b)_, and the Company shall deliver such
election form to the holders of Company Options no later than the third (3rd)
Business Day after the commencement of the Offer. Any Company Options for
which the election described in this _Section 4.5(b)_ is not timely received

restrictions thereon shall lapse and shall be converted automatically into the
right to receive at the Effective Time an amount in cash in U.S. dollars equal
to the product of (i) the total number of such Company Stock Units and (ii)
the Merger Consideration; _provided_ , _however_ , that Company Stock Units
that have been deferred in accordance with the terms of a Company Plan shall

the number of Company Stock Units that have been so deferred and (y) the

amounts. All amounts payable under this _Section 4.5_ shall be reduced by
amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any
provision of U.S. state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making
of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or deducted, such
withheld or deducted amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such
withholding or deduction was made.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

With respect to any Section of this _Article V_ , except (i) as expressly
disclosed in the reports and statements (excluding any exhibits thereto) and
other documents filed or furnished by the Company with the SEC pursuant to
the Exchange Act (other than any disclosures contained or referenced therein
under the captions "Risk Factors", "Market Risk" or "Forward-Looking
Statements"), in each case on or after January 2, 2010 and prior to the date
of

 



27  this Agreement (the " _Recent SEC Reports_ ") (it being understood, however,
that any matter disclosed in any Recent SEC Report shall not be deemed to be
disclosed in  _Section 5.2_ (Capitalization) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule unless it is also expressly set forth in _Section 5.2_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule) or (ii) as set forth in the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as
follows:

Section 5.1 _Organization and Qualification_. The Company is a corporation
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
State of Missouri. Each Subsidiary of the Company (each, a " _Company
Subsidiary_ ") is duly organized, and is validly existing and, where such
concept is recognized, in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of
its incorporation or organization, as the case may be, except to the extent
the failure of any such Company Subsidiary to be in good standing would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect
or prevent, materially impair or materially delay the ability of the Company
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. _Section 5.1_
of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a correct and complete list of
all of the Company Subsidiaries, the ownership interest of the Company in each
Company Subsidiary, and the ownership interest of any other Person or Persons
in each Company Subsidiary, in each case as of the date hereof. Each of the
Company and each Company Subsidiary has the requisite corporate or similar
power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to
carry on its business as presently conducted, except where the failure to
have such power or authority, individually or in the aggregate, would not have
a Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially impair or materially
delay the ability of the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. The Company and each Company Subsidiary is duly qualified
or licensed to do business in each jurisdiction where the character of the
properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its business
makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for such failures to
be so qualified or licensed that, individually or in the aggregate, would not
have a Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially impair or
materially delay the ability of the Company to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Company has delivered to Parent complete
and correct copies of the articles of incorporation and by-laws (or similar
organizational documents) of the Company and each Company Subsidiary, each as
amended to date, and each as so delivered is in full force and effect. As of
any date following the date hereof, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary and notwithstanding anything set forth in the Company
Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its "significant
subsidiaries" (as defined in Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation S-X under the Exchange
Act) has filed for bankruptcy or filed for reorganization under the U.S.
federal bankruptcy laws or similar state or federal law, become insolvent or
become subject to conservatorship or receivership.

free from preemptive rights. All shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon
exercise or settlement of Company Options or Company Stock Units have been
duly reserved for issuance by the Company, and upon any issuance of
such shares in accordance with the terms of the applicable Company Stock

Stock Units outstanding on Measurement Date in accordance with the terms of
such Company Options or Company Stock Units as of such date. There are no
outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of the Company

(c) Each outstanding share of capital stock or other Equity Interest of each
Company Subsidiary is (to the extent such concept is applicable) duly

rights and is held, directly or indirectly, by the Company or another Company
Subsidiary free and clear of all Liens. Except as set forth in _Section
5.2(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule and the Top-Up Option, there are no

Company Subsidiary free and clear of all Liens. Except for the capital

securities or interests in any Person that is material to the business of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(e) Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has entered into
any commitment, arrangement or agreement, or are otherwise obligated, to
contribute capital, loan money or otherwise provide funds or make additional
investments in any other Person, other than any such commitment, arrangement
or agreement in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
with respect to wholly-owned Subsidiaries of the Company. There are no
shareholder agreements, voting trusts, proxies or other agreements or
understandings to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or
by which it is bound relating to the voting or registration of any shares of
capital stock of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or preemptive rights
with respect thereto.

Section 5.3 _Corporate Authority; Approval and Fairness_.

this Agreement and, subject to obtaining any necessary Company Shareholder
Approval, to perform its obligations hereunder. The execution and delivery of
this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by all
necessary corporate action and no other corporate proceedings on the part of
the Company and no shareholder votes are necessary to authorize this
Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby other than,
with respect to the Merger, the filing and recordation of appropriate merger
documents as required by the MGBCL and any necessary Company
Shareholder Approval. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
the Company and, assuming this Agreement is a valid and binding obligation of
Parent and Merger Sub, this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with
its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency (including all Laws relating to
fraudulent transfers), reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights (the " _Bankruptcy
Exception_ ").

(b) If the holdings of Company Common Stock by Merger Sub do not meet the
threshold required by Section 351.447 of the MGBCL, the affirmative vote of
not less than sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66- 2/3%) of the shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding on the record date of the Company
Shareholders Meeting, voting together as a single class (the " _Company
Shareholder Approval_ "), is the only vote of the holders of any class or
series of the Companys capital stock necessary to approve this Agreement and
the Merger. If the holdings of Company Common Stock by Merger Sub meet the
threshold required by Section 351.447 of the MGBCL, no vote of the holders of
any class or series of the Companys capital stock is necessary to approve
this Agreement or the Merger.

(c) On or prior to the date of this Agreement, the Company Board has
received from UBS Securities LLC (the " _Company Financial Advisor_ "), its
written opinion, subject to the limitations, qualifications and assumptions
set forth therein, that the $63.50 in cash per share to be received by the
holders of Company Common Stock in the Offer and the Merger is fair from a
financial point of view to such holders, and, as of the date of this
Agreement, such

 



30  opinion has not been withdrawn, revoked or modified. The Company will
furnish a complete and correct copy of such opinion to Parent promptly after
receipt thereof by the Company for informational purposes only; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that neither Parent nor Merger Sub may rely upon such opinion.

(d) On or prior to the date of this Agreement, the Company Board (i) has
unanimously determined that each of this Agreement and the transactions

to, and in the best interest of, the Company and the Company Shareholders,

Company Subsidiary is bound or affected, or (iii) require any consent or
approval under, result in any breach of or any loss of any benefit under, or
constitute a default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both

vesting, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the
creation of a Lien (other than a Permitted Encumbrance) on any property or
asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary pursuant to, any Contract to
which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or by which any of
their respective properties or assets are bound, or (iv) result in any Permits
of the Company to be cancelled or rescinded or otherwise cease to be
effective, except, with respect to clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv), for matters

(a) _Company SEC Filings_. The Company has timely filed or furnished all
forms, reports and other documents required to be filed or furnished by it
under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, since
January 1, 2009 (collectively, the " _Company SEC Filings_ "). Each Company
SEC Filing as of its date, or if amended, as of the date of the last such
amendment prior to the date hereof, complied in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, each as in effect on the date the
Company SEC Filing was filed. Except to the extent that information in any

Filing filed prior to the date hereof, each Company SEC Filing did not, at the
time it was filed, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. No Company Subsidiary is subject to the
periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. The Company has made
available to Parent correct and complete copies of all material correspondence
between the SEC, on the one hand, and the Company and any of the Company
Subsidiaries, on the other hand, occurring since January 1, 2009 and prior to

the notes thereto), and each of the Company Financial Statements presented
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the
Company as of the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of
operations and cash flows of the Company for the respective periods indicated
therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal adjustments
which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
be material). The books and records of the Company and the Company

Companys principal executive officer and its principal financial officer have
disclosed to the Companys auditors and the audit committee of the Company

involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Companys internal controls.

principal financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decision regarding
required disclosure under the Exchange Act.

any Company Subsidiary has made any prohibited loans to any executive officer
of the Company (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) or director of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary. There are no outstanding loans or other
extensions of credit made by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
to any executive officer (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) or
director of the Company.

Section 5.8 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. None of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued,
absolute, contingent or otherwise) that would be required to be reflected on
a consolidated balance sheet of the Company prepared in accordance with GAAP,
except for liabilities or obligations (i) which, individually or in the

hereof.

(if applicable) to be filed with the SEC in connection with the Offer and the
Merger, when filed, distributed or disseminated, as applicable, will comply as

statutory and regulatory changes with respect to plan qualification
requirements for which the IRS will issue such a letter and, to the Knowledge

that caused or could reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such

Company Plan, including liability for severance pay, unemployment
compensation, termination pay or withdrawal liability, or accelerate the time
of payment or vesting or increase the amount of compensation or benefits due
to any employee, officer, director, shareholder or other service provider of

Section 5.21 _Takeover Provisions_.

 

(a) The Company Board has unanimously approved this Agreement, the Offer, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and such
approval is sufficient to render inapplicable to the Offer and the Merger the
provisions of Section 351.459 of the MGBCL. The Company Board has also
unanimously amended the Company By-laws to add a provision stating
that Section 351.407 of the MGBCL (which relates to "control share
acquisitions" as defined in Section 351.015(4) of the MGBCL) does not apply to
control share acquisitions of the Company. Such amendment of the Company By-
laws is sufficient to render the provisions of Section 351.407 of the MGBCL
inapplicable to the shares of Company Common Stock acquired in the Offer. The
Company Board has taken all necessary action so that the Takeover Provisions
do not, and will not, apply to (i) Parent, Merger Sub or any other Subsidiary
of Parent with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,

Time or the expiration of any subsequent offering period provided in
accordance with Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act, the
Company, acting through the Company Board, shall, in accordance with
applicable Law and the Company Articles of Incorporation and the Company By-
laws establish a record date for, call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of the Company Shareholders (the " _Company Shareholders  Meeting_")
for the purpose of voting upon the approval of this Agreement in accordance
with the MGBCL. The Company shall solicit from the Company Shareholders
proxies in favor of the approval of this Agreement in accordance with
Missouri Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, the Companys obligation to establish a record date for, call, give
notice of, convene and hold the Company Shareholders Meeting pursuant to
this _Section 7.2(a)_ shall not be limited to, or otherwise affected by, the
commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission to the Company of any
Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall ensure that all proxies solicited in
connection with the Company Shareholders Meeting are solicited in compliance
with all applicable Laws.

(b) In connection with the Company Shareholders Meeting, if any, following

Company shall prepare and file with the SEC a proxy statement, letter to
shareholders, notice of meeting and form of proxy accompanying the Proxy
Statement that will be provided to the Company Shareholders in connection with
the solicitation of proxies for use at the Company Shareholders Meeting, and
any schedules required to be filed with the SEC in connection therewith

Company and Parent, as the case may be, shall furnish all information
concerning the Company or Parent as the other party hereto may reasonably
request in connection with the preparation and filing with the SEC of the
Proxy Statement. Subject to all applicable Laws, the Company shall
use reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be cleared by the
SEC and disseminated to the Company Shareholders as promptly as practicable
following the filing thereof with the SEC. The Company shall provide Parent,
Merger Sub and their counsel reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
the Proxy Statement and all other materials used in connection with the
Company Shareholder Meeting that (i) constitute "proxy materials" or
"solicitation materials" as those terms are used in Rules 14a-1 through
14a-17 promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) are otherwise used for the
"solicitation" of "proxies" as those terms are defined in Rule 14a-1
promulgated under the Exchange Act, in each case prior to the filing thereof
with the SEC or the dissemination thereof to Company Shareholders. The Company
shall advise Parent, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of any request
by the SEC or its staff for an amendment or revisions to the Proxy Statement,
or comments thereon and responses thereto, or requests by the SEC or its staff
for additional information in connection therewith. If at any time prior to
the Company Shareholders Meeting, any information relating to the Company or
Parent, or any of their respective directors, officers or Affiliates, should
be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy
Statement would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which

 



55  they were made, not misleading, the Party that discovers such information
shall promptly notify the other Party or Parties hereto, as the case may be,
and an appropriate amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement describing
such information shall be promptly prepared and filed with the SEC and, to the
extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the Company Shareholders.
The Company shall cause the Proxy Statement to comply as to form and
substance in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act and the NYSE.

hereof, subject to the terms of _Section 7.5(d)_ hereof, the Company shall
include in the Proxy Statement the Company Board Recommendation (other than
with respect to the Offer).

Stock acquired in the Offer (or otherwise beneficially owned by it or any of
its respective Subsidiaries as of the applicable record date) in favor of the
approval of this Agreement in accordance with Missouri Law at the Company
Shareholders Meeting or otherwise.

 

Section 7.3 _Short-Form Merger_. Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section
7.2_ hereof, in the event that Parent and Merger Sub shall acquire at least
ninety percent (90%) of the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock pursuant to the Offer or otherwise (including as a result of the
exercise of the Top-Up Option or pursuant to any subsequent offering period)
(the " _Short-Form Threshold_ "), subject to _Section 8.1_, the Parties shall
take all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become
effective, in accordance with Section 351.447 of the MGBCL, as promptly as
reasonably practicable after such acquisition, without a meeting of the
Company Shareholders.

Section 7.4 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

(a) _Access to Information_. Subject to _Section 7.4(b)_, from the date of
this Agreement until the earlier to occur of the Effective Time or the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1_, the Company shall,
and shall instruct each Company Subsidiary and each of its and
their respective Representatives (collectively, " _Company Representatives_
") to: (i) provide to Parent and Merger Sub and each of their respective
Representatives (collectively, " _Parent Representatives_ ")
reasonable access during normal business hours, upon reasonable prior notice,
to the officers, employees, properties, offices, district managers and other
facilities of the Company or such Company Subsidiary and to the books and
records thereof and (ii) furnish or cause to be furnished such information
concerning the business, properties, Contracts, assets, liabilities, personnel

until the Effective Time, the Company shall not be required to (x) furnish, or
provide any access to, any information to any Person not a party to, or
otherwise covered by, the NDA or any similar agreement with the Company with
respect to such information or (y) provide access to or furnish any
information if doing so would unreasonably disrupt the operations of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, would violate any applicable Law or would
cause a violation of any agreement to which the Company or any Company
Subsidiary is a party (provided that the Company shall have used
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a waiver from the counterparty to
any such agreement so as to allow

 



56  the Company to provide access to or furnish the relevant information), or
where such access to information would involve the waiver or loss of an
attorney-client or work product privilege so long as the Company has
reasonably cooperated with Parent to permit such inspection of or to disclose
such information on a basis that does not compromise or waive such privilege
with respect thereto; _provided_ , _further_ , that such access
and information shall be disclosed or granted, as applicable, subject to the
execution of a joint defense agreement in customary form, to external counsel
for Parent to the extent required for the purpose of complying with applicable
Laws, including Antitrust Laws.

disclosed pursuant to  _Section 7.4(a)_, the Parties shall, subject to

in full force and effect in accordance with its terms until the earlier of
the Acceptance Time or the expiration of the NDA according to its terms.

of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1_ or _Section 9.2_
hereof and the Acceptance Time, the Company shall not, shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries not to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Company Representatives not to:

(i) initiate, solicit, propose, knowingly encourage (including by providing
information) or take any action to knowingly facilitate the making of any
proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead
to, an Acquisition Proposal;

 

(ii) engage in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or provide any
information concerning the Company or any Company Subsidiary to any Person
relating to, any Acquisition Proposal or any proposal or offer that could
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal;

(iii) grant any waiver, amendment or release under any standstill or
confidentiality agreement or Takeover Provision, for the purpose of allowing a
Third Party to make an Acquisition Proposal (including providing consent or
authorization to any Third Party to make an Acquisition Proposal to any
officer or employee of the Company or to the Company Board or any member
thereof); or

 

(iv) resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 

The Company shall, shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Company Representatives to, immediately
cease all discussions and negotiations with any Person (other than the Parties
hereto) that may be ongoing with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and
shall immediately request such Person to promptly return or destroy all
confidential information concerning the Company and the Company Subsidiaries.

 



57 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 7.5(a)_
but subject to the last sentence of this _Section 7.5(b)_, at any time prior
to the Acceptance Time, the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and the Company
Representatives may, subject to compliance with this _Section 7.5(b)_: 

(i) provide information in response to a request therefor to a Person who has
made an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal after the date
of this Agreement (which Acquisition Proposal does not arise out of any
material breach of this _Section 7.5_) only if, prior to providing such
information, the Company has received from the Person so requesting such
information an executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, _provided_ that
the Company shall promptly make available to Parent any material non-public
information concerning the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that is
provided to any Person making such Acquisition Proposal that is given such
access and that was not previously made available to Parent or the Parent
Representatives;

 

(ii) engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person
who has made such an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal;

(iii) grant any waiver, amendment or release under any standstill

_Section 7.5(b)(ii)_, _Section 7.5(b)(iii)_ or _Section 7.5(b)(iv)_ above,
(x) the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation
with outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action could be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Laws, and
(y) the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, based on the
information then available and after consultation with its financial advisor
and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a
Superior Proposal or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior
Proposal.

 

(c) Except as expressly provided by _Section 7.5(d)_, at any time after the
date hereof, neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall:

(i) (A) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly resolve to

Merger, (B) adopt, approve or recommend an Acquisition Proposal, (C) fail to
recommend, in a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9,

58  Proposal, (D) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the
Schedule 14D-9, (E) enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, definitive agreement or similar document or Contract relating
to any Acquisition Proposal (other than any Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement entered into in accordance with _Section 7.5(b)_), or (F) fail to
publicly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within five (5) Business
Days after Parent so requests in writing (provided that Parent shall make such
request on no more than two occasions in addition to any such request made by
Parent in connection with the announcement or commencement of an Acquisition
Proposal) (any action described in clauses (A) through (F), a " _Company
Adverse Recommendation Change_ ," it being understood that, for the avoidance
of doubt, neither the approval or delivery of a Determination Notice shall
be, by itself, deemed to be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change); or

(ii) cause or permit the Company or any Company Subsidiary to enter into any
acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar definitive Contract with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal (other than any Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement entered into in accordance with  _Section 7.5(b)_) (an "
_Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ").

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at
any time prior to the Acceptance Time:

(i) if the Company has received a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal
from any Person that is not withdrawn and that the Company Board concludes in
good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal, (x) the Company Board may effect a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to such Superior Proposal,
or (y) the Company may terminate this Agreement to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, if and only if:

 

(A) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with a
financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under applicable Laws;

(B) the Company shall have complied in all material respects with its
obligations under this _Section 7.5_;

 

(C) the Company shall have provided prior written notice (a " _Determination
Notice_ ") to Parent at least three (3) Business Days in advance (the "
_Notice Period_ "), to the effect that the Company Board has received a _bona
fide_ written Acquisition Proposal that is not withdrawn and that the Company
Board has concluded in good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal and, absent
any revision to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company Board
has determined to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and/or to
terminate this Agreement 

 



59  pursuant to this _Section 7.5(d)(i)_, which notice shall specify the
identity of the party making the Superior Proposal and the material terms
thereof and shall include copies of all relevant documents relating to such
Superior Proposal;

(D) prior to effecting such Company Adverse Recommendation Change or
termination, the Company shall, and shall cause its financial and legal
advisors to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent and the Parent
Representatives in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate)
to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement, so
that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal;
_provided_ , that in the event of any material revisions to the Acquisition
Proposal that the Company Board has determined to be a Superior Proposal, the
Company shall be required to deliver a new Determination Notice to Parent and
to comply with the requirements of this _Section 7.5_ (including _Section
7.5(d)_) with respect to such new Determination Notice and the revised
Superior Proposal contemplated thereby; and

(E) in the case of any action contemplated by clause (y) of this _Section
7.5(d)(i)_, the Company shall have terminated this Agreement in accordance
with _Section 9.1(c)(ii)_, including the payment of the Company Termination
Fee in accordance with _Section 9.4(b)(i)_; or

(ii) other than in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, the Company Board
may take the actions specified in clauses (A), (D) or (F) of _Section
7.5(c)(i)_ (" _Intervening Event Change of Recommendation_ ") in response to
an Intervening Event if the Company Board shall have determined in good
faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties
under applicable Laws, if and only if:

 

(A) the Company shall have provided a Determination Notice to Parent for at
least the Notice Period to the effect that the Company Board has determined
to effect an Intervening Event Change of Recommendation, which notice shall
specify the Intervening Event in reasonable detail;

 

(B) prior to effecting such Intervening Event Change of Recommendation, the
Company shall, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith
(to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the
terms and conditions of this Agreement in such a manner that such Intervening
Event no longer necessitates such Intervening Event Change of Recommendation;
and

(C) at or following the end of such Notice Period, the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal

 



60  counsel, that such Intervening Event continues to necessitate an Intervening
Event Change of Recommendation (in each case taking into account any revisions
to this Agreement made or proposed in writing by Parent).

None of the Company, the Company Board or any committee of the Company Board
shall enter into any agreement with any Person providing that the Company is
not permitted to give prior notice to Parent of its intention to effect a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change, an Intervening Event of Recommendation,
or prior notice of its intention to terminate this Agreement in light of a
Superior Proposal, or limiting its ability to give such notice.

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section 7.5_ shall be deemed to prohibit the
Company or the Company Board or any committee thereof from (i) complying with
its disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state Law with regard to an
Acquisition Proposal, including taking and disclosing to its shareholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communication to shareholders), _provided_ that any such disclosure (other
than a "stop- look-and-listen" communication or similar communication of the
type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) following the
commencement (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange
Act) of a tender offer that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal by a Third
Party shall be deemed to be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change unless the
Company Board expressly publicly reaffirms the Company Board
Recommendation within five (5) Business Days following any request by Parent,
or (ii) making any "stop-look-and-listen" communication or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act.

 

(f) The Company agrees that it will promptly (and, in any event, within forty-
eight (48) hours of the Company becoming aware of such event) notify Parent
if (i) a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal is received by, (ii) in
connection with a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal, any non-public
information is requested from, or (iii) any discussions or negotiations in
connection with the submission of an Acquisition Proposal are sought to be
initiated or continued with, in each case, the Company or any Company
Representative indicating, in connection with such notice, the identity of
the Person or group of Persons making such offer or proposal and the material
terms and conditions of any proposals or offers (including, if applicable,
copies of any written requests, proposals or offers, including proposed
agreements) and thereafter shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a
reasonably prompt basis (and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours), of
any material developments or modifications to the terms of any such proposals
or offers (including any material amendments thereto) and the status of any
such discussions or negotiations.

(g) No Company Adverse Recommendation Change or Intervening Event Change of
Recommendation shall change the approval of the Company Board for purposes of
causing any Takeover Provision to be inapplicable to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

or any other transaction contemplated hereby (the " _Transaction Litigation_
"), or (iii) to such Partys Knowledge, the failure of any such Party to
comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement which, individually or in

existence of any of facts, events or circumstance described in the conditions
to the Offer set forth on _Annex A_ or (y) any condition to the obligations
of any Party to effect the Merger set forth in _Article VIII_ not to be
satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant
to this _Section 7.8_ shall not cure any breach of any representation or
warranty or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to any
Party.

 

Section 7.9 _Transaction Litigation_. The Company and Parent shall give each
other the opportunity to participate in the defense, settlement and/or
prosecution of any Transaction Litigation; _provided_ , that neither the

releases or otherwise making public announcements (including conference calls
with investors and analysts) with respect to the Offer, the Merger or
any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No Party shall issue
any such press release or make any such public announcement prior to such
consultation, except to the extent the disclosing Party determines based on
advice of counsel it is required to do so by applicable Law or any listing
agreement with a stock exchange, in which case such Party shall use reasonable
best efforts to consult with the other Party before issuing any such release

(a) For a period of no less than twelve (12) months following the Effective

Employees, compensation and employee benefits (other than equity compensation)
that are, in the aggregate, no less favorable than the compensation and
benefits (other than equity compensation) being provided by the Company and
Company Subsidiaries to such employees immediately prior to the Effective
Time under the Company Plans. The preceding sentence shall not preclude Parent
or its Subsidiaries at any time following the Effective Time from terminating
the employment of any Continuing Employee for any reason (or no reason).

(b) Each Continuing Employee shall be given credit for all service with the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors under
any employee benefit plan of Parent or its Affiliates in which such Continuing
Employee is eligible to participate, including any such plans providing
vacation, sick pay, severance and retirement benefits maintained by Parent or
its Affiliates in which such Continuing Employees participate for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and entitlement to benefits, including for severance
benefits and vacation entitlement (but not for accrual of pension benefits),
to the extent past service was recognized for such Continuing Employees under
the comparable Company Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this  _Section 7.11(b)_ shall be
construed to require crediting of service that would result in (i) duplication
of benefits, (ii) service credit for benefit accruals under a defined benefit
pension plan, or (iii) service credit under a newly established plan for
which prior service is not taken into account for employees of Parent and its
Subsidiaries generally.

(c) In the event of any change in the welfare benefits provided to Continuing
Employees following the Effective Time, Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause (i) the waiver of all limitations as to pre-
existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Continuing Employees
under any such welfare benefit plans to the extent that such
conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would not apply in the absence of
such change, and (ii) for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs,
the crediting of each Continuing Employee with any co-payments and deductibles
paid prior to any such change in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-
of-pocket requirements after such change.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 7.11_ to the contrary, nothing
contained herein, whether express or implied, shall be treated as an amendment
or other modification of any employee benefit plan of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation or any of their 

 



67  respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or shall limit the right of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any employee benefit plan
of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries
or Affiliates following the Effective Time. If (i) a party other than the
Parties hereto makes a claim or takes other action to enforce any provision
in this Agreement as an amendment to any employee benefit plan of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates, and (ii) such provision is deemed to be an amendment to
such employee benefit plan even though not explicitly designated as such in
this Agreement, then, solely with respect to such employee benefit plan, such
provision shall lapse retroactively and shall have no amendatory effect with
respect thereto. 

(e) The Parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in
this _Section 7.11_ are included for the sole benefit of the Parties hereto,
and that nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall create
any third-party beneficiary or other rights (i) in any other Person, including
any employees or former employees of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or
any Affiliate of the Company, any Continuing Employee, or any dependent or
beneficiary thereof, or (ii) to continued employment with Parent or any of its
Affiliates.

 

Section 7.12 _Resignation of Directors_. Except as otherwise may be agreed by
Parent, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to deliver to Parent at
the Closing the resignation of all members of the Company Board who are in
office immediately prior to the Effective Time, which resignations shall be
effective at the Effective Time.

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses existing in favor of the current
or former directors and officers of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
and each Person who served as a director, officer, member, trustee or
fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension
or other employee benefit plan or enterprise at the request of the Company
(the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") as provided in their respective articles of
incorporation or by-laws or other organizational documents or under any
indemnification, employment or other similar agreements between any
Indemnified Party and the Company or any Company Subsidiary, in each case as
in effect on the date of this Agreement, shall survive the Merger and continue
in full force and effect in accordance with their respective terms to the
extent permitted by applicable Law. For a period of six (6) years after the
Board Appointment Date, Parent shall cause the articles of incorporation, by-
laws and other organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation and the
Company Subsidiaries to contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
exculpation and indemnification of and advancement of expenses to Indemnified
Parties than are set forth as of the date of this Agreement in the respective
articles of incorporation, by-laws or other organizational documents of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the extent permitted by applicable
Law. From and after the Board Appointment Date, in the event the Surviving
Corporation or any Company Subsidiary does not have sufficient funds to honor
each of the respective agreements contained in this _Section 7.13(a)_ in
accordance with their respective terms, Parent shall provide or cause to be
provided to the Surviving Corporation or Company Subsidiary, as the case may
be, sufficient funds so that such Person may honor the applicable agreements
contained in this _Section 7.13(a)_.

 



68 (b) The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation (including by providing funding to the extent the Surviving
Corporation does not have sufficient funds), to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law, to indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds in
respect of each of the foregoing) each Indemnified Party against any costs or
expenses (including advancing attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the
final disposition of any Action to each Indemnified Party to the fullest
extent permitted by Law), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or
threatened Action by reason of the fact that such Person was a director or
officer of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or anything done or not done
by such Person in such capacity, whether before or after the Board Appointment
Date (including acts or omissions in connection with such Persons serving as
an officer, director or other fiduciary in any entity if such service was at
the request of the Company). In the event of any such Action, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall control the defense of any such Action, and the
Indemnified Party shall cooperate with (but not control) Parent and the
Surviving Corporation in such defense. Neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall settle any such Action without the prior written consent of
the Indemnified Party unless the Surviving Corporation assumes full
responsibility for such settlement, the settlement grants the Indemnified
Party a complete release in respect of the potential liability relating to the
claims underlying such Action and such settlement does not contain any
admission detrimental to the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall
not settle any such Action without the prior written consent of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation unless such settlement does not provide for monetary
damages, the terms of such settlement are not in any way detrimental to Parent
or the Surviving Corporation and such settlement does not contain any
admission detrimental to Parent or the Surviving Corporation. In the event of
any payment under this _Section 7.13(b)_, the Surviving Corporation shall be
subrogated to the extent of such payment to all rights of recovery of the
Indemnified Party with respect to any insurance covering any such liability
(including the insurance set forth in _Section 7.13(c)_).

(c) From the Board Appointment Date through the sixth (6th) anniversary of the
Board Appointment Date (such period, the " _Tail Period_ "), Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain in effect the Companys
current directors and officers liability insurance covering each officer and
director currently covered by the Companys directors and officers liability
insurance policy for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Board
Appointment Date with respect to any matter claimed against such person by
reason of him or her serving in such capacity on terms with respect to such
coverage and amounts no less favorable in the aggregate than those of such
policy in effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , that in no event
shall the aggregate costs of such insurance policies exceed in any one year
during the Tail Period 250% of the current aggregate annual premiums paid by
the Company for such purpose (which aggregate annual premiums with respect to
such period are hereby represented and warranted by the Company to be in the
amount set forth in _Section 7.13(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule),
it being understood that Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall
nevertheless be obligated to provide such coverage, with respect to each year
during the Tail Period, as may be obtained for such 250% annual amount; 
_provided_ , _further_ that Parent or the Surviving Corporation may (i)
substitute therefor policies of any reputable

 



69  insurance company or (ii) satisfy its obligation under this _Section
7.13(c)_ by causing the Company to obtain prepaid (or "tail") directors and
officers liability insurance policy, in each case, the material terms of
which including coverage and amount, are no less favorable in the aggregate to
such directors and officers than the insurance coverage otherwise required
under this  _Section 7.13(c)_.

(d) Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys
fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in successfully enforcing
the indemnity and other obligations provided in this _Section 7.13_.

(e) The provisions of this _Section 7.13_ shall survive the consummation of
the Merger and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable
by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their respective heirs and
representatives.

(f) In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such
case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations of such Person set forth in this  _Section 7.13_.

Section 7.14 _Takeover Provisions_. Parent, the Company and their respective
Boards of Directors shall (i) take all reasonable action necessary to ensure
that no Takeover Provision is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or the
transactions provided for in this Agreement, including the Offer and the
Merger and (ii) if any Takeover Provision becomes applicable to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, take all
reasonable action necessary to ensure that the transactions provided for in
this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
Takeover Provision on Parent and Merger Sub, this Agreement and the
transactions provided for in this Agreement.

 

Section 7.15 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take all such steps as may reasonably be necessary and permitted to
cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (a) any
dispositions of shares of Company Common Stock (including Company Stock Units
and other derivative securities with respect to such shares of Company Common
Stock) by each individual who is or will be subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company,
and (b) the conversion of Company Options as contemplated by  _Section 4.5_
hereof, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 7.16 _Rule 14d-10 Matters_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Company will not, after the date hereof, enter
into, establish, amend or modify any plan, program, agreement or arrangement
pursuant to which compensation is paid or payable, or pursuant to which
benefits are provided, in each case to any current or former director,
officer, employee or independent contractor of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary unless, prior to such entry into, establishment, amendment
or modification, the

 



70  Compensation Committee (each member of which the Company Board determined is
an "independent director" within the meaning of Section 303A.01 of the NYSE
rules and shall be an "independent director" in accordance with the
requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act at the time of any
such action) shall have taken all such steps as may be necessary to (a)
approve as an Employment Compensation Arrangement each such plan, program,
agreement or arrangement and (b) satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive
safe harbor under Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act with respect to
such plan, program, agreement or arrangement. 

Section 7.17 _Stock Exchange De-listing_. Prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things,
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Laws
(including the rules and regulations of the NYSE) to cause the delisting of
the Company Common Stock from the NYSE and the deregistration of the Company
Common Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time.

 

Section 7.18 _FIRPTA Certificate_. The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide to Parent an affidavit, dated as of the Closing
Date, signed under penalties of perjury, that is consistent in form and
substance with the affidavit referred to in Treasury Regulations Section
1.1445-2(c)(3).

 

Section 7.19 _Exon-Florio_. Without limiting the provisions of _Section 7.6_,
the Parties shall jointly prepare and promptly (and in any event no later
than December 8, 2010) file with CFIUS, a notice of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the " _CFIUS Notice_ "), and shall furnish any
supplemental information requested therewith requested by CFIUS in connection
therewith pursuant to Section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as
amended, and the applicable regulations thereto.

Section 7.20 _Additional Agreements_.

(a) Parent shall (i) cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain its
principal administrative and executive offices within the city limits of Fort
Smith, Arkansas and (ii) cause such offices to be the headquarters for the
North American operations of Parents motors and generators business.

(b) Parent shall maintain the Baldor brand.

Acceptance Time, by action taken or authorized by the Board of Directors of
the terminating Party or Parties, as follows:

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

(b) by either Parent or the Company if:

 

(i) Merger Sub shall not have accepted for payment any shares of Company
Common Stock pursuant to the Offer on or before February 28, 2011; _provided_
that in the event that none of the facts, events or circumstances described in
the conditions set forth on Annex A (other than the facts, events and
circumstances described in the condition set forth in paragraph (b) or (c) of
_Annex A_ hereto) shall have occurred or be continuing and as of such date it
is reasonably likely that the facts, events and circumstances described in the
condition set forth in paragraph (b) or (c) of _Annex A_ hereto will cease to
exist, such date shall automatically be extended for an additional four-month
period to June 30, 2011 (the latest applicable date, the " _End Date_ ");
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under
this _Section 9.1(b)(i)_ shall not be available to any Party whose breach of
any covenant or obligation under this Agreement resulted in the failure of the
Acceptance Time to occur prior to such End Date; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 9.1(b)(i)_
shall not be available to the Company if, at the time of such intended
termination by the Company, either party is entitled to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)(ii)_; or

(ii) the Offer shall have expired or been terminated in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement without Merger Sub having accepted for payment any
shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and at the time of such
expiration or termination any of the facts, events or circumstances described
in the conditions to the Offer set forth on _Annex A_ hereto shall have
occurred and be continuing; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section 9.1(b)(ii)_ shall not be
available to any Party whose breach of any covenant or obligation under this
Agreement has been a proximate cause of

 



72 (x) the occurrence of any of the facts, events or circumstances described in
the conditions of the Offer set forth on _Annex A_ hereto or (y) the
expiration or termination of the Offer without Merger Sub having accepted for
payment any shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer;

 

(c) by the Company if:

(i) (x) Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached in any material respect any
of the covenants or agreements made by them in this Agreement, or (y) any of
the representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in this
Agreement shall have been inaccurate when made or shall have become inaccurate
as of a date subsequent to the date of this Agreement (as if made on such
subsequent date), but in either case only to the extent that such breach or
inaccuracy would prevent or delay Parent and Merger Sub from accepting for
payment or paying for the shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer
or consummating the Merger in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; 
_provided_ , _further_ , that the Company shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(c)(i)_ if, at the time
of such termination, there exists a material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company contained in
this Agreement; or

Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, (y) the
Company has complied in all material respects with _Section 7.5_ and (z)
immediately after the termination of this Agreement, the Company enters into
an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to the Superior Proposal
referred to in the foregoing clause (x); _provided_ , that the right of the
Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant this  _Section 9.1(c)(ii)_ is
conditioned on and subject to the payment by the Company to Parent of the
Company Termination Fee in accordance with _Section 9.4(b)(i)_, and any
purported termination pursuant to this  _Section 9.1(c)(ii)_ shall be void
and of no force or effect if the Company shall not have paid the Company
Termination Fee in accordance with _Section 9.4(b)(i)_,.

 

(d) by Parent if:

(i) (x) the Company shall have breached any of the covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement to be complied with by the Company (other than
_Section 7.5_) such that the facts, events and circumstances described in
the condition set forth in paragraph (f) on _Annex A_ hereto would have
occurred and be continuing or (y) there exists a breach of any representation
or warranty of the Company contained in this Agreement such that the facts,
events and circumstances described in the condition set forth in paragraph (e)
on _Annex A_ would have occurred and be continuing, and, in the case of either
(x) or (y), such breach is incapable of being cured by the End Date or is not
cured by the Company within thirty (30) calendar days after the Company
receives written notice of such breach from Parent or Merger Sub; _provided_
that Parent shall not 

 



73  have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section

Section 9.2  _Termination Before or After the Acceptance Time_.
Notwithstanding the prior approval of this Agreement by the Company
Shareholders in accordance with the MGBCL, this Agreement may be terminated
and the Offer and/or the Merger may be abandoned, at any time prior to the
Effective Time (it being agreed that the party hereto terminating this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.2_ shall give prompt written notice of
such termination to the other party or parties hereto), by either Parent or
the Company if (x) any Order of any Governmental Entity having competent
jurisdiction is entered permanently enjoining the Company, Parent or Merger
Sub from consummating the Offer and/or the Merger and such Order has become
final and nonappealable, or (y) there shall be any Law that makes
consummation of the Offer or the Merger illegal or otherwise prohibited
(unless the consummation of the Offer or the Merger in violation of such Law
would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect) and, prior to termination
pursuant to this _Section 9.2_, the terminating Party shall have complied in
all material respects with its obligations under _Section 7.6_; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 9.2_ shall not be available to any Party whose breach of any
provision of this Agreement was a proximate cause of the imposition of any
such Order or the failure of such Order to be resisted, resolved or lifted,
as applicable.

Section 9.3 _Notice of Termination_. The Party desiring to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1_ (other than under _Section 9.1(a)_) or
_Section 9.2_ shall give prompt written notice of such termination to the
other Parties specifying the provision or provisions of  _Section 9.1_ or
_Section 9.2_ pursuant to which such termination is effected.

Section 9.4 _Effect of Termination; Company Termination Fee and Expense
Reimbursement_.

(a) _Effect of Termination Generally_. Except as otherwise set forth in this
_Section 9.4_, in the event of a termination of this Agreement by either the
Company or Parent as provided in _Section 9.1_ or _Section 9.2_, this
Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and there shall be no
liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or
their respective directors, officers, shareholders, employees and other
Representatives; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the provisions of this
_Section 9.4_, _Article X_ and the NDA and (ii) after the Acceptance Time,
the provision of _Section 2.1(e)_ shall, in each case, remain in full force
and effect and survive any termination of this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that no Party shall be relieved or released from any liabilities
or damages arising out of its willful and material breach of its covenants or
agreements or willful and material breach of any representation or warranties

 



74  set forth in this Agreement made by such Party (including the failure by the
Company to pay any amounts due pursuant to _Section 9.4(b)_ or _Section
9.4(c)_). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall any Party be
liable for punitive damages.

(b) _Company Termination Fee_.

 

(i) In the event this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
_Section 9.1(c)(ii)_, the Company shall pay the Company Termination Fee to
Parent prior to or simultaneously with such termination by wire transfer of
same day funds to one or more accounts designated by Parent.

 

(ii) In the event this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section
9.1(d)(ii)_, the Company shall pay the Company Termination Fee to Parent
promptly, but in any event within two (2) Business Days after the date of such
termination, by wire transfer of same day funds to one or more accounts
designated by Parent.

 

(iii) In the event that (x) this Agreement is terminated (A) by either Parent
or the Company pursuant to  _Section 9.1(b)(ii)_ (due solely to a failure of
the Minimum Condition to be satisfied at the time of the final expiration of
the Offer) or (B) by Parent pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)(i)_ (other than any
such termination solely as a result of any breach or breaches of the
Companys representations and warranties due to facts or circumstances
existing or occurring prior to the date hereof), and prior to the time of such
termination an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced,
commenced or disclosed and shall not have been irrevocably and in good faith
withdrawn, and (y) at any time after the execution of this Agreement and prior
to the expiration of the twelfth (12th) month after the termination of this
Agreement, the Company consummates an Acquisition Proposal or enters into any
letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other
similar agreement related to an Acquisition Proposal that is
subsequently consummated, or the Company files a Solicitation/Recommendation
Statement on Schedule 14D-9 that includes the Company Boards recommendation
of any Acquisition Proposal to the Company Shareholders that is subsequently
consummated, then the Company shall, on the date such Acquisition Proposal is
consummated, pay the Company Termination Fee (less the amount of Parent
Expenses previously paid to Parent pursuant to _Section 9.4(c)(i)_, if any)
to Parent by wire transfer of same day funds to one or more accounts
designated by Parent; _provided_ , that for purposes of this _Section
9.4(b)(iii)_, all percentages in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall
be replaced with fifty percent (50%).

 

(iv) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be obligated to
pay, or cause to be paid, the Company Termination Fee on more than one
occasion. Parent shall have right to assign the right to receive the Company
Termination Fee to one or more Persons in its sole discretion.

 



75 (c) _Expense Reimbursement_.

 

(i) In the event this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section
9.1(d)(i)_, then the Company shall, following receipt of an invoice therefor,
promptly (in any event within two (2) Business Days) pay all of Parents
reasonably documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including legal fees
and expenses) actually incurred by Parent and its Affiliates on or prior to
the termination of this Agreement in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Parent Expenses_ "), which amount shall
in no event exceed $20,000,000 in the aggregate, by wire transfer of same day
funds to one or more accounts designated by Parent; _provided_ , that the
existence of circumstances which could require the Company Termination Fee to
become subsequently payable by the Company pursuant to  _Section 9.4(b)_
shall not relieve the Company of its obligations to pay the Parent Expenses
pursuant to this _Section 9.4(c)_; _provided_ , _further_ , that the payment
by the Company of Parent Expenses pursuant to this  _Section 9.4(c)_ shall
not relieve the Company of any subsequent obligation to pay the Company
Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 9.4(b)_ except to the extent indicated
in _Section 9.4(b)_.

 

(ii) In the event that a Company Termination Fee is payable by the Company to
Parent pursuant to  _Section 9.4(b)_, a portion of such Company Termination
Fee equal to the amount of Parent Expenses (less the amount of any Parent
Expenses previously paid by the Company pursuant to _Section 9.4(c)(i)_, if
any) shall be allocated as reimbursement of Parent Expenses. For the
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall any such allocation reduce or increase
the amount of Company Termination Fee payable by the Company pursuant to
_Section 9.4(b)_.

 

(d) _Acknowledgement_. Each Party acknowledges that (i) the agreements
contained in this _Section 9.4_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement, (ii) the damages resulting from termination of
this Agreement under circumstances where a Company Termination Fee is payable
are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation and therefore, the
amounts payable pursuant to _Section 9.4(b)_ or _Section 9.4(c)_ are not a
penalty but rather constitute liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that
will compensate Parent for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, (iii) subject to the final proviso in  _Section
9.4(a)_, in the event the Company Termination Fee is paid pursuant to _Section
9.4(b)_, Parents right to receive payment of the Company Termination Fee
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and its Affiliates and
Representatives against the Company and its Affiliates and Representatives
under this Agreement or arising out of or related to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, and upon payment of such amount, none of
the Company or any of its Affiliates or Representatives shall have any
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, in each case whether based on contract, tort
or strict liability, by the enforcement of any assessment, by any legal or
equitable proceeding, by virtue of any applicable Laws or otherwise, and (iv)
without the agreements contained in this _Section 9.4_, Parent would not have
entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly
pay any amount due pursuant to _Section 9.4(b)_ or _Section 9.4(c)_ and, in
order to

 



76  obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment
against the Company for the amount set forth in _Section 9.4(b)_ or _Section
9.4(c)_ or any portion thereof, the Company shall pay to Parent costs and
expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by the Parent and its Affiliates
in connection with such suit, together with interest on such amount or portion
thereof at the prime rate of Citibank N.A. in effect on the date such payment
was required to be made through the date of payment.

Section 9.5  _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
subject to _Section 2.4(d)_, the Parties may, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law and, subject to _Section 9.6_, (i) extend the time for
the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Parties,
(ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto or (iii) waive compliance
with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that after the Company Shareholder Approval has been obtained,
there shall be made no waiver that by Law (including the relevant rules of the
NYSE) requires further approval by the Company Shareholders without the
further approval of such shareholders. Any agreement on the part of a Party to
any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed on behalf of such Party. The failure of any Party to assert
any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a
waiver of those rights.

Section 9.6 _Amendment_. Subject to _Section 2.4(d)_, this Agreement may be
amended by the Parties by action taken by or on behalf of their respective
Boards of Directors at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before
or after the Acceptance Time or the Company Shareholder Approval, if required
by applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) after the Acceptance
Time, there shall be no amendment that decreases the Merger Consideration or
to _Section 7.13_ and (b) after the Company Shareholder Approval has been
obtained, there shall be made no amendment that by Law (including the relevant
rules of the NYSE) requires further approval by the Company Shareholders
without the further approval of such shareholders. This Agreement may not be
amended except by an instrument in writing signed by Parent and the Company.

such Person to each of the other Parties in accordance with this _Section
10.2_.

Section 10.3 _Fees and Expenses_. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all
charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent and all transfer,
documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other similar such Taxes and
fees (including penalties and interest), incurred in connection with the

forth in this Agreement, all fees and expenses incurred in connection
herewith and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the Party
incurring such expenses, whether or not the Offer or the Merger are
consummated.

Section 10.4 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible to the end
that transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the greatest extent
possible.

Section 10.5 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Exhibits,
Parent Disclosure Schedule, Company Disclosure Schedule and the other
documents delivered pursuant hereto) and the NDA constitute the entire
agreement of the Parties and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings,
both written and oral, between the Parties, or any of them, with respect to
the subject matter hereof and thereof.

Section 10.6 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof, and, accordingly, that the Parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof,
in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity.

 



79 Section 10.7 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 

(a) This Agreement (other than _Article III_ and _Article IV_ and with respect
to matters relating to fiduciary duties of the Company Board) and all claims
or causes of action (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) that may be based
upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement (other than _Article III_ and
_Article IV_ and with respect to matters relating to fiduciary duties of the
Company Board) or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement
(other than _Article III_ and _Article IV_ and with respect to matters
relating to fiduciary duties of the Company Board) (including any claim or
cause of action based upon, arising out of or related to any representation or
warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to
enter into this Agreement), shall be construed, performed and enforced in
accordance with the Laws of the State of New York without giving effect to
its principles or rules of conflict of laws to the extent such principles or
rules would require or permit the application of the Laws of another
jurisdiction.

 

(b) _Article III_ and _Article IV_ of this Agreement and all claims or causes
of action (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) that may be based upon,
arise out of or relate to _Article III_ or _Article IV_ of this Agreement, the
negotiation, execution or performance of _Article III_ and _Article IV_ of
this Agreement, or matters relating to fiduciary duties of the Company Board,
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of
Missouri without giving effect to its principles or rules of conflict of laws
to the extent such principles or rules would require or permit the
application of the Laws of another jurisdiction.

(c) Any Action against, arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought solely and exclusively in
the courts of the State of New York; _provided_ , that if (and only after)
such courts determine that they lack subject matter jurisdiction over
any such legal Action, such legal Action shall be brought in the Federal
courts of the United States located in the State of New York. Each of the
Parties hereto agrees that a final judgment (subject to any appeals therefrom)
in any such Action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.
Each Party hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such
courts in respect of any legal Action arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally
and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to
the laying of venue of any Action arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in any such court in
accordance with the provisions of this _Section 10.7_. Each of the Parties
hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such Action in any such
court. Each of the Parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in _Section
10.2_. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any Party to this
Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.

 



80 (d) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY, INCLUDING ANY CONTROVERSY
INVOLVING ANY MEMBER OF THE PARENT GROUP UNDER ANY SUCH AGREEMENT. EACH
PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT
SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY,
AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _S ECTION
10.7(d)_.

Section 10.8 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_.

Each of Parent and the Company hereby agrees that their respective
representations, warranties and covenants set forth herein are solely for the
benefit of the other Parties hereto, in accordance with and subject to the
terms of this Agreement, and this Agreement is not intended to, and does not,
confer upon any Person other than the Parties hereto any rights or remedies
hereunder, other than (a) as provided in _Section 7.13_ (Indemnification of
Directors and Officers) and (b) from and after the Effective Time, the right
of the Company Shareholders to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance
with _Article IV_ subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The
representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the Parties. In some instances, the representations and
warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the Parties of
risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of
the Parties. Consequently, Persons other than the Parties may not rely upon
the representations and warranties in this Agreement or the characterization
of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date. 

Section 10.9 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties
(whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent
of the other Parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to the Closing,
Merger Sub may assign this Agreement to any wholly-owned Subsidiary of
Parent. No assignment by any Party shall relieve such Party of any of its
obligations hereunder. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and
their respective successors and permitted assigns.

Section 10.10 _Obligations of Parent and of the Company_. Whenever
this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such
requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to
cause such Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a
Company Subsidiary to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to
include an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such Company
Subsidiary to take such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of
the Surviving Corporation to cause such Company Subsidiary to take such
action.

 



81 Section 10.11 _Mutual Drafting_. Each Party has participated in the drafting
of this Agreement, which each Party acknowledges is the result of extensive
negotiations between the Parties.

Section 10.12  _Headings_. The headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

Section 10.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed by facsimile and
in one or more counterparts, and by the different Parties in separate
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

Section 10.14  _Delivery by Facsimile or Email_. This Agreement, and any
amendments hereto, waivers hereof or consents or notifications hereunder, to
the extent signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by email
with facsimile or scan attachment, shall be treated in all manner and
respects as an original contract and shall be considered to have the same
binding legal effects as if it were the original signed version thereof
delivered in person. At the request of any Party, each other Party shall re-
execute original forms thereof and deliver them to all other Parties. No Party
shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or email to deliver a signature or
the fact that any signature or Contract was transmitted or
communicated through the use of facsimile machine or by email with facsimile
or scan attachment as a defense to the formation of a contract, and each such
Party forever waives any such defense.

Agreement to be executed as of the date first written above by their
respective officers thereunto duly authorized.

ownership or operation by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries of all or any
material portion of the business or assets of Parent, the Company or any of

and warranty expressly speaks as of an earlier date, in which case such
representation and warranty shall not be true and correct as of such earlier
date), except where failures of such representations and warranties to be so

Material Adverse Effect; (ii) the representations and warranties set forth in
_Sections 2.3(a)_ , _5.2(b)_ , _5.2(c)_ , _5.3_ , _5.21_ and _5.22_ (without

benefit of Parent and Merger Sub and may be asserted by Parent and Merger Sub
regardless of the circumstances (including any action or inaction by Parent or
Merger Sub, other than any action or inaction in breach of the Agreement)
giving rise to such condition, in whole or in part at any applicable time or
from time to time in its sole discretion prior to the expiration of the Offer,
and all conditions (except for the Minimum Condition, which may be waived by
Parent and Merger Sub only with the prior written consent of the Company) may
