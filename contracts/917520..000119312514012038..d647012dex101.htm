comparable, in the aggregate, to the benefits (excluding benefits pursuant to
non-qualified retirement savings plans, deferred compensation plans, programs
or arrangements and equity-based or long-term incentive compensation plans,
programs or arrangements) provided to similarly situated employees of
Purchaser and its Affiliates as of the Closing Date.

Company or its Affiliates until such Domestic Transferred Employees
termination date with Purchaser.

evidence of insurability or good health or actively-at-work exclusions
are applicable to any Domestic Transferred Employees or their dependents or
beneficiaries under any welfare benefit plans in which such Domestic
Transferred Employees may be eligible to participate to the extent that such
waiting periods, exclusions and limitations did not apply under a
corresponding Benefit Plan in which the applicable Domestic Transferred
Employee participated as of immediately prior to the Closing, and (ii)
Purchaser shall provide or cause to be provided that any costs or expenses
incurred by any Domestic Transferred Employees (and their dependents or
beneficiaries) under any health and dental Benefit Plans in the calendar year
in which the Closing Date occurs, up to (and including) the Closing Date,
shall be taken into account for purposes of satisfying applicable deductible,
maximum out-of-pocket provisions and like adjustments or limitations on

retain responsibility under their employee welfare benefit plans for all
amounts payable by reason of claims by any Domestic Transferred Employees and
their eligible spouses and dependents incurred on or prior to the Closing
Date, and Purchaser shall be responsible under its employee welfare benefit
plans for all amounts payable by reason of claims by such employees and their

provisions of COBRA with respect to any current or former Business Employee
who does not become a Domestic Transferred Employee.

Section 5.13 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Allocation of Taxes_.

 

(i) Seller shall be responsible for, and shall indemnify and hold the
Purchaser and its Affiliates harmless against any liability for Taxes (A)
imposed on the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (B) of any member of an
affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group of which any of the
Company was a member on or prior to the Closing Date, pursuant to U.S.
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any comparable provision under state,
local or non-U.S. Law), to the extent the Company is liable for the Taxes of a
Person other than the Company, and (C) for which the Company is
liable pursuant to any tax sharing agreement in effect immediately prior to
the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller shall not be liable for, and
shall not indemnify Purchaser for any Taxes resulting from transactions or
actions taken by Purchaser or the Company on the Closing Date that are taken
after the Closing, except for transactions or actions undertaken in the
ordinary course of business on the Closing Date (any such Taxes, other than
Taxes with respect to transactions undertaken in the ordinary course of
business on the Closing Date, a " _Closing Date Tax_ ").

(ii) Purchaser shall be responsible for, and shall indemnify and hold the
Seller and its Affiliates harmless against (A) any Liability for Taxes imposed
on the Company for any taxable period beginning after the Closing Date and for
the portion of any Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date, (B) any
Closing Date Tax and (C) any Transfer Taxes.

(iii) In the case of Taxes that are payable with respect to any Straddle
Period, such Taxes shall be apportioned between the period deemed to end on
the Closing Date and the period deemed to begin on the day following the
Closing Date as follows: (A) in the case of Taxes other than medical device
excise tax, income, sales and use and withholding Taxes, on a per diem basis,
and (B) in the case of medical device excise tax, income, sales and use and
withholding Taxes, as determined from the books and records of the Company as
though the taxable year of the Company terminated at the close of business on
the Closing Date.

 



39 (iv) All payments required to be made pursuant to this Section 5.13(a)
shall be made within thirty (30) days after such payment is requested in
writing by the Party to whom such payment is to be made.

(b)  _Tax Returns_.

(i) Seller shall have the exclusive obligation and authority to prepare and
file or cause to be prepared and filed all Tax Returns relating to the
Company for any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date.

 

(ii) Purchaser shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and timely file, or
cause to be timely filed, all required Tax Returns relating to the Company
for all taxable periods other than those for which Seller is responsible
pursuant to Section 5.13(b)(i); _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to
any such Tax Returns for a Straddle Period, Purchaser shall prepare such Tax
Returns and make any elections with respect to Tax Returns for Straddle
Periods in a manner consistent with prior practice of the Company. Before
filing any such Tax Return with respect to any such Straddle Period, Purchaser
shall provide Seller with a copy of such Tax Return, work papers and other
documentation relevant to the preparation of such Tax Returns at least sixty
(60) days (fifteen (15) days in the case of a Tax Return other than an annual
income Tax Return) prior to the last date for timely filing such Tax Return
(giving effect to any valid extensions thereof) accompanied by a statement
calculating in reasonable detail Sellers indemnification obligation, if any,
pursuant to Section 5.13(a). If Seller agrees with Purchasers preparation of
such Tax Returns, Seller shall provide written notice of its consent to
Purchaser no later than thirty (30) days (ten (10) days in the case of a Tax
Return other than an annual income Tax Return) prior to the last date for
timely filing such Tax Return (giving effect to any valid extensions thereof
and provided Seller has timely received from Purchaser the information
required by the immediately preceding sentence) and Purchaser may file such
Tax Returns as prepared. If Seller agrees with Purchasers calculation of
Sellers indemnification obligation, Seller shall pay to Purchaser the amount
requested by Purchaser at the time specified in Section 5.13(a)(iv). If
Seller does not agree with Purchasers preparation of such Tax Return and/or
the calculation of Sellers indemnification obligation, Seller shall notify
Purchaser of its disagreement within thirty (30) days (ten (10) days in the
case of Tax Return other than an annual Tax Return) of receiving a copy of
such Tax Return and Purchasers calculation. The Parties shall act in good
faith to resolve such dispute. If the Parties cannot resolve such dispute,
such dispute shall be resolved in accordance with Section 5.13(f). If the
dispute cannot be resolved before the due date of the Tax Return (taking into
account extensions) the Purchaser may file the Tax Return in the manner that
it determines and then file an amended Tax Return if necessary when the
dispute is resolved that reflects the resolution of the dispute.

 



40 (c) _Tax Refunds_.

 

(i) Any refunds or credits of Taxes of the Company plus any interest received
with respect thereto from the applicable Taxing Authority attributable to any
Pre-Closing Tax Period shall (net of any Tax cost to Purchaser, the Company or
their Affiliates of the receipt of such refund or credit) be paid by Purchaser
or the Company to Seller within ten (10) Business Days after the Company
receives such refund or claims such credit. Any refunds or credits of Taxes of
the Company for any Straddle Period shall be apportioned in the same manner as
the liability for such Taxes is apportioned pursuant to Section 5.13(a)(iii).

(ii) Except as required by applicable Law, the Company shall not, without the
prior written consent of Seller, not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned, make or change any Tax election or amend, refile or otherwise
modify (or grant an extension of any applicable statute of limitations with
respect to) any Separate Company Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period.

(d) _Procedures Relating to Tax Indemnification_.

 

(i) If Purchaser or the Company receives notice or other communication from a
Taxing Authority of a pending audit or other proceeding relating to the Tax
liability of the Company with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or if Seller
receives notice or other communication from a Taxing Authority of a pending
audit or other proceeding relating to the Tax Liability of the Company with
respect to a Post-Closing Tax Period, then the party receiving the notice
shall notify the other party in writing of such notice. If a written claim for
Taxes shall be made by any Taxing Authority, which, if successful, might
reasonably result in a payment to Purchaser pursuant to Section 5.13(a)(i) or
a payment to Seller pursuant to Section 5.13(a)(2) (a " _Tax Claim_ "), then
the party receiving such Tax Claim shall forward a copy of such Tax Claim to
the other party within ten (10) business days of receipt of such Tax Claim.
If either party fails to forward a copy of such Tax Claim within such period,
the other party shall not be liable to the party that failed to provide a copy
of such Tax Claim to the extent that their position is materially prejudiced
as a result thereof.

(ii) Except as provided in Section 5.13(d)(iv), Seller shall have the
exclusive authority to control any audit or examination by any Taxing
Authority, initiate any claim for refund, amend any Tax Return, and contest,
resolve and defend against any assessment for Taxes, notice of Tax deficiency
or other adjustment of Taxes of or relating to the Company for Taxes for any
Pre-Closing Tax Period. In the event that any such adjustment may have a
material adverse effect on the Tax liability of the Purchaser or the Company
(the " _Affected Party_ ") for a Post-Closing Tax Period the Seller (i) shall
give the Affected Party written notice of any such adjustment, (ii) keep the
Affected Party fully advised on the progress of such Tax Claim, and (iii)
shall not settle or otherwise compromise such proceeding in a manner that
would bind an Affected Party for any Post-Closing Tax Period without the prior
written consent of the Affected Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



41 (iii) The Parties shall cooperate with each other or their designee in
contesting any Tax Claim, which cooperation shall include (i) the retention
of (for the period described in Section 5.13(g)) and (upon either Partys or
its designees request) providing reasonable access to the other Party, its
designee and/or its representative to, records and information which are
relevant to such Tax Claim and (ii) making employees available, at reasonable
times and without unnecessary interference with business operations, to
provide additional information or explanation of any material provided
hereunder or to testify at proceedings relating to such Tax Claim.

(iv) With respect to any Tax Claim relating to a Straddle Period, the Party
which would bear the burden of the greater portion of the Tax Liability shall
control such Tax Claim, provided, however, that (i) the controlling party
shall keep the noncontrolling party fully advised of the progress of such Tax
Claim, (ii) the non-controlling party may participate, at its sole expense, in
all proceedings relating to such Tax Claim and (iii) the controlling party
shall not settle or compromise such Tax Claim without the noncontrolling
partys written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed).

 

(e) _Transfer Taxes_. All Transfer Taxes shall be borne by Purchaser. The
Party that is legally required to file Tax Returns and pay the Tax with
respect to all such Transfer Taxes shall, at its own expense, file all such
necessary Tax Returns with respect to all such Transfer Taxes, and, to the
extent required by applicable Law, the non-filing party shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns. To the
extent Seller files such Transfer Tax Returns and pays such Transfer Taxes,
Purchaser shall, within ten (10) business days of a written request therefor,
reimburse Seller for all such Transfer Taxes and Sellers out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in connection with the preparation and filing of such Tax
Returns.

 

(f) _Tax Dispute Resolution Mechanism_. The Parties shall cooperate in good
faith to resolve any dispute relating to Section 5.13 or any Tax matters;
however, if the Parties are unable to resolve such dispute, the Parties shall
submit the dispute to a nationally recognized accounting firm selected by
mutual agreement of Purchaser and Seller who is independent with respect to
each Party (the " _Settlement Accountants_ "), for resolution, which
resolution shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties. The fees and
expenses relating to any dispute as to the amount of Taxes owed by either of
the Parties shall be paid by Purchaser and Seller in proportion to each
Partys respective liability for the portion of the Taxes in dispute, as
determined by the Settlement Accountants.

 



42 (g) _Cooperation, Exchange of Information and Record Retention_. Each of the
Parties recognizes that the other Party and its Affiliates will need access,
from time to time, after the Closing Date, to certain accounting and Tax
records and information regarding Tax matters of the Company to the extent
such records and information pertain to events occurring on or prior to the
Closing Date; therefore, from and after the Closing Date, Seller and Purchaser
shall, and Seller and Purchaser shall cause their Affiliates (including, in
the case of the Purchaser, the Company) to (i) retain and maintain all
records, including all Tax Returns, schedules and work papers, books, records
and other documents in its or their possession relating to Tax matters of the
Company for each taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date and
for any Straddle Period until expiration of the statute of limitations of the
taxable periods to which such Tax Returns and other documents relate (giving
effect to any valid extensions), (ii) allow the other Party (as appropriate)
and its agents and representatives (and agents or representatives of any
Affiliates), upon reasonable notice and at mutually convenient times, to
inspect, review and make copies of such records (at the expense of the Party
or Parties requesting the records) as such Party or Parties may deem
reasonably necessary or appropriate from time to time, and (iii) use
reasonable best efforts to obtain Tax Returns, schedules and work papers,
books, records and other documents and provide additional facts, insights or
views as reasonably requested by the other Party or Parties, in each case,
that may be necessary or helpful in connection with any Tax Returns or Tax
Claims of the Company. Purchaser shall cause the Company to provide Seller
with written notice ninety (90) days prior to transferring, destroying or
discarding the last copy of any records, books, work papers, reports,
correspondence and other similar materials, and Seller shall have the right,
at their expense, to copy or take any such materials. Any information
obtained under this Section 5.13(g) shall be kept confidential except as may
be otherwise necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or claims
for refund or in conducting an audit or other proceeding.

(h) _Characterization of Indemnification Payments_. Unless otherwise required
by Law, any payment made pursuant to this Section 5.13 or Article VIII shall
be treated for all Tax purposes as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

(i)  _Tax Benefits_. Any indemnity payments made between the Parties pursuant
to Section 5.13(a) shall be made net of any Tax Benefit available to the
indemnified Party (including, with respect to Purchaser, the Company) that
results from the loss giving rise to such indemnity payments. For purposes of
determining the amount of any such Tax Benefit, the recipient of the Tax
Benefit shall be deemed to pay Tax at the highest U.S. federal income tax
corporate marginal rate in effect in the year such indemnifiable loss is
incurred and shall be deemed to realize or utilize any Tax Benefit in the
first taxable year that such Tax Benefit may be realized or utilized under
applicable Law, regardless of whether such Tax Benefit is actually utilized.
If a Tax Benefit resulting from an indemnifiable loss is available in multiple
Tax years, the amount of such Tax Benefit for purposes of this Section 5.13(i)
shall be the net present value of all of such available Tax
Benefits, calculated by using a discount rate equal to the long-term
applicable federal rate for the month in which such indemnifiable loss is
incurred (it being understood that for purposes of this Section 5.13(i) any
Tax Benefit in the form of a basis increase shall be considered realized or
utilized only as such basis is depreciated or amortized or the property to
which the basis increase is attached is actually sold or disposed of in a
taxable transaction prior to the time the indemnity payment is calculated).
Any dispute with respect to the calculation of a Tax Benefit which the parties
cannot resolve in good faith shall be resolved in accordance with Section
5.13(f).

 



43 (j) _Survival of Tax Provisions_. Any claim to be made pursuant to this
Section 5.13 must be made before the expiration of the applicable statutes of
limitations plus thirty (30) days (giving effect to any valid extensions)
relating to the Taxes at issue.

 

(k) _Section 338 Election_. Purchaser shall not make an election under
Section 338 of the Code with respect to the purchase of the shares of the
Company. Purchaser shall indemnify and hold Seller harmless for any increase
in Sellers liability for Taxes which results from the failure of Purchaser to
satisfy its obligations under this Section 5.13(k).

 

(l) _Carrybacks_. Neither the Purchaser nor the Company shall carry back any
net operating loss or other tax attribute from a taxable period beginning
after the Closing Date to a Pre-Closing Tax Period.

(m) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. All tax sharing agreements or similar
agreements with respect to or involving the Company shall be terminated as of
the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, the Company shall not be bound
thereby or have any liability thereunder.

 

(n) _Exclusivity_. Except with respect to claims pursuant to Section 8.1 with
respect to breaches of the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 3.15, Section 5.13 shall govern all matters, including the retention
of records and all indemnification claims, with respect to Taxes.

 

Section 5.14 _Asset Transfers; Certain Information_.

 

(a) On or prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall cause the Company to
transfer and assign to Covidien LP or another designated Affiliate the assets
set forth on _Schedule 5.14(a)_ , free and clear of all Liens, pursuant to
bills of sale or other transfer documents reasonably acceptable to Purchaser

of or related to such assets, whether actual or contingent, matured or
unmatured, known or unknown.

(b) On or prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall cause Covidien LP and each
other applicable Affiliate of Seller to transfer and assign to the Company the
assets set forth on _Schedule 5.14(b)_ , and any books and records primarily

44 (c) On or prior to the Closing Date, and subject to receipt of any applicable
consents set forth in _Schedule 3.4_ , Seller shall cause each of its
Affiliates that is party to any Assigned Contract to transfer and assign to
the Company (or Purchaser or an Affiliate thereof, if requested by Purchaser)
all rights of such Affiliate under such Assigned Contract, and such assignee
shall assume all obligations and Liabilities thereunder whether arising prior
to, on or after the Closing Date, pursuant to assignment and assumption
agreements reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and Seller;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that with respect to each Assigned Contract identified on
_Schedule 3.11_ as including products other than Company Products, only the
rights and obligations under such Assigned Contracts related to
Company Products will be assigned and assumed. On or prior to the Closing
Date, Seller shall cause the Company to transfer and assign to Seller or an
Affiliate thereof (other than the Company) all rights of the Company under the
Material Contracts set forth in _Schedule 3.11_ that are designated for such
assignment from the Company, and such assignee shall assume all obligations
and Liabilities thereunder whether arising prior to, on or after the Closing
Date, pursuant to assignment and assumption agreements reasonably acceptable
to Purchaser and Seller. To the extent any Assigned Contract may not be
transferred and assigned to the Company (or Purchaser or an Affiliate thereof
as requested by Purchaser) on or prior to the Closing Date by reason of the
absence of receipt of an applicable consent set forth in Schedule 3.4, Seller
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any such consent after the
Closing Date and the Parties shall, pending the receipt of such consent,
enter into a commercially reasonable alternative arrangement with respect
thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Seller or any of its
Affiliates be required to make any payment or incur any other out-of-pocket
expenses to obtain any such consent or provide any such alternative
arrangement.

(d) On or prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall cause Covidien LLC
to assign to the Purchaser (or an Affiliate of Purchaser authorized to hold
such Permit) each U.S. 510(k) clearance and U.S. premarket approval for the
Company Products, and each authorization to affix the CE Mark to Company
Products, pursuant to assignment letters reasonably acceptable to Purchaser.

(e) Within five Business Days after Purchaser notifies Seller that Purchaser
is prepared to receive such information, Seller shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, provide to Purchaser the information with respect to the
Business set forth in _Schedule 5.14(e)_.

 

(f) Each Party shall upon request furnish to the other Party such further
information, execute and deliver to any other Party such other documents, and
do such other acts and things, including filing any forms, notifications or
reports with Governmental Authorities, in each case as such requesting Party
may reasonably request for the purpose of carrying out this Section 5.14
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, at the expense of
the Party making such request.

Section 5.15 _Accounts Receivable; Accounts Payable_.

(a) Notwithstanding any provisions herein to the contrary, Seller and its
Affiliates shall retain all rights with respect to Accounts Receivable that
arise from the conduct of the Business prior to the Effective Time. To the
extent that any amounts with respect to Accounts Receivable that arise from
the conduct of the Business prior to the Effective Time are received by

Purchaser or such Affiliate shall remit to Seller such amounts within thirty

received by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates after the Effective Time,
Purchaser or such Affiliate shall reject and dispute such invoice or document
and refer the provider thereof to Sellers designated contact, and Seller
shall be responsible therefor. If any invoice or similar document for Accounts
Payable that arises from the conduct of the Business after the Effective Time
is received by Seller or any of its Affiliates after the Effective Time,
Seller or such Affiliate shall reject and dispute such invoice or document
and refer the provider thereof to Purchasers designated contact, and
Purchaser shall be responsible therefor.

 

Section 5.16 _Certain Intellectual Property Matters_.

 

(a) Seller shall be responsible for, and shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Company, Purchaser and its Affiliates from, and reimburse them for, all
amounts payable by the Company under the Technology Transfer and License
Agreement, dated as of August 11, 2009, between Nektar Therapeutics and the
Company for the "Milestone" payments set forth in Exhibit A of such Agreement
(including Milestones 3, 4 and 5).

(b) Effective as of the Closing, Seller, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates, hereby grants to Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the
Company) an irrevocable covenant not to sue on any Intellectual Property to
which Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Company) owns rights as of the

termination of employment of any person from) the Seller or any of its
Affiliates or any predecessors of the Seller or any of its Affiliates, except
in either case to the extent such Losses (1) relate solely to periods of
employment with Purchaser and its Affiliates from and after the Closing Date
or the termination of employment from Purchaser or its Affiliates after the
Closing Date, or (2) are expressly to be transferred to or assumed by
Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement or (C) any Plan(s) (other than a Benefit

liability (whether actual or contingent);

(v) any matter set forth in Schedule 8.1(a)(v).

 

(b) Purchaser shall and shall cause its Affiliates to use commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate any Loss.

 

Section 8.2 _Indemnification by Purchaser_. (a) From and after the Closing,
subject to the provisions of this Article VIII, Purchaser agrees to defend,
indemnify and hold harmless Seller, its Affiliates and their respective
Representatives, successors and assigns from and against any and all Losses
arising from (i) any breach by Purchaser of any of its covenants
or agreements contained in this Agreement (excluding those set forth in
Section 5.13, which are to be addressed exclusively in the manner set forth
therein), (ii) any breach by Purchaser of its representations and warranties
set forth in Article IV (it being agreed that qualifications as to
materiality in any such representation or warranty shall be taken into account
in determining whether there has been a breach of such representation or
warranty but not in calculating the amount of any related Losses) or (iii)
except to the extent (A) Seller is obligated to defend, indemnify and hold
harmless the Purchaser Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 8.1 or as
otherwise provided herein or (B) Affiliates of Sellers are obligated to
indemnify Purchaser, its Affiliates or other indemnified parties pursuant to
the Ancillary Agreements, the conduct of the Business prior to, on or after
the Closing Date.

 

(b) Seller shall and shall cause its Affiliates to use commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate any Loss.

 



49 Section 8.3 _Indemnification Procedure_. (a) Promptly after the incurrence of
any Losses by any Person entitled to indemnification pursuant to Sections 8.1
or 8.2 (an " _Indemnified Party_ "), including any claim by a third party
described in Section 8.4, that might give rise to indemnification hereunder,
the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Party from which indemnification
is sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") a certificate (the " _Certificate_
"), which Certificate shall:

 

(i) state that the Indemnified Party has paid or suffered or anticipates it
will incur or suffer Losses for which such Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Agreement, and

(ii) specify in reasonable detail (and have annexed thereto as applicable
reasonable supporting documentation) each individual item of Loss included in
the amount so stated, if applicable, the date such item was paid or accrued,
the basis for any anticipated liability or other Losses and the nature of the
misrepresentation, breach of warranty, breach of covenant or claim to which
each such item is related and the computation of the amount to which such
Indemnified Party claims to be entitled hereunder.

 

The failure of any Indemnified Party to give timely notice under this _Section
8.3(a)_ shall not affect its rights to indemnification, except to the extent
that the Indemnifying Party demonstrates actual damage caused by such failure.

(b) In the event that the Indemnifying Party shall object to the
indemnification of an Indemnified Party in respect of any claim or claims
specified in any Certificate, the Indemnifying Party shall, within thirty (30)
days after receipt by the Indemnifying Party of such Certificate, deliver
to the Indemnified Party a notice of objection to such effect, specifying in
reasonable detail the basis for such objection, and the Indemnifying Party and
the Indemnified Party shall, within the sixty (60) day period beginning on the
date of receipt by the Indemnified Party of such objection, attempt to agree
upon the rights of the respective Parties with respect to each of such claims
to which the Indemnifying Party shall have so objected. If the Indemnified
Party and the Indemnifying Party shall succeed in reaching agreement on their
respective rights with respect to any of such claims, the Indemnified Party
and the Indemnifying Party shall promptly prepare and sign a memorandum
setting forth such agreement. Should the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party be unable to agree as to any particular item or items or
amount or amounts within such time period, then either the Indemnified Party
or the Indemnifying Party may submit such dispute to a court of competent
jurisdiction as set forth in Section 10.10.

(c) Claims for Losses specified in any Certificate to which an
Indemnifying Party shall not object in writing within thirty (30) days of
receipt of such Certificate, claims for Losses covered by a memorandum of
agreement of the nature described in Section 8.3(b), and claims for Losses the
validity and amount of which have been the subject of judicial determination
as described in Section 8.3(b), or shall have been settled with the consent of
the Indemnifying Party as described in Section 8.4, are hereinafter referred
to, collectively, as " _Agreed Claims_." Within ten (10) Business Days of the
determination of the amount of any Agreed Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall
pay to the Indemnified Party an amount equal to the Agreed Claim by wire
transfer in immediately available funds to the bank account or accounts
designated by the Indemnified Party in a notice to the Indemnifying Party not
less than two (2) Business Days prior to such payment.

 



50 Section 8.4 _Third-Party Claims_. (a) If a claim by a third party is made
against any Indemnified Party with respect to which the Indemnified Party
intends to seek indemnification hereunder for any Loss under this Article VIII
or under any other section or provision hereof (other than a claim with
respect to Taxes, the procedures for which are covered exclusively in Section
5.13), the Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party of
such claim. The failure of any Indemnified Party to give timely notice under
this Section 8.4 shall not affect its rights to indemnification, except to
the extent that the Indemnifying Party demonstrates actual damage caused by
such failure. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to conduct and control, through counsel of its choosing, any
third party claim, action, suit or proceeding, (a " _Third-Party Claim_ "),
other than Specified Third-Party Claims, which right the Indemnifying Party
shall exercise by written notice to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30)
days of having been notified of any Third-Party Claim, and the Indemnifying
Party may compromise or settle any Third-Party Claim other than Specified
Third-Party Claims, the defense of which it chooses to conduct and control; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall give the
Indemnified Party advance notice of any proposed compromise or settlement and
may not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, settle or
compromise any such Third-Party Claim, except that the Indemnifying Party may
settle or compromise a Third-Party Claim relating solely to money damages if
the Indemnified Party is provided an unconditional release from liability. No
Indemnified Party may compromise or settle any Third-Party Claim for which it
is seeking indemnification hereunder without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, and, if the Indemnified Party does so, the
Indemnified Party will have no right to any indemnification hereunder with
respect to such Third-Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall permit the
Indemnified Party to participate in, but not control, the defense of any such
action or suit controlled by the Indemnifying Party through counsel chosen by
the Indemnified Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that the fees and expenses of
such counsel shall be borne by the Indemnified Party. If the
Indemnifying Party elects not to control or conduct the defense of a Third-
Party Claim that it is entitled to so control or conduct pursuant to this
Section 8.4(a), the Indemnifying Party nevertheless shall have the right to
participate in, but not control, the defense of such Third-Party Claim and,
at its own expense, to employ counsel of its own choosing for such purpose. "
_Specified Third-Party Claim_ " means any Third-Party Claim by the FDA
or non-United States equivalent agencies.

(b) The Parties shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution of any Third-
Party Claim, with such cooperation to include (i) the retention and the
provision of any records and information that are reasonably relevant to such
Third-Party Claim and (ii) the making available of employees on a mutually
convenient basis for providing additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder.

 



51 Section 8.5 _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. All representations
and warranties made herein by the Parties in Articles III and IV (other than
(x) the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 and
3.21 (the " _Fundamental Representations_ "), which shall survive
indefinitely, (y) the representations and warranties in the first sentence of
Section 3.9(d) and in Section 3.12, which shall terminate and expire on the
date that is eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date and (z) the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.15, which shall
terminate and expire on the date that is thirty-six (36) months after the
Closing Date), all covenants made by any of the Parties to this Agreement
which by their nature are to be performed prior to the Closing, and all
indemnification obligations under Sections 8.1(a) and 8.2(a) with respect
thereto, shall terminate and expire on the date which is twelve (12) months
after the Closing Date, and no action or proceeding seeking damages or other
relief for breach of any thereof or for any misrepresentation or inaccuracy
with respect thereto shall be commenced after, the applicable date of
expiration set forth in this Section 8.5, unless prior to such date a claim
for indemnification with respect thereto shall have been made, with reasonable
specificity, by delivery of a Certificate in accordance with Section 8.3.

 

Section 8.6 _Certain Limitations_.

 

(a) Except with respect to breaches of the Fundamental Representations, Seller
shall not have any indemnification obligations under Section 8.1(a)(ii)
unless and until the aggregate amount of all indemnifiable Losses suffered by
Purchaser Indemnified Parties for which Purchaser Indemnified Parties would be
entitled to indemnification exceeds One Million Seven Hundred Sixty-Two
Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($1,762,500) (the " _Threshold_ "), whereupon,
provided the other requirements of this Article VIII have been complied with,
Seller shall indemnify and hold the Purchaser Indemnified Parties harmless
for the amount of such indemnifiable Losses which exceed the Threshold, as
herein provided; except that, the aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses
recoverable under Section 8.1(a)(ii), except with respect to breaches of
the Fundamental Representations, by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall
be limited to Forty-Seven Million Dollars ($47,000,000) and the aggregate
amount of indemnifiable Losses recoverable under Section 8.1(a)(ii), including
with respect to breaches of the Fundamental Representations, by the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties shall be limited to the Purchase Price.

(b) Except with respect to breaches of the representations and warranties set
forth in Section 4.1, 4.2, 4.5, 4.9 and 4.10 (the " _Fundamental Purchaser
Representations_ "), Purchaser shall not have any indemnification
obligations under Section 8.2(a)(ii) unless and until the aggregate amount of
all indemnifiable Losses suffered by Seller Indemnified Parties for which
Seller Indemnified Parties would be entitled to indemnification exceeds One
Million Seven Hundred Sixty-Two Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($1,762,5000)
(the " _Purchaser Threshold_ "), whereupon, provided the other requirements of
this Article VIII have been complied with, Purchaser shall indemnify and hold
the Seller Indemnified Parties harmless for the amount of such indemnifiable
Losses which exceed the Purchaser Threshold, as herein provided; except that,
the aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses recoverable under Section
8.2(a)(ii), except with respect to breaches of Fundamental Purchaser
Representations, by the Seller Indemnified Parties shall be limited to Forty-
Seven Million Dollars ($47,000,000) and the aggregate amount of indemnifiable
Losses recoverable under Section 8.2(a)(ii), including with respect to
breaches of Fundamental Purchaser Representations, by the Seller Indemnified
Parties shall be limited to the Purchase Price.

 



52 Section 8.7 _Losses Net of Insurance_. The amount of any Loss for which
indemnification is provided under Section 8.1 or 8.2 shall be net of any (i)
insurance proceeds actually received by the Indemnified Party (a " _Collateral
Source_ ") and (ii) Tax Benefit actually realized by such Indemnified Party
(in an amount determined pursuant to Section 5.13(i)), if any, attributable
to such Loss. The Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to recover insurance proceeds in respect of such Loss if available, but in no
event shall an Indemnified Party be required to bring a lawsuit or
arbitration proceeding to do so. If the amount to be netted hereunder in
connection with a Collateral Source from any payment required under Sections
8.1 or 8.2 is determined after payment by the Indemnifying Party of any
amount otherwise required to be paid to an Indemnified Party pursuant to this
Article VIII, the Indemnified Party shall repay to the Indemnifying Party,
promptly after such determination, any amount that the Indemnifying Party
would not have had to pay pursuant to this Article VIII had such determination
been made at the time of such payment.

 

Section 8.8 _Sole Remedy/Waiver_. (i) The Parties acknowledge and agree that,
effective upon the occurrence of the Closing, except in the case of fraud,
the remedies provided for in this Agreement shall be the Parties sole and
exclusive remedy for any misrepresentations, breach of warranties or breach of
covenants contained in this Agreement or any claim arising out of, relating
to or based upon this Agreement, the Shares, the Company or the transactions
contemplated hereby and (ii) in furtherance of the foregoing, the Parties
hereby waive, effective upon the occurrence of the Closing, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any and all other rights, claims
and causes of action (including rights of contribution, if any), whether at
law or in equity, known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, which exist or may
arise in the future, that they may have against Seller, its Affiliates or any
of their representatives, or Purchaser, its Affiliates or any of its or their
representatives, as the case may be, arising out of, relating to or based upon
this Agreement, the Shares, the Company, the Business, the transactions
contemplated hereby or any Law for any misrepresentations or breach of
warranties or breach of covenants contained in this Agreement, _provided_ ,
_however_ , the Parties agree that irreparable damage may occur in the event
any provision of this Agreement was not performed in accordance with the terms
hereof and that the Parties shall be entitled to seek specific performance of
the terms hereof, injunctive relief and any other equitable remedy.

giving written notice of such termination to the other Party, if the Closing
shall not have occurred on or prior to January 31, 2014 (unless the failure to

obligations under this Agreement),

court of competent jurisdiction or other competent Governmental Authority

any of its covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement to the extent
that any such failure would cause the failure of the condition set forth in

termination shall be without prejudice to, and shall not affect, any and all
rights to damages that the other Party may have hereunder or otherwise under
applicable Law.

agrees that the prohibition in the Confidentiality Agreement restricting

signed, in the case of an amendment, by Purchaser and Seller or, in the case
of a waiver, by the Party against whom the waiver is to be effective. No

rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent
of the other Party.

Section 10.4 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including all Schedules

Section 10.5  _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall inure to the
benefit of and be binding upon the Parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended
to confer upon any Person other than Purchaser, Seller or their successors or

_provided_ , _however_ , that Affiliates of Purchaser shall be third party
beneficiaries of the obligations of Seller set forth in Section 8.1, and
Affiliates of Seller shall be third party beneficiaries of the obligations of
Purchaser set forth in Section 8.2.

reimburse the Company for, any such unpaid costs and expenses incurred or
agreed to by the Company prior to Closing.

Article III or IV shall not be deemed to be a disclosure to any other
Schedule in Article III or IV, except to the extent such deemed disclosure

Agreement, the rights of the Parties and all Proceedings arising in whole or
in part under or in connection herewith shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the
conflicts of law principles of such state that might apply the law of another
jurisdiction.

(b) With respect to any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement
(each, a " _Proceeding_ "), each Party irrevocably (i) agrees and consents to
be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court
for the District of Delaware or any Delaware State court sitting in the City
of Wilmington and (ii) waives any objection which it may have at any time to
the laying of venue of any Proceeding brought in any such court, waives any
claim that such Proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient forum and
further waives the right to object, with respect to such Proceeding, that such
court does not have any jurisdiction over such Party. The foregoing consent to
jurisdiction shall not constitute general consent to service of process in
the State of Delaware for any purpose except as provided above and shall not
be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than the respective Parties to
this Agreement. Each of Seller and Purchaser irrevocably agrees that service
of any process, summons, notice or document by United States registered mail
to such Partys address set forth above shall be effective service of process
for any action, suit or proceeding in Delaware with respect to any matters for
which it has submitted to jurisdiction pursuant to this Section 10.10(b).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party may commence any Proceeding in any
court other than the above-named courts solely for the purpose of enforcing an
order or judgment issued by any of the above-named courts.

(c) _PURCHASER_ AND _SELLER_ HEREBY WAIVE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE  _LAW_ , ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY LITIGATION AS BETWEEN THE _PARTIES_ DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF,

HEREBY OR DISPUTES RELATING HERETO. _PURCHASER_ AND _SELLER_ (I) CERTIFY THAT

EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER _PARTY_ WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT
OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (II) ACKNOWLEDGE THAT
IT AND THE OTHER _PARTY_ HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS _AGREEMENT_ BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION
10.10(c). 

 



57 Section 10.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which
shall constitute one and the same agreement, and shall become effective when
one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered
to the other Party, it being understood that all Parties need not sign the
same counterpart.

Section 10.12 _Headings_. The heading references herein and the table of
contents hereto are for convenience purposes only, do not constitute a part of
this Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or affect any of the
provisions hereof.

 

Section 10.13 _No Strict Construction_. The Parties have participated jointly
in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event any ambiguity
or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be
construed as if drafted jointly by all Parties and no presumption or burden of
proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of
the authorship of any provision of this Agreement.

Section 10.14 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be
deemed severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision

hereof. If any term or other provision of this Agreement, or the application
thereof to any Person or any circumstance, is invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted
therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the
intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable provision and (b) the
remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to other
Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity, illegality
or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity, illegality
