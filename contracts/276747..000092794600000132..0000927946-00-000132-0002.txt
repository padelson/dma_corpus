                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

     AGREEMENT  AND  PLAN  OF  MERGER,   dated  as  of  October  2,  2000  (this
"Agreement"), by and among Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company a Delaware
corporation,  Barbados  Acquisition,  Inc. an Indiana  corporation  and a wholly
owned Subsidiary of Parent ("Barbados Acquisition" or "Merger Sub") and Robinson
Nugent, Inc. (the "Company"), an Indiana corporation.

                              W I T N E S S E T H:

     WHEREAS,  the respective Boards of Directors of Parent,  Merger Sub and the
Company  have each  determined  that the  merger of Merger Sub with and into the
Company (the "Merger") upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this  Agreement is  advisable,  and in the best  interests  of their  respective
corporations and stockholders and have approved the Merger;

     WHEREAS,  it is intended that, for federal income tax purposes,  the Merger
will  qualify as a tax-free  reorganization  under  Section 368 of the  Internal
Revenue  Code of 1986,  as amended,  and the rules and  regulations  promulgated
thereunder (the "Code");

     WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
as a condition and inducement to Parent's and Merger Sub's  willingness to enter
into this  Agreement,  Parent  and the  stockholders  of the  Company  listed on
Exhibit A have  executed and  delivered a Voting and Stock  Option  Agreement (a
"Stock  Option  Agreement"),  dated as of this  date,  pursuant  to which  those
stockholders have agreed to vote in favor of the Merger and, among other things,
are granting to Parent an option to purchase,  under certain circumstances,  all
of the common shares, no par value, of the Company (the "Company Common Shares")
beneficially owned by them, with an exercise price of $19.00 per share.

     NOW, THEREFORE,  in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants
and agreements  contained in this  Agreement,  and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties agree as follows (certain  capitalized terms used herein are
defined in Section 9.3):

                                    ARTICLE I

     Section 1.1 The Merger.  At the Effective  Time and subject to and upon the
terms and  conditions  of this  Agreement  and in  accordance  with the  Indiana
Business Corporation Law ("IBCL"),  Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company and the separate  corporate  existence  of Merger Sub shall  cease.  The
Company shall continue as the surviving  corporation  (sometimes  referred to as
the "Surviving  Corporation")  in the Merger.  The Merger shall have the effects
specified in Section 23-1-40-6 of the IBCL.


<PAGE>

     Section 1.2 The Closing; Effective Time. (a) The closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") shall take place (i) at the offices of Parent,  3M Center,  St. Paul,
MN 55133 at 10:00 A.M. local time, on the second business day following the date
on which  the last to be  satisfied  or waived  of the  conditions  set forth in
Article  VII  (other  than  those  conditions  that by  their  nature  are to be
satisfied at the Closing,  but subject to the  satisfaction or, where permitted,
waiver of those conditions) shall be satisfied or waived in accordance with this
Agreement  or (ii) at such other  place,  time  and/or  date as the  Company and
Parent shall agree (the date of the Closing, the "Closing Date").

     (b) On the Closing Date, the Company and Merger Sub shall cause articles of
merger in  respect  of the  Merger to be  properly  executed  and filed with the
Secretary  of State of the State of Indiana as provided in Section  23-1-40-5 of
the IBCL.  The Merger shall become  effective at such time at which the articles
of merger shall be duly filed with the  Secretary of State of Indiana or at such
later time reflected in the articles of merger as shall be agreed by the Company
and Parent (the time that the Merger becomes effective, the "Effective Time").

     Section 1.3 Subsequent  Actions.  If, at any time after the Effective Time,
the Surviving  Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of
sale,  assignments,  assurances  or any other actions or things are necessary or
desirable  to  continue,  vest,  perfect or confirm of record or  otherwise  the
Surviving  Corporation's  right,  title or  interest  in, to or under any of the
rights,  properties,   privileges,   franchises  or  assets  of  either  of  its
constituent corporations acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation
as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger, or otherwise to carry out the
intent  of  this  Agreement,   the  officers  and  directors  of  the  Surviving
Corporation  shall be  authorized  to execute  and  deliver,  in the name and on
behalf of either of the constituent  corporations of the Merger, all such deeds,
bills of sale, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in the name and on
behalf of each of such  corporations  or  otherwise,  all such other actions and
things as may be necessary or desirable to vest,  perfect or confirm any and all
right, title and interest in, to and under such rights, properties,  privileges,
franchises or assets in the Surviving  Corporation or otherwise to carry out the
intent of this Agreement.

     Section 1.4 Articles of  Incorporation;  Bylaws;  Directors and Officers of
the Surviving Corporation. Unless otherwise agreed by Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company prior to the Closing, at the Effective Time:



                                      - 2 -
<PAGE>

     (a) The Articles of Incorporation of the Company (the "Company  Articles of
Incorporation")  shall be amended at the  Effective  Time to read in the form of
Exhibit B and,  as so  amended,  such  Articles  of  Incorporation  shall be the
Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving  Corporation until thereafter changed
or amended as provided therein or by applicable law;

     (b) The  bylaws  of the  Company  as in  effect  immediately  prior  to the
Effective  Time  shall be at and after the  Effective  Time  (until  amended  as
provided by law, the Company  Certificate of Incorporation and the bylaws of the
Company, as applicable) the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation;

     (c) The  officers of Merger Sub  immediately  prior to the  Effective  Time
shall continue to serve in their respective offices of the Surviving Corporation
from and after the  Effective  Time,  until  their  successors  are  elected  or
appointed and qualified or until their resignation or removal; and

     (d) The directors of Merger Sub  immediately  prior to the  Effective  Time
shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation from and after the Effective
Time,  until their  successors  are elected or appointed  and qualified or until
their resignation or removal.

                                   ARTICLE II

     Section  2.1  Effect  of  the  Merger  on  Capital  Stock;   Conversion  of
Securities.  At the  Effective  Time,  by virtue of the Merger and  without  any
action on the part of any holder of any capital stock of the Company, Merger Sub
or Parent:

     (a)  Cancellation  of Certain  Company Common  Shares.  Each Company Common
Share that is owned by the  Company as  treasury  stock and all  Company  Common
Shares that are owned by Parent shall be canceled and shall cease to exist,  and
no stock of  Parent  or other  consideration  shall  be  delivered  in  exchange
therefor.  All references to Company  Common Shares include the Rights  attached
thereto.

     (b) Conversion of Company Common Shares.  Subject to the provisions of this
Section 2.1, each Company  Common Share other than shares  canceled  pursuant to
Section 2.1(a), issued and outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall by virtue of the Merger and  without  any action on the part of the holder
thereof be converted into,  subject to Section 2.1(c), the right to receive that
number of fully paid,  non-assessable  shares of common stock, $ 0.01 par value,
of Parent ("Parent Common Stock") equal to the Exchange Ratio.  All such Company
Common Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled
and retired and shall cease to exist, and each certificate previously evidencing
any  such shares shall thereafter represent the right only to receive the Merger


                                      - 3 -
<PAGE>

Consideration  (as defined in Section 2.2(b)).  The holders of such certificates
previously  evidencing such Company Common Shares outstanding  immediately prior
to the  Effective  Time  shall  cease to have any  rights  with  respect to such
Company  Common  Shares  except as  otherwise  provided  herein or by law.  Such
certificates  previously evidencing Company Common Shares shall be exchanged for
certificates   evidencing   whole  shares  of  Parent  Common  Stock  issued  in
consideration  therefor  upon the surrender of such  certificates  in accordance
with the provisions of Section 2.2. No fractional  shares of Parent Common Stock
shall be issued,  and, in lieu thereof, a cash payment shall be made pursuant to
Section 2.2(d).  The "Exchange Ratio" shall be equal to $19.00 divided by either
(i) the Average Price of Parent Common Stock if such Average Price is no greater
than  $100.00 and no less than  $82.00,  (ii)  $100.00 if the  Average  Price of
Parent  Common Stock is greater than $100.00,  in which case the Exchange  Ratio
shall equal 0.19 or (iii) $82.00 if the Average  Price of Parent Common Stock is
less than $82.00, in which case the Exchange Ratio shall equal 0.2317.  "Average
Price"  means the average of the  closing  prices as reported in The Wall Street
Journal's New York Stock Exchange Composite Transactions Reports for each of the
20  consecutive  Trading Days in the period ending on the business day preceding
the  Effective  Time.  "Trading  Day"  means a day on which  the New York  Stock
Exchange, Inc. (the "NYSE") is open for trading.

     (c) Anti-Dilution Provisions. If between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective  Time,  the number of shares of Parent Common Stock or Company  Common
Shares  issued and  outstanding  changes as a result of a stock  split,  reverse
stock   split,   stock   dividend,    stock    combination,    recapitalization,
reclassification,  reorganization or similar transaction (a  "Recapitalization")
with  a  record  date  within  such  period,   the   Exchange   Ratio  shall  be
proportionately  adjusted to provide the  holders of Company  Common  Shares the
same economic effect as  contemplated  by this  Agreement.  If, between the date
hereof and the Effective  Time,  Parent shall merge or consolidate  with or into
any other  corporation  (a "Business  Combination")  and the terms thereof shall
provide that Parent  Common Stock shall be converted  into or exchanged  for the
shares of any other corporation or entity,  then provision shall be made so that
shareholders  of the Company  who would be entitled to receive  shares of Parent
Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement shall be entitled to receive, in lieu of
each share of Parent  Common  Stock  issuable to such  shareholders  as provided
herein,  the  same  kind  and  amount  of  securities  or  assets  as  shall  be
distributable upon such Business Combination with respect to one share of Parent
Common Stock and the parties shall agree on an appropriate  restructuring of the
transactions contemplated herein.

     (d) Conversion of Common Stock of Merger Sub. At the Effective  Time,  each
share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding  immediately prior to
the Effective Time, and all rights in respect thereof,  shall forthwith cease to
exist and be converted  into one validly  issued,  fully paid and  nonassessable
common share of the Surviving Corporation.



                                      - 4 -
<PAGE>

     (e) Options.  In accordance  with Section 6.11, as soon as practicable  but
not more than five (5) days from the date  hereof,  the  Company  shall  provide
written  notice  to each  holder of a Company  Option of the  execution  of this
Agreement  which notice  shall  include the election by the Company to terminate
all Company  Options as of the 30th day  immediately  following  the date of the
sending of such notice as  contemplated  by the provisions of the Company's 1993
Employee and Non-Employee  Director Stock Option Plan (the "Stock Option Plan"),
so that as of the  Closing  Date all  Company  Options  will  have  been  either
exercised and satisfied in full or terminated.  For purposes of this  Agreement,
"Company  Options"  shall  mean   subscriptions,   options,   warrants,   calls,
commitments,  agreements,  conversion  rights or other  rights of any  character
(contingent  or otherwise) to purchase or otherwise  acquire from the Company or
any of its  Subsidiaries at any time, or upon the happening of any stated event,
any shares of the capital stock of the Company.

     Section 2.2 Exchange of  Certificates.  (a) Deposit with Exchange Agent. As
soon as practicable  after the Effective Time,  Parent shall deposit with a bank
or trust  company  mutually  agreeable to Parent and the Company (the  "Exchange
Agent"), pursuant to an agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Parent and the  Company,  when  required,  certificates  representing  shares of
Parent Common Stock  required to effect the  conversion of Company  Common Stock
into Parent  Common Shares in  accordance  with Section  2.1(b) and an amount of
cash in respect of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.2(d).

     (b)  Exchange  and Payment  Procedures.  As soon as  practicable  after the
Effective  Time,  Parent shall cause  Parent's  transfer  agent and registrar as
paying  agent  (the  "Paying  Agent")  to mail to each  holder  of  record  of a
certificate   or   certificates   representing   Company   Common   Shares  (the
"Certificates")  that have been converted  pursuant to Section 2.1: (i) a letter
of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates  shall pass, only upon actual delivery of the
Certificates to Parent's Paying Agent) and (ii)  instructions  for effecting the
surrender of the  Certificates  and  receiving  the Merger  Consideration.  Upon
surrender of a Certificate to the Paying Agent for cancellation, together with a
duly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as the Paying Agent
may  require,  the holder of such  Certificate  shall be  entitled to receive in
exchange therefor (i) a certificate representing that number of shares of Parent
Common Stock into which the Company Common Shares previously represented by such
Certificate are converted in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and (ii) the cash in
lieu of  fractional  shares of Parent  Common Stock to which such holder has the
right to receive  pursuant to Section  2.2(d) (the shares of Parent Common Stock
and cash described in clauses (i) and (ii) above being referred to  collectively
as  the "Merger Consideration"). In  the event the Merger Consideration is to be


                                      - 5 -
<PAGE>

delivered  to any Person  who is not the  Person in whose  name the  Certificate
surrendered  in exchange  therefor is registered in the transfer  records of the
Company,  the Merger  Consideration  may be  delivered  to a  transferee  if the
Certificate  is  presented to the Paying  Agent,  accompanied  by all  documents
required to evidence and effect such  transfer and by evidence  satisfactory  to
the Paying Agent that any applicable  stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate  (other than a
certificate representing Company Common Shares to be canceled in accordance with
Section  2.1(a))  shall  be  deemed  at any time  after  the  Effective  Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration
contemplated by this Section 2.2. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any
cash payable to holders of  Certificates  pursuant to provisions of this Article
II.

     (c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or other
distributions  declared or made after the Effective  Time with respect to shares
of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid
to the holder of any  unsurrendered  Certificate  with  respect to the shares of
Parent  Common  Stock  represented  thereby  and no  cash  payment  in  lieu  of
fractional  shares shall be paid to any such holder  pursuant to Section  2.2(d)
until the holder of record of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate.
Subject to the effect of unclaimed property,  escheat and other applicable laws,
following  surrender of any such Certificate,  there shall be paid to the record
holder of the  certificates  representing  whole  shares of Parent  Common Stock
issued  in  exchange  therefor,  without  interest,  (i) at  the  time  of  such
surrender,  the  amount of any cash  payable  in lieu of a  fractional  share of
Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled  pursuant to Section 2.2(d)
and the amount of dividends or other  distributions with a record date after the
Effective  Time  theretofore  paid with  respect to such whole  shares of Parent
Common Stock and (ii) at the  appropriate  payment date, the amount of dividends
or other  distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to
surrender  and a payment date  subsequent  to surrender  payable with respect to
such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

     (d) No  Fractional  Securities.  In lieu of the issuance of any  fractional
securities in connection  with the Merger,  each holder of Company Common Shares
who would otherwise have been entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common
Stock upon surrender of  Certificates  for exchange  pursuant to this Article II
will be paid an amount in cash (without interest),  rounded to the nearest cent,
determined by multiplying  (a) the per share closing price on the NYSE of Parent
Common Stock on the date of the Effective Time by (b) the fractional interest to
which such holder  would  otherwise be entitled  (after  taking into account all
Company Common Shares then held of record by such holder).

     (e) Closing of Transfer Books.  If, after the Effective Time,  Certificates
are presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer,  they shall be canceled
and exchanged for certificates  representing the appropriate number of shares of
Parent  Common  Stock and the  appropriate  amount of cash as  provided  in this
Section 2.2.

Parent Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.2(a)
and not exchanged  within six months after the  Effective  Time pursuant to this
Section  2.2 shall be  returned  by the  Exchange  Agent to Parent,  which shall
thereafter  act as  Exchange  Agent.  All cash  held by the  Exchange  Agent for
payment to the holders of unsurrendered Certificates and unclaimed at the end of
six months from the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, after which time
any holder of unsurrendered  Certificates  shall look as a general creditor only
to Parent for  payment of such cash to which such  holder may be due  subject to
applicable law.

or funds  delivered to a public  official  pursuant to any applicable  abandoned
property, escheat or similar law.

from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts
as Parent is required to deduct and withhold  with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code or any  provision of state,  local or foreign tax law. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent,  such withheld  amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this  Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the Company Common Shares in respect of which such deduction and  withholding
was made by Parent.

provided or made available, to Parent (i) current,  accurate and complete copies

relevant Company Benefit Plan) and all trust or funding  agreements with respect
thereto;  (ii) the most recent annual actuarial valuation,  if any, prepared for

increasing the liabilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries  taken as a whole
under the relevant Company Benefit Plan).

     (c) All Company  Benefit  Plans have been  administered  in all respects in
accordance  with the terms thereof and all applicable laws except for violations

the  Code  (each,  an  "  Company  Pension  Plan"),  has  received  a  favorable
determination  letter from the Internal Revenue Service,  and the Company is not
aware of any  circumstances  that would  reasonably be expected to result in the
revocation or denial of this qualified status.  Except as otherwise set forth in
the Company  Disclosure  Letter or in the SEC Reports  filed prior to this date,
there  is  no  pending  or,  to  the  Company's  knowledge,  threatened,  claim,
litigation,  proceeding,  audit,  examination or  investigation  relating to any

aggregate,  would have or  reasonably  be  expected  to have a Material  Adverse
Effect.

entity which is considered a single  employer with the Company or any Subsidiary

"Company  ERISA  Affiliate").  No notice of a  "reportable  event,"  within  the
meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA for which the 30-day reporting  requirement has
not been  waived,  has been  required to be filed for any Company  Pension  Plan
within the past twelve (12) months.

     (e) All  contributions,  premiums and payments  (other than  contributions,
premiums or payments that are not  material,  in the  aggregate)  required to be

Pension Plan has an  "accumulated  funding  deficiency"  (whether or not waived)
within the meaning of Section  412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA.  Neither
the Company nor any  Subsidiaries of the Company nor any Company ERISA Affiliate
has provided,  or is required to provide,  security to any Company  Pension Plan
pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code.

     (f) As of the Closing  Date,  neither the Company,  any  Subsidiary  of the

Affiliate has  knowledge  that any Company  Multiemployer  Plan fails to qualify
under Section  401(a) of the Code, is insolvent or is in  reorganization  within
the  meaning of Part 3 of  Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA nor of any  condition
that would  reasonably  be  expected to result in a Company  Multiemployer  Plan
becoming insolvent or going into reorganization.

     (g) Except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter, the execution of,
and  performance of the  transactions  contemplated  in, this Agreement will not
(either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent events) (i)
constitute an event under any Company  Benefit Plan,  trust or loan that will or
may result in any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise), acceleration,
forgiveness of  indebtedness,  vesting,  distribution,  increase in  benefits or


                                     - 14 -

obligation to fund benefits with respect to any Company Employee, or (ii) result
in the triggering or imposition of any  restrictions or limitations on the right
of the Company,  any  Subsidiary  of the Company or Parent to amend or terminate
any Company Benefit Plan. Except as set forth in the Company  Disclosure Letter,
no payment or benefit which will or may be made by the Company,  any  Subsidiary
of the Company, Parent or any of their respective affiliates with respect to any
Company Employee will be characterized as an "excess parachute  payment," within
the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code.

Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole; and

     (e) any contract that would constitute a "material  contract" (as such term

     True and complete  copies of the written Company  Contracts,  as amended to

Subsidiary  of the Company which is a party thereto and, to the knowledge of the
Company,  each other  party  thereto  and is in full force and  effect,  and the
Company and its  Subsidiaries  have performed and complied with all  obligations
required to be performed or compiled  with by them under each Company  Contract,

     Section 3.19 Title to Assets.  The Company and its  Subsidiaries  have good
and  marketable  title to all of their real and personal  properties  and assets
reflected in the audited  consolidated  balance  sheet of the Company as of June
30, 2000 (the "Audited Balance Sheet") (other than assets disposed of since June
30, 2000 in the ordinary course of business,  and properties and assets acquired
since June 30, 2000), in each case free and clear of all Encumbrances except for
(i) Encumbrances which secure  indebtedness  reflected in the SEC Reports;  (ii)
liens for Taxes accrued but not yet due;  (iii) liens arising as a matter of law
in the ordinary  course of business with respect to  obligations  incurred after
the date of the Audited Balance Sheet,  provided that the obligations secured by
such  liens  are not  delinquent;  and (iv)  such  imperfections  of  title  and
Encumbrances,  if any,  as would not have or  reasonably  be  expected to have a
Material  Adverse Effect.  The Company and its  Subsidiaries  own, or have valid
leasehold  interests in, all  properties and assets used in the conduct of their
business.  Any real property and other assets held under lease by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries are held under valid,  subsisting and enforceable leases
with  such  exceptions  which,  individually  or in  the  aggregate,  would  not
reasonably be expected to interfere  with the use made or proposed to be made by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of such property.

     Section 3.20 State Takeover Statutes. The Board of Directors of the Company
has approved the Merger and this  Agreement  and such  approval is sufficient to
render   inapplicable  to  the  Merger,  this  Agreement  and  the  transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the provisions of Section 23-1-43 of the IBCL to
the extent, if any, such section is applicable to the transactions  contemplated
by this Agreement.  The Board of Directors of the Company has amended the bylaws
of the Company so as to render  inapplicable  to the Stock Option  Agreement and
the other  transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement  the  provisions of IC
23-1-42. To the Company's knowledge,  no other state takeover statute or similar
statute or  regulation  applies to the Merger or the  transactions  contemplated
hereby.

     Section 3.21 Rights Agreement. No "Distribution Date" or "Triggering Event"
(as such terms are defined in the Rights Agreement,  dated as of April 21, 1998,
between the Company and Compushare  Investor Services,  LLC, as successor rights
agent, as amended (the "Rights  Agreement"))  has occurred as of this date. This
Agreement  and  the  Stock  Option  Agreement,   and  the  consummation  of  the
transactions  contemplated hereunder and thereunder,  including the Merger, have
been approved by at least  two-thirds (2/3) of the  Disinterested  Directors (as
defined in the Rights Agreement).  The Rights Agreement has been amended so that
neither the  execution  or delivery of this  Agreement,  nor the exchange of the
Company  Common  Shares  for the  shares  of  Parent  Common  Stock  and cash in
accordance  with  Article II will cause (A) the Rights  issued  pursuant  to the
Rights Agreement to become exercisable under the Rights Agreement, (B) Parent or
Merger  Sub to be  deemed  an  "Acquiring  Person"  (as  defined  in the  Rights
Agreement),  or (C) the "Shares  Acquisition Date" or a "Triggering Event" (each
as defined in the Rights  Agreement) to occur upon any such event. The execution
and  delivery  of  this  Agreement  and  the  Stock  Option  Agreement  and  the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby will not result
in the  ability  of any  Person to  exercise  any  Rights or cause the Rights to
separate  from the  Company  Common  Shares to which they are  attached or to be
triggered or become exercisable.

     Section 3.22 Product Warranty. Each product manufactured,  sold, leased, or
delivered  by any of the Company and its  Subsidiaries  has been in  substantial
conformity  with all  applicable  contractual  commitments  and all  express and
implied  warranties,  and  none  of the  Company  and its  Subsidiaries  has any
liability  (and  there is no basis  for any  present  or  future  action,  suit,
proceeding, hearing, investigation,  charge, complaint, claim, or demand against
any of them giving rise to any liability)  for  replacement or repair thereof or
other damages in connection therewith other than liabilities that would not have
or reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, subject only to the
reserve for product  warranty claims as adjusted for the passage of time through
the Closing Date in accordance  with the past custom and practice of the Company
and its Subsidiaries. No product manufactured, sold, leased, or delivered by any


                                     - 22 -
<PAGE>

of the Company and its  Subsidiaries  is subject to any guaranty,  warranty,  or
other indemnity  beyond the applicable  standard terms and conditions of sale or
lease. The Company  Disclosure  Letter includes copies of the standard terms and
conditions  of sale  or  lease  for  each of the  Company  and its  Subsidiaries
(containing applicable guaranty, warranty, and indemnity provisions).

     Section 3.23 Product  Liability.  None of the Company and its  Subsidiaries
has any liability (and there is no basis for any present or future action, suit,
proceeding, hearing, investigation,  charge, complaint, claim, or demand against
any of  them  giving  rise  to any  liability)  arising  out  of any  injury  to
individuals or property as a result of the ownership,  possession, or use of any
product  manufactured,  sold, leased, or delivered by any of the Company and its
Subsidiaries,  other  than  liabilities  that  would not have or  reasonably  be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

the statements made therein,  in the light of the circumstances under which they
will be made, not misleading.

          being  understood  that this provision shall not prohibit the exercise
          (cashless or otherwise) of Company Options);

               (iv) the Company  shall not, and shall not cause or permit any of

     Section 5.2 No Solicitation.  (a) The Company shall  immediately  cease and
terminate  any  existing  solicitation,   initiation,  encouragement,  activity,
discussion or negotiation with any Persons conducted  heretofore by the Company,
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective  representatives with respect to any
proposed,  potential or  contemplated  Acquisition  Transaction  and request the
return or  destruction  of all  non-public  information  furnished in connection
therewith.

     (b) From and after this date,  without the prior written consent of Parent,
the Company will not, will not authorize or permit any of its  Subsidiaries  to,
and  shall  use  its  reasonable  best  efforts  to  cause  any of its or  their
respective officers, directors,  employees,  financial advisors, agents or other
representatives not to, directly or indirectly,  solicit,  initiate or encourage
(including  by way of  furnishing  information)  or take  any  other  action  to
facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal which  constitutes or may
reasonably  be  expected  to lead to an  Acquisition  Proposal  from any Person,
engage  in any  discussion  or  negotiations  relating  thereto  or  accept  any
Acquisition Proposal or enter into any contract or understanding requiring it to
abandon,  terminate  or  fail  to  consummate  the  Merger  or any of the  other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided that, at any time prior to
receipt of the stockholder approval referred to in Section 6.1, the Company may,
subject to compliance  with this Section  5.2(b),  furnish  information  to, and
negotiate or otherwise  engage in  discussions  with,  any Person (a  "Proposing
Party") who (x) delivers a bona fide written Acquisition  Proposal which was not
solicited,  initiated,  encouraged or  facilitated  by the Company,  directly or
indirectly, after the date of this Agreement or otherwise resulted from a breach
of  this  Section  5.2,  and (y)  enters  into  an  appropriate  confidentiality
agreement  with the Company (which  agreement  shall be no less favorable to the
Company than the Confidentiality Agreement and a copy of which will be delivered
to Parent promptly after the execution  thereof),  if, but only if, the Board of
Directors of the Company  determines in good faith by a majority vote, (i) after
consultation  with, and receipt of advice from, its outside legal counsel,  that
failing to take such action would constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of
such Board of Directors  under the IBCL,  and (ii) after  consultation  with the
Company's independent financial advisors, that such proposal could reasonably be
expected to lead to a Superior Transaction.

     (c) The  Company  shall  notify  Parent  orally  and in writing of any such
inquiries,  offers or proposals  (including,  without limitation,  the terms and
conditions of any such offers or proposals, any amendments or revisions, and the
identity of the Person  making it), as  promptly as  practicable  following  the
receipt,  and shall keep Parent  reasonably  informed of the status and material
terms of any such inquiry,  offer or proposal.  For purposes of this  Agreement,
"Acquisition  Proposal"  shall mean,  with respect to the Company,  any inquiry,
proposal or offer from any Person (other than Parent or any of its Subsidiaries)
relating to any (i) direct or indirect  acquisition or purchase of a business of
the  Company or any of its  Subsidiaries,  that  constitutes  15% or more of the
consolidated net revenues, net income or assets of Company and its Subsidiaries,
(ii) direct or indirect  acquisition  or purchase of 15% or more of any class of
equity  securities  of  the  Company or  any of its  Subsidiaries whose business


                                     - 28 -
<PAGE>

constitutes 15% or more of the consolidated  net revenues,  net income or assets
of the Company and its  Subsidiaries,  (iii) tender offer or exchange offer that
if consummated would result in any Person beneficially owning 15% or more of the
capital  stock  of  the  Company,  or  (iv)  merger,   consolidation,   business
combination,  recapitalization,  liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction
involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries whose business  constitutes 15%
or more of the  consolidated  net revenues,  net income or assets of the Company
and its Subsidiaries. Each of the transactions referred to in clauses (i) - (iv)
of the definition of Acquisition  Proposal,  other than any such  transaction to
which  Parent  or any of its  Subsidiaries  is a  party,  is  referred  to as an
"Acquisition Transaction".

     (d) If, prior to the approval of this Agreement by the  stockholders of the
Company,  the Board of  Directors of the Company  determines  in good faith by a
majority vote,  with respect to any written  proposal from a Proposing Party for
an  Acquisition  Transaction  received  after  the  date  hereof  that  was  not
solicited,  initiated,  encouraged or  facilitated  by the Company,  directly or
indirectly,  after the date of this Agreement or did not otherwise result from a
breach of this Section 5.2, that,  based upon (x) the written opinion (a copy of
which  shall have been  delivered  to  Parent)  from the  Company's  independent
financial  advisors that the Acquisition  Transaction is a Superior  Transaction
and (y) the advice of the Company's outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition
Transaction is a Superior Transaction and is in the best interest of the Company
and its  stockholders  and  failure to enter into such  Acquisition  Transaction
would  constitute a breach of the fiduciary  duties of the Board of Directors of
the Company under the IBCL,  then the Company may terminate  this  Agreement and
enter into an acquisition agreement for the Superior Transaction; provided that,
prior  to any  such  termination,  and  in  order  for  such  termination  to be
effective,  (i) the Company shall provide  Parent three  business  days' written
notice that it intends to  terminate  this  Agreement  pursuant to this  Section
5.2(d),  identifying  the  Superior  Transaction  and the  parties  thereto  and
delivering  an  accurate  description  of all  material  terms  of the  Superior
Transaction to be entered into,  and (ii) on the date of  termination  (provided
that the  opinion  and advice  referred  to in clauses  (x) and (y) above  shall
continue in effect without  revocation,  revision or modification),  the Company
shall deliver to Parent (A) a written  notice of  termination  of this Agreement
pursuant to this Section  5.2(d),  (B) a wire transfer of immediately  available
funds in the amount of the Termination  Fee, (C) a written  acknowledgment  from
the  Company  that the  termination  of this  Agreement  and the entry  into the
Superior  Transaction are a Triggering  Event, and (D) a written  acknowledgment
from each other party to the Superior Transaction that it has read the Company's
acknowledgment  referred to in clause (C) above and will not contest the matters
thus acknowledged by the Company, including the payment of the Termination Fee.

     (e) "Superior Transaction" shall mean an Acquisition  Transaction which the
Board of Directors of the Company,  reasonably  determines is more  favorable to
the Company and its stockholders than the Merger and which is not subject to any
financing condition; provided, however, that, without limiting the foregoing, an
Acquisition  Transaction shall not constitute a Superior  Transaction unless, in
the  written  opinion  (with only  customary  qualifications)  of the  Company's
independent financial advisors, the value of the consideration to be paid in the
Acquisition  Transaction is more favorable to the  stockholders  of such company
from a financial point of view than the Merger  Consideration.  Reference in the
foregoing  definition to the "Merger" and "Merger  Consideration" shall include,
as applicable,  any proposed alteration of the terms of this Agreement submitted
by Parent in writing in response to any Acquisition Proposal.

     (f) Nothing in this Section 5.2 shall prevent the Board of Directors of the
Company, from taking, and disclosing to the Company's  stockholders,  a position
contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a)  promulgated under the Exchange Act
or  making  any  disclosure  required  under  the  IBCL  (subject,  however,  to
compliance  with  the  balance  of  this  sentence  where  applicable),  and the
Company's Board of Directors may prior to the date of its stockholders  meeting,
withdraw,  modify or change its  recommendation  if, but only if and only to the
extent  that,  the  Board  of  Directors  determines  in good  faith  that  such
withdrawal,  modification  or change  is  required  in order to comply  with its
fiduciary duties to its stockholders  under the IBCL after receiving advice from
its outside legal  counsel;  provided  that in the case of a tender  offer,  the
Board of Directors of the Company shall not recommend that  stockholders  tender
their Company Common Shares in such tender offer unless (i) such tender offer is
determined to be a Superior  Transaction  in accordance  with the  provisions of
Section 5.2(d) and (ii) the Company has provided Parent with not less than three
business days, prior written notice of any such action; provided,  further, that
in no event shall the Company or its Board of Directors take,  agree, or resolve
to take any action  prohibited  by Section  5.2(b) or 5.2(d) except as expressly
permitted by such Sections.

     (g) Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company
shall not take any action to make the provisions of IC 23-1-43  inapplicable  to
any  Acquisition  Transaction in respect of the Company  (including any Superior
Transaction) or release any standstill  agreements or other similar restrictions
prior to the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

                                   ARTICLE VI

     Section 6.1  Meetings  of  Stockholders.  The Company  will take all action
necessary in accordance  with  applicable law and its Articles of  Incorporation
and its  bylaws  to  convene  a  meeting  of its  stockholders  as  promptly  as
practicable  to consider and vote upon the approval  and  authorization  of this
Agreement and the Merger.  The Board of Directors of the Company shall recommend
this  approval  and the  Company  shall take all lawful  action to solicit  such
approval   including,    without   limitation,    timely   mailing   the   Proxy
Statement/Prospectus.

their  respective  filings,  and any other  submissions,  under the HSR Act with
respect to the Merger and the other  transactions  contemplated  hereby, and (b)
use  their  reasonable  best  efforts  to  cooperate  with  one  another  in (i)
determining  which other filings are required to be made prior to the expiration
of  the  Effective  Time  with,  and  which  consents,   approvals,  permits  or
authorizations  are required to be obtained  prior to the  Effective  Time from,

such consents, approvals, permits, authorizations and waivers; and (b) use their
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other actions and do,

consummate and make effective the  transactions  contemplated by this Agreement;
provided,  however,  that such reasonable best efforts shall not include (i) the
sale or  divestiture  of any  assets of Parent (or its  affiliates)  or (ii) the
licensing  of  any  Intellectual  Property  of  Parent,  or  its  affiliates  or
Intellectual Property to be acquired under this Agreement. If, at any time after

the Surviving Corporation shall take all such necessary action.

     Section 6.3 Publicity. The initial press release relating to this Agreement
shall be issued  jointly by the  Company,  Parent and  Merger  Sub.  Thereafter,
subject to their respective legal  obligations,  the Company,  Parent and Merger
Sub shall consult with each other, and use reasonable  efforts to agree upon the
text of any press  release,  before  issuing any such press release or otherwise
making public  statements with respect to the transactions  contemplated  hereby
and in making any  filings  with any  Governmental  Entity or with any  national
securities exchange with respect thereto.

     Section  6.4  Registration  Statement.  The  parties  shall  cooperate  and
promptly prepare,  and Parent shall file with the SEC as soon as practicable,  a
Registration  Statement  on Form S-4 (the "Form S-4") under the  Securities  Act
with  respect to the Parent  Common Stock  issuable in the Merger,  a portion of
which   Registration   Statement   shall   also   serve  as  the   joint   proxy
statement/prospectus  with respect to the meeting of the Company stockholders in
connection with the Merger (the "Proxy Statement/Prospectus").  The parties will
cause  the Proxy  Statement/Prospectus  and the Form S-4 to comply as to form in
all material respects with  the applicable provisions of the Securities Act, the


                                     - 31 -

inclusion in the Proxy  Statement/Prospectus  and each  amendment or  supplement
thereto,  at the time of  mailing  thereof,  at the time of the  meeting  of the
Company stockholders, and at the time it is filed or becomes effective, will not
include an untrue  statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated  therein or necessary to make the statements  therein,  in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

     Section  6.5  Listing  Application.  Parent  shall  as soon  as  reasonably
practicable prepare and submit to the NYSE and all other securities exchanges on
which the shares of Parent  Common Stock are listed a listing  application  with

official notice of issuance.

     Section  6.6 Further  Action.  Each of the  parties  shall,  subject to the
fulfillment  at or  before  the  Effective  Time of each  of the  conditions  of
performance  set  forth  in  this  Agreement  or the  waiver  thereof,  use  its
reasonable  best  efforts  to  perform  those  further  acts and  execute  those

Company identified by Parent on terms satisfactory to Parent and such employees.

     (a) the  occurrence  or  nonoccurrence  of any event  whose  occurrence  or
nonoccurrence  is reasonably  expected to cause any of the conditions  precedent
set forth in Article VII not to be satisfied; and

     (b) any facts  relating  to that party  which  would make it  necessary  or
advisable  to amend the Proxy  Statement/Prospectus  or the Form S-4 in order to
make  the  statements  therein  not  untrue  or  misleading  or to  comply  with
applicable law; provided,  however,  that the delivery of any notice pursuant to
this  Section 6.8 shall not limit or  otherwise  affect the  remedies  available
hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

     (c) From  time to time  after the date of this  Agreement  and prior to the
Effective  Time,  the Company will promptly  supplement or amend the  Disclosure
Letter  with  respect to any matter  hereafter  arising  which,  if  existing or

be set forth or described in the Disclosure Letter which is necessary to correct
any information in the Disclosure Letter or in any  representation  and warranty
of the  Company  that has been  rendered  inaccurate  thereby.  For  purposes of
determining  the accuracy of the  representations  and warranties of the Company
contained in Article III in order to determine the fulfillment of the conditions

deemed to include only that  information  contained  therein on the date of this
Agreement  and shall be deemed  to  exclude  any  information  contained  in any
subsequent supplement or amendment thereto.

accountants' work papers, (ii) permit Parent to make such copies and inspections
thereof as Parent may  reasonably  request  and (iii)  furnish  Parent with such
financial and operating data and other  information with respect to the business
and  properties of the Company and its  Subsidiaries  as Parent may from time to
time reasonably request; provided that no investigation or information furnished


                                     - 33 -
<PAGE>

pursuant to this Section 6.9 shall affect any  representation  or warranty  made
herein by the Company or the conditions to the  obligations of Parent and Merger
Sub to consummate the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement.  Parent will
endeavor  to  describe  information  requests  with  as much  specificity  as is
practicable.  Each of Parent and the Company shall designate a representative to
coordinate  information  and other  requests  pursuant to this  Section 6.9. All
access  shall be  subject  to the  condition  that  such  examinations  shall be
conducted  during normal  business hours and in a manner designed to minimize to
the extent  practicable  disruption  to the normal  business  operations  of the
Company.

     Section 6.10 Insurance;  Indemnity.  (a) Parent will maintain in effect for
not less than three  years  after the  Effective  Time,  the  Company's  current
directors and officers insurance  policies,  if such insurance is obtainable (or
policies of at least the same coverage  containing  terms and conditions no less
advantageous  to the  current  and all  former  directors  and  officers  of the
Company)  with respect to acts or failures to act prior to the  Effective  Time,
including  acts relating to the  transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement;
provided,  however,  that in order to maintain or procure such coverage,  Parent
shall not be required to maintain or obtain  policies  providing  such  coverage
except to the extent  such  coverage  can be  provided  at an annual  cost of no
greater than two times the most recent annual  premium paid by the Company prior
to the date  hereof (the  "Cap");  and  provided,  further,  that if  equivalent
coverage cannot be obtained, or can be obtained only by paying an annual premium
in excess of the Cap,  Parent shall only be required to obtain as much  coverage
as can be obtained by paying an annual premium equal to the Cap.

     (b) From and after the  Effective  Time,  Parent shall  indemnify  and hold
harmless to the fullest extent  permitted under  applicable law, each Person who
is, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the
Effective Time, an officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(each, an "Indemnified Party") against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
costs or expenses (including attorneys' fees),  judgments,  fines, penalties and
amounts  paid  in  settlement  in  connection  with  any  claim,  action,  suit,
proceeding or  investigation  arising out of or pertaining to acts or omissions,
or alleged acts or omissions, by them in their capacities as such, which acts or
omissions  occurred  prior to the Effective  Time,  whether  asserted or claimed
prior to,  at or after  the  Effective  Time.  In the  event of any such  claim,
action,  suit,  proceeding  or  investigation  (an  "Action"),  the Parent shall
control the defense of such Action with  counsel  selected by the Parent,  which
counsel  shall be  reasonably  acceptable to the  Indemnified  Party;  provided,
however,  that the  Indemnified  Party shall be permitted to  participate in the
defense of such Action through counsel selected by the Indemnified  Party, which
counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to the Parent, at the Indemnified Party's
expense.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  if there is any conflict  between the
Parent and any  Indemnified Parties  or  there are additional defenses available
to any Indemnified  Parties, the  Indemnified  Parties  shall  be  permitted  to


                                     - 34 -
<PAGE>

participate  in  the  defense  of  such  Action  with  counsel  selected  by the
Indemnified Parties, which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to the Parent,
and Parent  shall cause Parent to pay the  reasonable  fees and expenses of such
counsel,  as accrued and in advance of the final  disposition  of such Action to
the fullest extent  permitted by applicable  law;  provided,  however,  that the
Parent shall not be obligated  to pay the  reasonable  fees and expenses of more
than one counsel for all Indemnified  Parties in any single Action except to the
extent that, in the opinion of counsel for the Indemnified  Parties, two or more
of such Indemnified  Parties have  conflicting  interests in the outcome of such
Action.  The Parent shall not be liable for any settlement  effected without its
written consent, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld.

     (c) The Surviving  Corporation  shall keep in effect all  provisions in its
articles of  incorporation  and by-laws that provide for exculpation of director
and officer liability and  indemnification  (and advancement of expenses related
thereto) of the past and present  officers  and  directors of the Company to the
fullest extent  permitted by the IBCL and such  provisions  shall not be amended
except as either required by applicable law or to make changes  permitted by law
that would  enhance  the rights of past or present  officers  and  directors  to
indemnification or advancement of expenses.

     (d) If the Surviving  Corporation  or any of its  respective  successors or
assigns (i) shall  consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or other
entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of the
consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or  substantially  all of its
properties and assets to any individual,  corporation or other entity,  then and
in each such case,  proper  provisions  shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Surviving  Corporation  shall assume all of the  obligations  set
forth in this Section 6.10.

     (e) The  provisions of this Section 6.10 are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable  by, each of the Indemnified  Parties,  their heirs
and their representatives.

applicable competition,  merger control,  antitrust or similar law or regulation

reasonably be expected to have resulted in a Material Adverse Effect.

     (b) Agreements and Covenants.  The Company shall have performed or complied

have  been   expressly   made  as  of  an  earlier  date,  in  which  case  such
representations  and  warranties  shall  have been true and  correct  as of such
earlier date) with the same force and effect as if made on and as of the Closing
Date,  except  to the  extent  that any  failures  of such  representations  and

and Merger Sub's ability to consummate  the Merger or otherwise  prevent  Parent
and Merger Sub from performing  their  obligations  under this  Agreement.  This
condition  shall  not be  applicable  to  consents,  approvals,  authorizations,

material  breach  by  the  other  of any  of  its  representations,  warranties,
covenants or agreements  contained in this Agreement,  which breach would result
in the  failure to satisfy  one or more of the  conditions  set forth in Section
7.2(a) or (b) (in the case of a breach by the Company) or Section  7.3(a) or (b)
(in the case of a breach by Parent), and such breach shall be incapable of being
