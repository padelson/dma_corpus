          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements and conditions herein
contained, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as
follows:

                                    ARTICLE I
                                 THE TRANSACTION

          1.01    Sale and Purchase of the Company Shares. Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Company shall issue,
sell and deliver 100 shares of newly issued common stock, par value $0.01 per
share (the "Company Shares"), which shall constitute all of the then issued and
outstanding shares of the Company's capital stock, to Buyer, and Buyer shall
purchase and take delivery of the Company Shares from the Company, at the
Closing.

          1.02    Purchase Price. The aggregate purchase price for the Company
Shares (the "Purchase Price") shall equal (i) the sum of the aggregate Allowed
Secured Claims against the Debtors as of the Closing Date and $140,000,000,
subject to adjustment pursuant to Sections 1.04 and 1.05, less (ii) the
aggregate amount of the funds (the "Restricted Funds") transferred by the
Debtors to the Burlington Fabrics Irrevocable Trust (the "Restricted Funds
Trust") prior to the Closing Date.

          1.03    The Closing; Escrow. (a) Unless this Agreement shall have been
terminated pursuant to Section 9.01, and subject to the satisfaction or waiver
of the conditions set forth in Articles VII and VIII and the deliveries required
by Sections 1.04, 1.06 and 1.07, the closing of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (the "Closing") will take place at the offices of Jones, Day,
Reavis & Pogue, 222 East 41st Street, New York, NY 10017, at 10:00 a.m., local
time, on the first Business Day following the date of satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in Sections 7.05, 7.06, 8.05 and 8.06 or, if later, the
fifth Business Day after the delivery of the Preliminary Balance Sheet, unless
another date, time or place is mutually agreed to in writing by the parties
hereto (the "Closing Date").

          (b)     At the Closing, (i) Buyer will pay, on behalf of the Company,
the Purchase Price as it may be adjusted pursuant to Section 1.04, less the
amount specified under clause (ii) below, by wire transfer of immediately
available United States funds to the Distribution Trust, at an account
identified by the Distribution Trust Representative before the Closing Date, for
the distribution of such amount pursuant to the Plan and (ii) Buyer will deliver
the Escrow Amount by wire transfer of immediately available United States funds
to a commercial bank (the "Escrow Agent") reasonably acceptable to Buyer and the
Distribution Trust Representative, under an escrow agreement to be entered into
on or before the Closing Date by and among Buyer, the Distribution Trust (by the
Distribution Trust Representative) and the Escrow Agent substantially in the
form of Exhibit A hereto (the "Escrow Agreement"). From the date hereof through
the Closing Date, the Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Subsidiaries to, transfer any assets to or for the benefit of any creditor of
the Debtors, other than (A) Excluded Assets or net proceeds after all
transaction expenses from the sale of Excluded Assets, (B) Restricted Funds, (C)
payments to creditors on account of post-petition claims in the ordinary course
of business and to satisfy other Assumed Administrative Claims, (D) repayment of
principal or interest under

                                      - 2 -

<PAGE>

the Secured Credit Agreement, (E) professional fees related to the
Reorganization Cases and (F) as permitted by Section 4.02(e).

          (c)     At the Closing, there shall also be delivered to the Company
and Buyer the certificates and other documents to be delivered under Articles
VII and VIII.

          1.04    Purchase Price Adjustment. No later than five Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, the Company will deliver to Buyer (i) an unaudited
estimated consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of immediately prior to
the Closing (the "Preliminary Balance Sheet"), prepared in good faith applying
the same accounting principles and policies used in preparing the September
Balance Sheet (the "Company Accounting Principles and Policies"), (ii) a
schedule (the "Preliminary Pre-Closing Working Capital Schedule"), based on the
Preliminary Balance Sheet, setting forth the Company's calculation of the
estimated Working Capital of the Company as of immediately prior to the Closing
("Preliminary Pre-Closing Working Capital"), (iii) a schedule (the "Allowed
Secured Claims Schedule") setting forth the Company's calculation of the
aggregate Allowed Secured Claims as of the Closing Date, and (iv) a certificate
of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company
stating (A) that such Preliminary Balance Sheet and Preliminary Pre-Closing
Working Capital Schedule represent the Company's good faith estimate of the
consolidated financial position of the Company as of immediately prior to the
Closing applying the Company Accounting Principles and Policies and (B) that
such Allowed Secured Claims Schedule represents the Company's good faith
estimate of all Allowed Secured Claims as of the Closing Date. The Preliminary
Balance Sheet shall not give effect to Buyer's payment of the Purchase Price, or
to other payments or discharges of claims or liabilities to be made pursuant to
this Agreement or the Plan on or as a result of the Closing Date, but shall
accrue and reflect as current liabilities, among other current liabilities, all
Assumed Administrative Claims, all Priority Tax Claims to the extent such
Priority Tax Claims were not accrued and reflected on the September Balance
Sheet, and all cure costs associated with the assumption of Contracts, whether
assumed before or after the date of this Agreement, to the extent not fully paid
before the Closing Date. If the Preliminary Pre-Closing Working Capital
reflected on the Preliminary Pre-Closing Working Capital Schedule is less than
negative $102,949,000 (i.e., total current liabilities are more than
$102,949,000 greater than total current assets), then the Purchase Price paid at
Closing shall be reduced by the amount of such shortfall. If the Preliminary
Pre-Closing Working Capital reflected on the Preliminary Pre-Closing Working
Capital Schedule is greater than negative $102,949,000 (i.e., total current
liabilities are less than $102,949,000 greater than total current assets), then
the Purchase Price to be paid at Closing shall be increased by the amount of
such excess.

          1.05    Post-Closing Working Capital Adjustment. (a) Buyer shall
cooperate with the Distribution Trust Representative to jointly prepare the
following documents within forty-five Business Days following the Closing Date:
(i) an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of immediately
prior to the Closing (the "Final Balance Sheet"), prepared in good faith
applying the Company Accounting Principles and Policies, and (ii) a schedule
(the "Final Pre-Closing Working Capital Schedule" and, together with the Final
Balance Sheet, the "Closing Financials"), based on the Final Balance Sheet,
setting forth (A) a calculation of the Working Capital of the Company as of
immediately prior to the Closing ("Final Pre-Closing Working Capital") and (B) a
calculation of the amount by which the

                                      - 3 -

<PAGE>

Purchase Price should be adjusted, either upward or downward, to the extent the
Final Pre-Closing Working Capital is greater than or less than the Preliminary
Pre-Closing Working Capital (such difference being the "Working Capital Amount
Due"). The Final Balance Sheet shall not give effect to Buyer's payment of the
Purchase Price, or to other payments or discharges of claims or liabilities to
be made pursuant to this Agreement or the Plan on or as a result of the Closing
Date, but shall accrue and reflect as current liabilities, among other current
liabilities, all Assumed Administrative Claims, all Priority Tax Claims to the
extent such Priority Tax Claims were not accrued and reflected on the September
Balance Sheet, and all cure costs associated with the assumption of Contracts,
whether assumed before or after the date of this Agreement, to the extent not
fully paid before the Closing Date. Buyer shall cause the Company to provide to
the Distribution Trust Representative such reasonable access during normal
business hours to financial and other information of the Company as he or she
may request in good faith to assess the Closing Financials. If Buyer and the
Distribution Trust Representative agree upon the Working Capital Amount Due
within forty-five Business Days following the Closing Date, the Working Capital
Amount Due shall be paid in accordance with Section 1.05(d) or 1.05(e), as
applicable, and Sections 1.05(b) and 1.05(c) shall not apply. If Buyer and the
Distribution Trust Representative are unable to so agree, then within fifty
Business Days following the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to the
Distribution Trust Representative the Closing Financials that Buyer determines
satisfy this Section 1.05(a) and all the remaining provisions of this Section
1.05 shall apply.

          (b)     The Distribution Trust Representative may notify Buyer in
writing within five Business Days following delivery of the Closing Financials
as prepared by Buyer (the "Dispute Period") that (i) the Distribution Trust
Representative agrees with the Working Capital Amount Due as calculated by Buyer
(an "Approval Notice") or (ii) the Distribution Trust Representative disagrees
with the Working Capital Amount Due as prepared by Buyer, identifying in
reasonable detail the items of such Closing Financials with which the
Distribution Trust Representative disagrees (a "Dispute Notice"). Upon receipt
by Buyer of a Dispute Notice, Buyer will use good faith efforts during the ten
Business Day period following the date of receipt of a Dispute Notice (the
"Resolution Period") to resolve with the Distribution Trust Representative any
differences they may have as to the calculation of the Working Capital Amount
Due. During the Dispute Period and Resolution Period, Buyer shall cause the
Company to provide to the Distribution Trust Representative such reasonable
access during normal business hours to financial and other information of the
Company as he or she may request in good faith to assess the Closing Financials.
If Buyer and the Distribution Trust Representative cannot reach written
agreement during the Resolution Period, within five Business Days thereafter,
their disagreements, limited to those issues still in dispute (the "Disputed
Items"), shall be promptly submitted for arbitration before
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP or another independent Accounting Firm mutually
satisfactory to Buyer and the Distribution Trust Representative (the
"Independent Accountant"), which firm shall conduct such additional review as is
necessary to resolve the Disputed Items. Based upon such review, the Independent
Accountant shall prepare a schedule (the "Independent Accountant Schedule")
setting forth (A) its determination of the Disputed Items, (B) its calculation
of the Working Capital of the Company as of immediately prior to the Closing and
(C) its calculation of the Working Capital Amount Due. The Independent
Accountant Schedule shall be completed by the Independent Accountant as promptly
as practicable but in no event later than twenty days following the

                                      - 4 -

<PAGE>

selection of the Independent Accountant and shall be confirmed by the
Independent Accountant in writing to, and shall be final and binding on, Buyer
and the Distribution Trust for purposes of this Section 1.05.

          (c)     The fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant shall be
paid equally by Buyer and the Distribution Trust.

          (d)     If the Working Capital Amount Due is owed to Buyer, then no
later than the second Business Day after, as applicable, the (i) receipt by
Buyer of an Approval Notice, (ii) expiration of the Dispute Period if Buyer has
not received an Approval Notice or a Dispute Notice within such period, (iii)
expiration of the Resolution Period if Buyer and the Distribution Trust
Representative have resolved any differences regarding the Working Capital
Amount Due within such period and (iv) receipt of the Independent Accountant
Schedule (the date of such applicable event, the "Escrow Determination Date"),
Buyer and the Distribution Trust Representative shall deliver a written notice
to the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement instructing the Escrow
Agent to pay (A) the Working Capital Amount Due from the Escrow Amount to Buyer
and (B) the remainder of the Escrow Amount, if any, to the Distribution Trust,
as part of the Purchase Price, for the distribution of such amount pursuant to
the Plan, in each case by wire transfer of immediately available funds, without
setoff or deduction of any kind, within two Business Days of receipt of such
letter of instruction.

          (e)     If the Working Capital Amount Due is owed to the Distribution
Trust, then no later than the second Business Day after the Escrow Determination
Date, (A) Buyer shall, on behalf of the Company and as part of the Purchase
Price, pay the Working Capital Amount Due to the Distribution Trust for the
distribution of such amount pursuant to the Plan and (B) Buyer and the
Distribution Trust Representative shall deliver a written notice to the Escrow
Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement instructing the Escrow Agent to pay,
within two Business Days of receipt of such letter of instruction, the Escrow
Amount, also as part of the Purchase Price, to the Distribution Trust for the
distribution of such amount pursuant to the Plan, in each case by wire transfer
of immediately available funds, without set-off or deduction of any kind.

          1.06    Restricted Funds. No later than five Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, the Company will deliver to Buyer a schedule (the "Restricted
Funds Schedule"), certified on behalf of the Company by its Chief Financial
Officer as being true and complete in all material respects, setting forth, as
of the date of delivery of the Restricted Funds Schedule, the dates on which any
Restricted Funds were transferred to the Restricted Funds Trust, the amounts of
such transfers, the sources of such Restricted Funds and the aggregate amount of
all Restricted Funds transferred to the Restricted Funds Trust (which aggregate
amount shall be deducted from the Purchase Price in accordance with Section
1.02). Following the delivery to Buyer of the Restricted Funds Schedule, no
Debtor shall transfer any Restricted Funds to the Restricted Funds Trust.

          1.07    Excluded Assets. Section 1.07 of the Company's Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a description of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries classified as "Assets held for sale" on the September Balance Sheet
(the "Excluded Assets"). No later than five Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, the Company will deliver to Buyer a schedule (the "Sold Excluded

                                      - 5 -

Assets Schedule"), certified on behalf of the Company by its Chief Financial
Officer as being true and complete in all material respects, setting forth, as

any Excluded Assets were sold, the net proceeds after all transaction expenses
received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to each such
sale, the aggregate net proceeds after all transaction expenses received by the
Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to all such sales (the "Excluded
Assets Aggregate Net Proceeds") and the amount, if any, of Excluded Assets
Aggregate Net Proceeds that have theretofore been transferred to or for the
benefit of any creditor of the Debtors. Simultaneously with the Closing, the
Company will transfer any remaining Excluded Assets to the Distribution Trust
for disposition pursuant to the Plan. Following the delivery to Buyer of the
Sold Excluded Assets Schedule, no Debtor shall sell any Excluded Assets.

would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company, and (iii) the Company and each of its Subsidiaries is in compliance
with all such licenses, permits, registrations and other authorizations, except
for possible failures to be so in compliance which would not, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

all required registration statements, prospectuses, reports, schedules, forms,
statements and other documents required to be filed by it with the SEC since

registration statement, prospectus or other document with the SEC. As of their
respective dates, none of the Company SEC Reports (and, if amended or superseded
by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement or the Closing Date, then on the
date of such filing) contained, and none of the Company SEC Reports filed
subsequent to the date hereof will contain, any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary

were made, not misleading.

ended September 28, 2002 (the "Audited Financial Statements") fairly present in
all material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as at September 28, 2002 and September 29, 2001 and
the consolidated results of their operations, cash flows and stockholders'
equity for the 52 weeks ended September 28, 2002, September 29, 2001 and
September 30, 2000, all in accordance with GAAP consistently applied. No
independent auditors' report included with the Audited Financial Statements has
been revoked or qualified in any manner since its date. The Company has not,
since September 28, 2002, made any material change in the accounting practices
or policies applied in the preparation of the Audited Financial Statements. The
Books and Records of the Company and its Subsidiaries have been, and are being,
maintained in all material respects in accordance with GAAP. The

others within those entities, and (ii) has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation, to the Company's auditors and the audit committee of the Company's
Board of Directors (A) all significant deficiencies in the design or operation
of internal controls which could adversely affect the Company's ability to

          (a)     other than the Reorganization Cases, there are no Actions or
Proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against,

reasonably be expected to (i) result in the issuance of an Order restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (ii) individually or in the
aggregate with other such Actions or Proceedings, have a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company; and

          (b)     except for Orders of the Bankruptcy Court, there are no Orders
outstanding against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which, individually
or in the aggregate with other such Orders, would reasonably be expected to have

adversely affect such qualification.

other such "reportable events" and "accumulated funding deficiencies,"
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company: (i) no
"reportable event" (as such term is used in Section 4043 of ERISA) (other than
those events for which the 30-day notice has been waived pursuant to the
regulations) is pending with respect to any Benefit Plan and (ii) no
"accumulated funding deficiency" (as such term is used in Section 412 or 4971 of

aggregate with all other such terminations, would reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

          (f)     Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not (i)
entitle any current or former employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of
compensation due to any such employee.

          (g)     There are no pending claims by or on behalf of any Benefit

subject to any grievance procedure, arbitration or litigation, or any Action or
Proceeding, and there is no representation petition pending or, to the Knowledge
of the Company, threatened with respect to any employee employed by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received any notice of the intent of any Governmental Authority responsible for
the enforcement of labor or employment laws to conduct an investigation of the

                                     - 11 -

<PAGE>

Liability Act of 1980 ("CERCLA")) has been filed by or on behalf of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries since CERCLA became effective, and no notice
has been received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries informing the
Company or such Subsidiary of potential liability for a release of a hazardous
substance under CERCLA or any similar state or foreign Law. Except as would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, no site
or facility owned or operated, or that has been owned or operated, by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is or has been listed on the CERCLIS
published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or on any similar list
maintained by any state in which any Assets and Properties of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries are located.

Tax Return) have been paid. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
currently is the beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file any
material Tax Return.

by any authority to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in writing or (ii) as
to which the Company has Knowledge.

          (c)     Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has waived any

federal income Tax Return, other than a group the common parent of which was the
Company, or (ii) has any liability for the Taxes of any person, other than any
member of the group the common parent of which is the Company, under Reg.
Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local, or foreign law), as
a transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise.

          (e)     The reserve for Tax liability (other than any reserve for
deferred taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and tax
income) set forth on the face of the Audited Financial Statements was adequate
under GAAP to cover Tax liabilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries through
the date thereof, and (2) that reserve as adjusted for operations and
transactions through the Closing Date in accordance with the past custom and
practice of the Company and its Subsidiaries in filing their Tax Returns as
shown on the Final Balance Sheet will be adequate under GAAP to cover Tax
liabilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries through the Closing Date.

the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is material to the conduct of the
Company's business is owned free and clear of any Liens or other restrictions
upon use or enjoyment, other than Liens permitted under the DIP Facility or
Liens that will be released or discharged pursuant to the Confirmation Order at
or prior to the Closing. Except for common law trademarks, the material patents
and trademarks that are included in the Intellectual Property have been duly
registered with, or are covered by pending applications filed with, the United
States Patent and Trademark Office. The Company has taken such other
commercially reasonable actions to ensure the full protection of its and its
Subsidiaries' respective rights to, and title and interest in, such material
Intellectual Property under applicable Law. Such registrations and filings
remain in full force and effect, in each case to the extent material to the
Company's business.

          (b)     Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is infringing
upon the Intellectual Property rights of any other Person, except where such
infringement would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

policies of any kind or nature owned by or issued to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, including, without limitation, policies for fire, life, theft,
product liability, public liability, property damage, other casualty, workers'
compensation, employee health and welfare, title, property and liability, with
respect to the Company's business or Assets and Properties are in full force and
effect and are of a nature and provide such coverage as is sufficient and as is
reasonably appropriate or is customarily carried by companies engaged in
business similar to the Company's business.

          2.16    No Undisclosed Liabilities. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any Liabilities of any nature, except (i) as disclosed or
reserved against in the Audited Financial Statements, (ii) for Liabilities not
required by GAAP to be accrued, disclosed or reserved against in the Audited
Financial Statements (other than Liabilities that are Known to the Company,
reasonably estimable, material to the Company and not required by GAAP to be
accrued, disclosed or reserved against solely because they are judged not to be
probable or reasonably possible to occur), and (iii) for Liabilities that (x)
were incurred after September 28, 2002 in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice and (y) individually and in the aggregate have not
had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company.

          2.17    Absence of Changes. Since September 28, 2002, (i) there has
not occurred a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the Company or any
change, event or development that individually or in the aggregate would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company and (ii)
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action that would
be prohibited under Sections 4.01 and 4.02 after the date of this Agreement.

          2.18    Estimated Allowed Secured Claims. As of the date hereof, the
Company calculates in good faith that the aggregate amount of Allowed Secured
Claims against the Debtors as of June 30, 2003 will be $443,000,000.

the Bankruptcy Court with respect to this Agreement, the Plan or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby that is
inconsistent with performing and carrying out the provisions of this Agreement

ERISA) and the other Benefit Plans; provided, however, that Buyer, the Company,
or its Subsidiaries may amend, modify or terminate any Benefit Plan in
accordance with its terms and applicable law; provided, further, that, for a
period of at least two years after the Closing Date, no such amendment,
modification or termination shall result in compensation (including salary or
wage rate, as applicable, and bonus opportunity) and benefits to the employees
of the Company or its Subsidiaries that are less favorable, in the aggregate,
than the compensation and benefits that are provided to them immediately prior
to the Closing Date.

          (b)     As of the Closing Date, Buyer shall enter into new employment
agreements with the executives of the Company identified by the Company to Buyer
and agreed to by Buyer prior to the date of this Agreement in accordance with
the terms provided on Schedule 6.02(b) of the Company's Disclosure Schedule;
provided, however, that with respect to each such executive, (i) he or she
remains an executive of the Company from the date hereof through the Closing
Date and (ii) prior to or contemporaneously with the execution of such new
employment agreement, he or she agrees in writing (A) to the termination of, and
waives in writing any rights under, any previous employment agreement with the
Company and (B) that Buyer's acquisition of the Company pursuant to the terms
hereof does not constitute a "Change of Control" as that term is defined under
such new employment agreement.

          (c)     As of the Closing Date, Buyer shall offer a new supplemental
executive retirement plan to the executives of the Company identified by the
Company to Buyer and agreed to by Buyer prior to the date of this Agreement in
accordance with the terms provided on Schedule 6.02(c) of the Company's
Disclosure Schedule; provided, however, that with respect to each such
executive, (i) he or she remains an executive of the Company from the date
hereof through the Closing Date, and (ii) prior to or contemporaneously with the
effective date of such new supplemental executive retirement plan, he or she
agrees in writing (A) to reduce the benefits to be received under such new
supplemental executive retirement plan by the amount of any benefits actually
received pursuant to the Plan under any previous supplement executive retirement
plan of the Company so as to prevent the double-counting of benefits and (B)
that Buyer's acquisition of the Company pursuant to the terms hereof does not
constitute a "Change of Control" as that term is defined under such new
supplemental executive retirement plan.

          6.03    Indemnification. (a) From and after the Closing Date, Buyer
shall, and shall cause the Company to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each
person who is now, or

has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement or who becomes such
prior to the Closing Date, an officer or director of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or a Company-designated officer or director of a joint venture in
which the Company participates (the "Indemnified Parties") against (i) any and
all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys'
fees and expenses), fines, liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in
settlement with the approval of Buyer (which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) of or in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation based in whole or in part on or arising in whole or
in part out of the fact that such person is or was an officer or director of the
Company, such Subsidiary or such joint venture, whether pertaining to any action
or omission existing or occurring at or prior to the Closing Date and whether
asserted or claimed prior to, or at or after, the Closing Date ("Indemnified
Liabilities"), and (ii) all Indemnified Liabilities based in whole or in part
on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that such
indemnification shall not be applicable to any claims made against the
Indemnified Parties to the extent that a nonappealable judgment or other final
adjudication established that (A) their acts or omissions were committed in bad
faith or were the result of active and deliberate dishonesty and were material
to the cause of action so deliberated or (B) the liability arose out of, based
upon or attributable to the gaining in fact of any financial profit or other
advantage to which they were not legally entitled. Buyer or the Company shall
pay all expenses of each Indemnified Party in advance of the final disposition
of any such action or proceeding to the fullest extent permitted by law. Without
limiting the foregoing, in the event any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation is brought against any Indemnified Party after the Closing Date,
(i) the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to them
and Buyer, (ii) Buyer or the Company shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses
of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor are
received, and (iii) Buyer and the Company shall use all reasonable efforts to
assist and cooperate in the vigorous defense of any such matter; provided that
(i) neither Buyer nor the Company shall be liable for any settlement of any
claim effected without the written consent of Buyer, which consent, however,
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and (ii) neither Buyer nor the
Company shall settle any claim without the written consent of the applicable
Indemnified Party, which consent, however, shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, unless (A) Buyer or the Company undertakes to unconditionally and
irrevocably indemnify the applicable Indemnified Party with respect to the
subject matter of the proposed settlement or (B) the settlement provides for an
unconditional and irrevocable release of the Indemnified Party without any
payment by or obligation of the Indemnified Party. Any Indemnified Party wishing
to claim indemnification under this Section 6.03, upon learning of any such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall notify Buyer and the
Company (but the failure so to notify Buyer and the Company shall not relieve
Buyer and the Company from any liability which they may have under this Section
6.03 except to the extent such failure materially prejudices Buyer or the
Company). The Indemnified Parties as a group may retain only one law firm (in
addition to local counsel if reasonably required) to represent them with respect
to each such matter unless there is, under applicable standards of professional
conduct, a conflict on any significant issue between the positions of any two or
more Indemnified Parties. To the extent any Indemnified Party is required to
bring any action to enforce rights or to collect moneys due under this Agreement
and is successful in such action, Buyer or the Company shall reimburse such
Indemnified Party for all its expenses in bringing and pursuing such action.

person, then and in either such case, proper provisions shall be made so that

the obligations set forth in this Section 6.03.

          (c)     Sections 6.03(a) and (b) are intended to be for the benefit
of, and will be enforceable by, the Indemnified Parties and their respective
successors and heirs, and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights that an Indemnified Party may have by contract or otherwise.
