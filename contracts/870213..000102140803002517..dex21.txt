and the deliveries required by Sections 1.04, 1.06 and 1.07, the closing of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Closing") will take
place at the offices of Jones, Day, Reavis and Pogue, 222 East 41st Street, New

delivery of the Preliminary Balance Sheet, unless another date, time or place
is mutually agreed to in writing by the parties hereto (the "Closing
Date").   (b) At the Closing, (i) Buyer will pay, on behalf of the
Company, the Purchase Price as it may be adjusted pursuant to Section 1.04,
less the amount specified under clause (ii) below, by wire transfer of
immediately available United States funds to the Distribution Trust, at an
account identified by the Distribution Trust Representative before the
Closing Date, for the distribution of such amount pursuant to the Plan and
(ii) Buyer will deliver the Escrow Amount by wire transfer of immediately

reasonably acceptable to Buyer and the Distribution Trust Representative,
under an escrow agreement to be entered into on or before the Closing Date by
and among Buyer, the Distribution Trust (by the Distribution Trust

permitted by Section 4.02(e).   (c) At the Closing, there shall also be
delivered to the Company and Buyer the certificates and other documents to be
delivered under Articles VII and VIII.   1.04 Purchase Price Adjustment. No
later than five Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company will
deliver to Buyer (i) an unaudited estimated consolidated balance sheet of the
Company as of immediately prior to the Closing (the "Preliminary Balance
Sheet"), prepared in good faith applying the same accounting principles and
policies used in preparing the September Balance Sheet (the "Company
Accounting Principles and Policies"), (ii) a schedule (the "Preliminary Pre-
Closing Working Capital Schedule"), based on the Preliminary Balance Sheet,
setting forth the Company\'s calculation of the estimated Working Capital of
the Company as of immediately prior to the Closing ("Preliminary Pre-Closing
Working Capital"), (iii) a schedule (the "Allowed Secured Claims Schedule")
setting forth the Company\'s calculation of the aggregate Allowed Secured
Claims as of the Closing Date, and (iv) a certificate of the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company stating (A) that such
Preliminary Balance Sheet and Preliminary Pre-Closing Working Capital
Schedule represent the Company\'s good faith estimate of the consolidated
financial position of the Company as of immediately prior to the Closing
applying the Company Accounting Principles and Policies and (B) that such
Allowed Secured Claims Schedule represents the Company\'s good faith estimate
of all Allowed Secured Claims as of the Closing Date. The Preliminary Balance
Sheet shall not give effect to Buyer\'s payment of the Purchase Price, or to
other payments or discharges of claims or liabilities to be made pursuant
to this Agreement or the Plan on or as a result of the Closing Date, but
shall accrue and reflect as current liabilities, among other current
liabilities, all Assumed Administrative Claims, all Priority Tax Claims to
the extent such Priority Tax Claims were not accrued and reflected on the
September Balance Sheet, and all cure costs associated with the assumption of
Contracts, whether assumed before or after the date of this Agreement, to the
extent not fully paid before the Closing Date. If the Preliminary Pre-Closing
Working Capital reflected on the Preliminary Pre-Closing Working Capital
Schedule is less than negative $102,949,000 (i.e., total current liabilities
are more than $102,949,000 greater than total current assets), then the
Purchase Price paid at Closing shall be reduced by the amount of such
shortfall. If the Preliminary Pre-Closing Working Capital reflected on the
Preliminary Pre-Closing Working Capital Schedule is greater than negative
$102,949,000 (i.e., total current liabilities are less than $102,949,000
greater than total current assets), then the Purchase Price to be paid at
Closing shall be increased by the amount of such excess.   1.05 Post-
Closing Working Capital Adjustment. (a) Buyer shall cooperate with the
Distribution Trust Representative to jointly prepare the following documents
within forty-five Business Days following the Closing Date: (i) an unaudited
consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of immediately prior to the
Closing (the "Final Balance Sheet"), prepared in good faith applying the
Company Accounting Principles and Policies, and (ii) a schedule (the "Final
Pre-Closing Working Capital Schedule" and, together with the Final Balance
Sheet, the "Closing Financials"), based on the Final Balance Sheet, setting
forth (A) a calculation of the Working Capital of the Company as
of immediately prior to the Closing ("Final Pre-Closing Working Capital") and
(B) a calculation of the amount by which the   - 3 -    Purchase Price
should be adjusted, either upward or downward, to the extent the Final Pre-
Closing Working Capital is greater than or less than the Preliminary Pre-
Closing Working Capital (such difference being the "Working Capital
Amount Due"). The Final Balance Sheet shall not give effect to Buyer\'s
payment of the Purchase Price, or to other payments or discharges of claims
or liabilities to be made pursuant to this Agreement or the Plan on or as a
result of the Closing Date, but shall accrue and reflect as current
liabilities, among other current liabilities, all Assumed Administrative
Claims, all Priority Tax Claims to the extent such Priority Tax Claims were
not accrued and reflected on the September Balance Sheet, and all cure costs
associated with the assumption of Contracts, whether assumed before or after
the date of this Agreement, to the extent not fully paid before the Closing
Date. Buyer shall cause the Company to provide to the Distribution Trust
Representative such reasonable access during normal business hours to
financial and other information of the Company as he or she may request in
good faith to assess the Closing Financials. If Buyer and the Distribution
Trust Representative agree upon the Working Capital Amount Due within forty-
five Business Days following the Closing Date, the Working Capital Amount Due
shall be paid in accordance with Section 1.05(d) or 1.05(e), as applicable,
and Sections 1.05(b) and 1.05(c) shall not apply. If Buyer and
the Distribution Trust Representative are unable to so agree, then within
fifty Business Days following the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to
the Distribution Trust Representative the Closing Financials that Buyer
determines satisfy this Section 1.05(a) and all the remaining provisions of
this Section 1.05 shall apply.   (b) The Distribution Trust Representative
may notify Buyer in writing within five Business Days following delivery of
the Closing Financials as prepared by Buyer (the "Dispute Period") that (i)
the Distribution Trust Representative agrees with the Working Capital Amount
Due as calculated by Buyer (an "Approval Notice") or (ii) the Distribution
Trust Representative disagrees with the Working Capital Amount Due as
prepared by Buyer, identifying in reasonable detail the items of such Closing
Financials with which the Distribution Trust Representative disagrees (a
"Dispute Notice"). Upon receipt by Buyer of a Dispute Notice, Buyer will use
good faith efforts during the ten Business Day period following the date of
receipt of a Dispute Notice (the "Resolution Period") to resolve with the
Distribution Trust Representative any differences they may have as to the
calculation of the Working Capital Amount Due. During the Dispute Period and
Resolution Period, Buyer shall cause the Company to provide to the
Distribution Trust Representative such reasonable access during normal
business hours to financial and other information of the Company as he or she
may request in good faith to assess the Closing Financials. If Buyer and the
Distribution Trust Representative cannot reach written agreement during the
Resolution Period, within five Business Days thereafter, their disagreements,
limited to those issues still in dispute (the "Disputed Items"), shall be
promptly submitted for arbitration before PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP or
another independent Accounting Firm mutually satisfactory to Buyer and the
Distribution Trust Representative (the "Independent Accountant"), which firm
shall conduct such additional review as is necessary to resolve the Disputed
Items. Based upon such review, the Independent Accountant shall prepare a
schedule (the "Independent Accountant Schedule") setting forth (A) its
determination of the Disputed Items, (B) its calculation of the Working
Capital of the Company as of immediately prior to the Closing and (C) its
calculation of the Working Capital Amount Due. The Independent Accountant
Schedule shall be completed by the Independent Accountant as promptly as
practicable but in no event later than twenty days following the   - 4
-    selection of the Independent Accountant and shall be confirmed by
the Independent Accountant in writing to, and shall be final and binding on,
Buyer and the Distribution Trust for purposes of this Section 1.05.   (c)
The fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant shall be paid equally by
Buyer and the Distribution Trust.   (d) If the Working Capital Amount Due is
owed to Buyer, then no later than the second Business Day after, as
applicable, the (i) receipt by Buyer of an Approval Notice, (ii) expiration
of the Dispute Period if Buyer has not received an Approval Notice or a
Dispute Notice within such period, (iii) expiration of the Resolution Period
if Buyer and the Distribution Trust Representative have resolved any
differences regarding the Working Capital Amount Due within such period and
(iv) receipt of the Independent Accountant Schedule (the date of such
applicable event, the "Escrow Determination Date"), Buyer and the
Distribution Trust Representative shall deliver a written notice to the
Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement instructing the Escrow Agent to
pay (A) the Working Capital Amount Due from the Escrow Amount to Buyer and
(B) the remainder of the Escrow Amount, if any, to the Distribution Trust, as
part of the Purchase Price, for the distribution of such amount pursuant
to the Plan, in each case by wire transfer of immediately available funds,
without setoff or deduction of any kind, within two Business Days of receipt
of such letter of instruction.   (e) If the Working Capital Amount Due is
owed to the Distribution Trust, then no later than the second Business Day
after the Escrow Determination Date, (A) Buyer shall, on behalf of the
Company and as part of the Purchase Price, pay the Working Capital Amount Due
to the Distribution Trust for the distribution of such amount pursuant to the
Plan and (B) Buyer and the Distribution Trust Representative shall deliver a
written notice to the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement
instructing the Escrow Agent to pay, within two Business Days of receipt of
such letter of instruction, the Escrow Amount, also as part of the Purchase

to the Plan, in each case by wire transfer of immediately available funds,
without set-off or deduction of any kind.   1.06 Restricted Funds. No later
than five Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company will deliver
to Buyer a schedule (the "Restricted Funds Schedule"), certified on behalf of
the Company by its Chief Financial Officer as being true and complete in all
material respects, setting forth, as of the date of delivery of the
Restricted Funds Schedule, the dates on which any Restricted Funds were
transferred to the Restricted Funds Trust, the amounts of such transfers, the
sources of such Restricted Funds and the aggregate amount of all Restricted
Funds transferred to the Restricted Funds Trust (which aggregate amount shall
be deducted from the Purchase Price in accordance with Section 1.02).
Following the delivery to Buyer of the Restricted Funds Schedule, no Debtor
shall transfer any Restricted Funds to the Restricted Funds Trust.   1.07
Excluded Assets. Section 1.07 of the Company\'s Disclosure Schedule sets

Subsidiaries since CERCLA became effective, and no notice has been received
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries informing the Company or such
Subsidiary of potential liability for a release of a hazardous substance

any statute of limitations in respect of material Taxes or agreed to any
extension of time with respect to a material Tax assessment or
deficiency.   (d) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party
to any tax allocation or sharing agreement. Neither the Company nor any of

person, other than any member of the group the common parent of which is the
Company, under Reg. Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state,

otherwise.   (e) The reserve for Tax liability (other than any reserve
for deferred taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and
tax income) set forth on the face of the Audited Financial Statements was
adequate under GAAP to cover Tax liabilities of the Company and its
Subsidiaries through the date thereof, and (2) that reserve as adjusted for
operations and transactions through the Closing Date in accordance with the

pursuant to the Confirmation Order at or prior to the Closing. Except for
common law trademarks, the material patents and trademarks that are included

Office. The Company has taken such other commercially reasonable actions to
ensure the full protection of its and its Subsidiaries\' respective rights

to be accrued, disclosed or reserved against in the Audited Financial

practicable. The Plan and the Disclosure Statement shall include terms and
conditions that effect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, and shall
not include any terms or conditions that are inconsistent with the terms

actions to address such misstatement or omission as required by the
Bankruptcy Court.   (c) If the Confirmation Order, the Order approving the

shall cause the Debtor Subsidiaries to, take all such steps as may be
reasonable and appropriate to defend against such appeal, petition or motion

and proposal for the Company.   (e) Buyer will not file any pleading or take
any other action in the Bankruptcy Court with respect to this Agreement, the
Plan or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
that is inconsistent with performing and carrying out the provisions of this
Agreement in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions herein;
provided, however, that nothing contained in the foregoing will be construed
to limit in any way Buyer\'s rights under this Agreement, including Buyer\'s
rights under Article IX of this Agreement, or to limit Buyer\'s rights to
advocate for the approval of this Agreement and the Plan effectuating it and
against any Alternative Transaction or Plan that does not effectuate this
Agreement.   5.03 Assumption of Contracts Between Execution and Closing. On

costs associated with the assumption of Contracts, whether assumed before or
after the date of this Agreement, shall be accrued and reflected on the

right to discharge under Section  1141 of the Bankruptcy Code or any other
provision of the Bankruptcy  Code, other than as provided in the Plan;   -
24 -     (ii) From and after the Closing, all parties in interest  whose
claims against the Company or a Debtor Subsidiary are discharged  by the Plan

disclosed or reserved against in the  Company\'s consolidated financial

and   (iv) To the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, at  or upon
the Closing, Buyer, the Debtors and their respective  directors, officers,
agents, attorneys, affiliates, employees and  other representatives are

or related to the negotiation or  preparation of the Plan and this Agreement,
the conduct of the  Auction, or the conduct and administration of the
Reorganization Cases  in any other respect, except to the extent that any
such Liability  arises solely from fraudulent or willful misconduct and
except that  nothing in such provision of the Plan shall impair Buyer\'s
rights to  enforce any provision of this Agreement to be performed on or
after  the Closing Date.   5.05 Letters of Credit and Surety Bonds. The
parties will cooperate to, effective as of the Closing, obtain substitutions

benefits) depend, in whole or in part, on length of service, credit will be
given to current employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries for
service with the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date;
provided that such crediting of service does not result in duplication of
benefits. Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to,
honor in accordance with their terms all employee benefit plans (as defined
in Section 3(3) of ERISA) and the other Benefit Plans; provided, however,
that Buyer, the Company, or its Subsidiaries may amend, modify or terminate
any Benefit Plan in accordance with its terms and applicable law; provided,
further, that, for a period of at least two years after the Closing Date, no
such amendment, modification or termination shall result in compensation
(including salary or wage rate, as applicable, and bonus opportunity) and

favorable, in the aggregate, than the compensation and benefits that are
provided to them immediately prior to the Closing Date.   (b) As of the
Closing Date, Buyer shall enter into new employment agreements with the
executives of the Company identified by the Company to Buyer and agreed to by
Buyer prior to the date of this Agreement in accordance with the terms

agreement, he or she agrees in writing (A) to the termination of, and waives
in writing any rights under, any previous employment agreement with
the Company and (B) that Buyer\'s acquisition of the Company pursuant to the
terms hereof does not constitute a "Change of Control" as that term is
defined under such new employment agreement.   (c) As of the Closing Date,
Buyer shall offer a new supplemental executive retirement plan to the
executives of the Company identified by the Company to Buyer and agreed to by
Buyer prior to the date of this Agreement in accordance with the terms

however, that with respect to each such executive, (i) he or she remains an
executive of the Company from the date hereof through the Closing Date, and

supplemental executive retirement plan, he or she agrees in writing (A) to
reduce the benefits to be received under such new supplemental executive
retirement plan by the amount of any benefits actually received pursuant to
the Plan under any previous supplement executive retirement plan of the
Company so as to prevent the double-counting of benefits and (B) that
Buyer\'s acquisition of the Company pursuant to the terms hereof does
not constitute a "Change of Control" as that term is defined under such
new supplemental executive retirement plan.   6.03 Indemnification. (a)
From and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company to,
indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person who is now, or   - 27
-    has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement or who
becomes such prior to the Closing Date, an officer or director of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or a Company-designated officer or director of a
joint venture in which the Company participates (the "Indemnified Parties")
against (i) any and all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses (including
reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses), fines, liabilities or judgments or
amounts that are paid in settlement with the approval of Buyer (which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of or in connection
with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation based in whole or
in part on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such person is
or was an officer or director of the Company, such Subsidiary or such joint
venture, whether pertaining to any action or omission existing or occurring
at or prior to the Closing Date and whether asserted or claimed prior to, or
at or after, the Closing Date ("Indemnified Liabilities"), and (ii) all
Indemnified Liabilities based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or
in part out of, or pertaining to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby; provided, however, that such indemnification shall not
be applicable to any claims made against the Indemnified Parties to the
extent that a nonappealable judgment or other final adjudication established
that (A) their acts or omissions were committed in bad faith or were the
result of active and deliberate dishonesty and were material to the cause of
action so deliberated or (B) the liability arose out of, based upon or
attributable to the gaining in fact of any financial profit or
other advantage to which they were not legally entitled. Buyer or the Company
shall pay all expenses of each Indemnified Party in advance of the final
disposition of any such action or proceeding to the fullest extent permitted
by law. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event any such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation is brought against any Indemnified Party
after the Closing Date, (i) the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel
reasonably satisfactory to them and Buyer, (ii) Buyer or the Company shall
pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified
Parties promptly as statements therefor are received, and (iii) Buyer and the
Company shall use all reasonable efforts to assist and cooperate in the
vigorous defense of any such matter; provided that (i) neither Buyer nor the
Company shall be liable for any settlement of any claim effected without the
written consent of Buyer, which consent, however, shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed and (ii) neither Buyer nor the Company shall settle any
claim without the written consent of the applicable Indemnified Party, which
consent, however, shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, unless (A)
Buyer or the Company undertakes to unconditionally and irrevocably indemnify
the applicable Indemnified Party with respect to the subject matter of the
proposed settlement or (B) the settlement provides for an unconditional and
irrevocable release of the Indemnified Party without any payment by or
obligation of the Indemnified Party. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim
indemnification under this Section 6.03, upon learning of any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall notify Buyer and the Company
(but the failure so to notify Buyer and the Company shall not relieve Buyer
and the Company from any liability which they may have under this
Section 6.03 except to the extent such failure materially prejudices Buyer or
the Company). The Indemnified Parties as a group may retain only one law firm
(in addition to local counsel if reasonably required) to represent them with
respect to each such matter unless there is, under applicable standards of
professional conduct, a conflict on any significant issue between the
positions of any two or more Indemnified Parties. To the extent any
Indemnified Party is required to bring any action to enforce rights or to
collect moneys due under this Agreement and is successful in such action,
Buyer or the Company shall reimburse such Indemnified Party for all its
expenses in bringing and pursuing such action.   - 28 -     (b) In the
event Buyer or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all
or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then and in
either such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the continuing or
surviving entity or transferee, as appropriate, shall assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 6.03.   (c) Sections 6.03(a) and (b) are intended
to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, the Indemnified Parties
and their respective successors and heirs, and are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights that an Indemnified Party may have by
contract or otherwise.   ARTICLE VII  CONDITIONS TO OBLIGATIONS OF
