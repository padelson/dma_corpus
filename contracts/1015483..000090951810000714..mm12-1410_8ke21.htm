AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

  

  


 

  

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of December 14, 2010 (this
"Agreement"), is among TransForce Inc., a Canadian corporation ("Parent"),
TransForce Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and an indirect wholly
owned Subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and Dynamex Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the "Company"). Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement
are defined in Section 8.11.

  

  

WHEREAS, concurrently with entering into this Agreement, the Company (i)
terminated the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 1, 2010,
among DashNow Holding Corp., a Delaware corporation ("DashNow Parent" ),
DashNow Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation ("DashNow Merger Sub" ), and
the Company, as amended by that certain Amendment No. 1 to Agreement and Plan
of Merger, dated as of November 30, 2010, among the Company, DashNow Parent
and DashNow Merger Sub (the "Prior Merger Agreement") pursuant to, and in
accordance with, Section 7.1(d)(ii) of the Prior Merger Agreement and (ii)
paid DashNow Parent the "No-Shop Termination Fee" (as defined in the Prior
Merger Agreement);

  

  

WHEREAS, the parties intend that Merger Sub be merged with and into the
Company, with the Company surviving that merger on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement as a result of which the Company
will become an indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent (the "Merger");

  

  

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company has unanimously (i) determined
in accordance with Section 5.3 of the Prior Merger Agreement that the Merger
and the consummation of the Transactions constitute a "Superior Proposal" (as
defined in the Prior Merger Agreement); (ii) determined in accordance with
Section 5.3 of the Prior Merger Agreement that that failure to enter into this
Agreement would violate the directors' fiduciary duties to the Company's
stockholders under applicable Law; (iii) determined that it is advisable and
in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to terminate the
Prior Merger Agreement (in accordance with Section 7.1(d)(ii) of the Prior
Merger Agreement), to pay the "No-Shop Termination Fee" (as defined in the
Prior Merger Agreement) and to enter into this Agreement; (iv) determined that
the termination of the Prior Merger Agreement (in accordance with Section
7.1(d)(ii) of the Prior Merger Agreement), the payment of the "No-Shop
Termination Fee" (as defined in the Prior Merger Agreement), the entry into of
this Agreement and the Transactions are fair to, and in the best interests of,
the Company and its stockholders; (v) approved the termination of the Prior
Merger Agreement (in accordance with Section 7.1(d)(ii) of the Prior Merger
Agreement), the payment of the "No-Shop Termination Fee" (as defined in the
Prior Merger Agreement) and the execution, delivery and performance by the
Company of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, including
the Merger; and (vi) resolved to recommend adoption of this Agreement by the
stockholders of the Company; and

  

  

WHEREAS, the board of directors of each of Parent and Merger Sub have approved
this Agreement and declared it advisable for Parent and Merger Sub,
respectively to enter into this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows:

  

  

  

ARTICLE I

  

  

The Merger

  

  

SECTION 1.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company, and the separate corporate existence of
Merger Sub shall thereupon cease, and the Company shall be the surviving
corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation").

  

  

SECTION 1.2 Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take
place at 10:00 a.m. (Central time) on a date to be specified by Parent and
reasonably acceptable to the Company (as such date may be changed as provided
herein, the "Closing Date"), which date shall be no later than the fourth
(4th) business day after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
Article VI (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those
conditions at the Closing), at the offices of Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP, 200
Crescent Court, Suite 300 Dallas, Texas 75201, unless another time, date or
place is agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company.

  

  

SECTION 1.3 Effective Time. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as
soon as practicable on the Closing Date the parties shall file with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger, executed
in accordance with, and in such form as is required by, the relevant
provisions of the DGCL (the "Certificate of Merger"). The Merger shall become
effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger or at such later time
as is agreed to by the parties hereto and specified in the Certificate of
Merger (the time at which the Merger becomes effective is herein referred to
as the "Effective Time").

  

  

SECTION 1.4 Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth
in the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject
thereto, at the Effective Time, all the properties, rights, privileges, powers
and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger
Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

2  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

SECTION 1.5 Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving
Corporation. At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, in
the form of Exhibit A and Exhibit B hereto, respectively, shall be the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation (except
that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be Dynamex Inc.), until
thereafter amended as provided herein or by applicable Law (subject to Section
5.9 hereof).

  

  

SECTION 1.6 Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

(a) The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the
Effective Time, until their respective successors are duly elected or
appointed and qualified or their earlier death, resignation or removal in
accordance with the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation.

  

  

(b) The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors
are duly appointed and qualified or their earlier death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the
Surviving Corporation.

  

  

ARTICLE II 
 

  

  

Effect of the Merger on the Capital Stock of the Constituent Corporations;
Exchange of Certificates; Company Stock Options; Other Equity Awards

  

  

  

SECTION 2.1 Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of the
Company's common stock, par value $.01 per share ("Company Common Stock"), or
any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub:

  

  

(a) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each issued and outstanding share of capital
stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $.01 per share,
of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

(b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock. Any shares of
Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury stock, and any
shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or Merger Sub, shall be
automatically canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

  

  

(c) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each issued and outstanding share of
Company Common Stock (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with
Section 2.1(b) and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted automatically

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

3  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive $25.00 in cash,
without interest (the "Merger Consideration"). As of the Effective Time, each
such share of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate (or evidence of shares in book-entry form) which immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented any such share of Company Common Stock
(each, a "Certificate") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be paid in
consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with
Section 2.2(b), without interest.

  

  

SECTION 2.2 Exchange of Certificates.

  

  

(a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank
or trust company, which shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company, to act
as agent for the holders of shares of Company Common Stock in connection with
the Merger (the "Paying Agent") to receive, on terms reasonably acceptable to
the Company, for the benefit of holders of shares of Company Common Stock, the
aggregate Merger Consideration to which holders of shares of Company Common
Stock shall become entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(c). Parent shall deposit,
or cause to be deposited, such aggregate Merger Consideration with the Paying
Agent as soon as practicable following the Effective Time (but in any event
within one (1) business day after the date on which the Effective Time shall
occur). Such aggregate Merger Consideration deposited with the Paying Agent
shall, pending its disbursement to such holders, be invested by the Paying
Agent in accordance with instructions from Parent in (i) short-term direct
obligations of the United States of America, (ii) short-term obligations for
which the full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to
provide for the payment of principal and interest, (iii) short-term commercial
paper rated the highest quality by either Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and Poor's Ratings Services or (iv) money market funds investing
solely in a combination of the foregoing.

  

  

(b) Payment Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event
more than five (5) business days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Company Common
Stock entitled to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(c) (i)
a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and which shall be in such form and
shall have such other customary provisions (including customary provisions
with respect to delivery of an "agent's message" with respect to shares held
in book-entry form)) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of the Certificates in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with
such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance
with the instructions (and such other customary documents as may reasonably be
required by the Paying Agent), the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration, without
interest, for each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered shall immediately be

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

canceled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered,
it shall be a condition of payment that (x) the Certificate so surrendered
shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by separate stock powers) and shall
otherwise be in proper form for transfer (and the signature on the endorsement
or stock power, as the case may be, shall be guaranteed by an "eligible
guarantor institution," as such term is defined in Rule 17Ad-15 under the
Exchange Act) and (y) the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any
transfer and other similar taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax either has been paid
or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2,
each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated
by this Article II, without interest.

  

  

(c) Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock. The Merger
Consideration paid in respect of shares of Company Common Stock upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this
Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock previously represented
by such Certificates, and at the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of
the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time,
the holders of Certificates that evidenced ownership of shares of Company
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease
to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock, except
as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. Subject to the last
sentence of Section 2.2(e), if, at any time after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they
shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

  

  

(d) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit (in the form
required by Parent) of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be
lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such
Person of a bond, in such amount as is sufficient to provide a full indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in
respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificate, as contemplated by this Article II.

  

  

(e) Termination of Fund. At any time following the nine (9) month anniversary
of the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require
the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received
with respect thereto) that had been made available to the Paying Agent and
which have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates, and thereafter such
holders shall be entitled to look

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

5  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

only to Parent and the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property,
escheat or other similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to
the payment of any Merger Consideration that may be payable upon surrender of
any Certificates held by such holders, as determined pursuant to this
Agreement, without any interest thereon. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by
such holders at such time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, the property of Parent, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  

  

(f) No Liability. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, none of the parties hereto, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any Person for Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
other similar Law.

  

  

(g) Withholding Taxes. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted
and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder (collectively, the "Code"), or under any provision of state, local
or foreign tax Law. To the extent amounts are so withheld and paid over to the
appropriate taxing authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.

  

  

SECTION 2.3 Appraisal Rights.

  

  

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of
Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and which are held by a stockholder who did not vote in favor
of the Merger (or consent thereto in writing) and who is entitled to demand
and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who complies in
all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the "Dissenting
Stockholders"), shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right
to receive the Merger Consideration (the "Dissenting Shares"). At the
Effective Time, (i) the holder or holders of Dissenting Shares shall be
entitled only to such rights as may be granted to him, her, it or them under
Section 262 of the DGCL, and (ii) such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.3(a), if any Dissenting
Stockholder shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right (through
failure to perfect such appraisal rights or otherwise), such holder's shares
of Company Common Stock (i) shall no longer be deemed Dissenting Shares and
(ii) shall be treated as if they had been converted automatically into and
become exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the
Merger Consideration for each such share of Company Common Stock, in
accordance with Section 2.1, without any interest thereon.

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

(c) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, any withdrawals of such
demands and any other instrument served on the Company pursuant to Section 262
of the DGCL, and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to any demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The
Company shall not offer to make, agree to make, or make any payment with
respect to any demands for appraisal without the prior written consent of
Parent.

  

  

SECTION 2.4 Company Stock Options; Other Equity Awards.

  

  

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary
to provide that, and shall cause, each option outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (whether or not then vested or exercisable) that represents
the right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock (each, an "Option") shall
at the Effective Time be cancelled and terminated and converted at the
Effective Time into the right to receive a cash amount equal to the Option
Consideration, if any, for each share of Company Common Stock then subject to
the Option. The Option Consideration shall be paid by the Surviving
Corporation on the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and the
Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Option Consideration
otherwise payable such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of
state, local or foreign tax Law. For purposes of this Agreement, "Option
Consideration" means, with respect to any share of Company Common Stock
issuable under a particular Option, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of
(x) the Merger Consideration per share of Company Common Stock over (y) the
exercise price payable in respect of such share of Company Common Stock
issuable under such Option.

  

  

(b) All restrictions and conditions on each share of restricted stock granted
under the Company Stock Plans (the "Company Restricted Stock") that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Closing, other than the Company
Restricted Stock set forth in Section 2.4(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, shall immediately lapse as of, and conditioned upon, the occurrence
of the Closing and the Company Restricted Stock shall be converted in
accordance with Section 2.1(c).

  

  

(c) Each performance unit granted under the Company Stock Plans (each, a
"Company Performance Unit") that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Closing, other than the Company Performance Unit set forth in Section 2.4(c)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule, shall automatically vest in accordance
with the terms of the applicable award agreement and plan document, and be
settled (i) in Company Common Stock effective as of, and conditioned upon, the
occurrence of the Closing and converted in accordance with Section 2.1(c) or
(ii) to the extent permitted thereby, in cash by the Surviving Corporation on
the Closing Date.

  

  

SECTION 2.5 Adjustments. Notwithstanding any provision of this Article II to
the contrary, if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

7  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

number of shares or a different class by reason of the occurrence or record
date of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization,
split, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction, the Merger
Consideration shall be appropriately equitably adjusted to reflect such stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination,
exchange of shares or similar transaction.

  

  

  

ARTICLE III

  

  

Representations and Warranties of the Company

  

  

The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that except as
disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to Parent

Schedule") or in (or incorporated by reference in) the Filed Company SEC
Documents (other than any disclosure in the Company SEC Filings (x) set forth
under "Risk Factors" or under the heading "Competition," "Regulation,"
"Safety," "Available Information," "'Safe Harbor' Statement Under The Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act," "Foreign Exchange Exposure," or "Interest
Rate Exposure" or (y) that is not factual information but merely cautionary
language) (it being understood that any matter disclosed in the Company
Disclosure Schedule or in (or incorporated by reference in) such Company SEC
Documents shall be deemed disclosed with respect to any Section of this
Article III to which the matter relates, to the extent the relevance of such
matter to such section is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure):

  

  

SECTION 3.1 Organization, Standing and Corporate Power.

  

  

(a) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction in
which it is incorporated and has all requisite corporate power and authority
necessary to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by
it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased
by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the
failure to be so licensed, qualified or in good standing, individually or in
the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined below). For purposes of this
Agreement, "Company Material Adverse Effect" shall mean any change, event,
occurrence or effect which has had or would reasonably be expected to (i) have
a material adverse effect on the results of operations, condition (financial
or otherwise), business, assets or liabilities of such party and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, other than changes, events, occurrences or
effects (A) generally affecting (I) the industry of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, provided that such changes, events, occurrences or effects do
not disproportionately affect such party and its Subsidiaries, or (II) the
economy, or financial or capital markets, in the United States or elsewhere in
the world, including changes in interest or exchange rates, or (B) arising out

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

8  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

of, resulting from or attributable to (I) changes in Law or in generally
accepted accounting principles or in accounting standards, or changes in
general legal, regulatory or political conditions, (II) acts of war, sabotage
or terrorism, or any escalation or worsening of any such acts of war, sabotage
or terrorism threatened or underway as of the date of this Agreement, (III)
earthquakes, hurricanes, tornados or other natural disasters, (IV) the
negotiation, execution, announcement or performance of this Agreement or the
consummation of the Transactions, including the impact thereof on
relationships, contractual or otherwise, with customers, suppliers,
distributors, partners or employees, or any litigation arising from
allegations of breach of fiduciary duty or violation of Law relating to this
Agreement or the Transactions, (V) any action taken by the Company or its
Subsidiaries as contemplated or permitted by this Agreement or with Parent's
consent, or any failure by the Company to take any action as a result of the
restrictions in Article V, or (VI) any decline in the market price, or change
in trading volume, of the capital stock of the Company or any failure to meet
publicly announced revenue or earnings projections (with respect to subclause
(VI) of this clause (B), it being understood and agreed that the facts and
circumstances giving rise to such change, event, occurrence or effect that are
not otherwise excluded from the definition of Company Material Adverse Effect
may be taken into account in determining whether there has been a Company
Material Adverse Effect); provided, that such changes, events, occurrences or
effects referred to in subclauses (I) - (III) of this clause (B) do not
disproportionately affect the Company and its Subsidiaries, or (ii) impair in
any material respect the ability of the Company to perform its obligations
hereunder or prevent or materially delay consummation of the Transactions.

  

  

(b) Section 3.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists all Subsidiaries
of the Company together with the jurisdiction of organization of each such
Subsidiary. All the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other equity
interests in, each Subsidiary of the Company have been duly authorized and
validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and are owned directly or
indirectly by the Company free and clear of all Liens and transfer
restrictions, except for such transfer restrictions of general applicability
as may be provided under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Securities Act"), and other
applicable securities laws. Except as set forth in Section 3.1(b) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company does not own, directly or indirectly,
any capital stock, voting securities or equity interests in any Person.

  

  

(c) The Company has prior to the date of this Agreement delivered to Parent
complete and correct copies of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of
the Company, as amended to the date of this Agreement (the "Company Charter
Documents"), and complete and correct copies of the certificates of
incorporation and by-laws (or comparable organizational documents) of each of
its Subsidiaries (the "Subsidiary Documents"), in each case as amended to the
date of this Agreement. All such Company Charter Documents and Subsidiary
Documents are in full force and effect and neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is in violation of any of their respective provisions. The
Company has prior to the date of this Agreement made

10  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock, voting
securities or equity interests (or any options, warrants or other rights to

the Prior Merger Agreement, pay the "No-Shop Termination Fee" (as defined in
the Prior Merger Agreement), execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform
its obligations hereunder and, subject to obtaining the Company Stockholder

authorization, execution and delivery hereof by the other parties hereto,
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable

enforceability (i) may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws of general
application affecting or relating to the enforcement of creditors' rights
generally and (ii) is subject to general principles of equity, whether
considered in a proceeding at law or in equity (the "Bankruptcy and Equity

Agreement), the payment of the "No-Shop Termination Fee" (as defined in the
Prior Merger Agreement) and the execution, delivery and performance by the
Company of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, including
the Merger; and (vi) resolved to recommend adoption of this Agreement by the
stockholders of the Company.

  

  

(c) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company nor
the consummation by the Company of the Transactions, nor compliance by the
Company with any of the terms or provisions hereof, will (with or without the
giving of notice, the lapse of time, or both) (i) conflict with or violate any
provision of the Company Charter Documents or any of the Subsidiary Documents
or (ii) assuming that the authorizations, consents and approvals referred to
in Section 3.4 and the Company Stockholder Approval are obtained and the

Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of their assets
are bound, except, in the case of clause (ii)(y), for such violations or
defaults as individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company nor the consummation
by the Company of the Transactions, nor compliance by the Company with any of
the terms or provisions hereof, will (with or without the giving of notice,
the lapse of time, or both) violate or constitute a default under any of the
terms, conditions or provisions of the Prior Merger Agreement.

(collectively, "Foreign Antitrust Laws"), no consents or approvals of, or
filings, declarations or registrations with, any Governmental Authority are
necessary for the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and
the consummation by the Company of the Transactions, other than such other
consents, approvals, filings, declarations or registrations that, if not
obtained, made or given, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

SECTION 3.5 Company SEC Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities.

  

  

(a) The Company has timely filed all required reports, schedules, forms,
certifications, prospectuses and registration, proxy and other statements with
the SEC since July 31, 2007 (collectively, and in each case including all

As of their respective effective dates (in the case of Company SEC Documents

all other Company SEC Documents), the Company SEC Documents complied as to
form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and

(or, if amended prior to the date of this Agreement, the date of the filing of
such amendment, with respect to the disclosures that are amended) contained
any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements

(b) The consolidated financial statements of the Company included in the
Company SEC Documents have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in
the case of unaudited quarterly statements, as indicated in the notes thereto)
applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except (i) as may
be indicated in the notes thereto or (ii) as permitted by Regulation S-X) and
fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial position of
the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the
consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the periods then
ended (subject, in the case of unaudited interim statements, to normal year-
end audit adjustments that are not, in the aggregate, material).

  

  

(c) The Company has established and maintains internal control over financial
reporting and disclosure controls and procedures (as such terms are defined in
Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act); such disclosure controls
and procedures are designed to ensure that material information relating to
the Company, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, required to be disclosed
by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act
is accumulated and communicated to the Company's principal executive officer
and its principal financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure; and such disclosure controls and procedures are effective
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC
rules and forms. The Company's principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer have disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation, to
the Company's auditors and the audit committee of the board of directors of
the Company (x) all significant deficiencies in the design or operation of
internal controls which could adversely affect the Company's ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial data and have identified for
the Company's auditors any material weaknesses in internal controls and (y)
any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the Company's internal controls. The
principal executive officer and the principal financial officer of the Company
have timely made all certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the
Exchange Act and any related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC with
respect to the Company SEC Documents, and the statements contained in such
certifications are complete and correct. The management of the Company has
completed its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal
control over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended July 31, 2010, and
such assessment concluded that such controls were effective.

  

  

(d) Since July 31, 2007, neither the Company nor, to the Knowledge of the
Company, any Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has
received any complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or
oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures,
methodologies or methods of the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to
the Company's consolidated financial statements included in the Company SEC
Documents or the internal accounting controls of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, including any written or oral complaint, allegation,

whether or not employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has
reported evidence of a material violation of securities laws, breach of
fiduciary duty or similar violation by the Company or its Subsidiaries or any

has discharged, demoted, suspended, threatened, harassed or in any other
manner discriminated against an employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in the terms and conditions of employment because of any act of
such employee described in 18 U.S.C. § 1514A(a).

  

  

(f) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature whatsoever (whether direct or indirect, fixed or
contingent, known or unknown, due or to become due, accrued or otherwise, and
whether or not determined or determinable), except (i) liabilities reflected
or reserved against on the audited balance sheet of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of July 31, 2010 (the "Balance Sheet Date" ) (including the

business consistent with past practice, (iii) liabilities contemplated by this

that are no less favorable to the Company than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement.

  

  

(b) On the date of this Agreement, the Company shall and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors, employees,
consultants, agents, advisors, Affiliates and other representatives
(collectively, the "Representatives") to (i) immediately cease any
solicitation, encouragement, discussions or negotiations with any Persons that
may be ongoing with respect to a Takeover Proposal and with any Persons who
have made or indicated an intention to make a Takeover Proposal, and (ii)
request each such Person to promptly return or destroy all confidential
information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries. Except as permitted
by this Section 5.3, the Company shall not, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries and Representatives not to, from the date as of this Agreement
until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with Article VII, directly or indirectly, (A) solicit, initiate or

on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the Company

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

35  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

Stockholder Approval, the Company or any of its Representatives receives a
bona fide written unsolicited Takeover Proposal from any Person, which
Takeover Proposal was made or renewed on or after the date of this Agreement
and that did not result from any breach of this Section 5.3, if the board of
directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with
nationally-recognized independent financial advisors and nationally-recognized
outside legal counsel, that (i) failure to take such action would violate the
directors' fiduciary duties to the Company's stockholders under applicable Law
and (ii) such Takeover Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to result
in a Superior Proposal, then the Company and its Representatives may (x)
furnish, pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, information
(including non-public information) with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the Person or group of Persons who has made such Takeover
Proposal; provided that the Company shall promptly (and in any event within
twenty-four (24) hours) provide to Parent any material non-public information
provided orally and any non-public information provided in writing, in each
case, concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries that is provided to any
Person given such access which was not previously provided to Parent or its
Representatives; and (y) engage in or otherwise participate in discussions or
negotiations with the Person or group of Persons making such Takeover
Proposal; provided, further that the Company shall promptly provide to Parent
(and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) the identity of the Person
making the Takeover Proposal. From and after the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall not grant any waiver, amendment or release under any standstill
agreement without the prior written consent of Parent.

  

  

(d) Following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed of any material developments, discussions or negotiations
regarding any Takeover Proposal on a current basis (and in any event within
twenty-four (24) hours) and shall, from and after the date of this Agreement,
promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) provide to Parent
(i) a written summary of the terms of any such Takeover Proposal not made in
writing (other than terms that are, individually and in the aggregate,
inconsequential) and (ii) copies of any written materials provided by any
Person(s) making a Takeover Proposal (including a copy of any Takeover
Proposal made in writing). The Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries
will not enter into any confidentiality agreement with any Person subsequent
to the date of this Agreement which prohibits the Company from providing any
information to Parent in accordance with this Section 5.3.

  

  

(e) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.3(e), the board of
directors of the Company shall not (i)(A) fail to make the Company Board
Recommendation or fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the
Proxy Statement, (B) change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, or
publicly propose to change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, in a manner
adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation, (C) take any formal
action or make any recommendation or public statement in connection with a
tender offer or exchange offer other than a recommendation against such offer
or a temporary "stop, look and listen" communication by the board of directors
of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

36  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

Exchange Act, or (D) adopt, approve or recommend, or publicly propose to
approve or recommend to the stockholders of the Company a Takeover Proposal
(actions described in this clause (i) being referred to as a "Company Adverse
Recommendation Change"), (ii) subject to the compliance by the Company with
Section 7.1(d)(ii), authorize, cause or permit the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, agreement or agreement in
principle or other Contract with respect to any Takeover Proposal (other than
an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) (each, a "Company Acquisition
Agreement") or (iii) take any action pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, prior to the time the Company
Stockholder Approval is obtained, but not after, the board of directors of the
Company may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or enter into a
Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Takeover Proposal, if and only
if, prior to taking such action, the board of directors of the Company has
determined in good faith, after consultation with nationally-recognized
independent financial advisors and nationally-recognized outside legal
counsel, (i) that failure to take such action would violate the directors'
fiduciary duties to the Company's stockholders under applicable Law and (ii)
that such Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; provided,
however, that (w) the Company has given Parent at least four (4) business
days' prior written notice of its intention to take such action (which notice
shall specify the material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal
(including the identity of the party making such Superior Proposal) and has
contemporaneously provided a copy of the relevant proposed transaction
agreements with the party making such Proposal), (x) the Company has
negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith
with Parent during such notice period to the extent Parent wishes to
negotiate, to enable Parent to revise the terms of this Agreement, such that
it would cause such Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior
Proposal, (y) following the end of such notice period, the board of directors
of the Company shall have considered in good faith any changes to this
Agreement, proposed in writing by Parent, and shall have determined that the
Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if such
revisions were to be given effect, and (z) in the event of any change to the
terms of such Superior Proposal (other than changes that are, individually and
in the aggregate, inconsequential), the Company shall, in each case, have
delivered to Parent an additional notice and the four (4) business day notice
period shall have recommenced unless the event requiring notice pursuant to
clause (z) of this Section 5.3(e) occurred less than four (4) business days
prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, in which case the Company shall
deliver notice to Parent of such event as promptly as practicable; and
provided, further, that the Company has complied in all material respects with
its obligations under this Section 5.3 and provided, further, that
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any purported
termination of this Agreement pursuant to this sentence shall be void and of
no force and effect, unless the Company termination is in accordance with
Section 7.1 and the Company pays Parent the Termination Fee in accordance with
Section 7.3 prior to or concurrently with such termination.

  

  

(f) Except to the extent provided in Section 5.3(e), nothing in this Section
5.3 shall prohibit the board of directors of the Company from taking and

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

37  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the
Exchange Act, if failure to do so would violate applicable Law.

  

  

(g) For purposes of this Agreement:

  

  

"Takeover Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person
(other than Parent and its Subsidiaries but including, for the avoidance of
doubt, DashNow Parent, Greenbriar Equity Group LLC and their respective
Affiliates) or "group", within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange
Act, relating to, in a single transaction or series of related transactions,
any (i) acquisition of assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries equal to
more than 20% of the Company's consolidated assets or to which more than 20%
of the Company's revenues or earnings on a consolidated basis are
attributable, (ii) acquisition of more than 20% of the outstanding Company
Common Stock, (iii) tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would
result in any Person beneficially owning more than 20% of the outstanding
Company Common Stock, (iv) merger, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction
involving the Company or (v) any combination of the foregoing types of
transactions if the sum of the percentage of consolidated assets, consolidated
revenues or earnings and Company Common Stock involved is more than 20%; in
each case, other than the Transactions.

  

  

"Superior Proposal" means any bona fide written Takeover Proposal (i) that
includes consideration per share of Company Common Stock that is greater than
the per share Merger Consideration and that the board of directors of the
Company has determined in its good faith judgment (after consultation with
nationally-recognized independent financial advisors and nationally-recognized
outside legal counsel) is reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance
with its terms without unreasonable delay, taking into account all legal,
regulatory and financial aspects of the proposal (including certainty of
financing) and the Person making the proposal, and if consummated, would
result in a transaction more favorable to the Company's stockholders from a
financial point of view than the Merger (including any changes to the terms of
this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such proposal or otherwise)
and (ii) accompanied by executed customary financing commitments from
recognized financing sources not subject to any due diligence conditions and
that, together with available cash on hand, are sufficient to fund the cash
portion of such Takeover Proposal; provided that for purposes of the
definition of "Superior Proposal", the references to "20%" in the definition
of Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "50%."

  

  

SECTION 5.4 Commercially Reasonable Efforts.

  

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties
hereto shall cooperate with the other parties and use (and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective commercially reasonable
efforts to promptly (i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or
cause to be done, all things, necessary, proper or advisable to cause the
conditions to Closing to be satisfied as

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

38  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

promptly as practicable and to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, the Transactions, including preparing and
filing promptly and fully all documentation to effect all necessary filings,
notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information,
applications and other documents (including any required or recommended
filings under applicable Antitrust Laws), and (ii) obtain all approvals,
consents, expirations of waiting periods, registrations, permits,
authorizations and other confirmations from any Governmental Authority or
third party necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Transactions. For
purposes hereof, "Antitrust Laws" means the Sherman Act, as amended, the
Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as
amended, all applicable Foreign Antitrust Laws and all other applicable Laws
issued by a Governmental Authority that are designed or intended to prohibit,
restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or
restraint of trade or lessening of competition through merger or acquisition.

  

  

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, (i) each party
hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act and all applicable Foreign Antitrust Laws with respect
to the Transactions as promptly as practicable and in any event within five
(5) business days of the date of this Agreement and use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to supply as promptly as practicable any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant
to the HSR Act or such applicable Foreign Antitrust Laws necessary to cause
the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR
Act and the applicable Foreign Antitrust Laws (including any extensions
thereof) as soon as practicable and (ii) the Company and Parent shall each use
its commercially reasonable efforts to (x) take all action necessary to ensure
that no state takeover statute or similar Law is or becomes applicable to any
of the Transactions and (y) if any state takeover statute or similar Law
becomes applicable to any of the Transactions, use their commercially
reasonable efforts to ensure that the Transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise minimize the effect of such Law on the Transactions. Each party
shall request early termination of the HSR Act waiting period. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary provided in this Section 5.4, Parent and its
Affiliates hereby agree to sell or otherwise dispose of, hold separate
(through the establishment of a trust or otherwise), or divest itself of all
or any portion of the business or assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries to
eliminate any impediment that may be asserted under any Law governing
competition, monopolies or restrictive trade practices.

  

  

(c) Each of the parties hereto shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing
or submission with a Governmental Authority in connection with the
Transactions and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry by or
before a Governmental Authority relating to the Transactions, including any
Action initiated by a private party, and to contest and resist any Action by
or before a Governmental Authority (including any Action contemplated in
Section 5.10) and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

39  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or
restricts consummation of the Transactions, and (ii) keep the other party
informed in all material respects and on a reasonably timely basis of any
material communication received by such party from, or given by such party to,
the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice, the Canadian Competition Bureau or any other Governmental Authority
and of any material communication received or given in connection with any
Action by a private party, in each case regarding any of the Transactions.
Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, each of
the parties hereto shall have the right to review in advance, and to the
extent practicable each will consult the other on, all the information
relating to the other parties and their respective Subsidiaries, as the case
may be, that appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted
to, any third party and/or any Governmental Authority in connection with the
Transactions. Parent shall pay all fees associated with the filings made by
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company in accordance with this Section 5.4.

  

  

SECTION 5.5 Financing. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations and instruments which may
be reasonably requested by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the
termination of the Revolver at the Effective Time, including customary payoff
letters, lien releases and instruments of termination or discharge.

  

  

SECTION 5.6 Public Announcements. The initial press release with respect to
the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be
reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Thereafter, neither the
Company nor Parent shall issue or cause the publication of any press release
or other public announcement (to the extent not previously issued or made in
accordance with this Agreement) with respect to the Merger, this Agreement or
the other Transactions without the prior consent of the other party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as may be
required by Law or by any applicable listing agreement with the Nasdaq Stock
Market LLC or the Toronto Stock Exchange as determined in the good faith
judgment of the party proposing to make such release (in which case such party
shall not issue or cause the publication of such press release or other public
announcement without prior consultation with the other party).

  

  

SECTION 5.7 Access to Information; Confidentiality. The Company shall, and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and Parent's
Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to the
Company's and its Subsidiaries' properties, books, Contracts, commitments,
records and correspondence (in each case, whether in physical or electronic
form), officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other
Representatives and the Company shall furnish promptly to Parent (i) a copy of
each report, schedule and other document filed by it pursuant to the
requirements of Federal or state securities Laws and a copy of any
communication (including "comment letters") received by the Company from the
SEC concerning compliance with securities Laws and (ii) such other information
concerning its and its Subsidiaries' business, properties and personnel as
Parent may reasonably request

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

40  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

(provided that Parent and its representatives shall conduct any such
activities in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business
or operations of the Company). Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the
Company nor its Subsidiaries shall be obligated to provide any such access or
information to the extent that it would (x) require disclosure by the Company
or such Subsidiary of information subject to attorney-client privilege, (y)
conflict with confidentiality obligations to which the Company or such
Subsidiary is bound, or (z) violate any applicable Laws (including Antitrust
Laws); provided that the foregoing shall not limit the obligation of the
Company under Section 5.3(c) to promptly (and in any event within twenty-four
(24) hours) provide to Parent any material non-public information provided
orally and any non-public information providing in writing, in each case
concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries that is provided to any Person
under Section 5.3 which was not previously provided to Parent or its
Representatives. Except for disclosures permitted by the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of October 7, 2010, between the Company
and Parent (as it may be amended from time to time, the "Confidentiality
Agreement"), Parent and its representatives shall hold information received
from the Company pursuant to this Section 5.7 in confidence in accordance with
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 5.8 Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (a)
any notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental
Authority in connection with the Transactions or from any Person alleging that
the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Transactions, if the subject matter of such communication or the failure of
such party to obtain such consent could be material to the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, (b) any Actions commenced or, to such party's
knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting
such party or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to the Transactions, (c)
the discovery of any fact or circumstance that, the occurrence or non-
occurrence of which, would cause any representation or warranty made by such
party contained in this Agreement (i) that is qualified as to materiality or
Company Material Adverse Effect or "material adverse effect" or a similar
qualifier, as the case may be, to be untrue and (ii) that is no so qualified
to be untrue in any material respect and (d) any material failure of such
party to comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be complied with
or satisfied by it hereunder; provided, however, that the delivery of any
notice pursuant to this Section 5.8 shall not (x) cure any in accuracy or
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein
or (y) limit the remedies available to the party receiving such notice.

  

  

SECTION 5.9 Indemnification and Insurance.

  

  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Company and the Surviving Corporation to, (i) until the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time shall occur or, if longer,
until all claims for indemnification in respect of any claims made prior to
the end of such six (6) year period shall have been finally resolved,
indemnify and hold harmless each individual who at the Effective Time is, or
at any time prior to the Effective Time was, a director or officer of

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

41  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

the Company or of a Subsidiary of the Company (each, an "Indemnitee" and,
collectively, the "Indemnitees" ) with respect to all claims, liabilities,
losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties, costs (including amounts paid in
settlement or compromise) and reasonable expenses (including reasonable fees
and expenses of legal counsel) in connection with any Action (whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative), whenever asserted, based on or
arising out of, in whole or in part, (A) the fact that an Indemnitee was a
director or officer of the Company or such Subsidiary or (B) acts or omissions
by an Indemnitee in the Indemnitee's capacity as a director, officer, employee
or agent of the Company or such Subsidiary or taken at the request of the
Company or such Subsidiary (including in connection with serving at the
request of the Company or such Subsidiary as a director, officer, employee,
agent, trustee or fiduciary of another Person (including any employee benefit
plan)), in each case under (A) or (B), at, or at any time prior to, the
Effective Time (including any Action relating in whole or in part to the
Transactions), to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, and (ii)
assume all obligations of the Company and such Subsidiaries to the Indemnitees
in respect of indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time as provided in (x) the
Company Charter Documents and the organizational documents of such
Subsidiaries as currently in effect and (y) the indemnification agreements
listed on Section 5.9 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, which shall survive
the Transactions and continue in full force and effect in accordance with
their respective terms for a period of at least six (6) years. Without
limiting the foregoing, Parent shall, from and after the Effective Time and
until the sixth (6th) anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time
shall occur or, if longer, until all claims for indemnification in respect of
any claims made prior to the end of such six (6) year period shall have been
finally resolved, cause the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the
Surviving Corporation to contain provisions no less favorable to the
Indemnitees with respect to limitation of liabilities of directors and
officers and indemnification than are set forth as of the date of this
Agreement in the Company Charter Documents, which provisions shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnitees. In addition, from and after
the Effective Time and until the sixth (6th) anniversary of the date on which
the Effective Time shall occur or, if longer, until all claims for
indemnification in respect of any claims made prior to the end of such six (6)
year period shall have been finally resolved, Parent shall, and shall cause
the Company and the Surviving Corporation to, advance any expenses (including
reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel) of any Indemnitee under this
Section 5.9 (including in connection with enforcing the indemnity and other
obligations referred to in this Section 5.9) as incurred to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, provided that the person to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances to the extent required
by applicable Law.

  

  

(b) At the Company's election, (i) the Company shall obtain prior to the
Effective Time "tail" insurance policies with a claims period of at least six
(6) years from the Effective Time with respect to the directors' and officers'
liability insurance in amount and scope no less favorable than the existing
policy of the Company for claims

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

42  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

arising from facts or events that occurred on or prior to the Effective Time
at a cost that does not exceed 250% of the annual premium currently paid by
the Company for DandO Insurance (as defined below); or (ii) Parent will provide,
or cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, for a period of not less than
six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Indemnitees who are insured under
the Company's directors' and officers' insurance and indemnification policy
with an insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for events
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (the "DandO Insurance" ) that is no
less favorable, taken as a whole, than the existing policy of the Company or,
if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best
available coverage; provided, however, that Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall not be required to pay an aggregate amount for the DandO
Insurance during such six (6) year period in excess of 250% of the annual
premium currently paid by the Company for such insurance; provided, further,
that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with
the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

  

  

(c) The provisions of this Section 5.9 are (i) intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or
her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have
by contract or otherwise. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation under this Section 5.9 shall not be terminated or modified in such
a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee to whom this
Section 5.9 applies unless (x) such termination or modification is required by
applicable Law or (y) the affected Indemnitee shall have consented in writing
to such termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that the
Indemnitees to whom this Section 5.9 applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this Section 5.9).

  

  

(d) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations thereof set
forth in this Section 5.9.

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Action (whether
arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is made against any Indemnitee
on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of
this Section 5.9 shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such
Action.

  

  

SECTION 5.10 Securityholder Litigation. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any securityholder
litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to the
Transactions, and no such settlement shall be agreed to without Parent's prior
consent.

  

  

SECTION 5.11 Fees and Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

43  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses,
whether or not the Transactions are consummated.

  

  

SECTION 5.12 Rule 16b-3. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take
such steps as may be reasonably requested by any party hereto to cause
dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities)
pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual
who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

  

  

SECTION 5.13 Employee Matters. Parent shall, for a period of six (6) months
immediately following the Closing Date, cause the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries to provide employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the
"Company Employees" ) during their employment with (x) the same level of base
salary as in effect on the Closing Date and (y) employee benefit plans,
programs, contracts and arrangements, other than equity-based plans, that are
no less favorable, in the aggregate, than similar employee benefit plans,
programs, contracts and arrangements provided by the Company and its
subsidiaries to Company Employees prior to the Closing Date. Parent or one of
its Affiliates shall recognize the service of Company Employees with the
Company prior to the Closing Date as service with Parent and its affiliates in
connection with any tax-qualified pension plan, 401(k) savings plan, welfare
benefit plans and policies (including vacations and holiday policies)
maintained by Parent or one of its Affiliates which is made available
following the Closing Date by Parent or one of its Affiliates for purposes of
any waiting period, vesting, eligibility and benefit entitlement (but
excluding benefit accruals other than in the case of severance pay and
vacation entitlement), except to the extent such credit would result in a
duplication of benefits or is prohibited under Law. Parent shall (i) waive, or
cause its insurance carriers to waive, all limitations as to pre-existing and
at-work conditions, if any, with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to Company Employees under any welfare benefit plan
(as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) which is made available to Company
Employees following the Closing Date by Parent or one of its affiliates to the
same extent as under any similar type of welfare benefit plan applicable to
Company Employees prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) provide credit to
Company Employees for any co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses
paid by such employees under the employee benefit plans, programs and
arrangements of the Company and its subsidiaries during the portion of the
relevant plan year including the Closing Date. The provisions of this Section
5.13 are solely for the benefit of the Parties, and no other Person, including
any current or former employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their dependents or beneficiaries shall be regarded as a third party
beneficiary of this Section 5.13. No provision of this Agreement shall be
construed as amending any Company Plan or as limiting the ability of the
Company, Parent or any Affiliate of either to terminate the employment of any
Company Employee or the service of any Independent Contractor or to amend or
terminate any Company Plan.

Conditions Precedent

enacted, promulgated, issued, entered, amended or enforced by any Governmental
Authority (collectively, "Restraints" ) shall be in effect enjoining,

the consummation of the Merger illegal.

  

  

SECTION 6.2 Conditions to Obligations of Parent and Merger Sub. The
obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to effect the Merger are further subject
to the satisfaction (or waiver, if permissible under applicable Law) on or
prior to the Closing Date of the following conditions:

  

  

(a) Representations and Warranties. The representations and warranties of the

3.6(b), 3.18, 3.19 and 3.20 shall be true and correct on and as of the date of
this Agreement and as of the Closing Date as if made on and as of the Closing
Date (or, with respect to Section 3.18, at and as of the specific date given),
(ii) Section 3.2(a) shall be true and correct in all but de minimis respects
on and as of the date of this Agreement and as if made on and as of the

(iii) this Agreement, other than those Sections specifically identified in
subclause (i) or (ii) of this paragraph, disregarding all qualifications and

Adverse Effect, shall be true and correct on and as of the date of this
Agreement and as of the Closing Date as if made on the Closing Date (or, if
given as of a specific date, at and as of such date), except where the failure
to be true and correct, individually or in the aggregate, would not constitute
a Company Material Adverse Effect. Parent shall have received a certificate
signed on behalf of the Company by the chief executive officer or the chief
financial officer of the Company to such effect;

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

45  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

(b) Performance of Obligations of the Company. The Company shall have

be true and correct in all material respects, in each case on and as of the
date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date as though made on and as of
the Closing Date (or, if given as of a specific date, at and as of such date),
except where the failure to be true and correct would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to impair in any material respect the
ability of Parent or Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this
Agreement or prevent or materially delay consummation of the Transactions. The
Company shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of Parent by the
chief executive officer or the chief financial officer of Parent to such
effect; and

  

  

(b) Performance of Obligations of Parent and Merger Sub. Parent and Merger Sub
shall have performed in all material respects all obligations required to be

the Company shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of Parent by
the chief executive officer or the chief financial officer of Parent to such

SECTION 6.4 Frustration of Closing Conditions. None of the Company, Parent or
Merger Sub may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in Section 6.1,
6.2 or 6.3, as the case may be, to be satisfied if such failure was caused by
such party's failure to use its commercially reasonable efforts to consummate
the Merger and the other Transactions, as required by and subject to Section
5.4.

ARTICLE VII

  

  

Termination

  

  

SECTION 7.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the Transactions
abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after
receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval (except as otherwise expressly
noted):

  

  

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Company and Parent duly authorized by
each of their respective boards of directors; or

  

  

(b) by either of the Company or Parent:

  

  

(i) if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before May 31, 2011
(the "Walk-Away Date" ); provided, however, that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 7.1(b)(i) shall not be available to a party if
the failure of the Merger to have been consummated on or before the Walk-Away
Date was primarily due to the failure of such party to perform any of its
obligations under this Agreement; or

  

  

(ii) if any Restraint having the effect set forth in Section 6.1(c) shall be
in effect and shall have become final and nonappealable; provided, however,
that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(b)(ii) shall
not be available to a party if the issuance of such final, nonappealable
Restraint was primarily due to the failure of such party to perform any of its
obligations under this Agreement; or

  

  

(iii) if the Company Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained at the
Company Stockholders Meeting duly convened therefor or at any adjournment or
postponement thereof; or

  

  

(c) by Parent,

  

  

(i) if the Company shall have materially breached or failed to perform any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.2(a) or (b) and (B) cannot be
cured by the Company by the earlier of (x) twenty (20) calendar days following
receipt of written notice from Parent of such breach or failure or (y) the
Walk-Away Date; or

  

  

(ii) if: (A) the board of directors of the Company shall have failed to
include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement or shall have
effected a Company Adverse Recommendation Change; (B) at any time prior to the
Company Stockholder Approval, the board of directors of the Company shall have
failed to recommend against any Takeover Proposal, or failed to reaffirm the
Company Board Recommendation, in each case, within five (5) business days
after (x) the public announcement of any Takeover Proposal and (y) the receipt
of a written request to do so

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

47  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

from Parent; (C) the Company enters into a Company Acquisition Agreement; (D)
the Company shall have failed to call the Company Stockholders Meeting in
accordance with Section 5.1(b) or shall have failed to prepare and mail the
Proxy Statement in accordance with Section 5.1(a) and either such breach shall
remain uncured for ten (10) business days after the Company's receipt of
written notice thereof from Parent; or (E) the Company or the board of
directors of the Company shall have publicly announced its intention to do any
of the foregoing; or

  

  

(d) by the Company:

  

  

(i) if Parent or Merger Sub shall have materially breached or failed to
perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set
forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give
rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.3(a) or (b) and (B)
cannot be cured by Parent by the earlier of (x) twenty (20) calendar days
following receipt of written notice from the Company of such breach or failure
or (y) the Walk-Away Date; or

  

  

(ii) prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, in order to
concurrently enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement that constitutes a
Superior Proposal, if, (A) the Company has (without giving effect to any
materiality qualifiers set forth in Section 5.3) complied in all material
respects with the requirements of Section 5.3 and (B) prior to or concurrently
with such termination, the Company pays the fee due under Section 7.3 (as
contemplated by clause (y) of Section 7.3(a)).

  

  

SECTION 7.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement as provided in Section 7.1, written notice thereof shall be given to
the other party or parties, specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which
such termination is made, and this Agreement shall forthwith become null and
void (other than Sections 7.2 and 7.3 and Article VIII and the Confidentiality
Agreement in accordance with their respective terms, all of which shall
survive termination of this Agreement), and there shall be no liability on the
part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, except (a) the Company may have
liability as provided in Section 7.3, and (b) such termination shall not
relieve any party from liability for any willful and material breach of this
Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, "willful and material breach" shall
mean a material breach that is a consequence of an act or failure to act by
the breaching party with the knowledge that such act or failure to act would,
or would be reasonably expected to, cause a material breach of this Agreement.

SECTION 7.3 Termination Fee.

  

  

(a) In the event that:

  

  

(i) (A) a Takeover Proposal shall have been made, proposed or communicated,
after the date of this Agreement and not withdrawn prior to the Company
Stockholders Meeting or prior to the termination of this Agreement if there
has been no Company Stockholders Meeting, and (B) following the occurrence of
an event described in the preceding clause (A), this Agreement is terminated
by the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(i) or Section 7.1(b)(iii)
or by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(i) and (C) the Company enters into a
definitive agreement with respect to any Takeover Proposal, or any Takeover
Proposal is consummated, in either case within one (1) year after the date
this Agreement; provided that for purposes of clause (C) of this Section
7.3(a)(i), the references to "20%" in the definition of Takeover Proposal
shall be deemed to be references to "50%"; or

  

  

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section
7.1(d)(ii); or

  

  

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii);

  

  

then, in any such event under clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of this Section
7.3(a), the Company shall pay as directed by Parent the Termination Fee (as
defined below), by wire transfer of immediately available funds (x) in the
case of Section 7.3(a)(iii), within two (2) business days after such
termination, (y) prior to or currently with such termination if pursuant to
Section 7.1(d)(ii), or (z) in the case of Section 7.3(a)(i), two (2) business
days after the earlier of the entry into a Company Acquisition Agreement or
the consummation of a Takeover Proposal; it being understood that in no event
shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one
occasion. As used herein, "Termination Fee" shall mean a cash amount equal to
$7,729,106.

  

  

(b) Each of the parties hereto acknowledge that the agreements contained in
this Section 7.3 are an integral part of the Transactions, and that without
these agreements, the other party would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if the Company fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to
this Section 7.3, and, in order to obtain the payment, Parent commences a suit
which results in a judgment against the Company for the payment set forth in
this Section 7.3, the Company shall pay Parent's reasonable and documented
costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys' fees) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on such amount at the prime
rate as published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made through the date such payment was actually
received.

SECTION 8.1 No Survival of Representations and Warranties. The
representations, warranties and agreements in this Agreement shall terminate
at the Effective Time or, except as otherwise provided in Section 7.2, upon
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1, as the case may be,
except that the agreements set forth in Article II and Sections 5.9, 5.11, and
5.13 and any other agreement in this Agreement which contemplates performance
after the Effective Time shall survive the Effective Time indefinitely. The
Confidentiality Agreement shall (i) survive termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms and (ii) terminate as of the Effective Time.

  

  

SECTION 8.2 Amendment or Supplement. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
this Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and all respects, whether
before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, by written
agreement of the parties hereto, by action taken by their respective boards of
directors; provided, however, that following approval of the Transactions by
the stockholders of the Company, there shall be no amendment or change to the
provisions hereof which by Law would require further approval by the
stockholders of the Company without such approval.

  

  

SECTION 8.3 Extension of Time, Waiver, Etc. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, any party may, subject to applicable Law, (a) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties of any other party hereto, (b) extend the
time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of any other party
hereto or (c) waive compliance by the other party with any of the agreements
contained herein or, except as otherwise provided herein, waive any of such
party's conditions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub in exercising any right hereunder shall operate
as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude
any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right
hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension
or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed
on behalf of such party.

  

  

SECTION 8.4 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the parties without the prior written
consent of the other parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable
by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
Any purported assignment not permitted under this Section shall be null and
void.

  

  

SECTION 8.5 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (each
of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together
shall constitute one and the same agreement) and shall become effective when
one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered
to the other parties.

SECTION 8.6 Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement and
the Company Disclosure Schedule together with the other instruments referred
to herein including the Confidentiality Agreement (a) constitute the entire
agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof and (b) except for (i) if the Effective Time
occurs, (A) the right of the Company's stockholders to receive the Merger
Consideration at the Effective Time and (B) the right of the holders of
Options to receive the Option Consideration on the Closing Date; and (ii) the
provisions of Section 5.9, are not intended to and shall not confer upon any
Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub hereby expressly
acknowledge and agree that, prior to the Effective Time, the Company's measure
of damages for a willful and material breach of this Agreement by Parent or
Merger Sub may include the loss of the economic benefits of the Transactions
to the Company's stockholders and holders of Options, whether or not this
Agreement has been validly terminated pursuant to Article VII.

  

  

SECTION 8.7 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.

  

  

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
Laws of the State of Delaware, applicable to contracts executed in and to be
performed entirely within that State.

  

  

(b) Each of the parties hereto, on behalf of itself and its respective
Affiliates, (i) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the
Delaware Court of Chancery or the other courts of the State of Delaware, in
each case in connection with any dispute arising out of, in connection with,
in respect of, or in any way relating to (A) the negotiation, execution and
performance of this Agreement and the Transactions, (B) the interpretation and
enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and any agreements entered
into in connection herewith, or (C) any actions of or omissions of any party
in any way connected with, related to or giving rise to any of the foregoing
matters (clauses (A)-(C) collectively, the "Covered Matters"), (ii) hereby
waives, and agrees not to assert as a defense in any Action with regard to or
involving a Covered Matter that such Action may not be brought or is not
maintainable in said courts or that venue thereof may not be appropriate or
that this Agreement or any agreement entered into in connection herewith may
not be enforced in any such court, (iii) irrevocably agree that all claims
with respect to any such Action shall be heard and determined exclusively by
such courts, (iv) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such
court, (v) consents to and grants to any such court jurisdiction over the
person of such parties and over the subject matter of any such dispute and
agrees that the mailing of process or other papers in connection with such
Action in the manner specified in Section 8.9 or in such other manner as may
be permitted by Law shall be valid and sufficient service thereof and (vi)
agrees that it will not bring any Action relating to any Covered Matter in any
court other than any such court. Each of the parties, on behalf of itself and
each of its Affiliates, irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection
to the laying of venue of any Action arising out of this Agreement or the
Transactions in Delaware Court of Chancery or other courts of the

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

51  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

State of Delaware, as applicable pursuant to clause (i) above, and hereby
further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or
claim in any such court that any such Action brought in any such court has
been brought in an inconvenient forum.

  

  

(c) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE COVERED
MATTERS.

  

  

SECTION 8.8 Specific Enforcement. The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the
Delaware Court of Chancery or the other courts of the State of Delaware, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other
hand hereby agree not to raise any objections to the availability of the
equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement by such party or parties, and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants and obligations of such party or parties under this Agreement.

SECTION 8.10 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
