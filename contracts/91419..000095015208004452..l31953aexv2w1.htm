TRANSACTION AGREEMENT 

   

 This Transaction Agreement (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of June 4, 2008, is among The Procter and Gamble Company, an Ohio corporation (" _Parent_ "), The Folgers Coffee Company, a Delaware corporation and presently a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Folgers_ "), The J.M. Smucker Company, an Ohio corporation (" _RMT Partner_ "), and Moon Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned Subsidiary of RMT Partner (" _Merger Sub_ "). 

  

RECITALS 

   

 1. Parent directly and indirectly through its wholly owned Subsidiaries is engaged in the Coffee Business; 

  

 2. Parent has determined that it would be appropriate and desirable to separate the Coffee Business from Parent; 

  

 3. Prior to the Effective Time on the Closing Date (or as otherwise contemplated by Section 2.5 of the Separation Agreement) Parent will: 

  

 A. Pursuant to the Separation Agreement, effect the Folgers Transfer and Recapitalization; 

   

 B. Pursuant to the Separation Agreement and after the completion of the Folgers Transfer and Recapitalization, effect the Distribution; 

   

 4. The Boards of Directors of Parent, Folgers, RMT Partner and Merger Sub have each approved and declared advisable the Merger of Merger Sub with and into Folgers immediately following the Distribution, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL; 

  

 5. In the event that not all of the shares of Folgers Common Stock that are issued to Parent in the Folgers Stock Issuance are subscribed for in the Exchange Offer (if Parent determines to effect the Distribution through an Exchange Offer), Parent will distribute the balance of such shares of Folgers Common Stock on a _pro rata_ basis to its shareholders immediately following the consummation of the Exchange Offer through the Clean-Up Spin Off as provided in the Separation Agreement; 

  

 6. For federal income tax purposes, it is intended that (i) the Distribution should be tax-free to Parent and to the Parent shareholders pursuant to Section 361 and Section 355 of the Code, respectively, and (ii) the Merger will qualify as a tax-free reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code, and the parties intend that the execution of the Separation Agreement and this Agreement constitutes a plan of reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code; and 

  

 7. Simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement, and as an inducement to Parent to enter into this Agreement, certain shareholders of RMT Partner have entered into the Voting Agreement. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Accordingly, the Parties agree as follows: 

  

I. THE MERGER; INITIAL ISSUANCE OF FOLGERS STOCK; AMENDMENT AND 
 RESTATEMENT OF RMT PARTNER ARTICLES 

   

 1.01 __The Merger__. (a) On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, Merger Sub will be merged (the " _Merger_ ") with and into Folgers in accordance with the provisions of the DGCL. Immediately following the Merger, Folgers will continue as the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and will be a wholly owned Subsidiary of RMT Partner, and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease. 

  

 (b) On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, the consummation of the Distribution and the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at Jones Day, 222 East 41st Street, New York, New York, at 10:00 a.m., local time on the third Business Day following satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ hereof (other than those conditions, including the Distribution, that by their nature or pursuant to the terms of this Agreement are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, where permitted, the waiver of those conditions), or at such other date, time or place as Parent and RMT Partner may agree. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to as the " _Closing Date_." 

   

 (c) The Merger will be consummated by the filing of a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate Of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, in such form as required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the date and time of the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or such later time as is specified in the Certificate of Merger and as is agreed to by Parent and RMT Partner, the " _Effective Time_ "). 

   

 (d) The Merger will have the effects set forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of Folgers and Merger Sub will vest in Folgers as the Surviving Corporation and all debts, liabilities and duties of Folgers (including all of the obligations under the Folgers Credit Facility) and Merger Sub will become the debts, liabilities and duties of Folgers as the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (e) The text of the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation in effect at the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger, be amended and restated so as to be identical to the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (except that the name of the corporation set forth in the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation will continue to be "The Folgers Coffee Company"), until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. The bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (f) The initial directors of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time will be the directors of Merger Sub. The initial officers of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time will be the officers of Folgers at the Effective Time (after taking into account the resignations contemplated by _Section 2.2(a)(vi)_ of the Separation Agreement). Each of such initial officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation will hold office from the Effective Time until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in the manner provided by the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation or as otherwise provided by Law. 

   

 1.02 __Initial Issuance of Folgers Stock__. (a) As contemplated by _Section 1.1(a)(i)_ of the Separation Agreement and subject to adjustment as provided in Section 1.02(c), in partial consideration for the transfer of Assets contemplated by _Section 1.2_ of the Separation Agreement, Folgers will issue and deliver to Parent a number of shares of Folgers Common Stock equal to (i) (A) 1.1524 (the " _Exchange Ratio_ "), multiplied by (B) the number of shares of RMT Partner Common Stock on a Fully Diluted Basis; _less_ (iii) the number of shares of Folgers common stock outstanding immediately prior to the issuance of Folgers Common Stock pursuant to this _Section 1.02_. 

  

 (b) For purposes of this Agreement: 

    

 (i) " _Fully Diluted Basis_ " shall mean the Parties best estimate, made in good faith, of (i) the number of shares of RMT Partner Common Stock that are outstanding as of the Closing Date, plus (ii) (a) the number of restricted shares of RMT Partner Common Stock and deferred stock units outstanding as of the Closing Date (assuming, for purposes of this calculation, that all of the Permitted Equity Awards will be outstanding as of the Closing Date) and (b) the number of shares of RMT Partner Common Stock issuable upon exercise of any options or rights of any nature, whatsoever, whether contingent, vested or unvested, or otherwise, both (a) and (b) to be based upon the treasury stock method (in accordance with the rules and interpretations of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, subject to the following sentence, and consistent with _Section 1.02(b)(i)_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter (which details the calculation as of the date of this Agreement)), in each case other than the shares of RMT Partner Common Stock issued or to be issued in the Merger. The parties binding estimate of the number of shares of RMT Partner Common Stock on a Fully Diluted Basis shall be made on the Estimation Date using, for the purposes of the treasury stock method calculations, $50.85 for the price of RMT Partner Common Stock for all options and rights included in the calculation. 

   

 (ii) " _Estimation Date_ " means the soonest reasonably practicable date prior to the date on which the Exchange Offer is commenced (or prior to the last Trading Day that ends at least 20 Trading Days prior to the date the Parties expect the Distribution Date to occur, if Parent elects to effect the Distribution as a One-Step Spin-Off), or such other date as may be reasonably agreed by the parties hereto. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) If the condition to the obligation of Parent to effect the Folgers Transfer and the Distribution set forth in _Section 7.1(b)_ of the Separation Agreement has not been satisfied and all of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1(a)_ of the Separation Agreement have been satisfied or waived, Parent may elect to waive the condition set forth in _Section 7.1(b)_ of the Separation Agreement, in which case the number of shares of Folgers Common Stock issuable to Parent pursuant to _Section 1.02(a)_ shall be increased by an amount equal to (a) $350 million less the principal amount of indebtedness, if any, that is financable and received by Folgers pursuant to the Folgers Credit Facility (such difference, the " _Shortfall Amount_ "), divided by (b) the Reference Price. 

   

 1.03 __Amendment of RMT Partner Articles__. RMT Partner may present to its shareholders for approval at the RMT Partner Shareholder Meeting a proposal (the " _Amendment Proposal_ ") to amend and restate, effective as of the Effective Time, RMT Partners articles of incorporation to read in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ and, to the extent approved by the requisite vote of the shareholders of RMT Partner, such articles of incorporation will be the articles of incorporation of RMT Partner from and after the Effective Time until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. 

  

II. CONVERSION OF SHARES AND RELATED MATTERS 

   

 2.01 __Conversion Of Capital Stock in the Merger__. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Folgers, RMT Partner or the holders of the following securities: 

  

 (a) Each share of Merger Sub Common Stock will be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

Until exchanged as contemplated by this _Section 2.03_, any Folgers Common Stock will be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such exchange Merger Consideration as contemplated by this _Section 2.03_. No interest will be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon exchange of any Folgers Common Stock. 

   #####

 2.05 __No Fractional Shares__. (a) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of RMT Partner Common Stock will be issued upon the conversion of Folgers Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.01_, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a holder of RMT Partner Common Stock.

The Exchange Agent will make available the net proceeds thereof, after deducting any required withholding Taxes and brokerage charges, commissions and transfer Taxes, on a _pro rata_ basis, without interest, as soon as practicable to the holders of Folgers Common Stock entitled to receive such cash. Payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of RMT Partner Common Stock will be made solely for the purpose of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to RMT Partner of issuing fractional shares of RMT Partner Common Stock and will not represent separately bargained-for consideration.

 (iv) reclassify, combine, split or subdivide, directly or indirectly, any of its capital stock, or issue or authorize the issuance of any shares of RMT Partner Common Stock or any other RMT Partner Equity Interests, except as expressly provided in this Agreement and the Other RMT Agreements (other than in connection with (a) the exercise of currently outstanding stock options and equity awards under existing RMT Partner Compensation and Benefit Plans, and (b) the issuance of up to 225,000 shares of restricted stock in the aggregate under existing RMT Partner Compensation and Benefit Plans (the " _Permitted Equity Awards_ ");

 (vi) (A) make a material change in its accounting or Tax reporting principles, methods or policies except as required by applicable Law or a change in GAAP, (B) make, change or revoke any material Tax election, settle or compromise any material Tax claim or liability or enter into any material Tax closing agreements, or (C) amend any Tax Return if any such action would materially increase the Tax obligations of RMT Partner or any of its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time; or 

   ##### 

  

   

 (vii) agree, in writing or otherwise, to take any of the foregoing actions. 

  

 5.03 __Efforts To Close; Antitrust Clearance__. (a) In addition to the actions specifically provided for elsewhere in this Agreement or in any Other RMT Agreement, each of the Parties hereto will cooperate with each other and use (and will cause their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates to use) commercially reasonable efforts, prior to, at and after the Closing Date, to take, or to cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or to cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary on its part under applicable Law or Contractual obligations to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Other RMT Agreements as promptly as reasonably practicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the level of efforts required to be utilized in connection with the Folgers Transfer will be as set forth in the Separation Agreement. 

  

 (b) Parent and RMT Partner will comply fully with all applicable notification, reporting and other requirements. Parent and RMT Partner, within ten Business Days after the date of this Agreement, will file the required notifications with the appropriate Governmental Authorities pursuant to and in compliance with the respective Antitrust Laws, including the HSR Act.

 (c) Parent and RMT Partner will each use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, as soon as practicable, the Governmental Approvals that may be or become necessary for the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, the Other RMT Agreements and the consummation of the Transactions and will cooperate fully with each other in promptly seeking to obtain such Governmental Approvals. 

   

 (d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties contained in  _Section 5.03(c)_, RMT Partner and Parent will offer to take (and if such offer is accepted, commit to take) all necessary steps to avoid or eliminate impediments under any Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and to avoid or prevent the entry of any Order sought by any Governmental Authority or private Person under any Antitrust Law that would result in the failure of any condition to the obligations of the Parties to consummate the Transactions to be satisfied, in each case to enable the Closing to occur as expeditiously as possible. RMT Partner will propose, negotiate, cooperate with Parent, and effect (or permit Parent to effect) prior to the Closing Date, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of such assets or businesses of the Coffee Business (or otherwise take any action that limits the freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, any of its businesses, product lines, or assets or those of the Coffee Business) as may be required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent), which would otherwise have the effect of preventing or delaying the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. 

    ##### 

  

     

 5.04 __Confidentiality__. (a) The parties acknowledge that in connection with the Transactions, the parties have disclosed to each other technical and business information which the parties consider proprietary and confidential. This information may include, by way of example and without limitation, new products, commercial plans, financial projections, technical or non-technical data, financial data, know-how, formulae, processes, patterns, strategies, compilations, programs, devices, methods, techniques, drawings, designs, sketches, photographs, plans, specifications, samples, reports, pricing information, lists of actual or potential customers and suppliers, studies, findings, inventions, ideas, and trade secrets. Such information is herein referred to as the " _Information_." The parties agree that, after the Effective Time, Information that constitutes an Folgers Asset will be Information of the Surviving Corporation and Parent will be deemed to be the Receiving Party of such Information for purposes of  _Section 5.04(b)_. 

  

 (b) Each Party receiving Information (the " _Receiving Party_ ") recognizes and acknowledges (i) that Information of the other Party may be commercially valuable proprietary products of such Party, the design and development of which may have involved the expenditure of substantial amounts of money and the use of skilled development experts over a long period of time and which afford such Party a commercial advantage over its competitors; (ii) that the loss of this competitive advantage due to unauthorized disclosure or use of Information of such Party may cause great injury and harm to such Party; and (iii) that the restrictions imposed upon the parties under this _Section 5.04_ are necessary to protect the secrecy of Information and to prevent the occurrence of such injury and harm. The parties agree that: 

    

 (i) disclosure of Information will be received and held in confidence by the Receiving Party and that such Receiving Party will not, without the prior written consent of the Party from whom such Information was obtained (the " _Disclosing Party_ "), disclose, divulge or permit any unauthorized person to obtain any Information disclosed by the Disclosing Party (whether or not such Information is in written or tangible form); 

   

 (ii) the Receiving Party will take such steps as may be reasonably necessary to prevent the disclosure of Information to others; and 

   

 (iii) the Receiving Party will use the Information only in connection with the Transactions unless otherwise authorized in writing by the Disclosing Party. 

  

 (c) The commitments set forth above will not extend to any portion of Information: 

    

 (i) which is already known to the Receiving Party, or is information generally available to the public; 

   

 (ii) which, hereafter, through no act on the part of the Receiving Party becomes generally available to the public; 

   ##### 

  

   

 (iii) which corresponds in substance to a disclosure furnished to the Receiving Party by any third party having a bona fide right to do so and not having any confidential obligation, direct or indirect, to the Disclosing Party with respect to the same; or 

   

 (iv) which is required to be disclosed by Law, _provided_ that the Receiving Party provides reasonable prior written notice of such required disclosure to the Disclosing Party. The commitments set forth in this _Section 5.04_ will promptly and automatically terminate in their entirety upon the lapse of a period of three (3) years from the Closing Date. 

  

 5.05 __Cooperation In Tax Matters__. Subject to the Tax Matters Agreement, Parent and RMT Partner will make available to each other during normal business hours, but without unreasonably disrupting their respective businesses, all personnel and records of the Coffee Business reasonably necessary in connection with the filing of any Tax Return, amended return or claim for refund, determining a liability for Taxes or a right to refund for Taxes or conducting an audit or other proceeding in respect of Taxes. 

  

 5.06 __Access__. From the date hereof to the Effective Time, each of Parent and RMT Partner will allow all designated officers, attorneys, accountants and other representatives of Parent or RMT Partner, as the case may be, access at reasonable times upon reasonable notice and in a manner as will not adversely impact the conduct of the business of either Party or the Coffee Business to the personnel, records files, correspondence, audits and properties, as well as to all information relating to commitments, contracts, titles and financial position, or otherwise pertaining to the business and affairs of the Coffee Business and RMT Partner and its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, including inspection of such properties and the items described in _Section 5.06_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter; _provided_ that no investigation pursuant to this  _Section 5.06_ will affect any representation or warranty given by any Party hereunder, and provided further that notwithstanding the provision of information or investigation by any Party, no Party will be deemed to make any representation or warranty except as expressly set forth in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) no Party will be required to provide any information which it reasonably believes it may not provide to the other Party by reason of applicable Law, which such Party reasonably believes constitutes information protected by attorney/client privilege or which it is required to keep confidential by reason of Contracts with third parties and (ii) no Party will be required to provide access to any of its properties of such access results in damage to such property or if such access is for the purpose of performing any onsite procedure or investigation (including any onsite environmental investigation or study), without that Partys written consent, which the Party may grant or deny in its sole discretion. The parties hereto will make reasonable and appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. Each of Parent and RMT Partner agrees that it will not, and will cause its respective representatives not to, use any information obtained pursuant to this _Section 5.06_ for any purpose unrelated to the consummation of the Transactions. All 

   ##### 

  

 

information provided by a Party to the other Party hereunder will be subject
to the confidentiality provisions of _Section 5.04_.

From the date hereof through the Effective Time, neither Parent nor RMT Partner will issue any press releases with respect to this Agreement, the Other RMT Agreements and the Transactions (or the portion thereof relating to this Agreement, the Other RMT Agreements and the Transactions) without the prior approval of the other Party, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, except as may be required by Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange.

Each of Parent and RMT Partner will use their best efforts to have the Folgers Form 10/S-4, the RMT Partner Form S-4, and other registration statements as may be required declared effective under the Exchange Act or Securities Act, as applicable, as promptly as practicable after such filing. RMT Partner will use its best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to RMT Partners stockholders as promptly as practicable after the Folgers Form 10/S-4 and the RMT Partner Form S-4 are declared effective under the Securities Act. Each of RMT Partner and Parent will also take any action (other than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified) required to be taken under any applicable state securities Laws in connection with, in the case of RMT Partner, the issuance of RMT Partner Common Stock in the Folgers Merger and, in the case of Parent, the issuance of Folgers Common Stock in the Distribution. Parent will furnish all information concerning Parent and Folgers, and RMT Partner will furnish all information concerning RMT Partner and Merger Sub, as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action and the preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement, the RMT

will be made by RMT Partner, no filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the
Folgers Form 10/S-4 will be made by Folgers and no filing of, or amendment or
supplement to, the Schedule TO will be made by Parent, in each case without
providing the other parties a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
thereon. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating

directors should be discovered by Parent or RMT Partner which should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the Proxy Statement, the
RMT Partner Form S-4, the Folgers Form 10/S-4 or the Schedule TO, so that any
such document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Party
which discovers such information will promptly notify the other Parties hereto
and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information will
be promptly filed with the Commission and, to the extent required by Law,
disseminated to the applicable stockholders. The Parties will notify each
other promptly of the receipt of any comments from the Commission or
its staff and of any request by the Commission or its staff for amendments or
supplements to the Proxy Statement, the RMT Partner Form S-4, the Folgers
Form 10/S-4 or the Schedule TO or for additional information and will supply
each other with copies of all correspondence between it or any of
its representatives, on the one hand, and the Commission or its staff, on the
other hand, with respect thereto and will respond as promptly as practicable
to any such comments or requests. 

   

 5.09 __RMT Partner Shareholder Meeting__. RMT Partner will, as soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, establish a record date following the date of this Agreement for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the " _RMT Partner Shareholder Meeting_ ") solely for the purpose of obtaining the RMT Partner Shareholder Approval and approval of the Amendment Proposal. Subject to _Section 5.10_, RMT Partner will, through its Board of Directors, recommend to its shareholders that they give RMT Partner Shareholder Approval and will include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement. RMT Partner may, through its Board of Directors, recommend to its shareholders that they approve the Amendment Proposal and may include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, RMT Partner agrees that its obligations pursuant to the first sentence of this _Section 5.09_ will not be affected by (i) the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to RMT Partner of any RMT Partner Takeover Proposal or (ii) the withdrawal or modification by the Board of Directors of RMT Partner of its approval or recommendation of the RMT Partner Shareholder Approval. 

  

 5.10 __No Solicitation__. (a) RMT Partner will, and will cause its Representatives to, cease immediately any discussions and negotiations regarding any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, an RMT Partner Takeover Proposal. Except as provided in  _Section 5.10(b)_, RMT Partner will not, nor will it authorize or permit any of its Subsidiaries to, nor will it authorize or permit any officer, employee, agent, advisor, director or other representative (collectively, 

   ##### 

  

 

" _Representatives_ ") of RMT Partner or any of its Subsidiaries to (and will
instruct such Representatives not to), directly or indirectly (i) solicit,
initiate or encourage the submission of any RMT Partner Takeover Proposal or
(ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to
any Person any information with respect to, or take any other action to
facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or
may reasonably be expected to lead to, any RMT Partner Takeover Proposal. For
purposes of determining whether RMT Partner has violated the foregoing
restrictions through the actions of any of its employees, it is agreed that
only actions by any director or officer of RMT Partner or a Person acting at
the direction or with the knowledge of such director or officer (whether or
not such Person is purporting to act on behalf of RMT Partner or any of its
Subsidiaries or otherwise), will be deemed to be a breach of this _Section
5.10_ by RMT Partner. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 5.10(a)_, prior to receipt of the RMT Partner Shareholder Approval, RMT Partner may, if the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of RMT Partner to the stockholders of RMT Partner under applicable Law, as determined in good faith after consulting with outside legal counsel, in response to a Qualifying RMT Partner Takeover Proposal (and subject to compliance with the provisions of this _Section 5.10_): 

    

 (i) furnish information with respect to RMT Partner to the Person making such RMT Partner Takeover Proposal and its Representatives pursuant to a confidentiality agreement not less restrictive of the other Party than the Confidentiality Agreement ( _provided_ that all such information has previously been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent prior to or substantially concurrent with the time it is provided to such Person), and 

   

 (ii) participate in discussions and negotiations with such Person and its Representatives regarding such Qualifying RMT Partner Takeover Proposal. 

  

 (c) Neither the Board of Directors of RMT Partner nor any committee thereof will (i) withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Folgers, or publicly propose to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Folgers, the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Board of Directors of RMT Partner of this Agreement, the Other RMT Agreements or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including the RMT Partner Shareholder Approval, (ii) approve, adopt or recommend, or permit RMT Partner or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, merger agreement or similar agreement relating to any RMT Partner Takeover Proposal, or (iii) approve, adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, adopt or recommend, any RMT Partner Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, prior to receipt of the RMT Partner Shareholder Approval, the Board of Directors of RMT Partner receives an RMT Partner Superior Proposal and as a result thereof the Board of Directors of RMT Partner reasonably determines in good faith, after consulting with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be 

     ##### 

  

    

inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of RMT Partner
under applicable Law, then, on the fifth business day following Parents
receipt of written notice from RMT Partner, the Board of Directors of RMT
Partner may withdraw or modify its recommendation of the RMT
Partner Shareholder Approval and, in connection therewith, recommend such RMT
Partner Superior Proposal;  _provided_ that, during such five-business day
period, RMT Partner will be obligated to negotiate in good faith with Parent
and Folgers any modification to this Agreement proposed by Parent
or Folgers. 

   

 (d) RMT Partner promptly will advise Parent orally and in writing of any RMT Partner Takeover Proposal or any inquiry with respect to or that could reasonably be expected to lead to any RMT Partner Takeover Proposal, and the identity of the Person making any such RMT Partner Takeover Proposal or inquiry and the material terms of any such RMT Partner Takeover Proposal or inquiry. RMT Partner will (i) keep Parent reasonably informed of the status including any change to the material terms of any such RMT Partner Takeover Proposal or inquiry and (ii) provide to Parent as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt or delivery thereof with copies of all correspondence and other written material sent or provided to RMT Partner from any third party in connection with any RMT Partner Takeover Proposal or sent or provided by RMT Partner to any third party in connection with any RMT Partner Takeover Proposal. 

   

 (e) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.10_ will prohibit RMT Partner from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 or 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any required disclosure to RMT Partners stockholders if, in the good-faith judgment of the Board of Directors of RMT Partner after consulting with outside legal counsel, failure so to disclose would be inconsistent with its obligations under applicable Law;  _provided_ , _however_ , that this _Section 5.10(e)_ will not eliminate or modify (x) RMT Partners obligations under the proviso in _Section 5.10(c)_ or (y) the effect that taking and disclosing any such position would otherwise have under this Agreement (including under _Section 7.01(d)(i)_ ). 

   

 (f) For purposes of this Agreement: 

    

 (i) " _Qualifying RMT Partner Takeover Proposal_ " mean a bona fide, written RMT Partner Takeover Proposal that (i) is made by a Person the Board of Directors of RMT Partner determines, in good faith, after consulting with outside counsel and independent financial advisors, is reasonably capable of making an RMT Partner Superior Proposal, (ii) the Board of Directors of RMT Partner determines, in good faith, after consulting with its independent financial advisor, constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to an RMT Partner Superior Proposal, and (iii) that was not solicited by RMT Partner and did not otherwise result from a breach of this _Section 5.10_. 

   

 (ii) " _RMT Partner Takeover Proposal_ " means (i) any proposal for a merger, consolidation, dissolution, recapitalization or other business combination involving RMT Partner, (ii) any proposal or offer for the issuance by 

   ##### 

  

    

RMT Partner of over 15% of its equity securities as consideration for the
assets or securities of another Person, or (iii) any proposal or offer to
acquire in any manner, directly or indirectly, over 15% of the equity
securities or consolidated assets of RMT Partner, or assets or business that
constitute over 15% of the consolidated revenues or net income of RMT
Partner, in each case other than the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 (iii) " _RMT Partner Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide proposal made by a third party to acquire 50% or more of the equity securities or all or substantially all the assets of RMT Partner, pursuant to a tender or exchange offer, a merger, a consolidation, a liquidation or dissolution, a recapitalization, a sale of all or substantially all its assets or otherwise, on terms which the Board of Directors of RMT Partner determines in its good-faith judgment after consulting with its independent financial advisor (i) to be superior from a financial point of view to the holders of RMT Partner Common Stock than the transactions contemplated hereby, taking into account all the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including any proposal by Parent to amend the terms of the transactions contemplated hereby) as well as any other factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors of RMT Partner and (ii) is reasonably capable of being completed, taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal. 

  

 5.11 __Notification Of Certain Matters__. Each of Parent and RMT Partner will give prompt written notice to the other of (i) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Transactions, (ii) any Action commenced or threatened in writing against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting it or any of its Subsidiaries that relate to the consummation of the Transactions, and (iii) any change that is reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Coffee Business MAE or reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, an RMT Partner MAE, as the case may be. 

  

 5.12 __NYSE Listing__. RMT Partner will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the shares of RMT Partner Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger to be issued in connection with the Merger to be listed on the NYSE as of the Effective Time, subject to official notice of issuance. 

  

 5.13 __Affiliates__. At least ten days prior to the mailing of the Proxy Statement, (i) Parent will deliver to RMT Partner a letter identifying all persons who may be deemed to be Affiliates of Folgers as of the date on which Parent, as sole shareholder of Folgers, approves and adopts the Merger (the " _Rule 145 Affiliates_") and (ii) Parent will advise the persons identified in such letter of the resale restrictions imposed by applicable securities Law and will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from each person identified in such letter a written agreement in customary form and substance. 

  

 5.14 __Indemnification__. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, from and after the Closing, each of Parent and RMT Partner will indemnify and hold harmless the other (as well as their respective directors, officers, employees 

   ##### 

  

 

and agents) from and against any and all Losses incurred in investigation or
defense of any third-party Action arising out of or related to a breach by
such Party of (i) a Surviving Covenant or (ii) the representations and
warranties made by the indemnifying Party in _Sections 3.04_ and _4.06_ ,
respectively. 

   

 (b) The indemnification obligations set forth in _Section 5.14_ will be subject to the provisions of _Sections 4.4_, _4.5(b)_ , _4.6(a)_ and _4.6(c)-(d)_ of the Separation Agreement, which will be deemed to be incorporated herein _mutatis mutandis_. 

   

 5.15 __Employee Matters__. 

  

 (a) _Continuity of Employment_. Parent and RMT Partner hereby acknowledge that it is in their mutual best interest for there to be continuity of employment by RMT Partner, the Surviving Corporation or one of its respective Subsidiaries following the Closing Date with respect to each individual who currently works, or is hired prior to the Closing Date to work, for the sole purpose of providing services to the Coffee Business (and any individual hired prior to the Closing Date to replace such individual) (" _Business Employees_ "). Each Business Employee who continues employment with RMT Partner, the Surviving Corporation or one of its respective Subsidiaries (the applicable entity, the " _Employing Entity_ ") is referred to herein as a " _Continuing Employee_." A Business Employee who is on disability leave or on approved leave of absence on the Closing Date will become a Continuing Employee only if such Business Employee returns to active employment prior to the later of (a) the first anniversary of the Closing Date or (b) the end of the period of time during which the reemployment rights are guaranteed under applicable Law (such employee, a " _Delayed Employee_ "). The date on which a Delayed Employee commences active employment with the applicable Employing Entity is hereinafter referred to as the " _Delayed Date_ ". Within 30 calendar days following the execution of this Agreement, Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide RMT Partner with a list of the individuals as of the most reasonably practicable date who are Business Employees (the " _Continuing Employee List_ "). Parent will provide RMT Partner within five Business Days prior to the Closing Date an updated Continuing Employee List. 

   

 (b) _Compensation and Benefits_. With respect to each Continuing Employee, for the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the second anniversary thereafter (the " _Benefits Continuation Period_ "), RMT Partner will, or will the cause the applicable Employing Entity to, provide each such Continuing Employee (i) compensation (including salary, wages and bonus opportunity) as in effect immediately prior to Effective Time (or communicated to the applicable Continuing Employee in connection with the proposed divestiture of the Coffee Business) and (ii) employee benefits (including equity based compensation, retirement benefits and additional compensation in lieu of other benefits) that in all material respects are no less favorable in the aggregate than employee benefits communicated to the applicable Continuing Employee in connection with proposed divestiture of the Coffee Business and described on  _Section 3.10(a)_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter, or if more favorable, employee benefits provided by RMT Partner or the Employing Entity to similarly situated employees of RMT Partner or the Employing Entity. In evaluating the relative 

    ##### 

  

    

favorability of employee benefits, the RMT Partner may use reasonable
actuarial and other assumptions. For avoidance of doubt, except for the
Coffee Business And Benefit Plans set forth on _Section 3.10(a)(ii)_ of the
Parent Disclosure Letter, RTM Parent and the applicable Employing Entity will
have discretion to determine the compensation and employee benefits provided
to the Continuing Employees, provided that in the aggregate they
otherwise satisfy the standard set forth in this _Section 5.15(b)_. 

   

 (c) _Service Recognition_. RMT Partner will, or will cause the Employing Entity to, give each Continuing Employee full credit for purposes of eligibility, vesting and determination of level of benefits under the applicable RMT Partner Compensation and Benefit Plans for such Continuing Employees service with Parent or its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date (or, if applicable, the Delayed Date) at least to the same extent such service was recognized by the corresponding Coffee Business Compensation And Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date (or, if applicable, the Delayed Date); _provided_ , _however_ , that such service will not be recognized (i) to the extent that such recognition would result in the duplication of benefits under an RMT Partner Compensation and Benefit Plan and a Coffee Business Compensation And Benefit Plans and (ii) for purposes of any defined benefit pension plans or retiree medical plans. 

   

 (d) _401(k) Plan_. Each Continuing Employee who is eligible to contribute to Parent 401(k) plan on the Closing Date (or, if applicable, the Delayed Date) will be eligible to participate and contribute to an RMT Partner Compensation and Benefit Plan intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code (the " _RMT 401(k) Plan_ ") commencing as soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date (or, if applicable, the Delayed Date) and RMT Partner will, or will cause the Employing Entity to, permit Continuing Employees the right to roll over, in cash, their account balances into the RMT 401(k) Plan subject to the regular procedures of the RMT 401(k) Plan. 

   

 (e) _Welfare Plans_. RMT Partner or the Employing Entity will cause each RMT Partner Compensation and Benefit Plan that is a health and welfare benefit plan (an " _RMT Welfare Plan_ ") to (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and service conditions with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to Continuing Employees, other than limitations that were in effect with respect to such employees as of the Closing Date (or, if applicable, the Delayed Date) under the corresponding health and welfare plan maintained by Parent (" _Parent Welfare Plan_ "), (ii) honor any deductibles, out-of-pocket maximums and co-payments incurred by Continuing Employees under the corresponding Parent Welfare Plan in satisfying any applicable deductibles, out-of-pocket maximums or co-payments under an RMT Welfare Plan during the same plan year in which such deductibles, out-of-pocket maximums and co-payments were made, and (iii) with respect to any medical plan, waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of insurability requirement that would otherwise be applicable to a Continuing Employee following the Closing Date (or, if applicable, the Delayed Date) to the extent such employee had satisfied any similar limitation under the corresponding Parent Welfare Plan. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (f) _Severance Benefits_. With respect to each Continuing Employee, other than a Continuing Employee who is a party to an individual severance agreement, who incurs a "Constructive Termination" during the Benefits Continuation Period, RMT Partner will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide such employee with the severance payments and benefits under the formula set forth on _Section 5.15(f)_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter. A " _Constructive Termination_ " means (A) a termination by RMT Partner or the Employing Entity of a Continuing Employees employment, other than for "cause" or (B) a termination by a Continuing Employee of his or her employment with RMT Partner or the Employing Entity due to a reduction in his or her base pay from that in effect on the Closing Date or a relocation of such employees principal place of employment by more than 50 miles from his or her principal place of employment on the Closing Date. With respect to a Continuing Employee who is a party to an individual severance agreement, RMT Partner will assume such agreement and provide such employee with the severance payments and benefits such employee would be entitled under the terms of his or her severance agreement, or if more favorable, the severance payments provided by RMT Partner to similarly situated employees. RMT Partner and the Employing Entity may require, as a condition to the payment of any severance due hereunder to any Continuing Employee, that such Continuing Employee provide a general waiver and release of claims in a form substantially similar to the form used for similarly situated RMT employees; _provided_ that nothing herein will preclude such Continuing Employee from becoming employed by Parent and such release will also include a provision for a release of claims for the benefit of the Parent Group. 

   

 (g) _Specified Employee Matters_. The parties specified in _Section 5.15(g)_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter will take the actions therein specified for, if applicable, the period therein provided. 

   

 (h) The provisions of this _Section 5.15_ are solely for the benefit of the parties hereto and does not confer on third-parties (including any Business Employees or Continuing Employee or any of their beneficiaries, dependent or alternate payee of any of the foregoing) any remedy, claim, reimbursement, claim of action or other right in addition to those existing without reference to this Agreement. Furthermore, nothing in this Agreement, including this _Section 5.15_ is intended (i) to confer upon any employee or former employee of Parent (including Business Employees) any right to continued employment, or any recall or similar rights to an individual on layoff or any type of approved leave or (ii) to be construed to relieve any insurance company of any responsibility for any employee benefit under any benefit plan or any other Liability or to constitute a plan or a plan amendment. In the event that (i) a party other than Parent or RMT Partner makes a claim or takes other action to enforce any provision in this Agreement as an amendment to any Parent Compensation and Benefit Plan, RMT Partner Compensation and Benefit Plan, Coffee Business Compensation and Benefit Plan or other compensation or benefit plan and (ii) such provision is deemed to be an amendment to such Parent Compensation and Benefit Plan, RMT Partner Compensation And Benefit Plan, RMT Partner Compensation And Benefit Plan, Coffee Company Compensation and Benefit Plan or other compensation or benefit plan, as 

     ##### 

  

    

applicable, even though not explicitly designated as such in this Agreement,
then such provision will lapse retroactively and will have no amendatory
effect. 

   

 (i) Except for _Sections 5.15(g)_ and _5.15(h)_ , the provisions of this  _Section 5.15_ will not apply to any employee of the Business who is a beneficiary of a collective bargaining agreement. The terms and conditions of employment for such employees will be as set forth in the applicable collective bargaining agreement relating to such employee. 

   

 5.16 __Voting Agreement__. Contemporaneously with the execution of this Agreement, RMT Partner will deliver to Parent the Voting Agreement, fully executed by each of the shareholders of RMT Partner that are a party thereto except the Wagstaff Shareholders. RMT Partner will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Wagstaff Shareholders to execute the Voting Agreement as promptly as practicable after the date hereof. 

  

 5.17 __Required Amendments__. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein or in any other Transaction Document (as defined in the Tax Matters Agreement), the parties shall cooperate and negotiate in good faith with respect to any amendment to the Transaction Documents reasonably requested by a party in order to enable its counsel to deliver the written opinion(s) contemplated by Section 6.02 or 6.03 of this Agreement, as the case may be (any such amendment, a " _Proposed Amendment_ "). Neither party shall withhold its consent to a Proposed Amendment that (i) does not result in any change in the Merger Consideration, (ii) is not materially adverse to the interests of any party hereto, and (iii) does not unreasonably impede or delay consummation of the Merger. Any Proposed Amendment that the parties consent to shall be reflected through the execution of appropriate written amendments to the applicable Transaction Documents. 

  

 5.18 __TSA/IP Updates__. (a) _IP Matters Agreement_. Prior to the Closing, RMT Partner will use its best efforts to identify and remove from _Schedule B_ and _Schedule C_ to the Intellectual Property Matters Agreement, any Parent IP Asset(s) (as defined in the Intellectual Property Matters Agreement) that RMT Partner determines, in its reasonable discretion and in consultation with Parent, is not necessary to manufacture products of the Coffee Business as such products are currently being manufactured by Folgers in RMT Partners established business environment. 

  

 (b) _TSA Services_. Prior to the Closing, RMT Partner will use its best efforts to remove from the schedules to the TSA those Services (as defined in the TSA) identified on  _Section 5.18_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter, unless RMT Partner determines, in its reasonable discretion and in consultation with Parent, (i) it would not otherwise be able to procure such Service(s) from a third party on commercially reasonable terms or (ii) such Services would be necessary to consummate the Transactions on the timetable contemplated by the Parties. 

   

 5.19 __RMT Partner Special Dividend__. In the event that Parent elects to effect the Distribution by way of an Exchange Offer, Parent will use reasonable efforts to keep RMT Partner reasonably informed of the anticipated commencement date and 

   ##### 

  

 

anticipated terms of such Exchange Offer, for the purpose of facilitating RMT
Partners determination of the record date for such Special Dividend.

addressed to RMT Partner and dated the Closing Date, signed on behalf

VII. TERMINATION AND ABANDONMENT

 (a) by mutual written consent of Parent and RMT Partner; 

   

 (b) by either Parent or RMT Partner: 

    

 (i) if, upon a vote at a duly held meeting of RMT Partners stockholders to obtain the RMT Partner Shareholder Approval, the RMT Partner Shareholder Approval is not obtained; 

   

 (ii) if the Closing does not occur on or prior to March 31, 2009 (the " _Outside Date_ "), unless the failure of the Closing to occur by such date is due to the failure of the Party seeking to terminate the Agreement to perform or observe in all material respects the covenants and agreements of such Party set forth herein; or 

   

 (iii) if (A) there shall be any Law that makes consummation of the transactions hereunder illegal or otherwise prohibited or (B) any Governmental Authority having competent jurisdiction shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action (which the terminating Party shall have complied with its obligations hereunder to resist, resolve or lift) permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting any material component of the 

   ##### 

  

  

transactions hereunder, and such order, decree, ruling or other action shall
have become final and non-appealable; 

  

 (c) by Parent: 

    

 (i) if RMT Partner Board or any committee thereof withdraws, or modifies in a manner adverse to Parent or Folgers or publicly proposes to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Folgers, its approval or recommendation of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, fails to recommend to RMT Partners stockholders that they give the RMT Partner Shareholder Approval, or approves or recommends, or proposes publicly to approve or recommend, any RMT Partner Takeover Proposal; 

   

 (ii) if RMT Partner breaches its obligations under _Section 5.10_; 

   

 (iii) if RMT Partner or Merger Sub breaches or fails to perform any of its representations and warranties or covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in _Article VI_ and (B) cannot be or has not been cured within 60 days after the giving of written notice to RMT Partner of such breach; or 

   

 (iv) if any of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.01_ or _Section 6.03_ shall have become incapable of fulfillment, and shall not have been waived by Parent; 

  

 (d) by RMT Partner: 

    

 (i) if Parent or Folgers breaches or fails to perform any of its representations and warranties or covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in _Article VI_ and (B) cannot be or has not been cured within 60 days after the giving of written notice to Parent of such breach; or 

   

 (ii) if any of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.01_ or _Section 6.02_ shall have become incapable of fulfillment, and shall not have been waived by RMT Partner; 

 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that the Party seeking termination pursuant to
_clause (c)(iii)_ ,  _(c)(iv)_ , _(d)(i)_ , or _(d)(ii)_ is not in material
breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement. 

   

 7.02 __Notice of Termination, Return of Documents, Continuing Confidentiality Obligation__. In the event of termination by Parent or RMT Partner pursuant to this _Article VII_ , written notice thereof will forthwith be given to the other Parties and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Other RMT Agreements will terminate, without further action by any Party. If the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Other RMT Agreements are terminated as 

   ##### 

  

 

provided herein, (a) RMT Partner and Merger Sub will return to Parent all
documents and copies and other material received from Parent and its
Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby and by the Other RMT Agreements, whether so obtained
before or after the execution hereof, and (b) Parent and Folgers will return
to RMT Partner all documents and copies and other material received from RMT
Partner and its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives relating to
the transactions contemplated hereby and by the Other RMT Agreements, whether
so obtained before or after the execution hereof. 

   

 7.03 __Effect of Termination__. (a) If this Agreement is terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby are abandoned as described in this _Article VII_, this Agreement will become void and of no further force and effect, except for the provisions of _Section 5.04_ relating obligations to keep certain information confidential, _Section 5.07_ relating to publicity, this _Section 7.03_ and _Article VIII_ (other than _Section 8.12_ which shall terminate with the other provisions of this Agreement except as specifically provided herein) containing general provisions. Nothing in this _Article VII_ will be deemed to release any Party from any liability for any willful breach by such Party of the terms and provisions of this Agreement or to impair the right of any Party to compel specific performance by another Party of its obligations under this Agreement that specifically survive such termination as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence. For the avoidance of doubt, receipt by Parent of a payment or reimbursement pursuant to _Section 7.03(b)_ or _Section 7.03(c)_ will not limit the ability of Parent to sue for any willful breach of _Section 5.10_ or collect damages arising from any such willful breach (except, in the case of calculation of damages, to the extent a court would otherwise take such payment or reimbursement into account in assessing damages for such breach). 

  

 (b) RMT Partner will pay to Parent: 

    

 (i) a fee of $35 million if either Party terminates this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 7.01(b)(i_); _provided_ , that if (A) at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to any such termination, an RMT Partner Takeover Proposal with respect to RMT Partner shall have been publicly announced, publicly proposed or commenced (provided that for purposes of determining whether an RMT Takeover Proposal exists under this clause (i), the references in the definition of such term to "15%" will be deemed to be "50%"); and (B) within twelve months after the date of such termination, RMT Partner shall have entered into an agreement related to an RMT Partner Takeover Proposal or any RMT Takeover Proposal shall have been consummated, then RMT Partner shall pay an additional fee of $65 million to Parent at or before the execution of such agreement; 

   

 (ii) a fee of $100 million if (A) either Party terminates this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 7.01(b)(ii_); (B) at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to any such termination, an RMT Partner Takeover Proposal with respect to RMT Partner shall have been communicated to the Board of Directors of RMT Partner and not withdrawn (provided that for purposes of determining whether an RMT Takeover Proposal exists under this clause (ii), 

   ##### 

  

    

the references in the definition of such term to "15%" will be deemed to be
"50%"); and (C) within twelve months after the date of such termination, RMT
Partner shall have entered into an agreement related to an RMT Partner
Takeover Proposal or any RMT Takeover Proposal shall have been consummated; 

   

 (iii) a fee of $100 million if Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to ( _c)(i)_ or _(ii)_. 

 

Any fee due under this _Section 7.03(b)_ will be paid by wire transfer of
immediately available funds (to an account specified by Parent). The fees
described in clauses (i) and (iii) will be paid by RMT Partner promptly
following termination of this Agreement (except that the fee described in the
proviso to clause (i) will be paid as provided therein, and in the case of
a termination by RMT Partner described in clause (i) above, such payment will
be made at the time of or prior to such termination). The fee described in
clause (ii) will be paid by RMT Partner at or before entering into the
agreement relating to an RMT Takeover Proposal described therein. If
RMT Partner makes a payment to Parent pursuant to _Section 7.03(b)(i)_,
_7.03(b)(ii)_ , or  _7.03(b)(iii)_ , it will not be obligated to make any
subsequent payment under the other subsections of _Section 7.03(b)_ as
applicable (for the avoidance of doubt, if the first payment contemplated by
_Section 7.03(b)(i)_ is paid by RMT Partner, the second payment contemplated
by _Section 7.03(b)(i)_ will continue to become payable under the
circumstances provided therein). Upon payment of the termination fees in
accordance with this _Section 7.03(b)_ and any applicable reimbursement of
expenses under _Section 7.03(c)_, RMT Merger Partner will have no further
liability to Parent at law or in equity under this Agreement except
as specifically set forth in _Section 7.03(a)_. 

   

 (c) RMT Partner will reimburse Parent for all its out-of-pocket expenses actually incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Other RMT Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (not to exceed $10 million) if this Agreement is terminated in the circumstances specified in clauses (i) or (iii) of _Section 7.03(b)_, or if a fee becomes payable pursuant to clause (ii) of _Section 7.03(b)_. Such reimbursement will be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds (to an account specified by Parent), promptly following termination of this Agreement. 

   

VIII. MISCELLANEOUS 

   

 8.01 __Nonsurvival Of Representations, Warranties And Agreements__. None of the representations, warranties and agreements in this Agreement will survive the Merger; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the agreements contained in _Article I_, _Article II_ and in _Sections 5.04_ , _5.05_ , _5.06_ , _5.14_ and _5.15_ and this _Article VIII_ that by their terms are to be performed in whole or part after the Effective Time (each, a " _Surviving Covenant_ ") will survive the Merger.

RMT Partner will be responsible to make the one-time $18.4 million payment set forth in the Transition Services Agreement as reimbursement of the fees and expenses incurred by Parent and its Subsidiaries in connection with the preparation of transitional services to be provided to Folgers following a divestiture of Folgers; _provided, however_ , that RMT Partner will have no obligation to make such payment to Parent if this Agreement is terminated by RMT Partner pursuant to _Section 7.01(d)(i)_. 

   

 8.03 __Entire Agreement__. This Agreement and the Other RMT Agreements, including any related annexes, schedules and exhibits, as well as any other agreements and documents referred to herein and therein, will together constitute the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and will supersede all prior negotiations, agreements and understandings of the Parties of any nature, whether oral or written, with respect to such subject matter, including the Confidentiality Agreement, which is hereby terminated and of no further force or effect.

Griswold LLP in connection with this Agreement and the Other RMT Agreements,
and (b) Parent has been represented by Jones Day in connection with this
Agreement and the Other RMT Agreements (and Jones Day has not acted as
counsel to Folgers in connection therewith). In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement will be construed
as if drafted jointly by the Parties hereto, and no presumption or burden of
proof will arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the
authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement. Except as otherwise
expressly provided elsewhere in this Agreement or any Other RMT Agreement,
any provision herein which contemplates the agreement, approval or consent

 8.11 __Counterparts__. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts (any one of which need not contain the signatures of more than one Party), each of which will be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together will constitute one and the same agreement. This Agreement, and any amendments hereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or other electronic transmission, will be treated in all manner and respects as an original agreement and will be considered to have the same binding legal effects as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. At the request of any Party, the other Party will re-execute original forms thereof and deliver them to the requesting Party. No Party will raise the use of a facsimile machine or other electronic means to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature was transmitted or communicated through the use of facsimile machine or other electronic means as a defense to the formation of a Contract and each such Party forever waives any such defense. 

  

 8.12 __Specific Performance__. The parties hereby acknowledge and agree that the failure of any Party to perform its agreements and covenants hereunder, including its failure to take all actions that it is obligated to take under the terms hereof to consummate the Transactions, will cause irreparable injury to the other parties for which damages, even if available, will not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, each Party hereby consents to the issuance of injunctive relief by any court of competent jurisdiction to compel performance of such Partys obligations and to the granting by any court of the remedy of specific performance of its obligations hereunder.
