</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Transaction Agreement (this &#147;<U>Agreement</U>&#148;), dated as of June&nbsp;4, 2008, is among The
Procter &#038; Gamble Company, an Ohio corporation (&#147;<U>Parent</U>&#148;), The Folgers Coffee Company, a
Delaware corporation and presently a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (&#147;<U>Folgers</U>&#148;), The
J.M. Smucker Company, an Ohio corporation (&#147;<U>RMT Partner</U>&#148;), and Moon Merger Sub, Inc., a
Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned Subsidiary of RMT Partner (&#147;<U>Merger Sub</U>&#148;).

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Parent directly and indirectly through its wholly owned Subsidiaries is engaged in the
Coffee Business;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Parent has determined that it would be appropriate and desirable to separate the Coffee
Business from Parent;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Prior to the Effective Time on the Closing Date (or as otherwise contemplated by Section
2.5 of the Separation Agreement) Parent will:
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. Pursuant to the Separation Agreement, effect the Folgers Transfer and Recapitalization;
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B. Pursuant to the Separation Agreement and after the completion of the Folgers Transfer and
Recapitalization, effect the Distribution;
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;The Boards of Directors of Parent, Folgers, RMT Partner and Merger Sub have each approved
and declared advisable the Merger of Merger Sub with and into Folgers immediately following the
Distribution, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in
accordance with the DGCL;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;In the event that not all of the shares of Folgers Common Stock that are issued to Parent
in the Folgers Stock Issuance are subscribed for in the Exchange Offer (if Parent determines to
effect the Distribution through an Exchange Offer), Parent will distribute the balance of such
shares of Folgers Common Stock on a <I>pro rata </I>basis to its shareholders immediately following the
consummation of the Exchange Offer through the Clean-Up Spin Off as provided in the Separation
Agreement;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;For federal income tax purposes, it is intended that (i)&nbsp;the Distribution should be
tax-free to Parent and to the Parent shareholders pursuant to Section&nbsp;361 and Section&nbsp;355 of the
Code, respectively, and (ii)&nbsp;the Merger will qualify as a tax-free reorganization within the
meaning of Section&nbsp;368 of the Code, and the parties intend that the execution of the Separation
Agreement and this Agreement constitutes a plan of reorganization within the meaning of Section&nbsp;368
of the Code; and
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.&nbsp;Simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement, and as an inducement to Parent to
enter into this Agreement, certain shareholders of RMT Partner have entered into the Voting
Agreement.

Continuing Employee who is a party to an individual severance agreement,
who incurs a &#147;Constructive Termination&#148; during the Benefits Continuation Period, RMT Partner
will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide such employee with the severance payments
and benefits under the formula set forth on <U>Section&nbsp;5.15(f)</U> of the Parent Disclosure

Employing Entity of a Continuing Employee&#146;s employment, other than for &#147;cause&#148; or (B)&nbsp;a termination
by a Continuing Employee of his or her employment with RMT Partner or the Employing Entity due to a
reduction in his or her base pay from that in effect on the Closing Date or a relocation of such
employee&#146;s principal place of employment by more than 50 miles from his or her principal place of
employment on the Closing Date. With respect to a Continuing Employee who is a party to an
individual severance agreement, RMT Partner will assume such agreement and provide such employee
with the severance payments and benefits such employee would be entitled under the terms of his or
her severance agreement, or if more favorable, the severance payments provided by RMT Partner to
similarly situated employees. RMT Partner and the Employing Entity may require, as a condition to
the payment of any severance due hereunder to any Continuing Employee, that such Continuing
Employee provide a general waiver and release of claims in a form substantially similar to the form
used for similarly situated RMT employees; <I>provided </I>that nothing herein will preclude such
Continuing Employee from becoming employed by Parent and such release will also include a provision
for a release of claims for the benefit of the Parent Group.
