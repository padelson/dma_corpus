awarding only one of the proposals submitted and shall provide its decision
to the Parties. The Designated Arbitrators determination shall be final and
binding upon the parties hereto. All fees and costs of the
Designated Arbitrator, if any, shall be paid by the Party whose Closing
Working Capital Value is rejected by the Designated Arbitrator. The process
set forth in this Section 3.2 shall be the exclusive remedy of the Parties

Five (5) Business Days after January 31, 2007, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller a statement verifying the DCS Customer Payments and the DCS Customer Payment Amount. Such statement shall be certified by a financial officer of Buyer. Seller shall have the right for a thirty (30) day period following the statement from Buyer of the DCS Customer Payments and the DCS Customer Payment Amount to review the books and records of the Acquired Business relating to the DCS customers, and Buyers calculation of the DCS Customer Payment Amount and, to the extent Seller discovers any errors in Buyers calculation, Seller shall notify Buyer and such dispute shall be resolved in accordance with the 

   ##### 

  

 

dispute procedures set forth in Section 3.2. To the extent that Buyers
statement indicates there is an adjustment due to the Base Price in

adjustment to Buyer within five (5) Business Days following the resolution
of such adjustment amount.

Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information and in addition to Section 6.4(c), the Parties shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult the other regarding, all the information relating to the Party, as the case may be, that appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions. 

   

 (b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each Party agrees to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions as promptly as practicable and in any event within five (5) Business Days of the date hereof and to supply as promptly as practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other actions consistent with this Section 6.4 necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable. Buyer shall provide as promptly as practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be requested by the applicable Governmental Authority pursuant to foreign Antitrust Laws. 

   

 (c) Each Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission with any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry by or before a Governmental Authority relating to the Transactions, including any Proceeding initiated by a private party, and (ii) keep the other Party informed in all material respects and on a reasonably timely basis of any communication received by such party or its Affiliates from, or given by such party to, the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, or any other Governmental Authority and of any communication received or given in connection with any Proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any of the Transactions.

respect to the Transactions. Without limiting any other provision hereof, each
Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) avoid the entry
of, or to have vacated or terminated, any decree, order or judgment that
would restrain, prevent or delay the consummation of the Transactions, on or
before the Termination Date, including by defending through litigation on the
merits any claim asserted in any court by any Person, (ii) avoid or eliminate
each and every impediment under any Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any

Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to defend through
litigation on the merits any claim asserted in court by any party in order to

judgment (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would prevent
the Closing from occurring as promptly as practicable.

Prior to the Closing Date, no Party shall (except with respect to (a) presentations made to analysts, creditors or investors concerning the Transactions, and (b) disclosures made to the employees or customers of the Seller or Buyer, the Acquired Business and their respective Affiliates) issue any other press release or make any other public disclosures concerning this Transaction or the contents of this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party, unless a Party believes, upon advice of counsel, it is required by Law or regulation (of any applicable stock or securities exchange or otherwise) to make such public disclosure. The Parties shall reasonably cooperate as to the timing and contents of any public announcement or communication. 

  

 6.6 _Access to Records and Personnel_. 

  

 (a) From the date hereof until the earlier of the Closing or termination of this Agreement, upon reasonable notice, and subject to the Confidentiality Letter, the Seller shall cause the Retained Subsidiaries and the Acquired Entities to (i) afford Buyer and its representatives reasonable access to the senior managers of the Acquired Business and (ii) furnish to the representatives of Buyer such additional financial and operating data and other material information regarding the Business (or copies thereof) as Buyer may from time to time reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such access or furnishing of information shall be conducted at Buyers expense, during normal business hours, and in such a manner as not to interfere with the normal operations of the Business. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Seller shall not be required to disclose any information to Buyer if such disclosure would (i) jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege, (ii) contravene any applicable Laws, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date hereof or (iii) disrupt or jeopardize any material customer or vendor relationship or (iv) include Tax information pertaining to the Seller or its Affiliates other than the Acquired Business (except for 

    ##### 

  

    

tax information pertaining to combined, consolidated, or uniform tax filings
of Seller or its Affiliates that include any of the Acquired Entities). 

   

 (b) From and after the Closing Date, the Parties shall, and the Buying Parties shall cause the Acquired Business to, retain all material books, records, documents, instruments, accounts, correspondence, writings, evidences of title and other papers relating to the Acquired Business in their possession (the " _Books and Records_ ") for seven (7) years or for such longer period as may be required by Law. 

   

 (c) From and after the Closing Date, the Parties shall allow each other, and the Buyer shall cause the Acquired Business to allow the Seller, its Affiliates and their respective representatives, reasonable access to the Books and Records and to personnel having knowledge of the whereabouts and/or contents of the Books and Records, for legitimate non-competitive business reasons, including the preparation of audited financial statements and Tax Returns and the defense of Proceedings. Each Party shall be entitled to recover its out-of-pocket costs (including copying costs) incurred in providing such Books and Records and/or personnel to the other party. The requesting party shall hold in confidence for a period of two (2) years after the date of disclosure thereof all confidential information identified as such by, and obtained after the Closing from, the disclosing party, any of its officers, agents, representatives or employees;  _provided_ , _however_ , that information that (i) was in the public domain; (ii) was in fact known to the requesting party prior to disclosure by the disclosing party, its officers, agents, representatives or employees; (iii) becomes known to the requesting party from or through a third party not under an obligation of non-disclosure to the disclosing party; or (iv) is required by Law or regulation (of any applicable stock or securities exchange or otherwise) or otherwise deems necessary and proper to disclose in connection with the filing, examination or defense of any Tax Return or other document required to be filed, shall not be deemed to be confidential information. In addition, the Parties agree that confidential information may only be used for the purpose for which it was supplied. 

   

 6.7 _Employee Relations and Benefits_. 

  

 (a) Effective as of the Closing and for a period of twelve (12) months thereafter, the Buyer shall cause the Acquired Business to provide each Business Employee substantially the same base compensation amount and incentive compensation program, and with a benefits package substantially similar in value in the aggregate, to the compensation and benefits provided by Seller or its Subsidiaries to such Business Employee at the time of Closing; provided that nothing herein shall prevent Buyer from terminating the employment of any Business Employee with or without cause. For a period of twelve (12) months after Closing, the Business Employees not terminated for cause shall be entitled to participate in Buyers severance plan and shall receive credit thereunder for service to Seller or its Affiliates. 

   

 For the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on December 31, 2006 or as extended by mutual agreement of the parties to a date no later than December 31, 2007 (the " _Transition Period_ "), Buyer may elect, and Seller shall agree to provide: (1) continuation of benefits for Business Employees under the Benefit Plans set forth in _Section 6.7(a) of the Disclosure Schedule_ (the " _Continued Benefit Plans_ ") to the extent provided to such Business Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date along with employee benefits administration 

    ##### 

  

    

services; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 6.7(a) shall be
construed to amend the Continued Benefit Plans or to otherwise limit Sellers
or its Subsidiaries right to amend or modify its Benefit Plans; and (2)
payroll services (not including payments under any employment, consulting,
retention, severance, change-of-control, bonus, or similar agreements) for
the Transition Period. If Buyer elects such services and benefits, Buyer
agrees to pay or reimburse Seller for costs and expenses associated with
providing such services and benefits attributable to the Business Employees
(and their covered dependents) pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement.
If Buyer elects for the Business Employees to continue participation in the
Continued Benefit Plans during the Transition Period, Seller shall not be
liable for payment for any claim for welfare or fringe benefits incurred on
or after the Closing Date with respect to such Business Employees. For
purposes of this Section 6.7(a), a claim is deemed incurred for medical,
dental, and vision benefits, when the services or products generating such
expenses are performed or provided to the Business Employee (or his or her
covered dependent); for life insurance, accidental death and dismemberment
insurance, and travel accident insurance, when the death or dismemberment of
the Business Employee (or his or her covered dependent) occurred; for short-
term disability and long-term disability, upon the occurrence of the
accident, injury, illness, or disabling effect; for pre-tax dependent care
benefits or pre-tax health care benefits under Sellers flexible spending
account plan, when the services or products generating such expenses are
performed or provided to the Business Employee (or his or her covered
dependent, as applicable); and for tuition assistance benefits, when the
Business Employee begins an approved course in accordance with Sellers
tuition assistance plan. Seller shall make matching contributions to the
accounts of Business Employees participating in the ProQuest 401(k) Plan
based on Sellers earnings through the Closing Date; such matching
contributions shall be made by Seller at the same time and in the same manner
as applicable for other participants in the plan. If Buyer elects for the
Business Employees to continue participation in the ProQuest 401(k) Plan
during the Transition Period, then Buyer may elect to make an additional
matching contribution to the accounts of Business Employees attributable to
the Transition Period. Seller shall be required to perform benefits and
payroll administration services only in a manner that is substantially
similar to the manner in which such services were performed for the Acquired
Business prior to the Closing Date. Notwithstanding any provision to the
contrary, and in addition to any other remedies provided under this Agreement
and the Transition Services Agreement, Buyer shall indemnify, defend, and
hold Seller and its Subsidiaries harmless from any and all claims,
liabilities, damages, losses, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees) incurred by Seller in connection with, arising from, or relating to
the provision of benefits and payroll services pursuant to this Section
6.7(a), including liabilities relating to the Business Employees
participation in the Continued Benefit Plans following the Closing, other
than liability arising out of Sellers gross negligence or willful
misconduct. 

   

 (b) Buyer and its Affiliates shall recognize all service (consistent with Buyers service recognition policies) of the Business Employees with the Acquired Business prior to the Closing Date as service with Buyer and its Affiliates in connection with any designated 401(k) savings plans, welfare benefit plans and employment policies (including any vacation and holiday policies) maintained by Buyer or its Affiliates that are made available following the Closing Date (or after the end of the Transition Period described in Section 6.7(a)) by any of the Buying Parties or their Affiliates for purposes of any waiting period, vesting, eligibility and benefit entitlement (but excluding pension plan accruals); _provided_ _,_ _however_ _,_ that with respect to 

    ##### 

  

    

any defined benefit pension plan maintained by Buyer or one of its Affiliates
in which such Business Employee participates following the Closing Date, such
service credit shall be measured from the earliest date that such employee
commenced participation in a tax-qualified pension or savings plan maintained
by Buyer. 

   

 (c) Following the Closing Date (or after the end of any Transition Period described in Section 6.7(a)), Buyer shall (i) waive, or cause their insurance carriers to waive, all limitations as to pre-existing and at-work conditions, if any, with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to Business Employees under any welfare benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(l) of ERISA) that is made available to Business Employees following the Closing Date by Buyer or one of its Affiliates, and (ii) provide credit to Business Employees for any co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid by such employees under the employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements of the Seller or the Acquired Business during the portion of the relevant plan year including the Closing Date. 

   

 (d) Effective as of the Closing, the Buying Parties shall retain or assume all liabilities under the Benefit Plans listed on _Section 6.7(d) of the Disclosure Schedule_ (the " _Stand-Alone Benefit Plans_ "). 

   

 (e) Nothing herein, expressed or implied, shall confer upon any employee or former employee of Seller or any Acquired Entity, or the Buying Parties or any of their respective Affiliates (including the Business Employees), any rights or remedies including any right to employment or continued employment for any specified period of any nature or kind whatsoever, under or by reason of this Agreement. 

   

 (f) The Buying Parties shall retain full responsibility for compliance with the Workers Adjustment and Restraining Notification Act of 1988, as amended, and be solely responsible for furnishing any required notice of any "plant closing" or "mass layoff", as applicable, which arise as a result of any facility closings, reductions in work force, terminations or other actions, that the Acquired Business or their Affiliates may cause or initiate on or after the Closing Date with respect to the Acquired Business and shall jointly and severally indemnify Seller and its Affiliates for any liability related thereto, including reasonable attorneys fees related thereto. 

   

 (g) In respect of the European Employees, Section 6.7 shall apply except as otherwise required by Law; provided, however, that Section 6.8 will take precedence over this Section 6.7, and where there is any inconsistency between this Section 6.7 and Section 6.8, Section 6.8 will apply in respect of the European Employees. 

   

 (h) The Business Employees are expressly made third party beneficiaries to this Agreement to the extent provided in this Section 6.7 and in Section 6.8.

If the Indemnifying Parties shall have assumed the defense of any claim or Proceeding in accordance with this Section 10.4, the Indemnifying Parties shall be authorized to consent to a settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any such claim or Proceeding, without the prior written consent of such Indemnitee; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying Parties shall pay or cause to be paid all amounts arising out of such settlement or judgment concurrently with the effectiveness thereof (less any unapplied portion of the Minimum Amount and up to the Maximum Amount); _provided_ , _further_ , that the Indemnifying Parties shall not be authorized to encumber any of the assets of any Indemnitee or to agree to any restriction that would apply to any Indemnitee or to its conduct of business; and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that a condition to any such settlement shall be a complete and full release with prejudice of such Indemnitee and its Affiliates, officers, employees, consultants and agents with respect to such claim.

Each Indemnitee shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates, officers, employees, consultants and agents to, cooperate fully with the Indemnifying Parties in the defense of any claim or Proceeding being defended by the Indemnifying Parties pursuant to this Section 10.4. The assumption of any defense hereunder by an Indemnifying 

   ##### 

  

    

Party shall not be deemed an admission of responsibility for the underlying
claim. If the Indemnifying Parties do not assume the defense of any claim or
Proceeding resulting therefrom in accordance with the terms of this Section
10.4, such Indemnitee must defend against such claim or Proceeding. The
Indemnitee shall not pay, or permit to be paid, any part of the Third Party
Claim unless the Indemnifying Parties consent in writing to such payment or
unless a final judgment from which no appeal may be taken by or on behalf of
the Indemnifying Party is entered against the Indemnified Party for such
Third Party Claim. If the Indemnitee assumes the defense of any such claims
or proceeding in accordance with this section and proposes to settle such
claims or proceedings prior to a final judgment thereon or to forego any
appeal with respect thereto, then the Indemnitee shall give the Indemnifying
Party prompt written notice thereof and the Indemnifying Party shall have the
right to participate in the settlement or assume or reassume the defense
of such claims or proceeding.

 10.6 _Indemnification Calculations_. The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided under this Article X shall be computed net of any insurance proceeds or other recoveries available to any Indemnitee in connection with such Losses and net of any Tax benefits arising by reason of any such Loss.

No waiver by either party of any of the provisions hereof shall be effective unless explicitly set forth in writing and executed by the party so waiving. The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach. 

  

 12.6 _Schedules_. The Disclosure Schedule is hereby incorporated by reference and made a part of this Agreement. Any fact or item which is disclosed on any section or subsection of the Disclosure Schedule or in the Financial Statements in such a way as to make its relevance to a representation or representations made elsewhere in this Agreement or to the information called for by another section or subsection of the Disclosure Schedule to this Agreement reasonably apparent shall be deemed to be an exception to such representation or representations or to be disclosed on such other section of the Disclosure Schedule or in the Financial Statements, as the case may be, notwithstanding the omission of a reference or cross-reference thereto; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the matters disclosed in _Section 4.16 of the Disclosure Schedule_ shall not be deemed to be disclosed pursuant to _Section 4.11 of the Disclosure Schedule_. Any fact or item disclosed on any section or subsection of the Disclosure Schedule hereto shall not by reason only of such inclusion be deemed to be material and shall not be employed as a point of reference in determining any standard of materiality under this Agreement.

In that context, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally (a) submits for itself and its property in any action relating to this Agreement or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect thereof, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of the State of New York sitting in the County of New York, the court of the United States of America for the Southern District of New York, and appellate courts having jurisdiction of appeals from any of the foregoing, and agrees that all claims in respect of any such action shall be heard and determined in such New York State court or, to the extent permitted by law, in such federal court; (b) consents that any such action may and shall be brought in such courts and waives any objection that it may now or thereafter have to the venue or jurisdiction of any such action in any such

to plead or claim the same; (c) waives all right to trial by jury in any

process in any such action may be effected by mailing a copy of such process
by registered or certified mail (or any substantially similar form of mail),
postage prepaid, to such party at its address as provided in Section
12.1; and (e) agrees that nothing in this Agreement or any document delivered
pursuant to this Agreement shall affect the right to effect service of
process in any other manner permitted by the Laws of the State of New York. 

  

 12.10 _Injunctive Relief_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement exclusively in the Proper Courts, without bond or other security being required, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. 

  

 12.11 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the Disclosure Schedule hereto and agreements referred to herein (including the Confidentiality Letter) set forth the entire understanding of the parties hereto as to matters not expressly excepted or excluded herefrom. 

  

 12.12 _Interpretation and Rules of Construction_. In this Agreement, except to the extent otherwise provided or that the context otherwise requires: 

  

 (a) when a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article, Section, Exhibit or Schedule, such reference is to an Article or Section of, or an Exhibit or Schedule to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated; 

   

 (b) the table of contents and headings for this Agreement are for reference purposes only and do not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement;

If any provision of this Agreement shall be declared by any court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, all other provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected and shall remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end that the Transactions are fulfilled to the extent possible. 

  

 12.14 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts (including by means of facsimile or scanned copy), each of which shall be deemed to be an original and all of which together shall be deemed to be one and the same instrument.
