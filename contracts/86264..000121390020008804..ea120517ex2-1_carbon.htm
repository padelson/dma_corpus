(and the same shall be a Retained Liability) unless Purchaser agrees in
writing to include the same as a Permitted Lien and/or Assumed Liability. To

in accordance with _Section 5.2_ is not waived in writing by Purchaser or
cured on or before the Pre-Closing Cure Deadline, Purchaser shall elect in a
writing delivered to Sellers no less than five days prior to the Closing:

  



  

(i) to reject the Assets impacted by the Surviving Title Defects and reduce
the Base Purchase Price by the Allocated Values thereof, but allow Sellers,
at Sellers' sole expense and to the reasonable satisfaction of Purchaser, to
attempt to cure for a period ending at 5:00 pm Eastern Time on the day that is
one-hundred eighty (180) days after Closing (such period, the " _Post-Closing
Title Cure Period_ ") such asserted Title Defect pursuant to _Section
5.3(d)_. Such rejected Assets will be Excluded Assets and will be assigned to
Sellers (or an Affiliate thereof) prior to Closing pursuant to an Assignment
of the Excluded Assets which will be held in escrow by Sellers' counsel and
not recorded prior to the Post-Closing Title Cure Period as provided in
_Section 5.3 (d)_ ; or

  



  

   

\- 11 -

 



    



  

(ii) to permit the affected Assets to remain with the Company Entities but
provide an indemnity of Purchaser and the Company Entities against all
Liability resulting from such Title Defect with respect to such Assets
pursuant to an indemnity agreement mutually agreeable to the Sellers and
Purchaser (a " _Title Indemnity Agreement_ ").

  



  

If such Title Defect is not cured by Sellers, waived by Purchaser or resolved
in accordance with _Section 5.6_ hereof, from and after the Closing,
Purchaser shall operate the Assets affected by such Title Defect for the
benefit of Sellers and in accordance with a Contract Operating Agreement in
the form mutually agreed to by Sellers and Purchaser.

  



  

(d)  _Sellers Attempt to Cure Surviving Title Defects_. An attempt by Sellers
to cure a Surviving Title Defect shall be without prejudice to their rights
under _Section 5.6_ with respect to Title Disputed Matters and shall not
constitute an admission against interest or a waiver of Sellers' right to
dispute the existence, nature or value of the alleged Surviving Title Defect
or the adequacy of any Notice of Title Defects or any curative action. If
Sellers cure a Surviving Title Defect to the reasonable satisfaction of
Purchaser prior to expiration of the Post-Closing Title Cure Period, then in
connection with the delivery of the Final Settlement Statement, Sellers'
counsel will destroy, and will certify in writing to Sellers and Purchaser
the destruction of, the applicable Assignment of the Excluded Assets covering
such affected Assets, and Purchaser will pay to Sellers the amount by which
the Base Purchase Price was reduced at the Closing as a result of said
Surviving Title Defect. If Sellers fail to cure a Surviving Title Defect
prior to the expiration of the Post-Closing Period, then Sellers' counsel will
release the Assignment of the Excluded Assets to Purchaser and such Assets
permanently will be Excluded Assets and Retained Liabilities of Sellers.

  



  

5.4  _Agreement on Title Defects and Interest Additions_.

  



  

(a)  _Attempt to Agree_. With respect to each Title Defect that the Parties
do not agree has been waived or cured under _Section 5.3(a)_ or _Section
5.3(b)_ (each, an " _Open Title Defect_ "), from the receipt by Sellers of
Purchaser's Notice of Title Defects until the Closing or the earlier
acknowledgement of Purchaser in writing that it is not entitled to a Defect
Adjustment in connection with Title Defects, Purchaser and Sellers shall
attempt in good faith to agree on the existence and associated Title Defect
Value of each such Open Title Defect, and the existence and associated value
of each such Interest Addition.

  



  

(b)  _Agreement_. If Sellers and Purchaser agree on the existence and Title
Defect Value of any such Open Title Defect, then the Title Defect Value for
such Open Title Defect shall be the agreed Title Defect Value for purposes of
determining the Defect Adjustment, if any. If Sellers and Purchaser agree on
the existence and value of any Interest Addition, then the value of such
Interest Addition shall be the agreed upon value for purposes of determining
the Defect Adjustment, if any. Upon any such agreement, Sellers and Purchaser
shall execute a written instrument reflecting such agreement.

  



  

(c)  _Agreement Before Closing_. If, before the Closing Date, Sellers and
Purchaser agree on the existence and Title Defect Values of all Open Title
Defects, and the existence and value of all Interest Additions, then the
amount of the Defect Adjustment shall be deducted from and the value of all
Interest Additions shall be added to the Base Purchase Price at the Closing,
and shall be reflected in the Preliminary Adjustment Amount.

  



  

(d)  _Failure to Agree_. If, before the Closing Date, Sellers and Purchaser
do not agree on the existence and Title Defect Values of all Open Title
Defects, and the existence and value of all Interest Additions, then: (i) the
existence and Title Defect Value of those Open Title Defects that are not
agreed upon, and the existence and value of those Interest Additions that are
not agreed upon, shall be deemed to be Title Disputed Matters to be settled
by the Title Expert under _Section 5.6_ ; and (ii) the Base Purchase Price
shall be adjusted in the Final Settlement Statement pursuant to _Section 13.1_
by the amount of the Defect Adjustment (net of the values of any Interest
Additions), if any, based on the Title Defect Values of any Open Title
Defects, and the values of any Interest Additions, and any Allocated Value of
the Acquired Assets held back at Closing, as applicable, in each case
determined under this _Section 5.4_ or _Section 5.6_ , as applicable.

  



  

   

\- 12 -

 



    



  

5.5  _Interest Additions_.

  



  

(a)  _Notice of Interest Additions_. If, prior to the Defect Notice Deadline,
Sellers or Purchaser discover any additional ownership interests in Leases or
Wells that are not listed on _Exhibit A_ or _Exhibit B_ , including but not
limited to any interest that entitles the Company Entities to receive more
than the Net Revenue Interest with respect to any such Asset set forth in
_Exhibit A_ or _Exhibit B_ , or obligates Sellers or the Company Entities to
bear costs and expenses in an amount less than the Working Interest with
respect to any such Asset set forth in _Exhibit A_ or _Exhibit B_ and assuming
no corresponding reduction in the Net Revenue Interest (each an " _Interest
Addition_ "), Sellers or Purchaser, as applicable, shall promptly (but in any
event prior to the Defect Notice Deadline) provide written notice to the other
Parties of such Interest Addition. Such notice shall be in writing and shall
include: (i) a description of each such Interest Addition; (ii) the basis for
each such Interest Addition, and supporting documentation with respect
thereto; (iii) the Assets affected by each such Interest Addition and the
Allocated Values thereof; and (iv) the value of the Interest Addition or the
amount by which Sellers or Purchaser, as applicable, reasonably believe the
Allocated Values of the affected Assets should be increased by the Interest
Addition, and the computations upon which such belief is based.

  



  

(b)  _Effect of Interest Additions_. Interest Additions shall offset any
Defect Adjustment.

  



  

5.6  _Dispute Resolution_. If any Open Title Defects, including the
existence, waiver, cure, and Title Defect Values thereof, or any Interest
Additions, including the existence and values thereof (collectively, " _Title
Disputed Matters_ "), are not agreed upon under _Section 5.4(c)_ , then any
such Title Disputed Matters shall, in each case be resolved by a single Title
Expert under the dispute resolution procedure in this _Section 5.6_. As used
herein, a " _Title Expert_ " means an attorney licensed to practice law in
the State(s) where the Acquired Assets subject to the Open Title Defects are
located with at least 15 years of experience in oil and gas title and related
matters that does not have a material relationship with any Party, whose law
firm has not represented any Party or its Affiliates within the previous five
(5) years, and that is reasonably acceptable to Sellers and Purchaser. For
avoidance of doubt, if there are Open Title Defects in more than one State, a
separate Title Expert may be retained for each such State.

  



  

(a)  _Selection of Title Expert_. Sellers and Purchaser shall act in good
faith to promptly execute such engagement letters and other documents as
shall be necessary to engage the Title Expert within 20 Business Days after
the Closing. After the Title Expert has been engaged, if the Title Expert
dies or resigns or is removed upon mutual agreement of Sellers and Purchaser,
then such Title Expert shall be replaced within 20 Business Days thereafter
by Purchaser and Sellers in accordance with this _Section 5.6_ , and the time
periods in this _Section 5.6_ shall be extended as necessary or appropriate.
The fees and expenses of the Title Expert shall be paid fifty percent (50%)
by Sellers and fifty percent (50%) by Purchaser. In the event that
Sellers and Purchaser do not agree on a Title Expert within 20 Business Days
after the Closing, then Sellers, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other
hand, shall each propose a Title Expert during such 20 Business Day period and
such two (2) proposed individuals shall name the Title Expert.

  



  

(b)  _Materials to Title Expert_. Within 10 Business Days after the selection
of the Title Expert, the Parties shall provide to the Title Expert and to the
other Party (to the extent not previously provided) the following materials:

  



  

(i) Purchaser's Notice of Title Defects and all documentation provided by
Purchaser to Sellers prior to the Closing Date in connection with any Open
Title Defects or Interest Additions and values with respect thereto;

  



  

(ii) such evidence as Sellers deem appropriate to dispute the existence,
waiver, cure, and alleged Title Defect Values with respect to all Open Title
Defects, and the Interest Additions and values with respect thereto, in each
case assigned thereto by Purchaser in the Notice of Title Defects, together
with Sellers' good faith estimate of the Title Defect Values with respect to
all such Open Title Defects, if any, and the values with respect to all such
Interest Additions, if any; and

  



  

(iii) a copy of this Agreement, including all Exhibits.

  



  

   

\- 13 -

 



    



  

(c)  _Decisions of Title Expert_. The Title Expert shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to make his or her determination and provide to the
Parties written findings within 30 days after he or she has received the
materials under _Section 5.6(b)_. The decision of the Title Expert shall be
final and non-appealable and shall be limited to awarding only Sellers'
position or Purchaser's position with respect to the Title Disputed Matters
associated with each Open Title Defect and Interest Addition, in each case
that are not agreed upon by the Parties under _Section 5.4_. The Title Expert
shall make a separate determination with respect to each Open Title Defect
and Interest Addition. The written findings of the Title Expert shall set
forth the Title Expert's decision with respect to each applicable Open Title
Defect and Interest Addition and the Title Expert's rationale and supporting
documentation for the decision. The Title Expert shall not make any other
award or grant any other remedy, whether or not prohibited or contemplated by
this Agreement, and shall certify, as necessary, the resolution of such Title
Disputed Matters, as applicable, to the Accounting Referee under _Section
13.1(d)_.

  



  

5.7  _Changes in Prices_. Without prejudice to Purchaser's rights under any
provisions in this Agreement pertaining to Casualty Losses, with respect to
the operational covenants in _Article 9_ , the Purchaser shall assume all risk
of Loss with respect to: (a) changes in commodity or product prices and any
other market factors or conditions affecting the Membership Interests and the
Acquired Assets from and after the Effective Time; (b) production declines or
any adverse change in the production characteristics or downhole condition of
any Well, including any well watering out, or experiencing a collapse in the
casing or sand infiltration, before, on or after the Closing; and (c)
depreciation of any of the Acquired Assets that constitute personal property
through ordinary wear and tear, and none of the foregoing shall constitute
Title Defects or otherwise give rise to any Claims by Purchaser before, on,
or after the Closing.

  



  

5.8  _Exclusive Remedy_. Except for Purchaser's rights under Sellers'
Special Warranty of Title, Purchaser's right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 11.1(b )_, and Purchaser's rights under any
INDEMNIFICATION PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY Title Indemnity Agreement,
THIS  _Article 5_ SHALL, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
BE THE EXCLUSIVE RIGHT AND REMEDY OF PURCHASER WITH RESPECT TO TITLE DEFECTS
AND OTHER DEFICIENCIES IN TITLE WITH RESPECT TO THE ACQUIRED ASSETS.
Except for Purchaser's rights under Sellers' Special Warranty of Title,
Purchaser's right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 11.1(b
)_, and Purchaser's rights under any INDEMNIFICATION PROVISION OF THIS
AGREEMENT AND under any Title Indemnity Agreement, PURCHASER RELEASES,
REMISES AND FOREVER DISCHARGES SELLERS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES AND
THEIR RESPECTIVE MEMBERS, MANAGERS, STOCKHOLDERS, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS,
EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, ADVISORS, AND REPRESENTATIVES FROM ANY AND ALL SUITS, LEGAL
OR ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS, CLAIMS, DEMANDS, DAMAGES, LOSSES, COSTS,
LIABILITIES, INTEREST, OR CAUSES OF ACTION WHATSOEVER, IN LAW OR IN
EQUITY, KNOWN OR UNKNOWN, WHICH PURCHASER MIGHT NOW OR SUBSEQUENTLY MAY HAVE,
BASED ON, RELATING TO OR ARISING OUT OF, ANY TITLE DEFECT OR OTHER DEFICIENCY
IN TITLE TO ANY OF THE ACQUIRED ASSETS.

  



  

5.9  _Title Defect Value_. " _Title Defect Value_ " means, with respect to an
Asset, the reduction in such Asset's Allocated Value as of the Defect Notice
Deadline caused by an uncured Title Defect with respect to such Asset,
taking into account any subsequent cure of such Title Defect by Sellers or
the Company Entities as described herein; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that:

  



  

(a) in determining the Title Defect Value, the reduction in the Asset's value
shall be based on the Allocated Value thereof;

  



  

(b) the Title Defect Value shall not exceed the cost to cure the related
Title Defect (if the cost to cure is reasonably determinable);

  



  

(c) the aggregate amount of Title Defect Values attributable to all Title
Defects affecting an Asset shall not exceed the Allocated Value of such
Asset;

  



  

   

\- 14 -

 



    



  

(d) notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Title Defect is a Lien which is
undisputed and liquidated in amount, the Title Defect Value shall be the
amount necessary to be paid to remove the Lien; _provided, further,_ Liens
established in connection with the Credit Agreement and which are to be paid
off and released in connection with Closing will not be considered a Title
Defect;

  



  

(e) if a Title Defect affects an Asset for less than its full productive
life, the Title Defect Value shall be reduced to take into account the
applicable time period only;

  



  

(f) the Title Defect Value attributable to any Title Defect shall not include
any amount with respect to which Purchaser receives credit in the calculation
of the adjusted Base Purchase Price attributable to any other Title Defect;
and

  



  

(g) Subject to _Sections 5.9(a)_ through _(f)_ above, the Title Defect Value
shall be determined in accordance with the following methodology, terms and
conditions:

  



  

(i) if Purchaser and Sellers agree on the Title Defect Value, that amount
shall be the Title Defect Value;

  



  

(ii) if the Title Defect reflects a discrepancy between (A) the actual Net
Revenue Interest for the affected Asset and (B) the Net Revenue Interest
stated on the applicable Exhibit for such Asset, then the Title Defect Value
shall be an amount equal to the product of the Allocated Value of such Asset
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the Net
Revenue Interest decrease and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue
Interest stated in the applicable Exhibit for such Asset; _provided, however_
, that with respect to any discrepancy in a reversionary Net Revenue Interest,
the Title Defect Value shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect the
economic effect of the asserted Title Defect over the life of the affected
Asset;

  



  

(iii) if the Title Defect results from Sellers having more Net Mineral Acres
in the Asset than the Net Mineral Acres stated on _Exhibit A_ without a
corresponding increase in the Net Revenue Interest stated in _Exhibit A_ for
such Asset, then the Title Defect Value shall be an amount equal to the
product of the Allocated Value of such Asset multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the amount of the Net Mineral Acres increase and the
denominator of which is the Net Mineral Acres stated in _Exhibit A_ for such
Asset;

  



  

(iv) if the Title Defect represents an obligation, encumbrance, burden or
charge upon or other defect in title to the Asset of a type not described in
clauses (i)-(iii) above, the Title Defect Value shall be determined by taking
into account the Allocated Value of the Asset, the portion of the Asset
adversely affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect of the Title Defect,
the potential economic effect of the Title Defect over the life of the Asset,
the values placed upon the asserted Title Defect by Purchaser and Sellers and
such other factors as are reasonably necessary to make a proper evaluation;
and

  



  

(v) the Title Defect Value with respect to a Title Defect shall be determined
without duplication of any costs or losses included in any other Title Defect
Value hereunder or of any amounts for which Purchaser otherwise receives
credit in the calculation of the adjustments to the Base Purchase Price and
shall be calculated in a manner that is net to the interest of the applicable
Company Entity in the applicable Asset.

  



  

(h) If an instrument creating or conveying (or purporting to create or
convey) any Mineral Fee Interest or leasehold interest (which shall include
but not be limited to overriding royalty interests) is the basis for Purchaser
asserting a Title Defect and the Title Defect affects more than one Asset,
then the Title Defect Threshold and the Title Defect Value shall apply
cumulatively to all impacted Assets. If an Asset is affected by more than one
(1) Title Defect, then Purchaser may assert a cumulative Title Defect in
respect of all such Title Defects affecting such Acquired Asset and the Title
Defect Threshold shall apply cumulatively to all such Title Defects.

ARTICLE 6 
 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

  



  

6.1  _Notice of Environmental Conditions_.

  



  

(a) As a condition to asserting any claim with respect to any alleged Adverse
Environmental Condition affecting the Acquired Assets, Purchaser must deliver
to Sellers a valid written Notice of Environmental Condition no later than the
Defect Notice Deadline. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall use
reasonable efforts to notify Sellers of any alleged Adverse Environmental
Condition affecting the Acquired Assets at least once every week during the
period between the Execution Date and the Defect Notice Deadline which notice
may be preliminary in nature and supplemented prior to the Defect Notice
Deadline; _provided_ that failure of Purchaser to provide preliminary notice
of any Adverse Environmental Condition shall not be deemed to be a waiver of
or otherwise prejudice Purchaser's right to assert an Adverse Environmental
Condition on or before the Defect Notice Deadline.

  



  

(b) On or before the Defect Notice Deadline, Purchaser shall deliver to
Sellers a written notice (a " _Notice of Environmental Conditions_ ") that
sets forth all Adverse Environmental Conditions affecting the Acquired Assets
that Purchaser desires to assert under this Agreement. The Notice of
Environmental Conditions shall, with respect to each such alleged Adverse
Environmental Condition set forth therein:

  



  

(i) a specific description of each Asset that is affected by the alleged
Adverse Environmental Condition (the " _Environmental Defect Property_ ");

  



  

(ii) a description of the alleged Adverse Environmental Condition and the
facts and circumstances giving rise thereto, including all materials compiled
by Purchaser which supports the existence of such alleged Adverse
Environmental Condition;

  



  

(iii) the Allocated Value of each Environmental Defect Property; and

  



  

(iv) a good-faith estimate of the Remediation Amount (itemized in reasonable
detail) that Purchaser asserts is attributable to such alleged Adverse
Environmental Condition.

  



  

Purchaser' good-faith estimate of the Remediation Amount must describe the
Remediation proposed for the Adverse Environmental Condition and identify all
material assumptions used by Purchaser in estimating the Remediation Amount,
including any applicable standards the Purchaser asserts must be met to
comply with Environmental Laws.

  



  

(c) An Adverse Environmental Condition shall be conclusively waived by
Purchaser and Purchaser shall not be entitled to any adjustment for such
Adverse Environmental Condition, and Sellers shall not be obligated to cure
such Adverse Environmental Condition, if Purchaser fails to provide a Notice
of Environmental Defect to Sellers of such Adverse Environmental Condition in
accordance with  _Section 6.1(b)_ on or before the Defect Notice Deadline.

  



  

6.2  _Environmental Defect Threshold; Remediation; Remedies_.

  



  

(a)  _Environmental Defect Threshold_. An Adverse Environmental Condition
shall be conclusively waived by Purchaser, Purchaser shall not be entitled to
any adjustment for such Adverse Environmental Condition, and Sellers shall not
be obligated to cure such Adverse Environmental Condition, if: (i) the
Remediation Amount with respect to such Adverse Environmental Condition is
less than the Environmental Defect Threshold; and (ii) the Allocated Value of
the Environmental Defect Properties affected by such Environmental Defect is
less than the Environmental Defect Threshold.

  



  

   

\- 16 -

 



    



  

(b)  _Election of Remedies_. Subject to Sellers' continuing right to dispute
the existence of an Adverse Environmental Condition or the Remediation Amount
asserted with respect thereto under _Section 6.3_ below and subject to the
Environmental Defect Threshold and the Defect Deductible with respect to
clause (i) below, an Adverse Environmental Condition that is not waived under
_Section 6.2(a)_ or otherwise waived by Purchaser or Remediated under this
_Section 6.2(b) _prior to such time and date is referred to in this
Agreement as a " _Surviving Environmental Defect_." To the extent Purchaser
delivers any valid Notice of Environmental Conditions prior to the Defect
Notice Deadline, then for any Adverse Environmental Conditions that are not
waived under _Section 6.2(a)_ , Purchaser may elect any of the following
remedies with written notice to Sellers no less than five (5) days prior to
Closing:

  



  

(i) reject the Environmental Defect Properties and reduce the Base Purchase
Price by the Allocated Values thereof, but allow Sellers to attempt to
Remediate in accordance with Environmental Laws at Sellers' sole cost such
Adverse Environmental Condition, which Remediation work must be completed to
Purchaser's reasonable satisfaction on or prior to 5:00 pm Eastern Time on
the day that is five (5) days prior to Sellers' delivery of the Final
Settlement Statement to Purchaser (such period, the " _Post-
Closing Environmental Cure Period_ "). Such rejected Environmental Defect
Properties will be Excluded Assets and will be assigned to Sellers (or an
Affiliate thereof) pursuant to the Assignment of Excluded Assets which will
be held in escrow by Sellers' counsel and not recorded prior to the Post-
Closing Environmental Cure Period as provided in _Section 6.2(d)_ ; or

  



  

(ii) permit the Environmental Defect Properties to remain with the applicable
Company Entity and indemnify such Company Entity and Purchaser against all
Liability resulting from such Adverse Environmental Condition with respect to
such Environmental Defect Properties pursuant to an indemnity agreement
mutually agreeable to the Sellers and Purchaser (an " _Environmental
Indemnity Agreement_ ").

  



  

(c)  _Effect of Attempted Remediation by Sellers_. An attempt by Sellers to
Remediate a Surviving Environmental Defect shall be without prejudice to
their rights under _Section 6.3_ with respect to Disputed Environmental
Matters and shall not constitute an admission against interest or a waiver of
Sellers' right to dispute the existence, nature or value of, or cost to
Remediate, the alleged Adverse Environmental Condition or the adequacy of any
Notice of Environmental Conditions or any curative action. If Sellers
Remediate a Surviving Environmental Defect in accordance with Environmental
Laws and to the reasonable satisfaction of Purchaser prior to expiration of
the Post-Closing Environmental Cure Period, then in connection with the
delivery of the Final Settlement Statement, Sellers' counsel will destroy,
and will certify in writing to Sellers and Purchaser the destruction of, the
applicable Assignment of the Excluded Assets covering such affected Assets,
and Purchaser will pay to Sellers the amount by which the Base Purchase Price
was reduced at the Closing as a result of said Surviving Environmental Defect.
If Sellers fail to cure a Surviving Environmental Defect prior to the
expiration of the Post-Closing Period, then Sellers' counsel will release the
Assignment of the Excluded Assets to Purchaser and such Assets permanently
will be Excluded Assets and Retained Liabilities of Sellers.

  



  

(d)  _Adequacy of Sellers Remediation_. With respect to any Remediation
completed by Sellers, Sellers will be deemed to have adequately completed the
Remediation upon receipt by Purchaser, subject to Purchaser's review and
approval, of a written certificate of approval or completion from the
applicable Governmental Body that the Adverse Environmental Condition has been
cured and no further Remediation is required. If no written certificate or
approval is available under Environmental Law, Sellers will be deemed to have
adequately completed the Remediation upon receipt by Purchaser, subject to
Purchaser's review and approval, of a certificate from an independent,
licensed professional engineer or other professional that the Adverse
Environmental Condition has been cured and no further Remediation is
required. If the Parties cannot reach an agreement and do not obtain an
independent certificate or are not able to appoint an independent, licensed
professional engineer, the issue of whether the Remediation is completed may
be resolved by the dispute resolution procedures set forth in _Section 6.3_
below. Following the completion of any Remediation in accordance with this
_Section 6.2_, Purchaser shall have no further remedies against Sellers
with respect to the applicable Adverse Environmental Condition or the
corresponding Remediation Amount.

  



  

6.3  _Adverse Environmental Condition Disputes_.

  



  

(a) Sellers and Purchaser shall attempt to agree on all asserted Adverse
Environmental Conditions and Remediation Amounts prior to the Pre-Closing
Cure Deadline. If, by the Pre-Closing Cure Deadline, Sellers and Purchaser are
unable to agree on an alleged Adverse Environmental Condition, on the
completion of Remediation or on an alleged Remediation Amount (including, in
each case, the adequacy of any Remediation actions with respect thereto) (the
" _Disputed Environmental Matters_ ") such disputes, and only such disputes,
shall be exclusively and finally resolved in accordance with the following
provisions of this _Section 6.3_. Any initiation of an expert determination
of any Disputed Environmental Matter shall only be in accordance with the
following  _subsections (b)_ through _(j)_ below.

  



  

   

\- 17 -

 



    



  

(b) No later than 10 days following the Closing, a representative of Sellers
and a representative of Purchaser shall meet to attempt to resolve any
Disputed Environmental Matters. In the event that the Parties are not able to
reach agreement with respect to any Disputed Environmental Matters, then
either Sellers or Purchaser may submit any Disputed Environmental Matter to
expert determination pursuant to this _Section 6.3_ by written notice to the
other Party within 20 days following the Closing, together with
all supporting documentation of such Disputed Environmental Matter. If a
Party does not submit a notice of expert determination to the other Party in
accordance with this _Section 6.3(b)_ within 20 days following the Closing,
such Party shall be deemed to have waived all such Disputed Environmental
Matters, which shall be deemed conclusively resolved in accordance with the
other Party's written position or subsequent agreement between the Parties
pursuant to this _Section 6.3(b)_.

  



  

(c) By not later than 15 days after a Party's receipt of a written
description of any Disputed Environmental Matters, such Party shall provide
to the initiating Party a written response setting forth its position with
respect to such Disputed Environmental Matters, together with all supporting
documentation.

  



  

(d) The environmental expert (the " _Environmental Expert_ ") shall be
selected by Sellers and Purchaser in accordance with this _Section 6.3(d)_.
Sellers and Purchaser shall each exchange lists of three (3) acceptable,
qualified environmental experts (who shall be an environmental engineer or
environmental attorney with at least 10 years of experience
in investigations, remediation and examining environmental matters involving
oil and gas producing properties in the State(s) where the Assets subject to
the Disputed Environmental Matters are located), and shall certify that each
potential environmental expert set forth on its list has not, and such
environmental expert's firm has not, represented the certifying Party or any
of its Affiliates within the previous three (3) years. Within five (5) days
following the exchange of lists of environmental experts, Sellers and
Purchaser shall select by mutual agreement the Environmental Expert from their
lists of three (3) acceptable environmental experts. If no such agreement is
reached, the Lexington, Kentucky office of the American Arbitration
Association shall select an environmental expert from the lists provided by
Sellers and Purchaser to serve as the Environmental Expert (but only to
the extent such listed environmental experts satisfy the conditions and
qualifications set forth herein).

  



  

(e) Within 10 days following the engagement of the Environmental Expert, the
Parties shall submit to the Environmental Expert one copy of (i) this
Agreement, (ii) the initiating Party's written description of the Disputed
Environmental Matters provided pursuant to _Section 6.3(b)_ , together with
the supporting documents that were provided to the other Party and (iii)
the other Party's written response to the initiating party's written
description of the Disputed Environmental Matters, together with the
supporting documents that were provided to the initiating Party. The
Environmental Expert shall resolve the Disputed Environmental Matters based
only on the foregoing submissions. Neither the Purchaser nor the Sellers shall
have the right to submit any additional documentation to the Environmental
Expert or to demand discovery on the other Party.

  



  

(f) The Environmental Expert, once appointed and engaged, shall have no ex
parte communications with any Party concerning the determination required
hereunder. All communications between any Party and the Environmental Expert
shall be conducted in writing, with copies sent simultaneously to the other
Parties in the same manner, or at a meeting in Lexington, Kentucky, to which
the representatives of all Parties have been invited and of which such
Parties have been provided at least five (5) days' written notice.

  



  

   

\- 18 -

 



    



  

(g) The Parties will instruct the Environmental Expert to make his/her
determination by written decision within 15 days following submission of the
Disputed Environmental Matters to the Environmental Expert, which shall be
final and binding upon the Parties, without right of appeal. In making the
determination, the Environmental Expert shall be bound by the rules set forth
in this _Article 6_. The Environmental Expert may consult with and engage
disinterested third party consultants to advise the Environmental Expert but
shall disclose to the Parties the identities of such consultants. Any such
consultant shall not have worked as an employee of or consultant for the
Parties or their respective Affiliates within the previous three (3) years and
shall not have any financial interest in the dispute. The written finding of
the Environmental Expert will set forth the Environmental Expert's
finding, if applicable, as to (i) whether the subject Adverse Environmental
Condition exists or has been Remediated and, subject to the following
sentence, the resulting Remediation Amount, (ii) the deficiencies in any
notice of the foregoing and the specific supplemental information that, if
provided, would cause such notice to be in compliance with the terms of
_Section 6.1_ and/or (iii) the adequacy of any Remediation action, including
any such additional Remediation actions necessary to Remediate properly any
asserted Adverse Environmental Condition, as applicable, in each case,
including the Environmental Expert's rationale for the determination. With
respect to a Remediation Amount, the Environmental Expert shall be limited to
awarding only the final amount proposed by either Sellers or Purchaser in
their respective submissions provided pursuant to _Section 6.3(e)_. The
Environmental Expert shall make a separate and independent determination with
respect to each Disputed Environmental Matter submitted and shall provide a
detailed written finding supporting such determination.

  



  

(h) The Environmental Expert shall act as an expert for the limited purpose

such Seller Operated Properties.

9.7  _Governmental Reviews and Filings; Customary Post-Closing Consents_.

  



  

(a)  _Before Closing_. From and after the Execution Date until the Closing,
the Parties shall cooperate to provide all information requested by, make all
required filings with, prepare and submit all required applications to, and
conduct all negotiations required or requested by, any Governmental Authority
as may be required to consummate the Contemplated Transactions.

  



  

(b)  _Customary Post-Closing Consents_. Within 30 days after the Closing,
Purchaser, the Companies, the CAC Subsidiaries and the Nytis LLC Subsidiaries
(at their cost and expense) shall apply for all Customary Post-Closing
Consents and, upon request by Sellers, provide copies of all such
applications to Sellers. After Closing, Purchaser, the Companies, the CAC
Subsidiaries and the Nytis LLC Subsidiaries further agree to promptly take
all other actions reasonably required of them by Governmental Authorities
having jurisdiction to obtain all requisite regulatory approvals with respect
to the Contemplated Transactions.

  



  

9.8  _Material Required Consents_.

  



  

(a) Promptly after the Execution Date, the Companies and the applicable CAC
Subsidiaries shall (i) mail requests for all Material Required Consents set
forth on _Schedule 7.9_ as well as other consents to assignment of the
Membership Interests that do not constitute Material Required Consents to the
applicable third Persons holding such rights and (ii) use commercially
reasonable efforts (but in no event required to make any payments or incur
any material obligations to any such Person), with reasonable assistance from
the Parties (including Purchaser providing required assurances of financial
condition and operator qualifications but in no event shall Purchaser, the
Companies or the CAC Subsidiaries be required to make any payments or incur
any material obligations to any Person in connection therewith), to obtain
all Material Required Consents and such other consents before the Closing.

  



  

(b) If, during the course of Purchaser's Due Diligence Review, Purchaser
discovers any Material Required Consent that is not listed in _Schedule 7.9_
, Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts within three (3)
Business Days after discovery to provide written notice to Sellers of such
Material Required Consent, and _Schedule 7.9_ shall be deemed updated to
include such Material Required Consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
such updated Schedule shall not be deemed to have cured any inaccuracy in or
breach of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement,
including for purposes of the indemnification or termination rights contained
in this Agreement or of determining whether or not the conditions set forth in
_Section 10.3(a) _ have been satisfied.

  



  

(c) If a Material Required Consent applicable to the Contemplated
Transactions, the failure of which to obtain or satisfy would render the
assignment of an Acquired Asset void, voidable or result in termination or the
right to terminate thereof, is not obtained, complied with or otherwise
satisfied prior to the Closing Date, then, unless otherwise mutually agreed in
writing by Sellers and Purchaser, (i) any Acquired Asset or portion thereof
affected by such Material Required Consent shall be an Excluded Asset and the
Base Purchase Price to be paid at Closing shall be reduced by the portion of
the Allocated Value thereof. Any such Excluded Asset so held back at the
Closing will be conveyed to Purchaser within ten (10) days following the date
on which Sellers obtain, comply with or otherwise satisfy all Material
Required Consent with respect to such Excluded Asset for a purchase price
equal to the amount by which the Base Purchase Price was reduced on account
of the holding back of such Excluded Asset; _provided_ ,  _however_ , if all
Material Required Consents with respect to any such Excluded Asset so held
back at the Closing are not obtained, complied with or otherwise satisfied
within 180 days following the Closing Date, then such Excluded Asset shall be
eliminated from the Acquired Assets and this Agreement unless Sellers and
Purchaser mutually agree to proceed with a closing on such Excluded Asset in
which case Purchaser shall be deemed to have waived any objection with respect
to non-compliance with such Seller Approvals.

  



  

9.9  _Preferential Purchase Rights_.

  



  

(a)  _Compliance with Preferential Rights_. Each of the Company Entities
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts (but in no event required to
make any payments or incur any material obligations owed to any Person) to
comply with any Preferential Rights by sending written notice of this
Agreement, promptly after the Execution Date, to all Persons holding any such
Preferential Rights set forth on _Schedule 7.10_ , offering to sell to each
such Person that portion of the Acquired Assets for which such a right is
held for an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such portion of such
Acquired Assets, as applicable. In no event shall the Parties be required to
make any payments or incur any material obligations to any Person with respect
to obtaining a waiver of any Preferential Right.

  



  

   

\- 34 -

 



    



  

(b)  _Notification_. If, during the course of its Due Diligence Review,
Purchaser discovers any Preferential Right that is not set forth on _Schedule
7.10_ , Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts within three
(3) Business Days after discovery to provide written notice to Sellers of
such Preferential Right, whereupon Sellers and the Company Entities shall
promptly thereafter comply with such Preferential Right in accordance with
_Section 9.9(a)_, and _Schedule 7.10_ shall be deemed updated by such
Preferential Right. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such updated Schedule
shall not be deemed to have cured any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement, including for purposes
of the indemnification or termination rights contained in this Agreement or
of determining whether or not the conditions set forth in  _Section 10.3(a)_
have been satisfied.

  



  

(c)  _Consummation Before Closing_. If, before the Closing Date, any
Preferential Right is exercised and the sale to the holder of such right is
consummated, then that portion of the Acquired Assets, as applicable, affected
by such Preferential Right shall be excluded from the Acquired Assets
conveyed at the Closing, and the Preliminary Adjustment Amount shall be
adjusted downward by the Allocated Value of such portion of the Acquired
Assets, subject to the following:

  



  

(i) if the Preferential Right applies to a change of control of the Acquired
Assets, then the Preliminary Adjustment Amount shall be adjusted downward by
the Allocated Value of all assets attributable to such Preferential Right; and

  



  

(ii) if the Preferential Right affects only a portion of an Acquired Asset
and a portion of the Base Purchase Price has not been allocated specifically
to such portion of an Acquired Asset in _Exhibit A_ , _Exhibit B_ or _Exhibit
C_ , then the portion of the Base Purchase Price to be allocated to such
Acquired Asset shall be determined in the same manner as provided in
_Section 5.9(g)_ when a Title Defect affects only a portion of an Asset.

  



  

(d)  _Consummation After Closing_. If, with respect to a Preferential Right,
either: (i) the time frame for the exercise of such right has not expired
before the Closing Date and none of Sellers or the Company Entities, as
applicable, has received from the holder of such right either a notice of
such holder's intent not to exercise such Preferential Right or a waiver of
such Preferential Right, or (ii) the holder of such Preferential Right timely
and properly exercises such right before the Closing Date but the purchase
and sale of the affected Acquired Assets to the holder of such Preferential
Right is not consummated before the Closing Date, then such Acquired Assets
shall be conveyed to Purchaser at Closing subject to such Preferential
Right, unless such affected Acquired Assets has been otherwise eliminated
from the Acquired Assets in accordance with other provisions of this
Agreement. If a third party elects to purchase such affected Acquired Assets
subject to a Preferential Right and Closing has already occurred with respect
to such affected Acquired Assets, Purchaser shall be obligated to convey such
affected Acquired Assets to such third party and shall be entitled to the
consideration for the sale of such affected Acquired Assets.

  



  

(e)  _Certain Acknowledgements_. Purchaser acknowledges that, by selling the
Membership Interests to Purchaser, Sellers desire to sell all of the Acquired
Assets to Purchaser and would not have entered into this Agreement but for
Purchaser's agreement to purchase all of the Acquired Assets as herein
provided. Sellers' obligation hereunder to sell the Membership Interests to
Purchaser is expressly conditioned upon the transfer of all of the Acquired
Assets (other than the other Assets excluded pursuant to the express
provisions of this Agreement) in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
either by conveyance by Sellers to the Company Entities or conveyance by the
applicable Company Entity (for Sellers' benefit) pursuant to an applicable
Preferential Right; provided that, nothing herein is intended or shall
operate to extend or apply any Preferential Right to any portion of the
Acquired Assets that is not otherwise burdened thereby.

9.10  _Casualty Loss_. If, from and after the Effective Time but prior to the
Closing Date, any portion of the Acquired Assets suffers a Casualty Loss that
exceeds $250,000, then, subject to _Section 10.1(c)_  and the other
provisions of this Agreement, (i) Purchaser shall nevertheless be required to
close the Contemplated Transactions and (ii) Sellers shall elect by written
notice to Purchaser prior to Closing to either (A) cause, at Sellers' sole
cost, each Acquired Asset affected by such Casualty Losses to be repaired,
restored or replaced (to at least the condition or quality prior to the
occurrence of the applicable event) prior to Closing or (B) reduce the
Base Purchase Price by the cost to repair, restore or replace each Acquired
Asset affected by such Casualty Losses to at least its condition prior to
such casualty or taking. In each case, Sellers shall retain all rights to
insurance, condemnation awards and other claims against third parties with
respect to the casualty or taking except to the extent the Parties otherwise
agree in writing. Sellers shall be deemed to have made the election under
clause (B) above with respect to each Acquired Asset affected by Casualty
Losses if, as of the Outside Closing Date or the Closing, as applicable, such
Asset has not been repaired, restored or replaced (to at least the condition
or quality prior to the occurrence of the applicable event) at Sellers' sole
cost.

  



  

9.11  _Confidentiality_.

  



  

(a)  _Confidentiality Agreement_. Unless and until the Closing occurs, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect; _provided,
however,_ Carbon is permitted to disclose the terms of this Agreement to the
third-party owner of the 1.89% membership interest of Nytis LLC in connection
with its negotiating the purchase of such membership interest. Effective upon
the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall automatically terminate
without any further action of the Parties. If this Agreement is terminated
before the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue to remain in
full force and effect in accordance with its terms and shall survive the
termination of this Agreement.

  



  

(b)  _Obligations after Closing_. After the Closing, Purchaser, the Companies
and the CAC Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand,
shall not, directly or indirectly, disclose, or permit any of their respective
Entity Representatives to disclose, to any third party (i) any of the
financial terms of this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions, (ii) in
the case of Purchaser, any of the Excluded Assets that constitute records,
data or other agreements or information or (iii) in the case of Sellers,
the Records (including all or any portion of the Purchase Price)
(collectively, " _Confidential Information_ ") without the prior written
consent of the other Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that this _Section
9.11(b)_ shall not prevent disclosures of Confidential Information by a
Party: (A) pursuant to _Section 9.11(c)_ or _Section 9.12_ ; (B) of
information that, at the time of disclosure, is generally available to the
public (other than as a result of a breach of this Agreement (including
_Section 9.12_ ) or any other confidentiality agreement to which such Party is
a party or of which it has knowledge), as evidenced by generally available
documents or publications; (C) to the extent disclosure is necessary
or advisable, to its Affiliates or to such Party's or any such Affiliate's
Entity Representatives for the purpose of performing their respective
obligations under this Agreement; (D) to banks or other financial institutions
or agencies or any independent accountants or legal counsel or investment
advisors employed by such Party or its Affiliates, to the extent
disclosure is necessary or advisable to obtain financing; (E) to the extent
necessary, to enforce this Agreement; (F) to the extent disclosure is
required or advisable under any securities Law or listing requirement of any
securities exchange applicable to such Party or any of its equity owners or
its or their respective Affiliates; or (G) to the extent required under any
contract; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in each case of disclosure under
clauses (C) or (D), the Persons to whom disclosure is made agree to be
bound by this confidentiality provision, and the Party making such disclosure
shall be liable and responsible for any breach by such Person of this
confidentiality obligation.

  



  

(c)  _Information Requests_. Notwithstanding _Section 9.11(b)_ , if, in the
opinion of a Party's counsel, such Party is required by a Proceeding,
discovery request, Freedom of Information Act (or state equivalent) request,
investigative demand, subpoena, or Order to disclose Confidential Information
(collectively, an " _Information Request_ "), such Party shall give the other
Party at least 10 days' prior written notice (unless less time is permitted by
the applicable Information Request, in which case the disclosing Party shall
give as much notice as is possible), together with a copy of the Information
Request. If, before the time such disclosure is required to be made, the other
Party provides the disclosing Party with written notice that it intends to
object to the Information Request, file a motion for a protective order, file
a motion to quash the Information Request, or take other legal action to
prevent the disclosure of Confidential Information (collectively, an "
_Objection_ "), the disclosing Party shall not produce any documents or make
any disclosures until it receives an Order from the relevant Governmental
Authority, receives written consent from the other Party, or receives an
opinion of legal counsel of the disclosing Party that the disclosing Party is
legally required to comply with the Information Request despite the pending
Objection. Further, the disclosing Party agrees to cooperate with the other
Party, at the request and expense of the other Party, in filing or obtaining
an Objection to ensure confidential treatment of the Confidential Information.
If, after compliance with the foregoing, the disclosing Party is required to
disclose Confidential Information pursuant to such an Information Request,
the disclosing Party shall furnish only that portion of the Confidential
Information that is legally required to be disclosed, and will cooperate with
the other Party's counsel to enable the other Party, at its sole cost and
expense, to obtain any available, reliable assurance that any Confidential
Information so disclosed will be accorded confidential treatment.

9.12  _Public Announcements_.

  



  

(a)  _Requirements_. Except as provided in _Section 9.12(b)_ , none of
Sellers, the Companies, the CAC Subsidiaries or Purchaser shall issue any
press release or make any announcement with respect to this Agreement or the
Contemplated Transactions, without the prior written consent of the other
Parties. If any Party intends to issue any press release or other announcement
concerning this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions, such Party shall
provide to the other Parties a copy of the proposed announcement at least
five (5) Business Days before the disclosure and shall in good faith consider
any comments provided by such other Parties;  _provided_ , _however_ , that
the right of a Party to provide comments to any such press release or
announcement shall not diminish its right to consent to such press release or
announcement under this _Section 9.12(a)_.

  



  

(b)  _Limited Exception_. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
_Section 9.12_ , nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent a Party
from disclosing the terms or the existence of this Agreement or the
Contemplated Transactions to the extent such Party determines, upon advice of
counsel, that such disclosure is required or advisable under any securities
Law or listing requirement of any securities exchange applicable to such
Party or any of its equity owners or its or their respective Affiliates; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that the disclosing Party shall provide the other
Parties with the opportunity to comment within the five (5) Business Day
period (or any shorter period as may be available under applicable Law or
requirement of any securities exchange) under _Section 9.12(a)_ before the
disclosure.

  



  

9.13 [ _Reserved_ ].

  



  

9.14  _Required Bonding_. Purchaser shall obtain all bonds, guarantees,
letters of credit and other surety arrangements and credit support
obligations required in connection with the ownership of the Membership
Interests or the ownership, use, or operation of the Acquired Assets
(including all bonds and surety arrangements required by the DOI and the
States of Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Tennessee, Virginia, West
Virginia) necessary to cause Sellers' bonds, guarantees, letters of credit and
other surety arrangements and credit support obligations with respect to the
Acquired Assets to be released at Closing. Not later than 10 Business Days
before the Closing, Purchaser shall provide Sellers with satisfactory evidence
that all such bonds, guarantees, letters of credit and other surety
arrangements and credit support obligations have been obtained and will be
unconditionally effective as of the Closing Date.

  



  

9.15  _Breach Before Closing_. If, before the Closing, Purchaser obtains
information that leads Purchaser to believe that Sellers, the Companies or
the CAC Subsidiaries have or may have breached any representation, warranty,
covenant, or other provision of this Agreement, Purchaser shall provide
notice to such Party(ies) of such breach or potential breach promptly after
discovery thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure of Purchaser to
notify Sellers, the Companies, or the CAC Subsidiaries of a breach shall not
be deemed to have cured any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement, including for purposes of the
indemnification or termination rights contained in this Agreement or of
determining whether or not the conditions set forth in _Section 10.3(a)_ have
been satisfied.

  



  

9.16  _Fulfillment of Conditions_. From and after the Execution Date until
the Closing, each Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts, and
proceed diligently and in good faith, to perform and satisfy all
representations, warranties and covenants of such Party contained in this
Agreement (to the extent not inconsistent with this Agreement), and shall not
take or fail to take any action that could reasonably be expected to result
in the performance and fulfillment of any such representations, warranties or
covenant.

9.17  _Amendment of Sellers ' Schedules and Exhibits_.

  



  

(a) Purchaser agrees that, with respect to the representations and warranties
of Sellers contained in this Agreement, Sellers shall have the continuing
right until the Closing to add, supplement or amend any of Sellers' Exhibits
or Schedules to their representations and warranties with respect to any
matter hereafter arising or discovered which, if existing or known at the
Execution Date or thereafter, would have been required to be set forth or
described in such Exhibit and Schedules. For all purposes of this
Agreement, including for purposes of indemnification or termination rights or
determining whether the conditions set forth in _Section 10.3_ have been
fulfilled, the list of Material Contracts as set forth on _Exhibit E_ and the
Sellers' Schedules contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to include
only that information contained therein on the Execution Date and shall be
deemed to exclude all information contained in any addition, supplement or
amendment thereto.

  



  

(b) Within ten (10) days after the Execution Date, Sellers will provide to
Buyer supplements to _Exhibit C (Midstream Assets)_ ,  _Exhibit D (Rights-of-
Way, Easements, Surface Use Agreements, Surface Leases)_ and _Exhibit H (Field
Offices)_ setting forth the Book and Page Numbers or the Instrument Numbers
at which the operative documents have been recorded in the land records of

9.19  _Employee Matters_.

  



  

(a) Purchaser shall not assume any employment agreements between Nytis LLC
and its officers (each, an " _Excluded Employment Agreement_ " and
collectively, the " _Excluded Employment Agreements_ "), each of which is
an Excluded Asset that will be assigned to Sellers (or an Affiliate) prior to
the Closing. From the Execution Date until the date that is fourteen (14)
days prior to the Closing Date, Sellers shall cooperate with Purchaser's
review of the work history, performance, credentials, skills, and
qualifications of the Business Employees. If, prior to the expiration of such
period, Purchaser, in its sole discretion, determines not to employ any
Business Employee, Sellers shall, on or prior to Closing, terminate
such Business Employee and pay such Business Employee severance costs
pursuant to Sellers' severance programs and policies as may be in effect at
that time; provided, however, that Purchaser shall reimburse Sellers $200,000
for the severance costs paid to employees, which amount shall be paid at
Closing and set forth on the Preliminary Settlement Statement. Nothing in this
Agreement imposes an obligation on the Purchaser to retain any Business
Employee for any length of time.

  



  

(b) During the period of time beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the
first anniversary thereof, Seller shall not and shall cause its Affiliates
not to solicit for employment or hire any Business Employee; provided that
this covenant shall not preclude the Seller or an Affiliate thereof from
soliciting for employment or hiring any Business Employee whose employment is
terminated after the Closing Date by the Companies, CAC Subsidiaries or Nytis
LLC Subsidiaries.

  



  

9.20  _Information Statement_. Each Party shall cooperate with the other
Party in the preparation of the preliminary and the definitive Information
Statement, including all amendments or supplements thereto. Carbon shall
prepare and file with the SEC the preliminary Information Statement as
promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement. No
filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Information Statement will be
made by Carbon without first providing the Purchaser a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the portions expressly referencing
Purchaser, and Carbon shall consider in good faith all reasonable additions,
deletions and changes suggested by the Purchaser in connection therewith. If
Carbon receives any comments from the SEC with respect to the preliminary
Information Statement and any requests by the SEC for any amendment or
supplement thereto or for additional information with respect to the
preliminary Information Statement, Carbon shall respond as promptly as
reasonably practicable to such comments. The Purchaser shall, as promptly as
reasonably practicable, provide Carbon with such information as may be
required to be included in the Information Statement or as may be reasonably
required to respond to any comment of the SEC. As promptly as reasonably
practicable after all comments received from the staff of the SEC have been
cleared by the SEC, Carbon shall file the definitive Information Statement
with the SEC and cause such definitive Information Statement to be mailed to
its stockholders of record. If at any time prior to the Closing Date, any
information relating to the Purchaser or Carbon, or any of their respective
Affiliates, directors or officers, is discovered by the Purchaser or Carbon
that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Information
Statement, so that the Information Statement would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, the Party that discovers such information
shall promptly notify the other Party, and Carbon shall promptly file with
the SEC an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information
and, to the extent required by applicable Legal Requirements, disseminate
such amendment or supplement to the stockholders of Carbon.

reasonably requested by Purchaser to obtain and bind the RandW Insurance
Policy. Prior to or at the Closing, Sellers shall pay or cause to be paid,
all costs and expenses related to the RandW Insurance Policy, including the
total premium, underwriting costs, brokerage commissions, and other fees and
expenses of such policy;  _provided_ , that Purchaser shall pay or cause to
be paid one-half of the costs and expenses of the RandW Insurance Policy (up to

hereto as _Exhibit T_.

  



  

9.24  _No Solicitation_.

  



  

(a) Except as permitted by this _Section 9.24_ , from the Execution Date
until the Closing Date or the earlier termination of this Agreement, Carbon
shall not, shall cause each of the Sellers, the Companies and the CAC
Subsidiaries, and each of its and their respective officers and directors not
to, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its and the
Sellers', the Companies' and the CAC Subsidiaries' other employees not to,
directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly induce or knowingly
encourage, or take any action to knowingly facilitate the making of, any
inquiry, offer or proposal which constitutes, or would reasonably be expected
to lead to, a Takeover Proposal; (ii) participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding any Takeover Proposal or furnish, or otherwise afford
access, to any Person (other than Purchaser) any non-public information or
data with respect to Carbon, each of the Sellers, the Companies and the CAC
Subsidiaries or otherwise in connection with or for the purpose of
encouraging or facilitating a Takeover Proposal; (iii) except to the extent
necessary to take any actions that Carbon, each of the Sellers, the Companies
and the CAC Subsidiaries or any third party would otherwise be permitted to
take pursuant to this _Section 9.24_ _ _ or except to the extent that the
Carbon Board concludes, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Carbon Board under applicable
Law, release any Person from, waive any provisions of, or fail to enforce any
confidentiality agreement or standstill agreement to which Carbon, any
Seller, any Company or any CAC Subsidiary is a party; (iv) except for a
confidentiality agreement permitted by _Section 9.24(b)_ , enter into any
agreement, agreement in principle or letter of intent with respect to any
Takeover Proposal or approve or resolve to approve any Takeover Proposal or
any agreement, agreement in principle or letter of intent relating to any
Takeover Proposal; or (v) solicit or encourage the Carbon stockholders to
revoke, terminate, cancel, withdraw or otherwise modify the
Carbon Stockholder Consent. Carbon, each of the Sellers, the Companies and
the CAC Subsidiaries, and each of its and their respective officers and
directors shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any and all
existing discussions, negotiations, and communications with any Persons with
respect to any existing or potential Takeover Proposal.

  



  

   

\- 39 -

 



    



  

(b) Notwithstanding _Section 9.24(a)_ or any other provision of this
Agreement, Carbon may take any of the actions described in _Section
9.24(a)(i)_ or _(ii)_ if, but only if, prior to the satisfaction of the
condition set forth in _Section 10.1(d)_ , (i) Carbon has received a bona
fide unsolicited written Takeover Proposal that did not result from a breach
of _Section 9.24(a)_ ; (ii) the Carbon Board reasonably determines in good
faith, after consultation with and having considered the advice of its
outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Takeover
Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior
Proposal; (iii) Carbon has provided Purchaser with written notice of such
determination; and (iv) prior to furnishing or affording access to any non-
public information or data with respect to Carbon, any Seller, any Company or
any CAC Subsidiary in connection with or for the purpose of encouraging or
facilitating a Takeover Proposal, Carbon receives from such Person a
confidentiality agreement with terms no less favorable to Carbon than those
contained in the confidentiality agreement with Purchaser. Carbon shall
promptly provide to Purchaser any non-public information regarding Carbon, any
Seller, any Company or any CAC Subsidiary provided to any other Person in
connection with or for the purpose of encouraging or facilitating a
Takeover Proposal which was not previously provided to Purchaser, such
additional information to be provided no later than the date such information
is provided to such other Person. Nothing in this _Section 9.24(b)_ shall
prohibit Carbon or the Carbon Board, directly or indirectly through any
officer, employee or representative, from (1) informing any Person that
Carbon, any Seller, any Company or any CAC Subsidiary is party to this
Agreement and informing such person of the restrictions that are set forth in
this _Section 9.24_. or (2) disclosing factual information regarding the
business, financial condition or results of operations of Carbon, any Seller,
any Company or any CAC Subsidiary or the fact that a Takeover Proposal has
been made, the identity of the party making such proposal or the material
terms of such proposal in the Information Statement or otherwise; provided
that, in the case of this clause (2), Carbon shall in good faith determine
that such information, facts, identity or terms are required to be disclosed
under applicable Law or that failure to make such disclosure is reasonably
likely to be inconsistent with the Carbon Board's fiduciary duties under
applicable Law.

  



  

(c) Carbon shall promptly (and in any event within one business day) notify
Purchaser in writing if (i) any proposals or offers are received by, any
information is requested from, or any negotiations or discussions are sought
to be initiated or continued with, Carbon, or (ii) Carbon becomes aware that
any proposals or offers are received by, any information is requested from, or
any negotiations or discussions are sought to be initiated or continued with,
any Seller, any Company or any CAC Subsidiary, in each case in
connection with any Takeover Proposal, and such notice shall indicate the
name of the Person initiating such discussions or negotiations or making such
proposal, offer or information request and the material terms and conditions
of any proposals or offers (and, in the case of written materials relating to
such proposal, offer, information request, negotiations or discussion,
providing copies of any written proposals, indications of interest and draft
agreements, except to the extent that (i) discussions of such
materials jeopardizes the attorney-client privilege or (ii) disclosure of
such materials contravenes any Law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or
decree). Carbon agrees that it shall keep Purchaser informed, on a reasonably
current basis, of the status and terms of any such proposal, offer,
information request, negotiations or discussions (including any amendments or
modifications to such proposal, offer or request). Neither the Carbon Board
nor any committee thereof shall, subject to _Section 9.24(d)_ , cause or
encourage the revocation, termination, cancellation, withdrawal, or
modification of the Carbon Stockholder Consent.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement with
respect to a Takeover Proposal, the Carbon Board may only terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 11.1(c)(iii)_ if, after receiving a bona fide

faith, after consultation with and having considered the advice of outside

ARTICLE 14 
 TAX MATTERS

  



  

14.1  _Tax Treatment of Purchase of Membership Interests_. Sellers and
Purchaser each acknowledge and agree that, for federal Income Tax purposes
(and for state Income Tax purposes in states that follow federal Income Tax
purposes in this respect), the purchase of the Membership Interests will be
treated in a manner consistent with the holding in Situation 2 of Revenue
Ruling 99-6, 1994-1 C.B. 432. Specifically, the acquisition of the Membership
Interests will be treated (i) by each Seller as if such Seller had
conveyed the Membership Interests to Purchaser in exchange for the
consideration such Seller receives for the Membership Interests pursuant to
this Agreement and (ii) by Purchaser as if it had acquired from each Seller
such Seller's share of the Acquired Assets deemed distributed to each such
Seller in exchange for the consideration such Seller receives for the
Membership Interests pursuant to this Agreement. The parties will prepare and
file all Tax Returns consistent with the foregoing and will not take any
inconsistent position on any Tax Return, or during the course of any
proceeding with respect to Taxes, unless otherwise required by applicable Law
following a final determination as defined in Section 1313 of the Code.

(a)  _Tax Returns_. Carbon shall prepare or cause to be prepared all Tax
Returns of the Company Entities that are required to be filed prior to or on
the Closing Date and any Tax Returns that are required to be filed as a result
of the sale of the Nytis LLC Membership Interests, the CAC Membership
Interests and the Acquired Assets and the distribution of the Excluded Assets.
If Closing occurs, Purchaser shall file all other Tax Returns required to be
filed by or with respect to the Membership Interests and the Acquired Assets.

  



  

(b)  _Payment._ Sellers shall pay, or cause the Company Entities to pay, all
Taxes owed and payable by the Company Entities, the Acquired Assets at any
time prior to or on the Closing Date. If Closing occurs, Purchaser shall pay
all other Taxes owed with respect to the Companies, the CAC Subsidiaries and
the Acquired Assets.

  



  

(c)  _Straddle Period._ For purposes of this Agreement, liability for Taxes
with respect to each of the Companies, the CAC Subsidiaries, the Nytis LLC
Subsidiaries and the Acquired Assets with respect to any Straddle Period shall
be apportioned as follows: property, ad valorem, excise, severance,
production, sales, use, real property transfer and similar Taxes based upon
operation or ownership of the Acquired Assets (" _Asset Taxes_ ") payable
with respect to any Straddle Period shall be apportioned between the Sellers
and the Purchaser on a ratable daily basis, and Sellers shall pay any such
Taxes for any period prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that
Taxes that are based on quantity of or the value of production of Hydrocarbons
shall be apportioned between the Parties based on the number of units or
value of production actually produced, as applicable, before, on or after the
Effective Date. All other Taxes shall be apportioned based on an interim
closing of the books of the Companies, the CAC Subsidiaries and the Nytis LLC
Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time, provided that exemptions, allowances
for deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (including depreciation
and amortization deductions) shall be allocated between the period ending
prior to Effective Time and the period beginning on and after the Effective
Time in proportion to the number of days in each period. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (i) any West Virginia Asset Taxes due with respect to the Acquired
Assets for which the assessed valuation is based, in whole or in part, on the
value of production in prior years, shall be apportioned between Purchaser
and Sellers based on the period of ownership of the applicable Acquired Assets
during the "assessment year" as defined in West Virginia Code §11-3-1(f)(2),
and (ii) the West Virginia Public Utility property taxes for the
Cranberry Pipeline Corporation shall be apportioned between Purchaser and
Sellers based on the calendar year as defined in West Virginia Code
§11-6-1(e). If Closing occurs, Purchaser, Sellers, the Companies and the CAC
Subsidiaries shall each timely provide the others with all information and
cooperation reasonably requested by the others to prepare any Tax Return
relating to the Companies, the CAC Subsidiaries, the Nytis LLC Subsidiaries,
the Acquired Assets or the Contemplated Transactions.

  



  

(d)  _Election_. Sellers agree to make an election under Treasury Regulation
1.1502-36(d) to forgo a loss on the sale of the stock in Coalfield Pipeline
Company and Cranberry Pipeline Corporation to the extent either Purchaser or
Sellers identifies basis reduction required under section Treasury Regulation
1.1502-36(d) in the assets of Coalfield Pipeline Company and Cranberry
Pipeline Corporation. To the extent such a determination has not been made
prior to the filing of the Sellers' consolidated return reporting gain or
loss from the sale, Sellers agree to make a protective election under Treasury
Regulation 1.1502-36(d)(6) on such return to reduce basis in the stock in
Coalfield Pipeline Company and Cranberry Pipeline Corporation should any such
loss subsequently be determined by the IRS or otherwise.

  



  

   

\- 49 -

 



    



  

(e)  _Section 338(h)(10) Election_. At Purchaser's option by notice delivered
by Purchaser to Sellers within sixty (60) days after the Execution Date ("
_Election Date_ "), Sellers and the applicable Company Entities shall join in
making an election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and any corresponding
election under state, local or non-U.S. tax law) with respect to the purchase
and sale of the stock of Coalfield Pipeline Company and Cranberry Pipeline
Corporation hereunder (collectively, a " _Section 338(h)(10) Election_ ");
provided, however, that Purchaser agrees that in the event it requests
Sellers and the Company Entities make the Section 338(h)(10) Election,
Purchaser will promptly reimburse Sellers for any net increase in the
aggregate Tax owed by or the value of any loss of future tax benefit of the
applicable Company Entities and Sellers that results solely from the making
of the Section 338(h)(10) Election; provided, further, that Sellers shall
only be entitled to reimbursement by Purchaser for the net increase in Tax to
the extent they provide Purchaser on or before the Election Date with the
amount of such increase and such supporting information and calculations as
are reasonably requested by Purchaser. Sellers shall include any income,
gain, loss, deduction or other tax item resulting from the Section 338(h)(10)
Election on their Tax Returns to the extent required by applicable Law. Any
dispute between the Sellers and the Purchaser concerning the value of the net
increase in the aggregate Tax owed by or any loss of future tax benefit of the
applicable Company Entities and Sellers shall be determined by the Accounting
Referee under procedures substantially similar to those provided in _Section
13.1(d)_  through _(g)_.

  



  

14.3  _Amended Tax Returns_. Unless required by applicable Law, no amended
Tax Return with respect to a Pre-Closing Date Tax Period or Straddle Period
shall be filed by or on behalf of the Companies or the CAC Subsidiaries
without the prior written consent of Sellers (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), if such amended Tax Return could reasonably
be expected to increase the amount of Taxes owed by Sellers.

  



  

14.4  _Tax Refunds_. Sellers shall be entitled to any refunds or credits of
Seller Taxes. Purchaser shall be entitled to any other Tax refunds or
credits. Each Party shall forward, and shall cause its Affiliates to forward,
to the Party entitled to receive a refund or credit of Tax pursuant to this
_Section 14.4_ the amount of such refund or credit and any interest thereon
(or in the case of a Straddle Period, the applicable portion of any such
interest) received from the relevant Governmental Authority within 30 days
after such refund is received (or, in the case of a Tax credit, within 30 days
after the filing of a Tax Return claiming or utilizing such Tax credit). To
the extent requested by Sellers, and at expense of the Sellers, Purchaser
shall reasonably cooperate with Sellers in applying for and obtaining any
available Tax refunds or credits with respect to Pre-Closing Date Tax Periods
and Straddle Periods; provided, however, Purchaser will file all Tax Returns
agreed upon by the Parties after the Closing Date required to claim any such
Tax refunds or credits and will, within thirty (30) days of receipt, pay over
any such refunds or credits that are received by Purchaser, less an amount
equal to the costs and expenses incurred by Purchaser to seek such refunds or
credits and file such Tax Returns.

  



  

14.5  _Transfer Taxes_. The Parties agree to use their commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Transfer Taxes
required to be paid in connection with the sale or transfer of the Membership
Interests pursuant to this Agreement. As the Membership Interests are
intangibles, the Parties do not expect that any Transfer Taxes will be
incurred as a result of or with respect to the purchase and sale of the
Membership Interests. In the event that any Transfer Taxes are due, Purchaser
shall bear 50% of any such Transfer Taxes and Sellers shall bear 50% of any
such Transfer Taxes that result from, relate to, or arise in connection with
the sale and transfer of the Membership Interests pursuant to this Agreement
and the other transactions contemplated hereby. Sellers and Purchaser shall
cooperate with one another in the preparation of any necessary Tax Returns and
other related documentation with respect to such Transfer Taxes (including
any exemption certificates and forms as each may request to establish an
exemption from (or otherwise reduce) or make a report with respect to Transfer
Taxes).

  



  

14.6  _Cooperation_. Purchaser and Sellers shall cooperate fully, and shall
cause the Companies, the CAC Subsidiaries and the Nytis LLC Subsidiaries to
cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by Purchaser or
Sellers, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and any audit or
Proceeding with respect to Taxes or unclaimed property relating to the
Acquired Assets. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon
another Party's request), the provision of records and information that are
reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return or audit or Proceeding and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided under this Agreement.
Purchaser and Sellers further agree, upon request, to use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any
Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed on Sellers, Purchaser, the
Companies, the CAC Subsidiaries or the Nytis LLC Subsidiaries (including, but
not limited to, with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby). The
Sellers and the Purchaser agree to retain all books and records with respect
to Tax matters pertinent to the Companies, the CAC Subsidiaries, the Nytis
LLC Subsidiaries and the Acquired Assets relating to any taxable period
beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of
limitations of the respective Tax periods and to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any Governmental Authority.

Claim, at the election of the Indemnifying Party made by written notice to the
Indemnified Party within 30 Business Days after receipt of a Claim Notice
with respect to such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall permit the
Indemnifying Party to assume control of the defense of such Third-Party
Claim, including the determination of all appropriate actions,
the negotiation of settlements on behalf of the Indemnified Party, and the
conduct of any related Proceedings through attorneys of the Indemnifying
Party's choice; _provided, however_ , prior to and during such 30 Business Day
period, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to file any motion, answer
or other pleading that it shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect its
interests or those of the Indemnifying Party; provided, further, however,
where any Third-Party Claim consists of a civil, criminal, or regulatory
proceeding, action, indictment or investigation against the Indemnified Party
by any Governmental Authority or seeks recovery other than monetary damages,
the Indemnified Party, at its option, shall have the right to control the
defense and Proceedings. If an Indemnifying Party elects to assume control of
such defense:

  



  

(i) the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have admitted its obligation to
indemnify and defend the Indemnified Party in respect of such Third-Party
Claim and may not later contest such obligation; _provided, however_ , such
admission shall in no event be deemed to waive any limitations as to the
liability of, or expand any obligations of such Indemnifying Party;

  



  

(ii) the Indemnifying Party shall conduct such defense in a diligent manner
at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, and once an
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense, in whole or in part, it shall have no
right to later seek recoupment of any portion of its defense costs from the
Indemnified Party under any circumstances;

  



  

(iii) the Indemnified Party shall make available to the Indemnifying Party
all non-privileged documents and materials in the possession or control of
the Indemnified Party relating to the Third-Party Claim and provide such other
information and assistance that the Indemnifying Party shall reasonably deem
necessary to the proper defense of the Third-Party Claim;

  



  

(iv) the Indemnifying Party shall keep the Indemnified Party informed of all
material developments and events relating to the defense of the Third-Party
Claim, and provide copies of any materials disclosed to the claimant or
plaintiff in connection with the defense of the Third-Party Claim;

  



  

(v) the Indemnifying Party may not enter into a settlement of any Third-Party
Claim without the written consent of the Indemnified Party unless such
settlement provides the Indemnified Party with a full release from such Third-
Party Claim and requires no more than a monetary payment for which the
Indemnified Party is fully indemnified; and

  



  

(vi) the Indemnified Party shall be entitled, at its own expense, to
participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim.

  



  

   

\- 54 -

 



    



  

(b)  _Defense By Indemnified Party_. If an Indemnified Party asserts it is
entitled to a defense of the Third-Party Claim under  _Section 15.3_ , and
the Indemnifying Party does not timely elect to assume control of the defense,
or elects to assume control of the defense but does not continue to conduct
such defense in a diligent manner, or elects to assume control of the
defense of claims subject to limitations or reservation of rights, or if the
Indemnified Party exercises its right to control the defense pursuant to
_Section 15.5(a)_ , then:

  



  

(i) if it is finally determined in a non-appealable final judgment of a court

Indemnified Party to defend the Third-Party Claim shall be for the account of
the Indemnifying Party;

  



  

(ii) whether or not the Indemnifying Party is obligated to provide such
defense, the Indemnifying Party shall make available to the Indemnified Party
all non-privileged documents and materials in the possession or control of the
Indemnifying Party relating to the Third-Party Claim and provide such other
information and assistance that the Indemnified Party shall reasonably deem
necessary to the proper defense of the Third-Party Claim;

  



  

(iii) the Indemnified Party shall keep the Indemnifying Party informed of all
material developments and events relating to the defense of the Third-Party
Claim, and provide copies of any materials disclosed to the claimant or
plaintiff in connection with the defense of the Third-Party Claim; and

  



  

(iv) the Indemnified Party shall have the right to settle, adjust, or
compromise such Third-Party Claim with the written consent of the

the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate in good
faith to take appropriate action so as not to jeopardize the defense of such
Third-Party Claim or any Party's position with respect to such Third-Party
Claim.

Party, and the conduct of any related Proceedings through attorneys of
Sellers' choice; _provided, however_ , where any Retained Proceeding
consists of a civil, criminal, or regulatory proceeding, action, indictment
or investigation against an Indemnified Purchaser Party by any Governmental
Authority or seeks recovery other than monetary damages, the Indemnified

necessary to the proper defense of such Retained Proceeding;

  



  

(iii) Sellers shall keep the Indemnified Purchaser Party informed of all
material developments and events relating to the defense of such Retained

plaintiff in connection with the defense of such Retained Proceeding;

  



  

(iv) Sellers may not enter into a settlement of any Retained Proceeding
without the written consent of the Indemnified Purchaser Party unless such
settlement provides the Indemnified Purchaser Party with a full release from
such Retained Proceeding and requires no more than a monetary payment for
which the Indemnified Purchaser Party is fully indemnified; and

  



  

   

\- 55 -

 



    



  

(v) the Indemnified Purchaser Party shall be entitled, at its own expense, to
participate in the defense of such Retained Proceeding.

  



  

(b)  _Defense By Indemnified Purchaser Party_. The Indemnified Purchaser
Party may control the defense of any Retained Proceeding if (a) Sellers do
not continue to conduct such defense in a diligent manner, or (b) the
Indemnified Purchaser Party exercises its right to control the defense
pursuant to _Section 15.6(a)_ , in each case, subject to the following:

  



  

(i) all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Indemnified Purchaser
Party to defend the Retained Proceeding shall be for the account of Sellers;

  



  

(ii) whether or not Sellers are obligated to provide such defense, Sellers

for all Liabilities arising or resulting from the Retained Proceedings.

  



  

(c)  _Cooperation_. If a Retained Proceeding requires immediate action, both
the Indemnified Purchaser Party and the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate in
good faith to take appropriate action so as not to jeopardize the defense of
such Retained Proceeding or any Party's position with respect to such
Retained Proceeding.

  



  

15.7  _Limitations on Losses_.

  



  

(a)  _Cap on Sellers ' Liability_. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of
this Agreement, the aggregate Liability of Sellers under _Section 15.3(a)(i)_
(excluding Claims arising from the breach of Fundamental Representations and
the representations and warranties in Section _7.13_ (Taxes)) shall in the
aggregate be limited to twenty percent (20%) of the unadjusted Base Purchase
Price, being Twenty-two Million Dollars ($22,000,000.00) (the " _Cap_ "),
which aggregate amount shall be reduced to the extent coverage is available
under the RandW Insurance Policy. Any Claims for indemnification under 
_Section 15.3(a)(i)_ for breaches of Fundamental Representations or the
representations and warranties in Section _7.13 _ (Taxes) shall not be
subject to the Cap.

  



  

(b)  _Sellers ' Indemnity Threshold and Deductible_. Sellers shall have no
Liability for indemnification under _Section 15.3(a)(i)_ (excluding Claims
arising from the breach of Fundamental Representations and the representations
and warranties in Section _7.13_ (Taxes)) for any individual Loss or series
of related Losses arising from a common set of facts that do not exceed
$50,000 (the " _Indemnity Threshold_ " (and such Losses are to be disregarded
in determining whether the Indemnity Deductible has been exceeded). Sellers
shall have no Liability for indemnification under _Section 15.3(a)(i) _
(excluding Claims arising from the breach of Fundamental Representations and
the representations and warranties in Section  _7.13_ (Taxes)) until and
unless the aggregate amount of the Liability for all Claims, Proceedings and
Losses for which such Claim Notices are delivered by Purchaser and that
exceed the Indemnity Threshold exceeds two and one-half percent (2.5%) of
the Base Purchase Price, being Two Million Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand
Dollars ($2,750,000.00) (the " _Indemnity Deductible_ "), and then only to
the extent that such Claims, Proceedings and Losses exceed the Indemnity
Deductible. Any Claims for indemnification under _Section 15.3(a)(i)_ for
breaches of Fundamental Representations or the representations and warranties
in Section _7.13 _ (Taxes) shall not be subject to the Indemnity Threshold or
the Indemnity Deductible. The Parties shall treat, for Tax purposes, any
amounts paid under this _Article 15_ as an adjustment to the Base Purchase
Price.

  



  

   

\- 56 -

 



    



  

(c)  _Insurance Proceeds_. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this
Agreement, the amount of any Claims and Losses for which Purchaser or any
Indemnified Purchaser Party are entitled to indemnity under this _Article 15_
shall be reduced by the amount of insurance, other third party proceeds, or
reimbursements actually received by Purchaser or the Indemnified Purchaser
Party under the relevant insurance arrangements with respect to such Losses
and Claims (net of the amount of costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees) of recovery or collection thereof and any applicable
deductibles, retentions or similar costs or payments or increased premiums)
("Net Recoveries") and Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain any and all available recoveries from its third-party insurers to
cover any claim for which Purchaser or any Indemnified Purchaser Party is
entitled to indemnity from Sellers hereunder. For the avoidance of doubt, any
claim for indemnification under this _Article 15_ may be made prior to or
concurrently with any efforts to obtain available recoveries from any third-
party insurer, and nothing in this Section 15.7(c) shall delay the time for
making any indemnification payment under this Agreement.

  



  

(d)  _Mitigation_. Each Indemnified Party shall make commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate or minimize all Losses upon and after becoming aware of
any event or condition which would reasonably be expected to give rise to any
Losses and Claims that are indemnifiable hereunder and if an Indemnified
Party fails to so mitigate any indemnifiable Losses and Claims under the
preceding sentence, the Party that would otherwise have an indemnity
obligation hereunder with respect to such Losses and Claims shall have no
liability for any portion of such Losses and Claims that reasonably could have
been avoided or mitigated had the Indemnified Party made such efforts.

  



  

(e)  _No Consequential, Punitive or Exemplary Damages_. NO PARTY OR
INDEMNIFYING PARTY SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR INDEMNIFICATION, CLAIMS,
LOSSES, OR OTHERWISE UNDER ANY PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT FOR, AND "LOSSES"
AND "CLAIMS" SHALL NOT INCLUDE, (i) ANY COST, EXPENSE, DAMAGE, LOSS, OR
LIABILITY IN THE NATURE OF INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE
OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS, LOST BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, OR
DIMINUTION IN VALUE (EVEN IF THE INDEMNIFYING OR BREACHING PARTY IS AWARE OF
THE EXISTENCE OF ANY OF THE FOREGOING), EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY OF THE
FOREGOING RELATE TO THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS suffered by any Third Party for which
responsibility is allocated between the Parties, WHICH SHALL BE INCLUDED IN
LOSSES AND CLAIMS or (ii) any diminution of value or increase in Liability,
Loss, Claims, cost, expense, award or judgment to the extent such increase is
caused by the actions or omissions of any Person entitled to
indemnification hereunder after the Closing Date.

  



  

15.8  _Order of Recovery; R andW Insurance Policy; Indemnity Escrow Fund_.

  



  

(a)  _Order of Recovery_. Except in the case of fraud, with respect to Losses
owed by the Sellers in respect of Claims under _Section 15.3(a)(i)_ , the
order of recovery shall be as follows:

  



  

(i)  _first_ , the Indemnified Purchaser Parties will first use commercially
reasonable efforts to recover any amounts owed by Sellers from the RandW
Insurance Policy;

  



  

(ii)  _second_ , to the extent such Losses (A) exceed the Indemnity Threshold
and the Indemnity Deductible (if applicable), and (B) are not covered by the
RandW Insurance Policy for any reason (including the coverage limit being
exceeded and coverage being denied), from the Indemnity Escrow Fund; and

  



  

   

\- 57 -

 



    



  

(iii)  _third_ , to the extent such Losses (A) exceed the Indemnity Threshold
and the Indemnity Deductible (if applicable), (B) are not covered by the RandW
Insurance Policy for any reason (including the coverage limit being exceeded
and coverage being denied), and (C) exceed the balance of the Indemnity
Escrow Fund, directly from Sellers.

  



  

(b)  _R andW Insurance Policy_. For the purposes of _Section 15.8(a)(i)_ ,
"commercially reasonable efforts" shall mean using commercially reasonable
efforts to (a) file a claim for Losses pursuant to the RandW Insurance Policy,
(b) furnish proof of loss, supporting materials and such other information,
if any, as reasonably requested by the RandW Insurer and (c) comply with the
provisions of the RandW Insurance Policy; provided, however, nothing shall
require Indemnified Purchaser Parties to seek to recover any Loss under the
RandW Insurance Policy if such Loss is excluded from coverage under the
RandW Insurance Policy. Purchaser and Sellers acknowledge that Purchaser is
obtaining the RandW Insurance Policy for purposes of certain coverage of Losses
related to this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement shall limit the right of
any Indemnified Purchaser Party to make claims against the RandW Insurance
Policy. For purposes of clarity, as between any Indemnified Purchaser Party,
on the one hand, and the RandW Insurer, on the other hand, none of the terms,
limitations, conditions and restrictions (including time for asserting claims
or the procedures required by _Article 15_ hereof) on indemnification set
forth in this _Article 15 _ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall affect the
rights of the Indemnified Purchaser Parties under the RandW Insurance
Policy, which rights shall be governed solely thereby.

  



  

(c)  _Indemnity Escrow Fund_.

  



  

(i) The Indemnity Escrow Fund shall be available to satisfy any Claims of the
Indemnified Purchaser Parties arising or resulting from (i) any breach of any
representation or warranty to the extent such Losses (A) are in excess of the
Indemnity Threshold and the Indemnity Deductible, if applicable, and (B) are
not otherwise covered by the RandW Insurance Policy, (ii) any breach of
any covenant or agreement in this Agreement or any other Transaction
Document, and (iii) any Retained Liability. Except as set forth in _Section
15.8(c)(ii)_ , the balance of the Indemnity Escrow Fund shall be released to
Sellers on the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing Date; provided,
however, if there are any pending Claims as of such release date that may be
satisfied from the Indemnity Escrow Fund, the amount of any such Claims shall
be retained in the Indemnity Escrow Fund until such time as such Claims are
resolved.

  



  

(ii) Until such time as Sellers have delivered evidence satisfactory to
Purchaser of the full satisfaction of, and complete release with respect to,
each Retained Liability described on _Schedule 15.8(c)(ii)_ (each a "
_Specified Retained Liability_ " and, collectively, the " _Specified Retained
Liabilities_ "), the amount of the Indemnity Escrow Fund allocated to such
Specified Retained Liability (as set forth on _Schedule 15.8(c)(ii)_ ) shall
continue to be held in the Indemnity Escrow Fund. Any portion of the
Indemnity Escrow Fund allocated to the Specified Retained Liabilities that has
not been released to Sellers on the three (3) year anniversary of the Closing
Date shall be disbursed to and retained by Purchaser. For the avoidance of
doubt, Purchaser shall be entitled to recover from the Indemnity Escrow Fund
any Losses arising or resulting from any Specified Retained Liability, and
the amount of the Indemnity Escrow Fund allocated to a Specified Retained
Liability shall be reduced by the amount of Losses incurred by the
Indemnified Purchaser Parties with respect to such Specified Retained
Liability before any amount is disbursed to Sellers pursuant to this Section
_15.8(c)(ii)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties agree that neither
the Indemnity Escrow Fund nor any portion thereof allocated to the Specified
Retained Liabilities shall serve as a cap on Sellers' exposure with respect
to such Specified Retained Liabilities.

  



  

15.9  _Determination of Losses_. For purposes of determining whether there
has been any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty, and
for purposes of determining the amount of Losses resulting therefrom, all
qualifications or exceptions in any representation or warranty set forth in
this Agreement or any other Transaction Document using the terms
"material," "materiality," "in all material respects," "Material Adverse
Effect" or any similar term or phrase shall be disregarded. The right to
indemnification, payment of any Losses or other remedy based on the
representations, warranties, covenants and obligations contained herein or
breach thereof will not be affected by any investigation conducted
with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired), at
any time on or prior to the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy or
inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such representation, warranty, covenant
or obligation.

  



  

   

\- 58 -

 



    



  

15.10  _Exclusive Remedy_. If the Closing occurs, subject to the limitations
set forth in this _Article 15_ , the right of Purchaser, the Companies and
the CAC Subsidiaries to indemnification under _Section 15.3 (Indemnification
and Defense)_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of Purchaser, the
Companies and the CAC Subsidiaries against any Indemnified Seller Parties for:
(i) any breach by Sellers of any of their respective representations,
warranties, covenants, and agreements in this Agreement; and (ii) all Claims,
Proceedings and Losses of Purchaser, the Companies and CAC Subsidiaries
arising out of, relating to, or in connection with this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (a) in the case of
fraud by or on behalf of any Seller or any Company Entity committed at or
prior to the Closing, the Indemnified Purchaser Parties shall have all
remedies available under this Agreement or otherwise available at law or in
equity without giving effect to any of the limitations or waivers
contained herein, and (b) nothing herein shall limit any Party's rights
concerning Title Disputed Matters pursuant to _Section 5.6_ , Environmental
Disputed Matters pursuant to _Section 6.3_ , or Final Settlement dipsutes
pursuant to _Section 13.1_ , and (c) nothing herein shall limit Purchaser's
rights under Sellers' Special Warranty of Title and Purchaser's rights under
any Title Indemnity Agreement .

  



  

15.11  _Subrogation_. To the extent of the indemnification obligations in
this Agreement, Purchaser and Sellers hereby waive for themselves and their
respective successors and assigns, including any insurers, any rights to
subrogation for Losses for which such Party is liable or against which such
Party indemnifies any other Person under this Agreement, excluding any such
rights to subrogation in respect of fraud.

unenforceability shall not affect the validity, legality, or enforceability
of the remaining provisions of this Agreement or the validity, legality, or
enforceability of the offending provision as to any other Person or
circumstance or in any other jurisdiction. The invalidity or unenforceability
