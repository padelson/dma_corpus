In consideration of the premises and mutual covenants in this Agreement and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are acknowledged, each Party agrees as follows:

Article 1

 

PURCHASE AND SALE OF EQUITY INTERESTS

1.1 Generally. On and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
and the Drag Documents, at Closing, Buyer will purchase from Sellers, and
Sellers will sell to Buyer, the Shares with full title guarantee free from
all Encumbrances and together with all rights that attach (or may in the
future attach) to them including, in particular, the right to receive all
dividends and distributions declared, made or paid thereon after the
effective time of the Closing.

Article 2

PURCHASE PRICE AND ADJUSTMENT

2.1 Purchase Price. Upon and subject to the terms and conditions herein,
Buyer will pay to Sellers the amount of US$115,000,000 (the " _Initial
Purchase Price_"), as such amount is adjusted pursuant to the terms herein
(such amount, as adjusted pursuant to any term herein, is referred to herein
as the " _Purchase Price_").

2.2 Calculation of Estimated Purchase Price for Closing; Purchase Price
Certificate.

(a) On or before the third Business Day before the Closing Date, the Company
will deliver to Buyer a consolidated unaudited balance sheet for the Companies
dated as of three Business Days before the Closing Date and prepared in an a
manner consistent in all respects with the representation in Section 4.7(b)
(the " _Pre-Closing Balance Sheet_ ") and a statement (the " _Estimated
Purchase Price Certificate_ ") containing the Companys estimate of (a)
Working Capital and (b) the Purchase Price (which, for Closing, is (1) the
Initial Purchase Price _minus_ (2) Transaction Expenses and _plus_ or _minus_
(3) the amount by which such estimated Working Capital contained in such
statement exceeds Target Working Capital (up to a maximum increase of
US$500,000 for any such Working Capital excess) or the amount by which such
estimated Working Capital contained in such statement is less than Target
Working Capital, as applicable). The amount of such estimated Purchase Price
from the Company is the " _Estimated Purchase Price_ ," except if Buyer
reasonably objects to any such estimate from the Company, in which case the
Company and Buyer will mutually determine the Estimated Purchase Price before
Closing acting in good faith.

(b) On or before the third Business Day before the Closing Date, the Company
will deliver to Buyer an updated _Schedule 2.2(b)_ (the " _Payment Schedule_
") that sets forth for each Seller as of the Closing Date (i) the dollar
amount that each such Seller is entitled to receive as his, her or its Pro
Rata Share of the Estimated Purchase Price to be paid by Buyer at Closing (net
(A) those portions of the Estimated Purchase Price paid pursuant to Sections
2.3(a) and 2.3(b) hereof and (B) of any applicable exercise price or
withholding (if, and to the extent, such withholding is required by Applicable
Law) in respect of any Company Options or

 





     |  | 
---|---|--- 
  Equity Purchase Agreement |  | Page 2  Company Deferred Shares held by such Seller); (ii) the dollar amount that
each such Seller is contributing as his, her or its Pro Rata Share of the
Escrow Amount to be contributed on behalf of each Seller at Closing pursuant
to Section 2.3(b); (iii) the percentage of any additional payments of Purchase
Price or indemnification to which such Seller may be entitled following the
Closing under Sections 2.4 or 9.2 or otherwise; and (iv) to the extent
provided by such Seller, payment instructions for each such Seller. Upon the
Closing, the Payment Schedule shall be incorporated into, and made a part of,
the Schedules as _Schedule 4.2(c)_ thereof without any further action by any
Party.

2.3 Payment of Estimated Purchase Price at Closing and Related Payments. Upon
and subject to the terms and conditions herein, at Closing and on the Closing
Date, Buyer will pay the Estimated Purchase Price as follows:

(a) Buyer will deposit into escrow the amount of US$17,250,000 (the " _Escrow
Amount_") to be held by Wells Fargo Bank, National Association or with such
other bank or trust company that is mutually acceptable to Buyer and the
Representative (the " _Escrow Agent_ ") pursuant to the terms hereof and to
the terms of an escrow agreement substantially in the form attached as
_Exhibit B_ (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "). The portion of the Escrow Amount
contributed on behalf of each Seller shall be equal to such Sellers Pro Rata
Share of the aggregate Escrow Amount. The Escrow Amount shall be held as a
trust fund and shall not be subject to any Lien, attachment, trustee process
or any other judicial process of any creditor of any Party, and shall be held
and disbursed solely for the purposes and in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement. 

(b) Buyer will pay the Transaction Expenses to the Persons entitled thereto in
accordance with the instructions to be delivered by the Company to Buyer
prior to the Closing Date.

(c) Buyer will pay to the Executing Shareholders the amounts set forth
therefor on the Payment Schedule by wire transfer of immediately available
funds in accordance with the instructions set forth on the Payment Schedule.

(d) Buyer will pay to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association or such other
bank or trust company that is mutually acceptable to Buyer and the
Representative (the " _Disbursing Agent_ "), pursuant to the terms hereof and
to the terms of a disbursing agent agreement substantially in the form
attached as _Exhibit C_ (the " _Disbursing Agent Agreement_ "), the remaining
balance of the Estimated Purchase Price (after making the payments in the
preceding clauses of this Section), by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the Disbursing Agent for further payment to the Sellers other than
the Executing Shareholders and those Warrant Holders, if any, that are
cashing out their Company Warrants pursuant to Section 8.8, in all cases in
accordance with the amounts and instructions set forth on the Payment
Schedule.

 

2.4 Purchase Price Adjustment.

(a) Buyers Preparation of the Statement. Within 30 days after the Closing
Date, Buyer will prepare and deliver to the Representative a consolidated
unaudited 

 





     |  | 
---|---|--- 
  Equity Purchase Agreement |  | Page 3  balance sheet for the Companies dated as of the Closing Date and prepared in
an a manner consistent in all respects with the representation in Section
4.7(b) (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ ") and a statement (the " _Purchase
Price Certificate_ ") setting forth, in reasonable detail, Buyers
determination of Purchase Price, including all components in the definition
thereof; _provided_  that if Buyer does not deliver to the Representative the
Closing Balance Sheet and Purchase Price Certificate within 30 days after the
Closing Date, then the Pre-Closing Balance Sheet and Estimated Purchase Price
Certificate shall become final and binding upon Buyer to the extent that
Buyer shall be prohibited from making any claim thereafter that the Closing
Balance Sheet is below the Target Working Capital; _provided further_ that if
Buyer does not deliver to the Representative the Closing Balance Sheet and
Purchase Price Certificate within 30 days after the Closing Date, then the
Representative shall be provided with the Closing Balance and Purchase Price
Certificate as soon as reasonably practicable in order to determine
any excess of Working Capital over the Target Working Capital, which such
excess, if any, shall be paid in accordance with Section 2.4(f)(1). Buyer will
give the Representative and its representatives access promptly and at all
reasonable times during normal business hours to the personnel, properties,
books and records of the Companies for purposes of reviewing the Purchase
Price Certificate and the other matters in this Section 2.4. Such 30-day
period will be extended to the extent of any delay by the Company in
providing such access. The final determination of Working Capital pursuant to
this Section 2.4 is " _Final Working Capital_."

 

(b) Representatives Response to the Purchase Price Certificate. Subject to
Section 2.4(a), the Working Capital in the Purchase Price Certificate will
become final and binding upon the Parties (and become the Final Working
Capital) 30 days after Buyer gives the Purchase Price Certificate to the
Representative, unless the Representative gives written notice, in reasonable
detail, of its disagreement (a " _Notice of Disagreement_") to Buyer before
the end of such 30-day period. Such 30-day period will be extended, to the
extent of any unreasonable delay by Buyer or the Companies in providing
reasonable access during normal business hours, to the personnel, properties,
books and records of the Companies for purposes of reviewing the Purchase
Price Certificate and the other matters in this Section 2.4. If the
Representative gives a Notice of Disagreement before the end of such 30-day
period stated above (as such period may be extended in accordance with the
above), then Final Working Capital (as finally determined in accordance with
clause (A) or (B) below) will become final and binding on the Parties upon
the earlier of (A) the date the Parties resolve in writing any differences
they have with respect to all items specified in such Notice of Disagreement
or (B) the date any disputed items are finally resolved in writing by the
Expert pursuant to Section 2.4(c).

(c) Resolving Matters in Notice of Disagreement. During the 30-day period
after a Notice of Disagreement is given, the Representative and Buyer will
attempt to resolve in writing any differences that they have regarding any
item in such Notice of Disagreement. If, at the end of such 30-day period,
Representative and Buyer have not reached agreement on all such items, then
either Party may require that the items that remain in dispute be promptly
submitted to an independent expert (the " _Expert_ ") for review and
resolution. The Expert will be the London office of BDO LLP. If the Expert is
not willing to serve in this capacity, then the Expert will be selected by lot
from a list of four potential Experts remaining after Representative
nominates three, Buyer nominates three, and the Representative and Buyer each
eliminate one potential Expert from the others nominations. The Expert will
determine procedures for such review and consideration, subject to the terms
hereof. The Expert will only consider the items

 





     |  | 
---|---|--- 
  Equity Purchase Agreement |  | Page 4  that remain in dispute. The Expert will render a decision resolving such
items in dispute within 30 days after completion of submissions to the Expert.
The Expert will determine Final Working Capital solely based on submissions
made by the Representative and Buyer consistent with the terms hereof (and not
by independent review). The Expert will not assign a value to any item that is
greater than the greater value for such item claimed by either Party or less
than the lesser value for such item claimed by either Party.

(d) Allocation of Fees and Expenses. The Non-Prevailing Party in such expert
determination will pay its own and its Affiliates fees and expenses incurred
with respect to such expert determination and also will pay a fraction of (1)
the fees and expenses of the Expert _plus_ (2) the reasonable out-of-pocket
fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) of the Prevailing
Party and its Affiliates incurred with respect to such expert determination.
Such fraction will be: (A) an amount equal to the difference between the Non-
Prevailing Partys determination of the items in dispute (in the aggregate and
as submitted to the Expert) and the Experts determination of such items 
_divided_ _by_ (B) an amount equal to the difference between the Parties
respective determinations of such items (in the aggregate and as submitted to
the Expert). The Prevailing Party will pay the remainder of the fees
and expenses of the Expert and the remainder of the Prevailing Partys and
its Affiliates fees and expenses. A Party is the " _Prevailing Party_" if
the Experts determination of such items is closer to such Partys
determination of such items than it is to the other Partys determination of
such items (in each case in the aggregate and as submitted to the Expert). A
Party is the " _Non-Prevailing Party_" if the other Party is the Prevailing
Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to and in accordance with the
provisions of Section 8.10, any such fees and expenses attributable to the
Representative shall be the responsibility of the Sellers. 

(e) Adjustment to Purchase Price Based on Final Net Working Capital. The
Purchase Price will be, and automatically will be adjusted to be, (1) the
Initial Purchase Price _minus_ (2) Transaction Expenses and _plus_ or _minus_
(3) the amount by which such Final Working Capital exceeds Target Working
Capital (up to a maximum of US$500,000) or the amount by which Final Working
Capital is less than Target Working Capital, as applicable.

(f) Reconciliation Payment. Within five Business Days after Final Working
Capital becomes final and binding on the Parties, the following will occur
(with the payments in this Section below being made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds):

(1) if the Estimated Purchase Price (as paid at Closing) is less than the
Purchase Price (as adjusted, if at all, under _Section 2.4(e)_), then Buyer
will pay to the Disbursing Agent (for further payment to the Sellers in
accordance with the allocations and instructions set forth on the Payment
Schedule) the amount of such difference, up to a maximum increase of
US$500,000 for any such Working Capital excess, without interest; or

(2) if the Estimated Purchase Price (as paid at Closing) is more than the
Purchase Price (as adjusted, if at all, under _Section 2.4(e)_), the
Representative and Buyer shall provide joint written notice to the Escrow
Agent, authorizing payment to Buyer of an amount from the Escrow Amount equal
to the excess of the Estimated Purchase Price over the Purchase Price from the
Escrow Amount, without interest.

  Equity Purchase Agreement |  | Page 5 (g) Limitation on Indemnification. No matter taken into account in
an adjustment to Purchase Price pursuant to this Section 2.4 shall be deemed

Article 8

COVENANTS

 

8.1 Further Assurances. In case at any time after the Closing any further
actions are necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement, each of the Parties will take such further actions (including the
execution and delivery of such further instruments and documents) as the other
Party may reasonably request, all at the sole cost and expense of
the requesting Party (unless the requesting Party is entitled to
indemnification therefor under Article 9). The Executing Shareholders
acknowledge and agree that from and after the Closing, Buyer will be entitled
to possession of all documents, books, records (including Tax records),
agreements and financial data of any sort relating to the Companies;
_provided_ , however, that Buyer will provide reasonable access thereto
(during normal business hours) and copies thereof upon the reasonable request
of the Representative or any Executing Shareholder.

 





     |  | 
---|---|--- 
  Equity Purchase Agreement |  | Page 45 8.2 Confidentiality. For a period of two (2) years from the Closing Date,
each Executing Shareholder severally and not jointly agrees that such
Executing Shareholder will treat and hold as such all of the Confidential
Information in its possession and deliver promptly to Buyer or destroy, at the
request and option of Buyer, all tangible embodiments (and all copies) of the
Confidential Information that are in its possession, except for an
electronically archived copy. In the event that any Executing Shareholder is
requested or required pursuant to written or oral question or request for
information or documents in any legal proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena,
civil investigative demand, or similar process to disclose any Confidential
Information, such Executing Shareholder will notify Buyer promptly of
the request or requirement so that Buyer may seek an appropriate protective
order or waive compliance with the provisions of this Section 8.2. If, in the
absence of a protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, such
Executing Shareholder is, on the advice of counsel, compelled to disclose any
Confidential Information to any tribunal or else stand liable for contempt,
such Executing Shareholder may disclose the Confidential Information to the
tribunal; _provided_ , however, that such Executing Shareholder will use its
or his Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain, at the request of Buyer and
at Buyers expense, an order or other assurance that confidential treatment
will be accorded to such portion of the Confidential Information required to
be disclosed as Buyer will designate. The foregoing provisions will not apply
to any information that (i) is or becomes publicly available prior to the time
of disclosure by such Executing Shareholder, unless such information is so
available due to the actions of such Executing Shareholder in violation of the
provisions hereof; (ii) is or becomes available to any Executing Shareholder
on a non-confidential basis from a source that, to the knowledge of such
Executing Shareholder, is not subject to a confidentiality obligation to the
Company; (iii) is or was in the possession of the Executing Shareholder prior
to disclosure by the Company; or (iv) is or was independently developed by
such Executing Shareholder without use of the Confidential Information.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Buyer
understands that some or all of the Executing Shareholders may currently or in
the future be developing information internally or receiving information from
other sources that may be similar to that contained in the Confidential
Information. In addition, Buyer expressly acknowledges, confirms and agrees
that some or all of the Executing Shareholders already possess significant
industry and technical knowledge related to the technology developed and under
development by the Companies as well as the business conducted and proposed to
be conducted by the Companies. Only if and to the extent expressly provided
in a separate restricted covenant agreement expressly entered into between an
Executing Shareholder and Buyer as a condition to the Closing of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, nothing in this Section 8.2
shall be construed as a representation, inference, covenant, restriction or
agreement that any Executing Shareholder may or will not directly or
indirectly engage in business, technology development, or other activity which
may be directly or indirectly competitive with the technology developed or
under development, or the business conducted or proposed to be conducted, by
Buyer and/or the Companies before or after the Closing.

 

8.3 Tax Matters. The following provisions will govern the allocation of
responsibility as between Buyer and the Executing Shareholders for certain
Tax matters:

(a) The Tax Affiliates shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause
to be filed all Returns for the Tax Affiliates for all periods ending on or
prior to the Closing Date and which are due on or before the Closing Date or
for which the date of measurement for such

 





     |  | 
---|---|--- 
  Equity Purchase Agreement |  | Page 46  Tax occurs prior to the Closing Date and which are filed after the Closing
Date, and the Tax Affiliates shall pay all Taxes with respect to such periods.
All such Returns shall be prepared in accordance with past practices and
prior Tax positions of the Tax Affiliates. The Tax Affiliates shall permit
Buyer to review and comment on each such Return prior to filing. After the
Closing Date, the Tax Affiliates shall permit the Representative to review
and comment on each such Return, which shall not be filed without prior
written approval of the Representative, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. The Representative and Buyer
shall provide joint written notice to the Escrow Agent, authorizing payment
to Buyer of an amount from the Escrow Amount equal to any Taxes of the Tax
Affiliates with respect to such periods at least fifteen (15) days prior to
any payment by Buyer or the Tax Affiliates after the Closing of such Taxes,
to the extent such Taxes are not treated as a liability or otherwise reflected
on the Closing Balance Sheet.

(b) The Tax Affiliates shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause
to be filed any Returns of the Tax Affiliates for Tax periods which begin
before the Closing Date and end after the Closing Date (" _Straddle Tax
Returns_ "), and the Tax Affiliates shall pay all Taxes with respect to such
periods. Any portion of any Tax which must be paid in connection with the
filing of a Straddle Tax Return, to the extent attributable to any period or
portion of a period ending on or before the Closing Date, shall be referred to
herein as " _Pre-Closing Taxes_." To the extent such Pre-Closing Taxes exceed
the amount of the Liability for Taxes on the Closing Balance Sheet (after
first utilizing accumulated Tax losses to the extent available) the
Representative and Buyer shall provide joint written notice to the Escrow
Agent, authorizing payment to Buyer of an amount from the Escrow Amount equal
to the Pre-Closing Taxes due with any Straddle Tax Returns (to the extent such
Taxes are not treated as a liability or otherwise reflected on the Closing
Balance Sheet and after first utilizing accumulated Tax losses to the extent
available) at least fifteen (15) days before the Tax Affiliate is required to
pay the related Tax liability; it being understood that the Tax Affiliates
will accrue on the Most Recent Balance Sheet all Pre-Closing Taxes. Where the
Pre-Closing Taxes involve a period which begins before and ends after the
Closing Date, such Pre-Closing Taxes shall be calculated as though the taxable
year of the Tax Affiliate terminated as of the close of business on the
Closing Date; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in the case of a tax not based
on income, receipts, proceeds, profits or similar items, Pre-Closing Taxes
shall be equal to the amount of tax for the taxable period multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of days from the
beginning of the taxable period through the Closing Date and the denominator
of which shall be the number of days in the taxable period. All Straddle Tax
Returns shall be prepared, and all determinations necessary to give effect to
the foregoing allocations shall be made, in a manner consistent with prior
practice of the Tax Affiliates. The Tax Affiliates shall permit the
Representative to review and comment on each Straddle Tax Return, which shall
not be filed without prior written approval of the Representative, which
approval shall not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

(c) The Tax Affiliates, Executing Shareholders and Buyer shall cooperate
fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in
connection with the preparation and filing of Returns pursuant to this
Section 8.3(c) and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to
Taxes. Such cooperation shall include signing any Returns, amended Returns
(subject to Section 8.3(d) below), claims or other documents necessary to
settle any Tax controversy, the retention and (upon the other partys request)
the provision of records and information which are reasonably relevant to any
such Return, audit, litigation or other proceeding, and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information
and explanation of any material provided hereunder.

Article 4, respectively, by updating the applicable Schedule(s) in a manner
consistent with Section 10.14, promptly upon discovery thereof by the Company
(each such disclosure, an " _Update_ "). In the event that any such
variances relate to matters occurring after the date of this Agreement, and
Buyer has not exercised its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 6.4(c) as a result of Section 7.1(a) or has waived such right, such
disclosures shall be deemed to be exceptions to the applicable
representations and warranties and shall amend and supplement the relevant

written notice to the Company, no later than five Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company will provide Buyer with evidence that such Plan(s)
have been terminated (effective as of no later than the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date) pursuant to resolutions of the board of directors
(or such other relevant bodies) of any of the Companies or the ERISA
Affiliates, as the case may be. The form and substance of such resolutions

8.10 Appointment of Representative. The Sellers approve the designation of and
designate the Representative as the representative of the Sellers and as the

Matters) and the taking by the Representative of any and all actions and the
making of any decisions required or permitted to be taken by the
Representative under this Agreement, including the exercise of the power to:
(a) authorize the release or delivery to Buyer of the Escrow Amount in
satisfaction of claims by Buyer or any other Buyer Indemnitees pursuant to
Article 9; (b) agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of,
demand arbitration of, and comply with orders of courts and awards of
arbitrators with respect to, such claims; (c) arbitrate, resolve, settle or
compromise any claim for recovery of Losses from the Escrow Amount made
pursuant to Article 9; (d) execute the Escrow Agreement on behalf of each
Seller; (e) take all other actions specifically required or permitted to be
taken by the Representative under this Agreement; (f) authorize certain
actions with respect to Taxes set forth in Section 8.3(d); and (g) take all
actions necessary in the judgment of the Representative for the

     |  | 
---|---|--- 
  Equity Purchase Agreement |  | Page 50  in interest of the Executing Shareholders shall be further empowered to
determine the manner in which the Representative shall be appointed and
removed. The Representative will have authority and power to act on behalf of
each Seller with respect to the disposition, settlement or other handling of
all claims for recovery of Losses from the Escrow Amount under Article 9. The
Sellers will be bound by all actions taken and documents executed by the
Representative in connection with claims for recovery of Losses from the
Escrow Amount under Article 9, and Buyer will be entitled to rely on any
action or decision of the Representative. In performing the functions
specified in this Agreement, the Representative will not be liable to any
Seller in the absence of fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct, on the
part of the Representative. The Sellers will severally (based on each Sellers
respective Pro Rata Share) and not jointly indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Representative from and against any and all loss, liability,
damage, claim, penalty, fine, forfeiture, action, or expense (including the
fees and expenses of counsel and experts and their staffs and all expense of
document location, duplication and shipment) (collectively, "Representative
Losses") arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration
of its duties hereunder, in each case as such Loss is suffered or incurred;
_provided_ , that in the event that any such Loss is primarily caused by the
fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct, the Representative shall not be
entitled to indemnification hereunder in respect of such Loss. Any such
Losses shall be recovered by Representative from (i) first, the funds in the
Representative Reserve and (ii) second, upon exhaustion of the Representative
Reserve, the amounts in the Escrow Fund at such time as remaining amounts
would otherwise be distributable to the Sellers; _provided_ , that while this
Section 8.12 allows the Representative to be paid from the Representative
Reserve and the Escrow Amount, this does not relieve the Sellers from their
obligation to promptly pay such Representative Losses as such Representative
Losses are suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent the Representative from
seeking any remedies available to it at law or otherwise, subject to the
provisions and limitations set forth above. An amount equal to US$175,000
(the " _Representative Reserve_ ") shall be paid to the Representative from
the Estimated Purchase Price on the Closing Date to cover estimated out-of-
pocket costs by the Representative in connection with actions taken by the
Representative pursuant to the terms of this Section 8.12 and Section 2.3 of
this Agreement (including the hiring of legal counsel and the incurring of
reasonable legal fees and costs). The Representative will deposit and
maintain the Representative Reserve in accounts that are (a) at a national
commercial bank, (b) fully insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation, (c) can be sold, redeemed or otherwise liquidated in ten (10)
days or less without forfeiture or discount and (d) separate from its
corporate funds and the Representative will not use such funds for its
operating expenses or other corporate purposes and will not voluntarily make
the Representative Reserve available to its creditors in the event of
bankruptcy. The Sellers will not receive any interest or earnings on the
Representative Reserve and irrevocably transfer and assign to the
Representative any ownership right that they may otherwise have had in any
such interest or earnings. The Representative will not be liable for any loss
of principal of the Representative Reserve other than as a result of its
fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct. In the event that any portion
of the Representative Reserve remains outstanding after the Representatives
duties under this Agreement are complete, the Representative shall deliver
such portion to the Disbursing Agent for further distribution to the Sellers
in accordance with the Payment Schedule. For tax purposes, the Representative
Reserve will be treated as contingent Purchase Price paid by Buyer and
received by Sellers as installment payments of Purchase Price at the times
when amounts of the Representative Reserve are either withdrawn to cover
expenditures made by the Representative or delivered to the Sellers in
accordance with this Section 8.12.

  Equity Purchase Agreement |  | Page 51 8.11 No Other Negotiations. The Company will not, and will not authorize,
encourage or knowingly permit any director, officer, employee, stockholder,
affiliate or agent of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any attorney,
investment banker or other Person on the Companys behalf to, directly or
indirectly: (a) solicit, initiate, encourage or knowingly induce the making,
submission or announcement of any offer or proposal from any Person concerning
any Alternative Transaction or take any other action that could reasonably be
expected to lead to an Alternative Transaction or a proposal therefor; (b)
consider any inquiry, offer or proposal received from any party concerning any
Alternative Transaction (other than to respond to such inquiry, offer or
proposal by indicating that the Company is not interested in any Alternative
Transaction); (c) furnish any information regarding any of the Companies to
any Person (other than Buyer) in connection with or in response to any
inquiry, offer or proposal for or regarding any Alternative Transaction
(other than to respond to such inquiry, offer or proposal by indicating that
the Company is not interested in any Alternative Transaction); (d) participate
in any discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than Buyer)
with respect to any Alternative Transaction (other than to respond to such
inquiry, offer or proposal by indicating that the Company is not interested in
any Alternative Transaction); (e) cooperate with, knowingly facilitate or
encourage any effort or attempt by any Person (other than Buyer) to effect
any Alternative Transaction; or (f) execute, enter into or become bound by any
letter of intent, agreement, commitment or understanding between Company and
any Person (other than Buyer) that is related to, provides for or concerns
any Alternative Transaction. The Company will promptly notify Buyer orally and
in writing of any inquiries or proposals received by any of the Companies or
its directors or officers, or, to its knowledge, employees, stockholders,
affiliates or agents regarding any Alternative Transaction and will identify
the party making the inquiry or proposal and the nature and terms of any
inquiry or proposal. The Companies will also promptly provide Buyer with
a complete copy of any such inquiries or proposals received in writing. Any
violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 8.8 by any director,
officer or employee of the Company or any attorney, investment banker or other
director or representative of the Company will be deemed a breach of this
Section 8.8 by the Company. As used herein, the term " _Alternative
Transaction_ " means any commitment, agreement or transaction involving or
providing for the possible disposition of all or any substantial portion of
the Companys business, assets or capital stock, whether by way of merger,
consolidation, sale of assets, sale of stock, stock exchange, tender offer or
any other form of business combination.

8.12 Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification.

 

(a) For a period of eight years after the Closing Date, Buyer shall at all
times continue to give effect to each and all of the provisions in the
Companys or any Company Subsidiarys governing documents (e.g., articles of
association, bylaws, operating agreements, partnership agreements, etc.)
relating to the exculpation or indemnification of former officers
and directors (unless required by law), it being the intent of the parties
that the officers and directors of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
prior to the Closing shall continue to be entitled to such exculpation and
indemnification to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law,
notwithstanding any amendment, modification or termination of such provisions
after the Closing.

 





     |  | 
---|---|--- 
  Equity Purchase Agreement |  | Page 52 (b) Following the Closing Date and for the term of such policy, Buyer shall,
or shall cause the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to, maintain in full
force and effect, the director and officer liability insurance paid for by the
Sellers and reflected on the Estimated Purchase Price Certificate which
insurance shall provide coverage for the individuals who were officers and
directors of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries prior to Closing that is
at least as favorable for such individuals as the policy or policies
maintained by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, as applicable,
immediately prior to the Closing for the benefit of such individuals.

(c) The Parties acknowledge, confirm and agree that the officers and
directors of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries are intended third party
beneficiaries of the provisions of this Section 8.12 and each of such officers
and directors shall be entitled to enforce and obtain the benefit of such
provisions notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary in this
Agreement.

8.13 Retention Bonus Pool. Buyer will establish a retention bonus pool in the
amount of US$360,000 in which each holder of unvested Company Options will be
entitled to participate on a pro rata basis in accordance with the ratio of
such holders number of unvested Company Options to the total number of
unvested Company Options, in each case on the Closing Date. Such retention
bonus pool will be paid out over a period of not more than one year after the
Closing Date, and participants in such retention bonus pool will be required
to execute only a Retention Bonus Agreement, substantially in the form set
forth in Exhibit F, in connection with such participation.

     |  | 
---|---|--- 
  Equity Purchase Agreement |  | Page 53 (b) Subject to the other terms of this Article 9 (including, without
limitation, Section 9.3), for the period commencing at the Closing and ending
upon the expiration of the applicable periods set forth in Section 9.4, each
Seller will jointly and severally up to the Escrow Amount and, above the

(i) The Buyer Indemnitees will not be entitled to any indemnification pursuant
to Section 9.1(b)(1), other than regarding any breach of any Special
Representation, until the aggregate dollar amount of all indemnifiable Losses
that would otherwise be indemnifiable pursuant to Section 9.1(b)(1), other
than regarding any breach of any Special Representation (or related
certification) or with respect to the matter described in _Schedule 9.3(a)(i)_
, exceeds US$575,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), at which time the Buyer
Indemnitees will be entitled to indemnification of all indemnifiable Losses
that would otherwise be indemnifiable pursuant to Section 9.1(b)(1) in excess
of the Deductible, subject to the other limitations and qualifications set
forth in this Article 9; _provided_ , however, that no claim by Buyer shall
be asserted where the Loss relating to such claim is less than US$5,000 and
such claims shall not be aggregated for purposes of this Section 9.3(a)(i).

 

(ii) The Buyer Indemnitees will not be able to seek indemnification pursuant
to Section 9.1(b)(1), other than regarding any breach of any Special

 





     |  | 
---|---|--- 
  Equity Purchase Agreement |  | Page 54  Representation, for any indemnifiable Loss in excess of the Escrow Amount,
and the Escrow Amount (as reduced from time to time in accordance with this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement) shall serve as the exclusive source of
indemnification pursuant to Section 9.1(b)(1), other than regarding any breach
of any Special Representation.

(iii) The Buyer Indemnitees will not be able to seek indemnification under
this Agreement for any Loss arising out of (A) any breach by Buyer of Section
8.3(d); or (B) conversion of loan obligations to common stock pursuant to
Section 7.1(i); or (C) the matters disclosed on Schedule 9.3(a)(iii).

(iv) Any indemnification to which any Buyer Indemnitee is entitled under this
Agreement as a result of any Loss it may suffer or incur thereunder shall
first be satisfied from the Escrow Amount (as reduced from time to time in
accordance with this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement) and then be recovered
from the Sellers in accordance with this Article 9.

(v) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary hereunder (including Sections
9.3(a)(i) and 9.3(a)(ii) hereof), no Seller shall be liable for any amounts,
individually or in the aggregate, under this Agreement (including
indemnifiable Losses hereunder) in excess of the Pro Rata Share of the
Purchase Price received by such Seller.

(vi) No indemnification shall be payable to Buyer Indemnitees with respect to
any Losses arising out of any breach of the Companys representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement to the extent that (A) the Company has
made a corresponding reserve for such Losses on the balance sheet in the Most
Recent Financial Statements, which reserve has not been exceeded as of the
Closing Date; or (B) there has been a corresponding reduction in the
calculation of the Final Working Capital; or (C) the Company has disclosed the

expiration of the applicable periods set forth in Section 9.4.

(viii) A Seller shall have no indemnification obligation with respect to any
Losses arising out of any breach of such Sellers representations and
warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement to the extent that the
Company has otherwise been fully indemnified for such Losses in respect of the
same facts and circumstances giving rise to such breach of the representations
and warranties or covenants; _provided_ , however, that Buyer has no
obligation to pursue such other indemnification.

(b) Insurance. In determining the amount of Losses relative to any thresholds
set forth in Section 9.3(a) and in otherwise determining the amount of any
Losses for which the Buyer Indemnitees are entitled to assert a claim for
indemnification hereunder, the amount of any such Losses shall be
determined after deducting therefrom the amount of any Insurance Proceeds (as
defined below) and other third-party recoveries actually received (which
Insurance Proceeds and recoveries Buyer will use reasonable efforts to obtain)
and the amount of 

 





     |  | 
---|---|--- 
  Equity Purchase Agreement |  | Page 55  any net Tax Benefits actually realized by the Buyer Indemnitees in respect
of such Losses. If an indemnification payment is received by a Buyer
Indemnitee, and the Buyer Indemnitee or its Affiliates later receives
Insurance Proceeds, other third-party recoveries, or actually realizes net Tax
Benefits in respect of the related Losses, the Buyer Indemnitee shall promptly
pay to the Indemnifying Parties a sum equal to the lesser of (y) the actual
amount of Insurance Proceeds, other third party recoveries, and net Tax
Benefits actually realized or (z) the actual amount of the indemnification
payment previously paid by the Indemnifying Parties with respect to
such Losses. For the purposes of this Agreement, " _Insurance Proceeds_ "
shall mean insurance proceeds actually received by the Buyer Indemnitee or its
Affiliates in respect of any Losses for which indemnification is being
claimed hereunder after deducting (x) any premium increase resulting from the
coverage of such Loss by the insurer, and (y) any applicable deductible or
retention. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Tax Benefit_ " shall mean any
refund of Taxes paid or actual reduction in the amount of Taxes of the
relevant Tax Affiliate or the Company with respect to the same tax year in
which the Loss is taken into consideration, which otherwise would have been
paid, with the amount and timing of a tax benefit determined.

(c) Duplication of Loss. Any Loss for which the Buyer Indemnitees are
entitled to indemnification under Section 9.1 shall be determined without
duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such
Loss constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement. 

(d) Remedies Exclusive. Subject to Section 9.7, from and after the Closing,
the rights of the Parties to indemnification relating to this Agreement or
the Transactions shall be strictly limited to those contained in this Article
9, and, subject to the terms of this Article 9, such indemnification rights
shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Parties subsequent to the
Closing Date with respect to any matter in any way relating to this Agreement
or arising in connection herewith, other than claims for indemnification
involving fraud (and in the event of such fraud, the
indemnification limitations of this Article 9 shall not apply with respect to
such claims, provided that recourse with respect to such claims shall be
granted solely against the Person or Persons determined to be liable for such
fraud). No claim shall be brought or maintained by any Seller, Buyer, the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or their respective successors or permitted
assigns against any officer, director or employee (present or former) of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, in their capacity as such, and no recourse
shall be brought or granted against any of them in their capacity as such, by
virtue of or based upon any alleged misrepresentation or inaccuracy in or
breach of any of the representations, warranties or covenants of the Company,
a Company Subsidiary or a Seller set forth or contained in this Agreement or
any exhibit or Schedule hereto or any certificate delivered hereunder, except
to the extent that the same shall have been the result of fraud by any such
Person (and in the event of such fraud, recourse with respect to such claims
shall be granted solely against the Person or Persons determined to be liable
for such fraud).

(e) Consequential, Etc. Damages. In no event shall Buyer be entitled to
recover or make a claim for any amounts in respect of consequential,
incidental or indirect damages, lost profits, punitive or exemplary damages,
special damages or other similar items and, in particular, no "multiple of
profits" or "multiple of cash flow" or similar valuation methodology shall be
used in calculating the amount of any Losses except with respect to such
damages payable by an Indemnified Party to any third party.

 





     |  | 
---|---|--- 
  Equity Purchase Agreement |  | Page 56 (f) Mitigation. Buyer agrees that in the event of any breach giving rise to
an indemnification obligation under Section 9.1(b)(1), Buyer shall take and
cause its Affiliates (including the Company and each Company Subsidiary) to
take, or cooperate with the Sellers, if so requested by the Representative, in
order to take, reasonable measures to mitigate the consequences of the
related breach (including taking reasonable steps to prevent any contingent
liability from becoming an actual liability).

 

(g) Subrogation. Upon payment in full of any Losses pursuant to Section
9.1(b)(1) or the payment of any judgment or settlement with respect to a
Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to the extent of
such payment to the rights of the Claiming Party against any Person with
respect to the subject matter of such Loss or Third-Party Claim. The Claiming
Party shall assign (to the extent practicable) or otherwise reasonably
cooperate with the Indemnifying Party, at the cost and expense of the
Indemnifying Party, to pursue any claims against, or otherwise recover amounts
from, any Person liable or responsible for any Losses for which
indemnification has been received pursuant to this Agreement.

9.4 Certain Survival Periods.

(a) Representations and Warranties. Each representation and warranty contained
herein (and in any related Schedule) will survive the Closing and will remain
in full force and effect for a period of 15 months after the Closing Date,
_except_ that each Special Representation (and related Schedule) will survive
until all Liabilities hereunder relating thereto are barred by all applicable
statutes of limitation. " _Special Representation_ " means any representation
or warranty in Article 3 or in Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, or 4.4 hereof.

 

(b) Survival Until Final Determination. For each claim for indemnification
under this Agreement regarding a breach of a representation or warranty (or
related Schedule) that is made prior to expiration of the survival period for
such representation or warranty (as set forth in Section 9.4(a)), such claim
and associated right to indemnification will not terminate before final
determination and satisfaction of such claim.

(c) Survival of Other Terms. Except as provided in the preceding terms of
this Section 9.4 regarding representations and warranties, each covenant or
agreement contained herein, and all associated rights under this Article 9,
will survive Closing and will continue in full force thereafter, subject to
any limitation stated by their respective terms.

9.5 Third-Party Claims.

 

(a) Notice. A Party that believes itself entitled to indemnification hereunder
(the " _Claiming Party_ ") will give the Party that it believes is obligated
to provide such indemnification (the " _Indemnifying Party_") prompt notice
of any claim of a third party (a " _Third-Party Claim_") as to which
the Claiming Party believes it has the right to demand indemnification
hereunder, which notice shall set forth with reasonable specificity the facts
and circumstances of which such Claiming Party has received notice and specify
the basis hereunder under which the Claiming Party believes itself to be
indemnified (the " _Initial Claim Notice_"). The failure to promptly give
such Initial Claim Notice to the Indemnifying Party will not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of any liability hereunder, unless the Indemnifying Party
was prejudiced thereby, and then only to the extent of such prejudice.

 





     |  | 
---|---|--- 
  Equity Purchase Agreement |  | Page 57 (b) Commencement of Defense and Participation. If:

 

(1) the defense of a Third-Party Claim is so tendered and within thirty (30)
days thereafter such tender is accepted without qualification by the
Indemnifying Party; or

(2) within thirty (30) days after the date on which the Initial Claim Notice
has been given pursuant to this Section 9.5, the Indemnifying Party shall
acknowledge without qualification its indemnification obligations for any such
Losses as provided in this Article 9 in writing to the Claiming Party and
accept the defense thereof;

then, except as herein provided, the Claiming Party shall not, and the
Indemnifying Party shall, have the right to contest, defend, litigate or
settle such Third-Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall lose its right to
contest, defend, litigate and settle the Third-Party Claim if it shall fail to
diligently contest the Third-Party Claim. So long as the Indemnifying Party
has not lost its right and/or obligation to contest, defend, litigate and
settle as herein provided, the Indemnifying Party shall have the exclusive
right to contest, defend and litigate the Third-Party Claim and shall
have the exclusive right, in its discretion exercised in good faith, and upon
the advice of counsel, to settle any such matter, either before or after the
initiation of litigation, at such time and upon such terms as it deems fair
and reasonable, provided that (i) at least ten (10) days prior to any such
settlement, written notice of its intention to settle shall be given to the
Claiming Party, and (ii) that the Indemnifying Party will not, without the
written consent of the Claiming Party, (x) agree to any injunctive relief
affecting the Claiming Party or any of its Affiliates (y) agree to settle any
such matter without an unconditional release of the Claiming Party and its
Affiliates or (z) agree to any settlement that would adversely affect the
business or operations of the Claiming Party or any of its Affiliates
(including, but not limited to, material damage to the reputation of the
Claiming Party) . All expenses (including without limitation attorneys fees)
incurred by the Indemnifying Party in connection with the foregoing shall be
paid by the Indemnifying Party. No failure by an Indemnifying Party to
acknowledge in writing its indemnification obligations under this Article
9 shall relieve it of such obligations to the extent they exist. If a
Claiming Party is entitled to indemnification against a Third-Party Claim, and
the Indemnifying Party fails to accept a tender of, or assume, the defense of
a Third-Party Claim pursuant to this Section 9.5, or if, in accordance with
the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall lose its right to contest, defend,
litigate and settle such a Third-Party Claim, the Claiming Party shall have
the right, without prejudice to its right of indemnification hereunder, in
its discretion exercised in good faith and upon the advice of counsel, to
contest, defend and litigate such Third-Party Claim, and may settle such
Third-Party Claim, either before or after the initiation of litigation, at
such time and upon such terms as the Claiming Party deems fair and reasonable,
provided that (i) at least ten (10) days prior to any such settlement, written
notice of its intention to settle is given to the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnifying Party consents to such settlement, which such consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld and (ii) that the Claiming Party will not, without
the written consent of the Indemnifying Party, agree to settle any
such matter without an unconditional release of the Indemnifying Party and
its Affiliates . If, pursuant to this Section 9.5, the Claiming Party so
contests, defends, litigates or settles a Third-Party Claim for which it is 

 





     |  | 
---|---|--- 
  Equity Purchase Agreement |  | Page 58  entitled to indemnification hereunder, the Claiming Party shall be
reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party for the reasonable attorneys fees and
other reasonable expenses of contesting, defending, litigating and/or
settling the Third-Party Claim which are incurred from time to time, forthwith
following the presentation to the Indemnifying Party of itemized bills for
said attorneys fees and other expenses.

 

(c) Participation by Claiming Party. The Claiming Party will have the right to
engage its own legal counsel (and other professional advisers) in connection
with such defense and Third-Party Claim, at the Claiming Partys expense,
provided that the Claiming Party shall be entitled to reimbursement therefor
if the Indemnifying Party shall lose its right to contest, defend, litigate
and settle the Third-Party Claim as herein provided. So long as the
Indemnifying Party has, and is exercising, its right and/or obligation to
contest, defend, litigate and settle the Third-Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party will keep the Claiming Party fully informed of all matters
material to such defense and Third-Party Claim at all stages thereof, whether
or not the Claiming Party is represented by separate legal counsel.

 

(d) Failure to Commence Defense. If the Indemnifying Party does not commence a
defense within 30 days following receipt of any Initial Claim Notice the
Claiming Party may, at its option, settle or defend such Third-Party Claim at
the expense of the Indemnifying Party.

(e) Access and Cooperation. Each Party will, and will cause its Affiliates to,
promptly make available to the other Party (and its legal counsel and other
professional advisers with a reasonable need to know) all books and records
of such Party relating to such defense and Third-Party Claim, subject to
reasonable confidentiality requirements. Each Party will render to the other
Party such assistance as such other Party may reasonably request to ensure
the proper and adequate defense of such Third-Party Claim.

9.6 Additional Notices. In addition to and not in limitation of Section 9.5,
a Claiming Party will give prompt notice to an Indemnifying Party of each
claim for indemnification hereunder for which such Claiming Party proposes to
demand indemnification (whether or not involving a third party), specifying
the amount and nature of such claim (to the extent known). The failure to
promptly give such notice to the Indemnifying Party will not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of any liability hereunder, unless the Indemnifying
Party was prejudiced thereby, and then only to the extent of such prejudice.

9.7 Specific Performance. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that each other
Party would be damaged irreparably in the event any term of this Agreement is
not performed in accordance with its specific terms or otherwise is breached,
so that a Party will be entitled to injunctive relief to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms hereof
in addition to any other remedy to which such Party may be entitled, at law or
in equity. In particular, each Party acknowledges that the business of the
Companies are unique and recognizes and affirms that in the event any
Executing Shareholder or the Company breaches this Agreement, money damages
may be inadequate and it would have no adequate remedy at law, so that Buyer
will have the right, in addition to any other rights and remedies existing in
its favor, to seek enforcement of its rights and each other Partys
obligations hereunder not only by action for damages but also by action for
specific performance, injunctive or other equitable relief.

Page 59 9.8 Effect of Investigation. The representations, warranties and covenants of
each Party and any Persons rights to indemnification with respect thereto
shall not be affected or deemed waived by reason of any investigation made by
or on behalf of such Person (including by any of his, her or its advisors,
consultants or representatives) or, except as set forth in the Schedules
(including any Update) in a manner consistent with Section 10.14, by reason of
the fact that such Person or any of such advisors, consultants or
representatives knew or should have known that any such representation or
warranty is, was or might be inaccurate. The waiver of any condition based on
the accuracy of any representation or warranty will eliminate the right to
indemnification or other remedy based on such representation or warranty.

9.9 Materiality Qualifiers. For purposes of calculating Losses in this Article
9, all qualifications as to materiality contained in any representation or
warranty will be ignored.

9.10 Guaranty Regarding Buyers Obligations. Fair Isaac Corporation, a
Delaware corporation (the " _Guarantor_ ") and Affiliate of Buyer, to induce
the Executing Shareholders to enter into this Agreement, hereby absolutely,
unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the full and prompt payment and
performance when due of any and all of Buyers obligations, covenants,
agreements and other Liabilities under the Agreement (collectively, the "
_Obligations_ "). Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that the Executing
Shareholders refuse to enter into the Agreement or to consummate the
transactions contemplated herein unless Guarantor provides this guaranty and
that Guarantor will benefit personally from the Executing Shareholders
entering into this Agreement and consummating such transactions.

9.11 Waiver. Effective upon and subject to the Closing, each Seller hereby
agrees that such Seller will not make any claim for indemnification against
the Company by reason of the fact that such Seller was a director, officer,
employee, or agent of any such entity or was serving at the request of any
such entity as a partner, trustee, director, officer, employee or agent of
another entity (whether such claim is for judgments, damages, penalties,
fines, costs, amounts paid in settlement, losses, expenses or otherwise and
whether such claim is pursuant to any statute, charter document, bylaw,
Contract, or otherwise) with respect to any indemnification claim brought by
Buyer against such Seller under the provisions of this Article 9. Each of the
Sellers severally waives any right of pre-emption or other restriction on
transfer in respect of the Shares or any of them conferred on him or it under
the articles of association of the Company, the Shareholders Agreement or
otherwise.

 

9.12 Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments. To the maximum extent permitted by
law, it is the intention of the Parties to treat any indemnity payment made
under this Agreement as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for all federal,
state, local and foreign Tax purposes, and the Parties agree to file their
Returns accordingly.

and without appeal.

action.

extent such

 





     |  | 
---|---|--- 
  Equity Purchase Agreement |  | Page 65  disclosures application or relevance to a representation or warranty in any
other section of this Agreement is readily apparent on its face. A disclosure
made by the Company in any section of this Agreement or any Schedule will
expressly not be deemed to constitute an admission by the Company or any
Executing Shareholder, or otherwise imply, that any such matter is material or
creates a measure for materially for the purposes of this Agreement.

10.15 Conflict Waiver. Notwithstanding that the Company has been represented
by Feinberg Hanson LLP and/or Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP (the " _Firms_ ")
in the preparation, negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the
Transaction Documents, each Party agrees that after the Closing the Firms may
represent the Representative, the Sellers and/or their affiliates in matters
related to this Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents, including
without limitation in respect of any indemnification claims pursuant to this
Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents. Each Party hereby
acknowledges, on behalf of itself and its affiliates, that it has had an
opportunity to ask for and has obtained information relevant to such
representation, including disclosure of the reasonably foreseeable adverse
consequences of such representation, and it hereby waives any conflict
arising out of such future representation.
