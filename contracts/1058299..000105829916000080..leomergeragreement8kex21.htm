forth herein, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place at
10:00 a.m., Eastern time, on the date that is as soon as practicable (and, in
any event, within two (2) Business Days) after satisfaction or, to the extent
permitted hereunder, waiver of all conditions to the Merger set forth in
Article 7 (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the
extent permitted hereunder) of such conditions), unless this Agreement has
been terminated pursuant to its terms or unless another time or date is
agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. The Closing shall be held at the
offices of Goodwin Procter LLP, 100 Northern Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts,
02110, unless another place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto.
Notwithstanding this Section 2.01 or Article 7, if the Marketing Period has
not ended at the time when the Closing would otherwise be required to occur
pursuant to this Section 2.01, the Closing will occur on the earlier of (i) a
Business Day before or during the Marketing Period specified by Parent on two

(2nd) Business Day after the expiration of the Marketing Period (subject, in
each case, to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted hereunder)
of all of the conditions set forth in Article 7, other than those conditions
that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted hereunder) of such conditions
at the Closing), or at such other date and time as Parent and the Company
shall mutually agree upon in writing. Section 2.02 The Merger. Upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, as soon as
practicable on the Closing Date, Parent and the Company shall cause a
certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") to be executed and
delivered to the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware for filing as
provided in the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective on such date and at
such time when the Certificate of Merger has been received for filing by the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later time and date as
may be agreed by the parties in writing and specified in the Certificate of
Merger (the "Effective Time").  

  

 ![](leomergeragreement8kex21018.jpg) 

14 At the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company in accordance with the DGCL, whereupon the separate existence of
Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation in
the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation"), and the separate corporate
existence of the Company, with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers
and franchises, shall continue unaffected by the Merger. The Merger shall
have the effects specified in the DGCL. Section 2.03 Conversion of Shares. At
the Effective Time, as a result of the Merger and without any action on the
part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any capital stock
of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company: except as otherwise provided in Section
2.03(b), Section 2.03(c) or Section 2.05 and except for any shares of Company
Common Stock (including Company Restricted Stock Awards, if any) contributed
to Holdings by the Rollover Investor (collectively, the "Rollover Shares")
immediately prior to the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
automatically canceled and converted into the right to receive $5.75 in cash
without interest (the "Merger Consideration"). As of the Effective Time, all
such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be issued and outstanding
and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder
of a Certificate representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive
the Merger Consideration upon surrender of such certificate in accordance
with Section 2.04, without interest. For the avoidance of doubt, no Rollover
Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration;
each share of Company Common Stock owned by the Company and any shares of
Company Common Stock owned by Parent or Merger Sub (or any of their
respective Affiliates) immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall
be delivered in exchange therefor; and each share of common stock of Merger
Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
automatically be converted into and become one fully paid, nonassessable
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so
converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of
the Surviving Corporation. Section 2.04 Surrender and Payment. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall appoint American Stock Transfer and Trust Company
as the exchange agent (or such other nationally recognized exchange agent
agreed to between the parties) (the "Exchange Agent") to act as agent for the
Company's stockholders who shall become entitled to receive funds pursuant to
this Agreement, including as agent for the purpose of exchanging for the
Merger Consideration, certificates representing shares of Company Common  

  

 ![](leomergeragreement8kex21019.jpg) 

15 "Certificates;" provided, however, that any references herein to
"Certificates" are deemed to include references to book-entry account
statements relating to the ownership of shares of Company Common Stock). At
or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, with the Exchange Agent the Aggregate Merger Consideration (the
"Payment Fund"). To the extent such fund diminishes for any reason below the
level required to make prompt payment of the Merger Consideration, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall promptly replace or restore, or cause to be
replaced or restored, the lost portion of such fund so as to ensure that it
is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make such payments. The
Payment Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by Parent;
provided, that (i) no such investment or losses thereon shall relieve Parent
from making the payments required by this Article 2 or affect the amount of
Merger Consideration payable hereunder, and following any losses Parent shall
promptly provide additional funds to the Exchange Agent in the amount of any
such losses, (ii) no such investment shall have maturities that could prevent
or delay payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement and (iii) such
investments shall be in short-term obligations of the United States with
maturities of no more than thirty (30) days, or guaranteed by, and backed by
the full faith and credit of, the United States. Any and all interest or
other amounts earned with respect to such funds shall become part of the
Payment Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable hereunder shall
be promptly returned to either Parent or the Surviving Corporation. The
Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Surviving
Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) pay
all charges and expenses, including those of the Exchange Agent, in
connection with the exchange of shares of Company Common Stock and the
payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of such shares. Promptly after
the Effective Time, and in any event no later than three (3) Business Days
after the Effective Time, Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange
Agent to send, to each record holder of shares of Company Common Stock at the
Effective Time whose shares were converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.03(a) a letter of transmittal and
instructions in forms reasonably satisfactory to the Company (which shall
specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall
pass, only upon proper delivery or transfer of the Certificates (or affidavits
of loss in lieu of the Certificates pursuant to Section 2.09) to the Exchange
Agent for use in such exchange. Each holder of shares of Company Common
Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in
respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by a Certificate,
promptly, upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together
with a duly completed and validly executed letter of transmittal and such
other documents as may reasonably be requested by the Exchange Agent, or (ii)
receipt of an "agent's message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence,
if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case
of a book-entry transfer of shares of Company Common Stock, and, in each
case, delivery to the Exchange Agent of such other documents as may
reasonably be requested by the Exchange Agent. Until so surrendered or
transferred, each such Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time
for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger  

  

 ![](leomergeragreement8kex21020.jpg) 

16 Consideration. No interest shall be paid or accrued on the cash payable
upon the surrender or transfer of such Certificate. If any portion of the
Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to
such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (ii) the Person requesting
such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Tax
required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered
holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange
Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. All Merger Consideration
paid upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificate and from and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be
canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in
accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article 2. Any portion of
the Payment Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered
to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any such holder who has not
exchanged shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in
accordance with this Section 2.04 prior to that time shall thereafter look
only to Parent or the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger
Consideration, without interest. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such
holders at such time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent
permitted by Applicable Law, the property of Parent or its designee, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.
Section 2.05 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding Section 2.03, shares of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of adoption of this
Agreement or consented thereto in writing, who is entitled to appraisal and
who has properly exercised appraisal rights for such shares in accordance
with Section 262 of the DGCL shall not be converted into a right to receive
the Merger Consideration but instead shall be entitled only to payment of the
appraised value of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL
following which such shares shall automatically be canceled and shall cease
to exist; provided, however, that if, after the Effective Time, such holder
fails to perfect, withdraws or loses such holder's right to appraisal,
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or if a court of competent jurisdiction
shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by
Section 262 of the DGCL, such shares of Company Common Stock shall be treated
as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration (less any amounts entitled to be deducted or
withheld pursuant to Section 2.08) in accordance with Section 2.03(a),
without interest thereon, upon surrender of such Certificate formerly
representing such shares. The Company shall provide  

  

 ![](leomergeragreement8kex21021.jpg) 

17 Parent prompt written notice of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock, any withdrawal of any such
demand and any other demand, notice, instrument delivered to the Company
prior to the Effective Time pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL that relate
to such demand, and Parent shall have the opportunity and right to participate
in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with
the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment
with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands. Section
2.06 Company Stock Options; Restricted Stock Awards; Restricted Stock Unit
Awards. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each Company Stock
Option, whether or not vested and exercisable, that is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be automatically
converted into the right to receive from Parent or the Surviving Corporation
an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the
excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the per share exercise price
of such Company Stock Option, by (ii) the aggregate number of shares of
Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise or settlement of such
Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (such product,
the "Cash Amount"). From and after the Effective Time, any Company Stock
Option shall no longer represent the right to purchase shares of Company
Common Stock by the former holder thereof, but shall only entitle such holder
to the payment of the Cash Amount, if any. Payments of the Cash Amount shall
be paid as soon as practicable following the Effective Time, without
interest. All payments provided pursuant to this Section 2.06(a) shall be made
through the Company's payroll systems, subject to withholding in accordance
with the provisions of Section 2.08. If the exercise price per share of any
Company Stock Option equals or exceeds the Merger Consideration, the Cash
Amount therefor shall be zero. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders
thereof, each outstanding Company Restricted Stock Award shall become fully
vested and the restrictions with respect thereto shall lapse. All Company
Restricted Stock Awards, including shares that become fully vested and with
respect to which the restrictions shall lapse immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be treated in the Merger in the same manner as the other
shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.03(a) and Section
2.04. Company Restricted Stock Awards that become fully vested pursuant to
this Section 2.06(b) shall be subject to withholding in accordance with the
provisions of Section 2.08. In no event shall this Section 2.06 and Section
2.04 result in a duplication of benefits with respect to any Company
Restricted Stock Awards. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each
outstanding restricted stock unit award under the Company Stock Plans (the
"Company RSUs") shall become fully vested, shall not be assumed by Parent or
Merger Sub in the Merger and shall be canceled and extinguished as of the
Effective Time and, in exchange therefor, each former holder of any such
Company RSU shall have the right to receive from Parent or the Surviving  

  

 ![](leomergeragreement8kex21022.jpg) 

18 Corporation an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(i) the maximum number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company RSU by (ii) the Merger Consideration (such amounts payable hereunder,
the "RSU Award Payments" and, together with the aggregate Merger
Consideration and the aggregate Cash Amount, the "Aggregate Merger
Consideration"). From and after the Effective Time, any Company RSU shall no
longer represent the right to receive shares of Company Common Stock by the
former holder thereof, but shall only entitle such holder to the payment of
the RSU Award Payment. The RSU Award Payments shall be paid as soon as
practicable following the Effective Time, without interest. All payments
provided pursuant to this Section 2.06(c) shall be made through the Company's
payroll systems, subject to withholding in accordance with the provisions of
Section 2.08. As soon as reasonably practicable following the date hereof and
in any event prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if
appropriate, any committee administering the Company Stock Plans) shall adopt
such resolutions that are necessary for the treatment of the Company Equity
Awards pursuant to this Section 2.06, which resolutions will also provide
that such Company Equity Awards shall terminate conditioned upon, and
effective immediately after, the Effective Time. Section 2.07 Adjustments.
If, during the period between the date hereof and the Effective Time, any
change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company shall occur,
including by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split
(including reverse stock split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of
shares, or any stock dividend, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts
payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted. Section
2.08 Withholding Rights. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment under any provision of any applicable Tax law.
To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld and are paid to the
applicable Taxing Authority in accordance with Applicable Law by Parent,
Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the case may
be, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, made such
deduction and withholding. Section 2.09 Lost Certificates. If any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if reasonably required by the Surviving Corporation, the
posting by such Person of a bond, in such customary amount as the Surviving
Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue,
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate, as contemplated under this Article  

  

 ![](leomergeragreement8kex21023.jpg)

amended at the Effective Time to read in its entirety as the certificate of

hereof, on the date of such filing), each Company SEC Document complied, as to
form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As of its

hereof, on the date of such filing), no Company SEC Document filed pursuant to
the Exchange Act contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted
to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not

financial reporting utilized by the Company; (B) any illegal act or fraud,
whether or not material, that involves the management or other employees of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; or (C) any claim or allegation
regarding any of the foregoing. The Company's "disclosure controls and

processed, summarized and reported to the individuals responsible for
preparing such reports within the time periods specified in the rules and
forms of the SEC and (ii) all such information is accumulated and
communicated to the Company's management as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications of the
principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Company
required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports. Section 4.09

course consistent with past practice and there has not been any event,

H.I.G. Middle Market LBO Fund II, L.P. (the "Sponsor") to invest, subject to
the terms and conditions therein, cash in the aggregate amount set forth
therein (being collectively referred to as the "Equity Financing"), (ii) an
executed rollover agreement (the "Rollover Agreement") between Rory J. Cowan
(the "Rollover Investor") and Holdings, pursuant to which, and subject to the
terms and conditions therein, the Rollover Investor shall contribute to
Holdings the amount of Company Common Stock set forth therein (the "Rollover
Investment"), and (iii) an executed commitment letter and (subject to
redactions of fee amounts and certain economic terms of the market flex, none
of which could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the aggregate
amount or availability of the Debt Financing on the Closing Date or impose
new or additional conditions to, or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of
the conditions to, the availability of the Debt Financing) fee letter from the
financial institutions identified therein (the "Debt Commitment Letter" and,
together with the Equity Commitment Letter, the "Financing Commitment
Letters" and the Financing Commitment Letters together with the Rollover
Agreement, the "Transaction Commitment Letters") to provide, on the terms and
subject only to the conditions therein, debt financing in the amounts set
forth therein (being collectively referred to as the "Debt Financing" and,
together with the Equity Financing, the "Financing"). As of the date hereof,
none of the Transaction Commitment Letters has been amended or modified, and
no terms thereunder have been waived, no such amendment, modification or
waiver is contemplated, and the respective obligations and commitments
contained in such letters have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect.
Parent or Merger Sub has fully paid, or caused to be paid, any and all
commitment fees or other fees in connection with the Transaction Commitment
Letters that are payable on or prior to the date hereof. Assuming (i) the
Financing is funded in accordance with the Equity Commitment Letter and the
Debt Commitment Letter (including in the event that the market flex provision
of the Debt Financing is exercised in full), as applicable, and (ii) the
contribution contemplated by the Rollover Agreement is made in accordance
with the terms of the Rollover Agreement, the net proceeds contemplated by
the Equity Commitment Letter and the Debt Commitment Letter will, together
with the contribution contemplated by the Rollover Agreement, in the aggregate
be sufficient for Parent and Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to pay
the amounts contemplated in Article 2, including the Aggregate Merger
Consideration, to make any repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated by
this Agreement or the Debt Commitment Letter, to pay any other amounts
required to be paid on the Closing Date in connection with the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to pay all related fees
and expenses required to be paid on the Closing Date. The Transaction
Commitment Letters are,  

  

 ![](leomergeragreement8kex21049.jpg) 

45 valid, legal, binding and enforceable obligations of Merger Sub,
enforceable against Merger Sub in accordance with their terms, and, to the
knowledge of the Parent and Merger Sub, valid, legal, binding and enforceable
obligations of the other parties thereto, enforceable against such Persons in
accordance with their terms, in each case, except as enforceability may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
Applicable Laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally or by
equitable principles (regardless of whether enforcement is sought at law or
in equity). To the knowledge of Parent, the Transaction Commitment Letters
are in full force and effect as of the date hereof and, assuming the accuracy
of the Company's representations and warranties hereunder as of the date
hereof, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or
both, would or would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach
on the part of Parent or Merger Sub or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other
parties thereto, under any of the Transaction Commitment Letters. Assuming
the accuracy of the Company's representations and warranties hereunder, as of
the date hereof, Parent does not have any reason to believe that any of the
conditions to the funding of the full amount of the Financing will not be
satisfied or that the full amount of the Financing will not be available to
Parent or Merger Sub on the date of the Closing or that any of the conditions
to the contribution contemplated in the Rollover Agreement will not be
satisfied or that the contribution contemplated by the Rollover Agreement
will not be made to Holdings on or before the date of the Closing. The
Financing Commitment Letters contain all of the conditions precedent to the
obligations of the parties thereunder to make the full amount of the
Financing available to Parent on the terms therein, and the Rollover Agreement
contains all of the conditions precedent to the obligations of the parties
thereunder to make the contribution to Parent or its Affiliates described
therein. There are no side letters or other agreements, arrangements or
understandings (including fee or side letters) to which Parent or any of its
Affiliates is a party related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of
the full amount of the Financing other than as set forth in the Transaction
Commitment Letters. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the
Guarantor has delivered to the Company the duly executed Guarantee. No event
has occurred that would constitute a breach or default (or with notice or
lapse of time or both would constitute a default) under the Guarantee by the
Guarantor. The obligations of Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement are
not subject to any conditions regarding Parent's, Merger Sub's, their
respective Affiliates' or any other Person's (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, the Company's or any Subsidiary of the Company's) ability to obtain
the Financing. Section 5.09 Solvency. Assuming (a) satisfaction of the
conditions to Parent's obligation to consummate the Merger, and after giving
effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Financing (including in the event that the market flex provision of the Debt
Financing is exercised in full) and the payment of the amounts contemplated in
Article 2, including the Aggregate Merger Consideration, (b) any repayment or
refinancing of debt contemplated in this Agreement or the Financing
Commitment Letters, (c) the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
are solvent immediately prior to the Closing, (d) all cost estimates,
financial or other projections and other predictions of the Company have been
prepared in good faith based upon assumptions that were and continue to be
reasonable, immediately after giving effect to the transactions contemplated
hereby, (e) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company
set forth in Article 3 hereof, (f) payment of all amounts required to be paid
in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and (g) payment of all related fees and expenses, Parent and  

  

 ![](leomergeragreement8kex21050.jpg) 

46 the Surviving Corporation, taken as a whole, will be Solvent as of the
Effective Time and immediately after the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term
"Solvent" when used with respect to any Person, means that, as of any date of
determination (x) the amount of the "fair saleable value" of the assets of
such Person will, as of such date, exceed (i) the value of all "liabilities of
such Person, including contingent and other liabilities," as of such date, as
such quoted terms are generally determined in accordance with Applicable Laws
governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors, and (ii) the amount
that will be required to pay the probable liabilities of such Person on its
existing debts (including contingent and other liabilities) as such debts
become absolute and mature, (y) such Person will not have, as of such date,
an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses
in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged following such date, and (z)
such Person will be able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and
other liabilities, as they mature. For purposes of this definition, "not have
an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses
in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged" and "able to pay its
liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature"
means that such Person will be able to generate enough cash from operations,
asset dispositions or refinancing, or a combination thereof, to meet its
obligations as they become due. Section 5.10 Absence of Certain Agreements.
As of the date hereof, neither Parent, Merger Sub nor any of their respective
Affiliates has entered into any agreement, arrangement or understanding (in
each case, whether oral or written), or authorized, committed or agreed to
enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding (in each case, whether
oral or written), (i) pursuant to which any stockholder of the Company would
be entitled to receive in respect of any share consideration of a different
amount or nature than the Merger Consideration or pursuant to which any
stockholder of the Company has agreed to vote to adopt this Agreement or has
agreed to vote against any Superior Proposal or (ii) pursuant to which any
stockholder of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has agreed to make an
investment in, or contribution to, Parent or Merger Sub in connection with

one hand, and any member of the Company's management or directors, on the
other hand, as of the date hereof that relate in any way to, or are in
connection with, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Section
5.11 Stock Ownership. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub owns any shares of
capital stock of the Company. Section 5.12 Competing Businesses. None of
Parent, Sponsor nor any of their respective Affiliates owns any interest in
any Person that derives a significant portion of its revenues from a line of
business in the industries in which the Company or its Subsidiaries operate
that would reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on the ability of
Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with
the terms hereof. Section 5.13 Brokers' Fees. Other than the engagement of
Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC by Parent to act as investment banker,
there is no other investment banker, broker, finder or other agent or
intermediary that has been retained by or is authorized to act on behalf of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, Affiliates, or any of their respective
officers or directors in their capacities as officers or directors, who is
entitled to any advisory, banking, broker's, finder's or

any new Contract that would be a Lease Agreement if entered into prior to the
date hereof; implement any employee layoffs that would reasonably be expected
to implicate the WARN Act; or authorize, commit or agree to take any of the
foregoing actions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this
Agreement shall give to Parent or Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, rights
to control or direct the operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries prior
to the Effective Time. In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in
this Section 6.01 shall restrict the Company and its Subsidiaries from, or
require the consent of Parent prior to, engaging in any transaction or
entering into any agreement exclusively among the Company and its
Subsidiaries. Section 6.02 Go-Shop; Unsolicited Proposals. During the period

concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries that the Company provides to any
Person given such access that was not previously made available to Parent or
Merger Sub, (ii) engage in, continue, enter into and otherwise participate in
any discussion or negotiation with any Person with respect to any Acquisition

negotiations with any Third Party regarding an Acquisition Proposal, or
furnish to any Third Party information or data or provide to any Third Party

Confidentiality Agreement) (an "Alternative Acquisition Agreement") or enter
into any agreement, contract or commitment requiring the Company to abandon,
terminate, breach or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or (D) resolve, propose or agree to do any of the foregoing; and
(ii) the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall direct
the Company's and its Subsidiaries' Representatives to immediately cease and
terminate any existing solicitation, encouragement, discussion or negotiation
with any Third Party, other than an Excluded Person, theretofore conducted by
the Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal and the Company shall request that all
non-public information previously provided by or on behalf of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to any such Third Party (other than an Excluded
Person) be returned  

  

 ![](leomergeragreement8kex21056.jpg) 

52 or destroyed in accordance with the applicable Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section
6.02(b), if, at any time on or after the Non-Solicitation Start Date, but
prior to the Stockholder Approval; (i) the Company receives an unsolicited
written Acquisition Proposal from a Third Party, (ii) such Acquisition
Proposal did not, directly or indirectly, result from or arise out of a
material breach of this Section 6.02, (iii) the Company Board (acting upon
the recommendation of the Special Committee) determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Company Financial Advisor and outside legal counsel,
that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be expected
to lead to, a Superior Proposal and (iv) the Company Board shall have
determined in good faith, after consultation with the Company Financial
Advisor and outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, then

and its Subsidiaries to the Third Party making such Acquisition Proposal and
afford such Third Party access to the businesses, properties, assets and
personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and (B) enter into, maintain
and participate in discussions or negotiations with the Third Party making
such Acquisition Proposal regarding such Acquisition Proposal or otherwise
cooperate with or assist or participate in, or facilitate, any such
discussions or negotiations (including by entering into a customary
confidentiality agreement with such Third Party for the purpose of receiving
non-public information relating to such Third Party's business); provided,
however, that the Company (1) will not, and will not permit its Subsidiaries
or its or their Representatives to, furnish any non-public information except
pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and (2) will promptly
(but in any event within twenty-four (24) hours of provision thereof to any
Third Party) provide to Parent any material non- public information concerning
the Company or its Subsidiaries or access provided to such Third Party, which
was not previously provided to Parent. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company and its Representatives may
(x) following the receipt of an Acquisition Proposal from a Third Party, and
provided that such Acquisition Proposal shall not have been obtained in
violation of Section 6.02(a) and the Company shall have complied with the
requirements of this Section 6.02 with respect to such Acquisition Proposal
(other than immaterial violations or noncompliance), contact such Third Party
solely (other than contacts in the ordinary course of business) in order to
clarify and understand the terms and conditions of an Acquisition Proposal
made by such Third Party so as to determine whether such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal
and (y) direct any Persons to this Agreement, including the specific
provisions and restrictions of this Section 6.02. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company shall not provide any commercially sensitive non-
public information to any competitors of the Company performing services in
the translation, digital marketing services, or software localization and
testing industries in connection with the actions permitted by this Section
6.02(c), except in a manner consistent with the Company's past practices in
dealing with the disclosure of such information in the context of considering
Acquisition Proposals prior to the date of this Agreement, and subject to any
limitations placed on Parent, Merger Sub and/or their Representatives with
respect to such information in connection  

  

 ![](leomergeragreement8kex21057.jpg) 

53 with the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Company and its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives may
continue to engage in any of the activities described in this Section 6.02(c)
with respect to any Excluded Person. On the first (1st) Business Day
following the Non-Solicitation Start Date, the Company shall deliver to
Parent (x) a list identifying all Excluded Persons and (y) a copy of any
Acquisition Proposal made in writing by any Excluded Person and any other
material written terms or proposals provided to the Company by any Excluded
Person. From and after the Non-Solicitation Start Date, the Company shall as
promptly as practicable (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours)
notify Parent if any proposals or offers with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal are received from a Third Party, or any non-public information is
requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated
or continued with, the Company, any of the Company's Subsidiaries or any of
the Company's Representatives, in each case by a Third Party for the purpose
of making an Acquisition Proposal or seeking to initiate discussions or
negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal, which notification shall
include (i) a copy of the applicable written Acquisition Proposal (or, if
oral, the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal), (ii)
the identity of the Third Party making such Acquisition Proposal or
information request (unless the Company is prohibited from disclosing such
identity pursuant to a contractual obligation with such Third Party existing
as of the date hereof) and (iii) whether the Company has any intention to
provide confidential information to such person. The Company shall thereafter
keep Parent informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of (and in
any event within twenty- four (24) hours of any material developments,
discussions or negotiations regarding) any such Acquisition Proposal, and the
material terms and conditions thereof (including any change in price or form
of consideration or other material amendment thereto). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Company shall provide Parent with a copy of
documentation setting forth the material terms of the Acquisition Proposal
that is exchanged between the Third Party (or its Representatives) making
such Acquisition Proposal and the Company (or its Representatives) within
twenty-four (24) hours after the exchange thereof. Except as permitted under
Section 6.02(a), the Company agrees not to effect a Standstill
Release/Waiver, other than to the extent the Company Board or any committee
thereof determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company
Financial Advisor and outside legal counsel, that failure to provide a
Standstill Release/Waiver would be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary
duties under Applicable Law, and the Company will use its reasonable best
efforts to enforce or cause to be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by
Applicable Law each such agreement. The Company agrees that in the event any
Subsidiary or Representative is acting at the direction of the Company or one
of its Subsidiaries and such action which, if taken by the Company, would
constitute a breach by the Company of Section 6.02(b), Section 6.02(c) or
Section 6.02(e), the Company shall be deemed to be in breach of Section
6.02(b), Section 6.02(c) or Section 6.02(e), as applicable. Section 6.03
Board Recommendation.  

  

 ![](leomergeragreement8kex21058.jpg) 

54 Subject to Section 6.03(b) and Section 6.03(c), none of the Company
Board, the Special Committee or any other committee of the Company Board shall
(i) fail to make, withdraw, amend or modify, or publicly propose to withhold,
withdraw, amend or modify, in any manner adverse to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, Parent or Merger Sub, the Board
Recommendation, (ii) adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to adopt or
recommend, an Acquisition Proposal or Superior Proposal, (iii) fail to
recommend against acceptance of any Third Party tender offer or exchange offer
for the shares of Company Common Stock within ten (10) Business Days after
commencement of such offer, (iv) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to
approve or recommend, or cause or permit the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company to execute or enter into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement, (v)
fail to include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement (each of
the foregoing actions described in clauses (i) through (v) being referred to
as an "Adverse Recommendation Change"), (vi) other than as described in
clause (iii) above, fail to publicly reaffirm the Board Recommendation within
five (5) Business Days after receipt of a written request by Parent to
provide such affirmation (provided that the Company shall not be obligated to
make such reaffirmation more than once) or (vii) resolve or publicly propose
to take any action described in the foregoing clauses (i) through (vi). (i)
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior
to the Stockholder Approval, and subject to the Company's or the Company
Board's, as applicable, compliance with this Section 6.03 and Section 6.02,
the Company Board (acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee)
may, if the Company Board (acting upon the recommendation of the Special
Committee) determines in good faith (after consultation with the Company
Financial Advisor and outside legal counsel), that the failure to do so would
be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the directors under Applicable
Law, (A) make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to either (1) a
Superior Proposal received after the date hereof or (2) any material fact,
event, change, development or circumstances not known or reasonably
foreseeable by the Company Board as of the date hereof, which fact, event,
change, development or circumstances becomes known to the Company Board prior
to the Stockholder Approval (such material fact, event, change, development
or circumstance, an "Intervening Event"); provided, however, that in no event
shall the receipt, existence or terms of an Acquisition Proposal, or any
inquiry, indication of interest, proposal or offer that could reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, constitute an Intervening Event,
or (B) cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.01(h) and to authorize the Company to enter into a binding written
Agreement concerning a transaction that constitutes a Superior Proposal
(which agreement shall be entered into substantially concurrently with such
termination), subject in each case to compliance with the terms of paragraph
(ii) or (iii) below, as applicable. (ii) In the case of an Adverse
Recommendation Change sought to be made under clause (1) of Section
6.03(b)(i)(A) or termination of this Agreement  

  

 ![](leomergeragreement8kex21059.jpg) 

55 pursuant to Section 8.01(h) in response to a Superior Proposal, (x) no
Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this Section 6.03(b) may be made
and (y) no termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(h) may be
made, in either case (A) until after the third (3rd) Business Day following
written notice from the Company advising Parent that the Company Board
(acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee) intends to make an
Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.01(h) (a "Notice of Superior Proposal") and specifying the reasons
therefor, including, if applicable, the material terms and conditions of, and
the identity of the Third Party making, such Superior Proposal, and a copy of
all relevant transaction documents (it being understood and agreed that any
amendment to the financial terms or any other material term of such Superior
Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior Proposal, which shall require
a new notice period of three (3) Business Days, and compliance with this
Section 6.03(b) with respect to such new notice); (B) unless during such
three (3) Business Day period, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, to the extent requested by Parent, negotiate with Parent
in good faith to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the Guarantee, the Financing Commitment Letters and the Rollover
Agreement as would enable the Company Board (acting upon the recommendation
of the Special Committee) to maintain the Board Recommendation and not make
an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement; and (C) unless,
prior to the expiration of such three (3) Business Day period, Parent does
not make a proposal to adjust the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
Guarantee, the Financing Commitment Letters and the Rollover Agreement that
the Company Board (acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee)
determines in good faith (x) after consultation with the Company Financial
Advisor and outside legal counsel, that the failure to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change or authorize the termination of this Agreement would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law and (y) after
taking into account any adjustment or modification to the terms of this
Agreement, the Guarantee, the Financing Commitment Letters and the Rollover
Agreement proposed by Parent, that the Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal. None of the Company, the Company Board or any committee of
the Company Board shall enter into any agreement with any Third Party to
limit or prohibit the Company from giving prior notice to Parent of the
Company's intention to (x) effect an Adverse Recommendation Change or (y)
terminate this Agreement in light of a Superior Proposal.  

  

 ![](leomergeragreement8kex21060.jpg) 

56 (iii) In the case of an Intervening Event, no Adverse Recommendation
Change pursuant to this Section 6.03(b) may be made (A) until after the third
(3rd) Business Day following written notice from the Company advising Parent
that the Company Board or any committee thereof intends to take such action
and specifying the facts underlying the determination by the Company Board
(acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee) that an Intervening
Event has occurred, and the facts underlying the reason for the Adverse
Recommendation Change, in reasonable detail (a "Notice of Intervening
Event"); (B) unless during such three (3) Business Day period, the Company
shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, to the extent requested by
Parent, negotiate with Parent in good faith to enable Parent to amend this
Agreement, the Guarantee, the Financing Commitment Letters and the Rollover
Agreement in such a manner that obviates the need for an Adverse
Recommendation Change; and (C) unless, by the expiration of such three (3)
Business Day period, the Company Board (acting upon the recommendation of the
Special Committee) determines in good faith, taking into consideration any
amendments to this Agreement, the Guarantee, the Financing Commitment Letters
and the Rollover Agreement proposed by Parent (after consultation with the
Company Financial Advisor and outside legal counsel), that the failure to
effect an Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with the
fiduciary duties of the directors under Applicable Law. The provisions of
this Section 6.03(b)(iii) shall also apply to any material change to the
facts and circumstances relating to an Intervening Event, in which case such
change shall require a new Notice of Intervening Event and the Company shall
be required to comply again with the provisions of this Section 6.03(b)(iii),
except that any reference to three (3) Business Days shall instead be to two
(2) Business Days. Nothing contained in Section 6.02 or this Section 6.03 or
elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and
disclosing a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to
an Acquisition Proposal, or (ii) making any disclosure to the Company's
stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the directors (acting upon the
recommendation of the Special Committee), after consultation with outside
legal counsel, the failure to do so would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board under Applicable
Law or any disclosure requirements under Applicable Law; provided, however,
that that the Company and the Company Board may not effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change, except to the extent permitted by Section 6.03(b). In
addition, it is understood and agreed  

  

 ![](leomergeragreement8kex21061.jpg) 

57 that, for purposes of this Agreement, a factually accurate public
statement by the Company that describes the Company's receipt of an
Acquisition Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect
thereto, or any "stop, look and listen" communication by the Company Board
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, or any similar communication
to the stockholders of the Company, shall not constitute an Adverse
Recommendation Change or a proposal by the Company Board to withdraw or
modify its recommendation of this Agreement, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Section 6.04 Approval of Merger
As promptly as reasonably practicable following the clearance of the Proxy
Statement by the SEC, the Company shall, in accordance with Applicable Law and
the Company's governing documents, duly set a record date for, call, give
notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of the Company's stockholders
(including any adjournments and postponements thereof, the "Stockholder
Meeting") for the purpose of considering and taking action upon the matters
requiring Stockholder Approval (with the record date and meeting date set in
consultation with Parent). Once established, the Company shall not change the
record date for the Stockholder Meeting without the prior written consent of
Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
nothing will prevent the Company from postponing or adjourning the
Stockholder Meeting if (i) there are holders of an insufficient number of
shares of Company Common Stock present or represented by proxy at the
Stockholder Meeting to constitute a quorum at the Stockholder Meeting or (ii)
the Company is required to postpone or adjourn the Stockholder Meeting by
Applicable Law, Order or a request from the SEC or its staff. Unless the
Company Board (acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee) has
withdrawn the Company Recommendation in compliance with Section 6.03, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the definitive Proxy
Statement to be mailed to the Company's stockholders and to solicit from
stockholders of the Company proxies in favor of the adoption and approval of
this Agreement at the Stockholder Meeting and shall take all other action
necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of the holders of Shares
required by Applicable Law to effect the Merger. In furtherance and not in
limitation of this Section 6.04(a), the Company agrees that the definitive
Proxy Statement may be mailed to the Company's stockholders, setting forth
the record date and meeting date for the Stockholder Meeting, prior to the
Non- Solicitation Start Date, unless the timing of such mailing would, on the
advice of outside legal counsel or the SEC, reasonably be expected to violate
Applicable Law, the Company Board's fiduciary duties, or SEC guidance. As
promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution of this Agreement (and
in any event within fifteen (15) Business Days of the date of this
Agreement), the Company shall prepare a proxy/information statement in
preliminary form for the Stockholder Meeting (together with any amendments
thereof or supplements thereto and any other required proxy materials, the
"Proxy Statement") seeking stockholder approval of the matters requiring
Stockholder Approval and file it with the SEC. Subject to Section 6.03 and
Article 8, the Company Board shall cause the Board  

  

 ![](leomergeragreement8kex21062.jpg) 

58 Recommendation to be included in the Proxy Statement. The Company shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably
practicable to any comments received from the SEC or its staff concerning the
Proxy Statement, and to resolve any such comments, and shall, subject to
Section 6.04(a), cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to its stockholders
as promptly as reasonably practicable after the resolution of any such
comments. The Company shall notify Parent promptly upon the receipt of any
comments from the SEC or its staff or any other government officials and of
any request by the SEC or its staff or any other government officials for
amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement and shall supply Parent with
copies of all correspondence between it or any of its Representatives, on the
one hand, and the SEC, or its staff or any other government officials, on the
other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall reasonably
cooperate with the Company in connection with the preparation and filing of
the Proxy Statement, including as promptly as practicable furnishing to the
Company in writing upon request any and all information relating to it as may
be required to be set forth in the Proxy Statement under Applicable Law.
Parent shall ensure that such information supplied by it in writing for
inclusion in the Proxy Statement will not, on the date it is first mailed to
stockholders of the Company and at the time of the Stockholder Meeting or
filed with the SEC (as applicable), contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not false or misleading.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated above, prior to filing or
mailing the Proxy Statement or any other required filings (any amendment or
supplement thereto), or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect
thereto, the Company shall provide Parent and its counsel with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such document or response and shall
consider Parent's comments in good faith. The Company shall ensure that the
Proxy Statement will not, on the date it is first mailed to stockholders of
the Company and at the time of the Stockholder Meeting, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not false or misleading
and (ii) will comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company
assumes no responsibility with respect to information supplied in writing by
or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Proxy Statement. If, at any time prior to the Effective
Time, any information relating to the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, or any
of their respective Subsidiaries, officers or directors, should be discovered
by Parent or the Company that should be set forth in an amendment to the
Proxy Statement so that such document would not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not
misleading, then the party hereto that discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other party hereto and, to the extent required by
Applicable Law, the Company shall file as promptly as practicable with the
SEC and disseminate to the holders of Company Common Stock an appropriate
amendment or supplement containing such information.  

  

 ![](leomergeragreement8kex21063.jpg) 

59 Section 6.05 Access to Information. Subject to Applicable Law, Section
6.12(c), Section 6.18 and applicable contractual restrictions, upon reasonable
notice, the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford
Parent's officers and Parent's other authorized Representatives reasonable
access, during normal business hours throughout the period prior to the
Effective Time, to its properties, books, Contracts, personnel, Tax Returns,
work papers, and records as Parent may reasonably request to review. The
foregoing shall not require the Company (a) to provide access to or otherwise
make available or furnish any books, Contracts, work papers, or records
governed by a confidentiality, non-disclosure or other similar agreement in
effect as of the date hereof, (b) to provide access to or otherwise make
available or furnish any information if and to the extent that the provision
of such information would, in the good faith judgment of the Company based on
the advice of counsel, reasonably be expected to result in the loss of any
attorney-client, work product or other legal privilege or protection (it
being agreed that, (i) in the case of clauses (a) and (b), the Company shall
give notice to Parent of the fact that it is withholding such information or
documents and thereafter the Company and Parent shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to cause such information to be provided in a manner
that would not reasonably be expected to violate such restriction or waive the
applicable privilege or protection and (ii) in the cause of clause (a), the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any consents of
third parties that are necessary to permit such access), (c) to provide
access to or otherwise make available any information relating to the process
conducted by the Company that led to the execution of this Agreement, or (d)
to provide access to or otherwise make available or furnish any information if
and to the extent that the provision of such information would, in the good
faith judgment of the Company based on the advice of counsel, reasonably be
expected to violate any Applicable Law. All requests for information made
pursuant to this Section 6.05 shall be directed to the executive officer or
other Person designated by the Company. All such information shall be deemed
Evaluation Material (as such term is defined in the Confidentiality Agreement)
and be governed by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent and Merger Sub shall
not, and shall cause their respective Representatives not to, contact any
customer or supplier of the Company in connection with the Merger or any of
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the Company's
prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), and Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that
any such contact shall be arranged by and with a Representative of the
Company participating. Section 6.06 Notice of Certain Events. From the date
of this Agreement until the Effective Time, each of the Company and Parent
will give prompt notice to the other (and will subsequently keep the other
informed on a current basis of any material developments related to such
notice) of any inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty or
breach of covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement that could
reasonably be expected to cause, in the case of Parent and Merger Sub, any of
the conditions set forth in Section 7.01 or Section 7.03 not to be satisfied,
and, in the case of the Company, any of the conditions set forth in Section
7.01 or Section 7.02 not to be satisfied and (b) any written notice or other
communication received by such party or any of its Subsidiaries from any
Person alleging that the consent of such party is or may be required in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, the delivery of notice given by any party pursuant to this
Section 6.06 shall not cure any breach of any of the representations,
warranties, covenants, obligations or  

  

 ![](leomergeragreement8kex21064.jpg) 

60 conditions contained in this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the
remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice. Section
6.07 Employee Benefit Plan Matters. With respect to employees of the Company
or its Subsidiaries immediately before the Effective Time who continue
employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of Parent
or the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective Time
("Continuing Employees"), Parent shall cause the service of each such
Continuing Employee to be recognized for purposes of eligibility to
participate, levels of benefits (but not for benefit accruals under any
defined benefit pension plan) and vesting under each compensation,
retirement, vacation, fringe or other welfare benefit plan, program or
arrangement of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Subsidiaries, but not including any defined benefit pension, nonqualified
deferred compensation, post-termination welfare or equity-based compensation
plans, programs, agreements or arrangements in which any Continuing Employee
is or becomes eligible to participate in the year in which the Effective Time
occurs (collectively, the "Parent Benefit Plans"), but solely to the extent
service was credited to such employee for such purposes under a comparable
Company Employee Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date and to the extent
such credit would not result in a duplication of benefits or compensation.
For a period of not less than twelve (12) months after the Closing Date (or,
if earlier, until the termination of employment of the relevant employee),
Parent shall provide or cause to be provided each Continuing Employee with
(i) (A) base salary or base hourly rate and (B) cash incentive compensation
opportunities, in each case in an amount at least equal to the same level
that was provided to each such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Closing Date, and (ii) additional cash or equity incentives comparable to
each such Continuing Employee's level of equity compensation prior to the
Closing Date, and (iii) employee benefits (other than equity-based, defined
benefit pension, post-termination welfare or nonqualified deferred
compensation benefits, except to the extent provided for in any agreements or
arrangements existing as of the date hereof) that are substantially similar
in the aggregate to those provided to each such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Closing Date under the Company Employee Plans set
forth in Section 4.16 of the Company Disclosure Schedule. In addition and
notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent acknowledges that the Surviving
Corporation shall assume liability for the obligations set forth on Schedule
6.07(b), including the Company's Amended and Restated Change of Control Plan
and the other Company employee arrangements and benefits enumerated thereon
(which Contracts listed thereon are assumed by operation of Applicable Law),
and shall honor and comply with the requirements of such obligations in
accordance with their applicable terms. With respect to each Parent Benefit
Plan that is a health benefit plan in which any Continuing Employee is or
becomes eligible to participate in the plan year in which the Effective Time
occurs, Parent shall use or cause the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary
of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause each such Parent Benefit Plan to (i) waive all limitations as to pre-  

  

 ![](leomergeragreement8kex21065.jpg) 

61 existing conditions, waiting periods, required physical examinations and
exclusions with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable
under such Parent Benefit Plan for such Continuing Employees and their
eligible dependents to the same extent that such pre-existing conditions,
waiting periods, required physical examinations and exclusions would not have
applied or would have been waived under the corresponding Company Employee
Plan in which such Continuing Employee was a participant immediately prior to
his commencement of participation in such Parent Benefit Plan; provided,
however, that for purposes of clarity, to the extent such benefit coverage
includes eligibility conditions based on periods of employment, Section
6.07(a) shall control; and (ii) provide each Continuing Employee and their
eligible dependents with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid in
the calendar year that, and prior to the date that, such Continuing Employee
commences participation in such Parent Benefit Plan in satisfying any
applicable co-payment or deductible requirements under such Parent Benefit
Plan for the applicable calendar year, to the extent that such expenses were
recognized for such purposes under the comparable Company Employee Plan.
Nothing in this Section 6.07 shall (i) be deemed to establish, amend or
modify any Parent Benefit Plan or any other benefit or compensation plan,
program, agreement, Contract, policy or arrangement or limit the ability of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates to amend, modify
or terminate any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement, Contract,
policy or arrangement at any time, (ii) confer upon any Person not a party to
this Agreement any rights or remedies of any nature or kind whatsoever,
including any third-party beneficiary rights, or any right to employment or
continued employment or any term or condition of employment, or (iii)
restrict the ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Affiliates to terminate the employment of any Person (including any
Continuing Employee) at any time and for any or no reason. Section 6.08
State Takeover Laws. If any "control share acquisition," "fair price,"
"moratorium" or other anti-takeover Applicable Law becomes or is deemed to be
applicable to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, then each of the Company, Parent,
Merger Sub, as applicable, and their respective Board of Directors shall
grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to
render such anti-takeover Applicable Law inapplicable to the foregoing.
Section 6.09 Obligations of Merger Sub. Parent shall cause Merger Sub to
perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby on the terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement. Section 6.10 Voting of Shares. Parent shall vote any
shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by it or any of its
Subsidiaries in favor of adoption of this Agreement at the Stockholder
Meeting, and will vote or cause to be voted the shares of Merger Sub held by
it or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, in favor of adoption of
this Agreement.

62 Section 6.11 Director and Officer Liability. For six (6) years after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
maintain officers' and directors' liability insurance in respect of acts or
omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time covering each such person
currently covered by the Company's officers' and directors' liability
insurance policy on terms with respect to coverage and amount no less
favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof; provided,
however, that in satisfying its obligation under this Section 6.11(a),
neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to pay annual
premiums in excess of 300% of the amount per annum the Company paid in its
last full fiscal year prior to the date hereof (the "Current Premium") and if
such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed 300% of the Current
Premium, then the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained policies
of insurance that, in the Surviving Corporation's good faith judgment,
provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to 300% of
the Current Premium. The provisions of the immediately preceding sentence
shall be deemed to have been satisfied if prepaid "tail" or "runoff" policies
have been obtained by the Company prior to the Effective Time, which policies
provide such directors and officers with coverage for an aggregate period of
six (6) years with respect to claims arising from facts or events that
occurred on or before the Effective Time, including, in respect of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that the
amount paid for such prepaid policies does not exceed 300% of the Current
Premium. If such prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to) maintain such policies in full force and effect for their full
term, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder. From and after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to): (i) indemnify and hold harmless each individual
who at the Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the Effective Time was,
a director or officer of the Company or of a Subsidiary of the Company (each,
an "Indemnified Party") for any and all costs and expenses (including fees
and expenses of legal counsel, which shall be advanced as they are incurred;
provided, that the Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to such
advancement unless and until such Indemnified Party has made an undertaking
to repay such expenses if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified
Party was not entitled to indemnification under this Section 6.11),
judgments, fines, penalties or liabilities (including amounts paid in
settlement or compromise) imposed upon or reasonably incurred by such
Indemnified Party in connection with or arising out of any action, suit or
other proceeding (whether civil or criminal, and including any proceeding
before any regulatory, administrative or legislative body or agency) in which
such Indemnified Party may be involved or with which he or she may be
threatened (regardless of whether as a named party or as a participant other
than as a named party, including as a witness) (an "Indemnified Party
Proceeding") (A) by reason of such Indemnified Party's being or having been
such director or officer of the Company or such Subsidiary or an employee or
agent of the Company or otherwise in connection with any action taken or not
taken at the request of the Company or such Subsidiary (B) arising out of
such Indemnified Party's service in connection with any other corporation or
organization for which he or she serves or has  

  

 ![](leomergeragreement8kex21067.jpg) 

63 served as a director, officer, employee, agent, trustee or fiduciary at
the request of the Company (including in any capacity with respect to any
employee benefit plan), in each of (A) or (B), whether or not the Indemnified
Party continues in such position at the time such Indemnified Party
Proceeding is brought or threatened and at, or at any time prior to, the
Effective Time (including any Indemnified Party Proceeding relating in whole
or in part to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or relating to
the enforcement of this provision or any other indemnification or advancement
right of any Indemnified Party subject to the undertaking in this Section
6.11 to repay advanced amounts), to the fullest extent permitted under
Applicable Law; and (ii) fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of
the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to: (x) each indemnification
agreement in effect between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any
Indemnified Party as of the date hereof, the form of which has been Made
Available to Parent; and (y) any indemnification provision (including
advancement of expenses subject to the undertaking in this Section 6.11 to
repay advanced amounts) and any exculpation provision set forth in the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or its Subsidiary, as
applicable, as in effect on the date hereof. Parent shall pay all expenses,
including attorneys' fees, that may be incurred by Indemnified Parties in
connection with their enforcement of their rights provided under this Section
6.11. Parent's and the Surviving Corporation's obligations under the
foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) shall continue in full force and effect for a
period of six (6) years from the Effective Time; provided, however, that all
rights to indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses under this
Section 6.11 in respect of any claim asserted or made within such period shall
continue until the final disposition of such claim. If Parent or the Surviving
Corporation fails to comply with its obligations in this Section 6.11(b) and
an Indemnified Party commences a suit which results in a final determination
that the Parent or the Surviving Corporation failed to comply with such
obligation, Parent shall pay such Indemnified Party its costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorney's fees and disbursements) in connection with
such suit, together with interest thereon at the rate of interest per annum
equal to the prime lending rate as published in the Wall Street Journal in
effect on the date such payment was required to be made through the date of
payment. If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 6.11. The provisions of this Section 6.11 are (i)
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his or her representatives and (ii)
in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such individual may have under any
certificate of incorporation or bylaws, by contract or otherwise. The
obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.11
shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect
the rights of any Indemnified Party to whom this Section 6.11 applies unless
(x) such termination or modification is required by Applicable Law or  

  

 ![](leomergeragreement8kex21068.jpg) 

64 (y) the affected Indemnified Party shall have consented in writing to such
termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified
Parties to whom this Section 6.11 applies shall be third party beneficiaries
of this Section 6.11; provided, however, that such rights of the Indemnified
Parties as third-party beneficiaries under this Section 6.11 shall not arise
unless and until the Merger is consummated). Section 6.12 Reasonable Best
Efforts. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and without
limiting the generality of anything contained in this Section 6.12, the
Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other and use (and shall cause
their respective Subsidiaries to use) their reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, and to
assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable on its part under this Agreement and Applicable
Law to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as
reasonably practicable, including preparing and filing as promptly as
reasonably practicable all documentation to effect all necessary notices,
reports and other filings and to obtain as promptly as practicable all
consents, registrations, approvals, permits and authorizations necessary or
advisable to be obtained from any Governmental Authority, including under the
Antitrust Laws, in order to consummate the Merger and to fully carry out the
purposes of this Agreement. The Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to take all actions reasonably requested by Parent to obtain waivers
or consents from any Significant Customers, if required under any Contracts
with Significant Customers, and any Third Parties whose waiver or consent is
required under any Material Contract. In furtherance and not in limitation of
the foregoing, each of the Company and Parent (and their respective
Affiliates, if applicable) shall: (i) promptly, but in no event later than
five (5) Business Days after the date hereof, file any and all notices,
reports and other documents required to be filed by such party under the HSR
Act with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and shall use reasonable best efforts promptly to cause the
expiration or termination of any applicable waiting periods under the HSR
Act; and (ii) promptly make all filings, and use reasonable best efforts to
timely obtain all consents, permits, authorizations, waivers, clearances and
approvals, and to cause the expiration or termination of any applicable
waiting periods, as may be required under any other applicable Antitrust Laws
(to the extent required); (iii) as promptly as reasonably practicable provide
such information as may reasonably be requested by the U.S. Department of
Justice (the "DOJ") or the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") under the HSR
Act or by any other Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger and
other transactions contemplated hereby; (iv) use reasonable best efforts to
cause to be taken, on a timely basis, all other actions necessary or
appropriate for the purpose of consummating and effectuating the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (v) promptly take,
and cause its Affiliates to take, all reasonable actions and steps requested
or required by any Governmental Authority as a condition to granting any
consent, permit, authorization, waiver, clearance and approvals, and to cause
the prompt expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period and to
resolve such objections, if any, of the FTC and the DOJ, or other
Governmental Authorities of any other  

  

 ![](leomergeragreement8kex21069.jpg) 

65 jurisdiction for which consents, permits, authorizations, waivers,
clearances, approvals and expirations or terminations of waiting periods are
required with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; provided, that the Company and its Subsidiaries and Parent
and its Affiliates will only be required to take or commit to take any such
action, or agree to any such condition or restriction, if such action,
commitment, agreement, condition or restriction is binding on the Company or
its Subsidiaries or on Parent or its Affiliates, only in the event the
Closing occurs; provided, further, that, subject to the obligations of Parent
set forth in this Section 6.12(d) - (f), the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall only be permitted to take or commit to take any such action, or agree
to any such condition or restriction, with the prior written consent of
Parent. Parent shall pay all filing fees under the HSR Act. Without limiting
the generality of anything contained in this Section 6.12 each party hereto
shall: (i) give the other parties prompt notice of the making or commencement
of any request, inquiry, investigation, action or Proceeding by or before any
Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) keep the other parties reasonably
informed as to the status of any such request, inquiry, investigation, action
or Proceeding; (iii) promptly inform the other parties of any substantive
communication to or from the FTC, DOJ or any other Governmental Authority to
the extent regarding the Merger or other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or regarding any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or
Proceeding, and provide a copy of all substantive written communications, and
(iv) pull and re-file any notice under the HSR Act only if the other parties
agree. Subject to Applicable Law, in advance and to the extent practicable,
each of Parent or Company, as the case may be, will consult the other on all
the information relating to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and
any of their respective Subsidiaries that appear in any filing made with, or
substantive written materials submitted to, any third party and/or any
Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Proxy Statement)
and shall incorporate all comments reasonably proposed by Parent or the
Company, as the case may be. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, Parent shall be entitled to direct and control (i) all
substantive communications, strategy and defense of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) all substantive negotiations and
settlement discussions, if necessary, with any Governmental Authority;
provided, however, that Parent shall keep the Company informed of Parent's
contacts with any Governmental Authority, allow the Company's lawyers to
review and comment on substantive submissions and presentations, and allow
the Company's lawyers to attend any substantive meetings and participate in
any substantive telephone conference, without limitation; and provided,
further, that if review of any information would be material in connection
with any second request (or similar process), such information shall be
provided solely to those individuals acting as outside antitrust counsel for
the other parties; provided, that such counsel shall not disclose such
information to such other parties and shall enter into a joint defense
agreement with the providing party. In furtherance and not in limitation of
the foregoing, Parent agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to avoid,
eliminate or resolve each and every impediment and  

  

 ![](leomergeragreement8kex21070.jpg) 

66 obtain all clearances, consents, approvals and waivers under Antitrust
Laws that may be required by any Governmental Authority, so as to enable the
parties to consummate the Merger as soon as reasonably practicable (and in
any event no later than three (3) Business Days prior to the End Date),
including (i) committing to or effecting, by consent decree, hold separate
orders, trust, or otherwise, the sale, license, transfer, assignment or other
disposition of assets or businesses of Parent or Company or their respective
Subsidiaries, (ii) terminating, relinquishing, modifying, transferring,
assigning, restructuring, or waiving existing agreements, collaborations,
relationships, ventures, contractual rights, obligations or other
arrangements of Parent or Company or their respective Subsidiaries and (iii)
creating or consenting to create any relationships, ventures, contractual
rights, obligations, behavioral undertakings or other arrangements of Parent
or Company or their respective Subsidiaries and, in each case, to enter, or
offer to enter, into agreements and stipulate to the entry of an order or
decree or file appropriate applications with any Governmental Authority in
connection with any of the foregoing and in the case of actions by or with
respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries or its or their businesses or
assets, by consenting to such action by the Company (each a "Divestiture
Action"). Subject to Parent's obligations in this Section 6.12 Parent shall
have the sole and exclusive right to propose, negotiate, offer to commit and
effect, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, any and all
Divestiture Actions or otherwise to offer to take or offer to commit (and if
such offer is accepted, commit to and effect) to take any Divestiture Action
as may be required to resolve any Governmental Authority's objections to the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided,
however, that Parent shall consider in good faith the views of the Company
and its counsel in connection therewith. In the event that any litigation or
other administrative or judicial action or Proceeding is commenced
challenging the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and such litigation, action or Proceeding seeks, or would
reasonably be expected to seek, to prevent the consummation of the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub
shall take any and all action to resolve any such litigation, action or
Proceeding and each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate
with each other and use its respective reasonable best efforts to contest any
such litigation, action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed
or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits,
prevents or restricts consummation of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall, nor
shall they permit their respective Subsidiaries to, acquire or agree to
acquire any rights, assets, business, Person or division thereof (through
acquisition, license, joint venture, collaboration or otherwise), if such
acquisition, would reasonably be expected to increase the risk of not
obtaining any applicable clearance, consent, approval or waiver under
Antitrust Laws with respect to the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Section 6.13 Stockholder Litigation. The
Company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within
two (2) Business Days) notify Parent in writing  

  

 ![](leomergeragreement8kex21071.jpg) 

67 of, and shall give Parent the opportunity to review and timely comment on
all filings and responses to be made by the Company in connection with (which
such comments the Company will in good faith take into account), and
participate and consult in the defense and settlement of, any Stockholder
Litigation, and no such settlement, or other compromise or arrangement, or
any Stockholder Litigation shall be agreed to without Parent's prior written
consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to the status
of any Stockholder Litigation. Without otherwise limiting the Indemnified
Party's rights with regard to the right to counsel, following the Effective
Time, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to continue to retain Goodwin
Procter LLP or such other counsel selected by such Indemnified Party prior to
the Effective Time to defend any Stockholder Litigation. Section 6.14 Public
Announcements. Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before
issuing any press release or making any other public statement, or scheduling
a press conference or conference call with investors or analysts, with respect
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
shall not issue any such press release or make any such other public
statement without the consent of the other party, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, except as such release or announcement may be required
by Applicable Law or any listing agreement with or rule of any national
securities exchange or association upon which the securities of the Company
or Parent, as applicable, are listed, in which case the party required to
make the release or announcement shall, to the extent practicable, consult
with the other party about, and allow the other party reasonable time (taking
into account the circumstances) to comment on, such release or announcement in
advance of such issuance, and the party will consider such comments in good
faith; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company
shall not be required to consult with Parent before issuing any press release
or making any other public statement with respect to an Adverse
Recommendation Change effected in accordance with Section 6.03 or with respect
to its receipt and consideration of any Acquisition Proposal. The parties
hereto agree that the initial press release to be issued with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby following execution of this Agreement shall
be substantially in the form heretofore agreed to by Parent and the Company.
Section 6.15 Further Assurances. At and after the Effective Time, the officers
and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any deeds,
bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and
on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and things to vest,
perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any
and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights,
properties or assets of the Company acquired or to be acquired by the
Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.
Section 6.16 Section 16 Matters. Parent and the Company agree that, in order
to most effectively compensate and retain those officers and directors of the
Company who are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the
Exchange Act in connection with the Merger, prior to and after the Effective
Time, it is desirable that such Persons not be subject to a risk of liability
under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by
Applicable Law in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and, for that  

  

 ![](leomergeragreement8kex21072.jpg) 

68 compensatory and retentive purpose, agree to the provisions of this
Section 6.16. Promptly after the date hereof, the Company shall take all such
steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of shares of Company
Common Stock resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law. Section 6.17 Financing. Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, or do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange,
obtain and consummate the Financing on and in accordance with the terms and
conditions (including agreeing to any requested changes to the commitments
thereunder in accordance with any flex provisions therein) described in the
Financing Commitment Letters, and the contribution contemplated by the
Rollover Agreement pursuant to the terms thereof, and, subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, shall not permit any amendment or
modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision under, the
Financing Commitment Letters or the Rollover Agreement if such amendment,
modification or waiver (A) with respect to the Financing Commitment Letters,
reduces (or could have the effect of reducing) the aggregate amount of the
Financing (including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original
issue discount unless (x) the Debt Financing or the Equity Financing is
increased by a corresponding amount or the Debt Financing is otherwise made
available to fund such fees or original issue discount and (y) the
representation and warranty set forth in Section 5.10 shall be true and
correct as of the date of such amendment, modification or waiver after giving
effect thereto), or (B) imposes new or additional conditions or otherwise
expands, amends or modifies any of the conditions to the Financing or the
contribution contemplated by the Rollover Agreement, in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to (x) delay or prevent or make less likely the
funding of the Financing or the contribution contemplated by the Rollover
Agreement (or satisfaction of the conditions to the Financing or the
contribution contemplated by the Rollover Agreement) on the Closing Date or
(y) adversely impact the ability of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, as
applicable, to enforce its rights against the Debt Financing sources pursuant
to the Financing Commitment Letters or the Rollover Agreement, in each of
clauses (x) and (y) in any material respect (provided, that, subject to
compliance with the other provisions of this Section 6.17(a), Parent and
Merger Sub may amend the Debt Commitment Letter to add additional lenders,
arrangers, bookrunners and agents). Parent shall promptly deliver to the
Company copies of any amendment, modification or waiver to any Financing
Commitment Letter or the Rollover Agreement. References to "Financing" shall
include the financing contemplated by the Financing Commitment Letters as
permitted to be amended, modified or waived by this Section 6.17(a),
references to "Debt Financing" shall include the debt financing contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letter as permitted to be amended, modified or waived
by this Section 6.17(a), references to the "Rollover Investment" shall
include the financing contemplated by the Rollover Agreement as permitted to
be amended, modified or waived by this Section 6.17(a) and references to
"Debt Commitment Letter" shall include such documents as permitted to be

 ![](leomergeragreement8kex21073.jpg) 

69 Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts (A) to maintain, or cause to be maintained, in effect and effect the
Financing Commitment Letters and the Rollover Agreement on the terms and
conditions set forth therein, (B) to promptly negotiate and enter into
definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Commitment Letter on the terms
and conditions (including agreeing to any requested changes to the
commitments thereunder in accordance with any flex provisions therein)
contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (or on terms no less favorable in the
aggregate to Parent or Merger Sub than the terms and conditions (including
flex provisions) in the Debt Commitment Letter, subject in all respects to
any restrictions on amendments or modifications set forth in by this Section
6.17), (C) to satisfy, or cause to be satisfied, on a timely basis all
conditions to funding in the Debt Commitment Letter and such definitive
agreements thereto and in the Equity Commitment Letter and the Rollover
Agreement that it is required to satisfy and to consummate the Financing and
make the Rollover Investment at or prior to the Closing, including using its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the lenders and the other persons
committing to fund the Financing and make the Rollover Investment, to fund
the Financing and make the Rollover Investment at the Closing on the terms
and conditions set forth therein, (D) to promptly, diligently and fully
enforce its rights under the Financing Commitment Letters and Rollover
Agreement and (E) to comply with its, or cause their Affiliates to comply
with their, obligations under the Financing Commitment Letters and the
Rollover Agreement. Parent shall keep the Company fully informed, in all
reasonable detail, of the status of its efforts to arrange and consummate the
Debt Financing and of all material developments in respect thereof. Parent
shall provide the Company, upon request, with copies of any executed material
definitive documents in respect of the Debt Financing and such other
information and documentation regarding the Debt Financing and any
syndication efforts as shall be reasonably necessary to allow the Company to
monitor the progress of such financing activities. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub shall give the Company
prompt notice (x) of any actual or threatened breach or default by any party
to any of the Financing Commitment Letters, Rollover Agreement, or definitive
agreements related to the Financing of which Parent or Merger Sub become
aware, (y) of the receipt of (A) any written notice or (B) other written
communication, in each case from any Financing source with respect to any (1)
actual or threatened breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party
to any of the Financing Commitment Letters, Rollover Agreement or definitive
agreements related to the Financing of any provisions of the Financing
Commitment Letters, Rollover Agreement or definitive agreements related to
the Financing or (2) material dispute or disagreement between or among any
parties to any of the Financing Commitment Letters, Rollover Agreement or
definitive agreements related to the Financing with respect to the obligation
to fund the Financing or the amount of the Financing to be funded at Closing,
and (z) if at any time for any reason Parent or Merger Sub believes in good
faith that it will not be able to obtain the Financing or the Rollover
Investment on the terms and conditions, in the amount, in the manner or from
the sources contemplated by any of the Financing Commitment Letters, the
Rollover Agreement or definitive agreements related to the Financing. As soon
as reasonably practicable, but in any event within two (2) Business Days of
the date the Company delivers to Parent or Merger Sub a written request,
Parent and Merger Sub shall provide any information reasonably requested by  

  

 ![](leomergeragreement8kex21074.jpg) 

70 the Company relating to any circumstance referred to in clause (x), (y) or
(z) of the immediately preceding sentence or the status of the Debt
Financing. Upon the occurrence of any circumstance referred to in clause (x),
(y) or (z) of the second preceding sentence or if any portion of the Debt
Financing or Rollover Investment otherwise becomes unavailable, and such
portion is reasonably required to fund the Aggregate Merger Consideration and
all fees, expenses and other amounts contemplated to be paid by Parent,
Merger Sub, their Affiliates or the Surviving Corporation pursuant to this
Agreement on the Closing Date, Parent and Merger Sub shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to arrange and obtain in replacement thereof
alternative financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement with terms and conditions (including structure, covenants and
pricing) not less favorable, taken as a whole, to Parent and Merger Sub (or
their Affiliates) than the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter or the Rollover Agreement, as applicable, (provided that no
alternative financing may contain any term that would not be permitted
pursuant to Section 6.17(a) as an amendment to the Financing Commitment
Letters) as promptly as reasonably practicable following the occurrence of
such event. Parent shall deliver to the Company true and complete copies of
all executed agreements, arrangements or understandings (including any side
letters and fee letters) (subject to redactions consistent with Section 5.08)

and its Subsidiaries), including, but not limited to using commercially
reasonable efforts to, (i) upon reasonable notice, assist in preparation for

prospective lenders), (iii) furnish Parent with the historical financial
statements of the Company identified in paragraph 5(1) and (2) of Exhibit D of
the Debt Commitment Letter as in effect on the date hereof (subject to the

Subsidiaries or its Representatives otherwise be required to provide pro
forma financial statements or pro forma adjustments in connection with the
Debt Financing, (iv) provide Parent and Merger Sub with information
reasonably necessary to complete customary perfection certificates and other

and its Subsidiaries to the extent required on or prior to the Closing Date
by the Debt Commitment Letter as in effect on the date hereof, and (vi) take
reasonable corporate actions, subject to and only effective upon the
occurrence of the Closing, reasonably necessary to permit the consummation of
the Debt Financing; provided, that the Company shall not be required to
provide, or cause its Subsidiaries to provide, cooperation under this Section
6.17 that: (A) unreasonably interferes with the ongoing business of the
Company or its Subsidiaries; (B) causes any covenant, representation or

Subsidiaries is a party; (D) requires the Company or its Subsidiaries to
incur any liability (including, without limitation, any commitment fees) in
connection with the Debt Financing prior to the Closing; (E) requires the
Company and its Subsidiaries or their respective directors, officers, managers
or employees to execute, deliver or enter into, or perform any agreement,
document, certificate or instrument with respect to the Debt Financing and
the directors and managers of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be
required to adopt resolutions approving the agreements, documents and
instruments pursuant to which the Debt Financing is obtained, or (F) requires
the Company or its Subsidiaries to provide any legal opinion or other opinion
of counsel, or any other information that would, in its good faith opinion,
result in a violation of applicable law or loss of attorney-client privilege);
provided that, in such case, the Company will promptly inform Parent that
information is being withheld pursuant to this clause (F). So long as
requested by Parent at least ten (10) days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish Parent and
the Merger Sub promptly, and in any event at least two (2) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, all documentation and other information with
respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries that is required by regulatory
authorities under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering
rules and regulations,  

  

 ![](leomergeragreement8kex21076.jpg) 

72 including, without limitation, the PATRIOT Act. In no event shall the
Company be in breach of this Agreement because of the failure to deliver any
financial or other information that is not currently readily available to the
Company and its Subsidiaries on the date hereof or is not otherwise prepared
in the ordinary course of business of the Company and its Subsidiaries at the
time requested by Parent (other than the Required Financial Information) or
for the failure to obtain review of any financial or other information by its
accountants (other than the Required Financial Information). In no event
shall the Company or its Subsidiaries be required to pay any commitment or
other fee or incur any liability (including due to any act or omission by the
Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates or
Representatives) or expense (including legal and accounting expenses) in
connection with assisting Parent and Merger Sub in arranging the Debt
Financing or as a result of any information provided by the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives in
connection with the Debt Financing. On or prior to the Closing Date, the
Company will deliver to Parent a customary payoff letter executed by the
lenders of the Credit Facility (or the administrative agent on behalf of such
lenders), which letter will set forth (a) the total amount required to be
paid at the Effective Time to satisfy in full the repayment of all
Indebtedness outstanding under the Credit Facility at such time (the "Payoff
Amount"), (b) the agent's obligation to release all liens and other security
securing the Credit Facility in due course and at Parent's or its
Subsidiaries' expense after receiving the Payoff Amount, and (c) wire
transfer instructions for paying the Payoff Amount. For the avoidance of
doubt, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the provisions contained
in this Section 6.17 represent the sole obligation of the Company, its
Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates and Representatives with respect
to cooperation in connection with the Debt Financing. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, the condition precedent set forth in Section
7.02(b), as it applies to the Company's obligations under this Section
6.17(c), shall be deemed satisfied unless the Debt Financing has not been
obtained primarily as a result of the Company's breach of its obligations
under this Section 6.17(c), which breach is a consequence of an act or failure
to act by the Company with the actual knowledge that the taking of such action
or failure to take such action would cause such breach. The Company hereby
consents to the use of its and its Subsidiaries' trademarks, service marks or
logos in connection with the Debt Financing; provided, that such trademarks,
service marks or logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to or
reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective intellectual property rights. Parent shall promptly,
upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable and
documented attorneys' and accountants' fees) incurred by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives in connection with the
cooperation required by or requested in accordance with this Section 6.17 or
otherwise requested by Parent, Merger Sub or their Representatives in
connection with the Debt Financing. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless
the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates and
Representatives (collectively, the "Financing  

  

 ![](leomergeragreement8kex21077.jpg) 

73 Indemnitees") from and against any and all costs, expenses, losses,
damages, claims, judgments, fines, claims, losses, penalties, damages,
interest, awards and liabilities directly or indirectly suffered or incurred
by any of them in connection with the arrangement and consummation of the
Financing and any information used in connection therewith (other than
arising from fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct of the Person
seeking indemnification hereunder, as determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction in a final, non-appealable judgment), to the fullest extent
permitted by Applicable Law and with appropriate contribution to the extent
such indemnification is not available. This Section 6.17(e) shall survive
consummation of the Merger and the Closing and any termination of this
Agreement, and is intended to benefit, and may be enforced by the Financing
Indemnitees and their respective heirs, executors, estates, personal
representatives, successors and assigns who are each third party beneficiaries
of this Section 6.17(e). Section 6.18 Confidentiality. Parent and the
Company hereby acknowledge and agree to continue to be bound by the letter

to the extent requested by Parent, any director (or any equivalent) or each
Subsidiary of the Company) in office immediately prior to the Effective Time,
which resignations shall be effective at the Effective Time. ARTICLE 7

 ![](leomergeragreement8kex21083.jpg) 

79 Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all costs and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such cost or expense, whether or not the Merger is consummated. For
the avoidance of doubt, Parent shall pay all filing fees payable pursuant to
(i) the HSR Act and (ii) any other Antitrust Laws. In the event that: (i)
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.01(g) (Adverse
Recommendation Change); (ii) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
8.01(h) (Company Superior Proposal); or (iii) (A) this Agreement is
terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(d) (No Vote) or
by Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(e) (Company Breach), (B) prior to the
Stockholder Meeting an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made publicly or
to the Company Board, and not withdrawn and (C) within twelve (12) months of
the date this Agreement is terminated the Company consummates or enters into
a definitive agreement for an Acquisition Proposal that is subsequently
consummated (whether during such twelve (12) month period or thereafter);
provided, that, for purposes of this Section 9.04(b)(iii), all percentages in
the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be replaced with 50%, then the
Company shall pay Parent the Company Termination Fee (less the amount of any
Tier I Parent Expenses previously paid to Parent pursuant to Section 9.04(f))
by wire transfer of same-day funds to an account designated by Parent (i) in
the case of Section 9.04(b)(i), within two (2) Business Days after such
termination, (ii) in the case of Section 9.04(b)(ii), concurrently with the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(h), and (iii) in the
case of Section 9.04(b)(iii), on the date that the Company consummates an
Acquisition Proposal (or no later than the next Business Day if such event
occurs on a day that is not a Business Day). In the event that Parent shall
become entitled to receive payment of the Company Termination Fee pursuant to
this Section 9.04(b), the receipt of the Company Termination Fee and/or any
Parent Expenses shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all
losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Merger Sub, any of their
respective Affiliates or any other Person in connection with this Agreement
(and the termination hereof), the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such
termination, the Company shall have no further liability, whether pursuant to
a claim at law or in equity, to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates in connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and the abandonment thereof) or
any matter forming the basis for such termination, and none of Parent, Merger
Sub, any of their respective affiliates or any other Person shall be entitled
to bring or maintain any claim, action or Proceeding against the Company or
any of its Affiliates for damages or any equitable relief arising out of or
in connection with this Agreement (other than  

  

 ![](leomergeragreement8kex21084.jpg) 

80 equitable relief to require payment of the Company Termination Fee and/or
any Parent Expenses), any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or any matters forming the basis for such termination. If the Company fails
to pay the Company Termination Fee and/or any Parent Expenses and Parent
and/or Merger Sub commences a suit which results in a final, non-appealable
judgment against the Company for the Company Termination Fee and/or any
Parent Expenses or any portions thereof, then the Company shall pay Parent or
Merger Sub its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and
disbursements) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the
Company Termination Fee and/or Parent Expenses at the "prime rate" as
published in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, in effect on the date
such payment was required to be made through the date of payment (calculated
daily on the basis of a year of 365 days and the actual number of days
elapsed, without compounding). For the avoidance of doubt, any payment made
by the Company under Section 9.04(b) shall be payable only once with respect
to Section 9.04(b) and not in duplication even though such payment may be
payable under one or more provisions hereof. Parent shall have the right to
assign the right to receive the Company Termination Fee and/or Parent
Expenses to one or more Persons in its sole discretion; provided, however,
that, for the avoidance of doubt, any such assignment shall not in any manner
whatsoever affect the parties' agreements set forth in the last paragraph of
Section 9.04(b). In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 8.01(f) (Parent Breach) (but only if the failure to satisfy the
condition specified therein results from an intentional breach by Parent or
Merger Sub of any or their respective representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements contained therein) or Section 8.01(i) (Failure to Close), then
Parent shall pay the Company the Parent Termination Fee by wire transfer of
same-day funds on the first (1st) Business Day following such termination. In
the event that the Company shall become entitled to receive the payment of the
Parent Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 9.04(d), the receipt of the
Parent Termination Fee together with the amounts, if any, to be paid by
Parent pursuant to Section 6.17(e) and this Section 9.04(d) (collectively,
the "Company Expenses") shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and
all losses or damages suffered or incurred by the Company in connection with
this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis
for such termination, and except for payment of the Parent Termination Fee
and/or any Company Expenses, neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall have any
further liability, whether pursuant to a claim at law or in equity, to the
Company or any of its Affiliates under this Agreement (and the termination
hereof), the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and the abandonment
thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and the
Company shall not be entitled to bring or maintain any claim, action or
Proceeding against Parent or Merger Sub for damages or any equitable relief
arising out of or in connection with this Agreement (other than equitable
relief to require payment of the Parent Termination Fee and/or any Company
Expenses), any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
matters forming the basis for such termination. If Parent fails to pay the
Parent Termination Fee and/or any Company Expenses and the Company commences
a suit which results in a final, non-  

  

 ![](leomergeragreement8kex21085.jpg) 

81 appealable judgment against Parent for the Parent Termination Fee and/or
any Company Expenses or any portions thereof, then Parent shall pay the
Company its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and
disbursements) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the
Parent Termination Fee and/or any Company Expenses at the "prime rate" as
published in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, in effect on the date
such payment was required to be made through the date of payment (calculated
daily on the basis of a year of 365 days and the actual number of days
elapsed, without compounding), which amounts shall themselves be Company
Expenses. For the avoidance of doubt, the failure of Parent or Merger Sub to
consummate the Merger on the date required by Section 2.01 after the
conditions set forth in Article 7 (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing and which are capable of being
satisfied on the Closing Date, assuming for purposes hereof that the date of
termination is the Closing Date) have been satisfied or waived shall
constitute an intentional breach by Parent and Merger Sub for which Parent
shall pay the Company the Parent Termination Fee in accordance with this
Section 9.04(d). For the avoidance of doubt, any payment made by Parent under
Section 9.04(d) shall be payable only once with respect to Section 9.04(d)
and not in duplication even though such payment may be payable under one or
more provisions hereof. In the event this Agreement is terminated by Parent
pursuant to Section 8.01(e) (Company Breach) as a result of a willful breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement under this Agreement
by the Company, in each case under circumstances in which the Company
Termination Fee is not then payable pursuant to Section 9.04(b), and prior to
the time of such termination by Parent, Parent and Merger Sub were not in
material breach of any of their representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements under this Agreement, then the Company shall, following receipt of
an invoice therefor, no later than two (2) Business Days after the date of
such termination (or, if later after the date of receipt of the invoice
therefor), pay, or cause to be paid, at the direction of Parent, up to
$2,000,000, in the aggregate, of Parent's reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket fees and expenses (including legal fees and expenses) incurred by
Parent and its Affiliates on or prior to the termination of this Agreement in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including
the Financing) (the "Tier I Parent Expenses"); provided, that the existence
of circumstances that could require the Company Termination Fee to become
subsequently payable by the Company pursuant to Section 9.04(b) shall not
relieve the Company of its obligations to pay the Tier I Parent Expenses
pursuant to this Section 9.04; provided further that the payment by the
Company of any Tier I Parent Expenses pursuant to this Section 9.04 shall not
relieve the Company of any subsequent obligation to pay the Company
Termination Fee pursuant to Section 9.04(b) except to the extent indicated in
Section 9.04(b). In the event this Agreement is terminated by the Company
prior to the Non-Solicitation Start Date pursuant to Section 8.01(h) (Company
Superior Proposal) so as to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement
with an Excluded Person who is not also a Prior Party, then the Company
shall, following receipt of an invoice therefor, no later than two (2)
Business Days after the date of such termination (or, if later, after the
date of receipt of the invoice therefor), pay, or cause to be paid, at the
direction of  

  

 ![](leomergeragreement8kex21086.jpg) 

82 Parent, up to $1,000,000, in the aggregate, of Parent's reasonable and
documented out-of- pocket fees and expenses (including legal fees and
expenses) incurred by Parent and its Affiliates on or prior to the
termination of this Agreement in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the Financing) (the "Tier II Parent
Expenses" and, together, but without duplication, with any Tier I Parent
Expenses, the "Parent Expenses"). The payment by the Company of any Tier II
Parent Expenses pursuant to this Section 9.04(g) shall be in addition to
payment by the Company of the Company Termination Fee pursuant to Section
9.04(b)(ii), but shall only be payable in the case of a termination by the
Company prior to the Non-Solicitation Start Date pursuant to Section 8.01(h)
(Company Superior Proposal) so as to enter into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement with an Excluded Person who is not also a Prior Party. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Company shall not be obligated to pay both the Tier I
Parent Expenses and the Tier II Parent Expenses. Each of the Company, Parent
and Merger Sub acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained in this Section
9.04 are an integral part of the Agreement, (ii) the damages resulting from
termination of this Agreement under circumstances where a Company Termination
Fee or Parent Termination Fee is payable are uncertain and incapable of
accurate calculation and therefore, the amounts payable pursuant to this
Section 9.04 are not a penalty but rather constitute liquidated damages in a
reasonable amount to compensate Parent or the Company, as the case may be,
for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the Agreement, and (iii) without the
agreements contained in this Section 9.04, the parties hereto would not have
entered into this Agreement. Section 9.05 Assignment; Benefit. This Agreement
shall not be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of
law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other parties;
provided, that Parent or Merger Sub may transfer or assign its rights and
obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time to time in part, to
(a) one or more of its Affiliates at any time, (b) after the Effective Time,
to any parties providing secured debt financing for purposes of creating a
security interest herein or otherwise assigning this Agreement as collateral
in respect of such secured debt financing, and (c) after the Effective Time,
to any Person; provided, that any assignment by Parent or Merger Sub shall not
relieve Parent or Merger Sub of its obligations hereunder. Notwithstanding
anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer on any Person other than
the parties hereto or their respective heirs, successors, executors,
administrators and assigns any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities
under or by reason of this Agreement, except for (a) the rights of the
Company's stockholders to receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective
Time pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, (b) the rights
of the holders of Company Equity Awards to receive the payments in respect
thereof following the Effective Time pursuant to Section 2.06, (c) the rights
of the Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 6.11 and (d) with respect to
the Debt Financing Parties, Section 9.03, this Section 9.05, Section 9.06,
Section 9.07, Section 9.08, Section 9.09, and Section 9.12, which, in each
case, which shall inure to the benefit of the Debt Financing sources
benefiting therefrom who are hereby expressly intended to be third-party
beneficiaries thereof and who may enforce the covenants contained therein
(solely as such provisions relates to such Debt Financing sources  

  

 ![](leomergeragreement8kex21087.jpg) 

83 in such capacity as third party beneficiary). For the avoidance of doubt,
prior to the Effective Time, the rights and remedies conferred on the
Company's stockholders pursuant to Article 2 concerning payment of the
Aggregate Merger Consideration may only be enforced by the Company acting on
the behalf of the Company's stockholders. The parties hereto further agree
that, except for those rights contained in clause (d) of the second preceding
sentence, the rights of third-party beneficiaries under this Section 9.05
shall not arise unless and until the Merger is consummated. Section 9.06
Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the
conflicts of law rules of such State; provided, that, notwithstanding the
foregoing, any disputes involving Debt Financing Parties will be governed by,
construed in accordance with and enforced under the Applicable Laws of the
State of New York without giving regard to conflicts or choice of law
principles that would result in the application of any Law other than the Law
of the State of New York. Section 9.07 Jurisdiction. The parties hereto
agree that any Proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on
any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be brought in the Delaware
Court of Chancery, New Castle County, or if that court does not have
jurisdiction, a federal court sitting in the State of Delaware. Each party
hereto hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court
in respect of any legal or equitable action, suit or proceeding arising out
of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or relating to enforcement of any of the terms of this Agreement,
and hereby waives, and agrees not to assert, as a defense in any such action,
suit or proceeding, any claim that it is not subject personally to the
jurisdiction of such court, that the action, suit or proceeding is brought in
an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the action, suit or proceeding is
improper or that this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may not be enforced in or by such courts. Each party hereto agrees
that notice or the service of process in any action, suit or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement shall be properly served or delivered if delivered in the
manner contemplated by Section 9.01 or in any other manner permitted by law.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each of the
parties hereto agrees that it will not bring, or support the bringing of, any
suit or proceeding, claim or counterclaim, whether in law or in equity,
whether arising in contract, tort, equity or otherwise, against the Debt
Financing Parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated herein, including any dispute arising out of or
relating to the performance of the Debt Commitment Letter, in any forum other
than the federal and New York State courts located in the Borough of Manhattan
within the City of New York. Section 9.08 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE
PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY
IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING, FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF
DOUBT, ANY LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO ANY DEBT FINANCING
USED TO CONSUMMATE THE MERGER OR THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED  

  

 ![](leomergeragreement8kex21088.jpg) 

84 Section 9.09 Specific Performance; Parent Liability Cap. The parties
hereto agree that irreparable harm would occur in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached, and, accordingly that the parties
hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at law or in equity in connection with this Agreement. The parties hereto
agree that unless and until this Agreement is validly terminated in
accordance with Section 8.01 and any dispute over the right to termination
has been finally resolved, (i) the parties hereto shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions from a court of competent jurisdiction as set forth
in Section 9.07 to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement (for the avoidance of
doubt, including to specifically enforce a party's obligation to effect the
Closing, but excluding the Company's covenants in Section 6.19), without
bond, or other security being required, and (ii) the right of specific
enforcement is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger, and without that right, none of the Company,
Parent or Merger Sub would have entered into this Agreement. The parties
hereto further agree that that unless and until this Agreement is terminated
in accordance with Section 8.01 and any dispute over the right to termination
has been finally resolved, the Company shall be entitled to an injunction,
specific performance or other equitable remedy to specifically enforce
Parent's and Merger Sub's obligations to effect the Closing in the event that
each of the following conditions have been satisfied: (A) the conditions set
forth in Section 7.01 and Section 7.02 (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, provided that each such
condition is then capable of being satisfied at the Closing) have been
satisfied or waived at the time the Closing would have occurred but for the
failure of the Equity Financing to be funded, and the conditions set forth in
Section 7.01 remain satisfied, (B) the Debt Financing is available to be
funded at the Closing and has been funded in accordance with the terms
thereof or will be funded in accordance with the terms thereof at the Closing
if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing, and (C) the Company has
irrevocably confirmed in writing to Parent that if specific performance is
granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded, then the
Company will take such actions as are within its control to effect the Closing
(such clauses (A) and (B), together, the "Specific Performance Conditions").
For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be entitled to
enforce or seek to enforce specifically Parent's right to cause the Equity
Financing to be funded or to complete the Merger if the Debt Financing has
not been funded (or will not be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing
is funded at the Closing). In no event shall the Company be entitled to seek
the remedy of specific performance of this Agreement other than solely under
the specific circumstances and as specifically set forth in this Section
9.09. For the avoidance of further doubt, in no event shall the Company or its
Subsidiaries, affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, partners,
managers, members or stockholders be entitled to seek any remedy of specific
performance or other equitable remedies against any Debt Financing Party.
Each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief on the basis that
any other of such parties has an adequate remedy at law  

  

 ![](leomergeragreement8kex21089.jpg) 

85 or that any such injunction or award of specific performance or other
equitable relief is not an appropriate remedy for any reason; provided, that
solely with respect to the equitable remedy to specifically enforce Parent's
or Merger Sub's obligation to effect the Closing, Parent and Merger Sub may
oppose the granting of specific performance only on the basis that one of the
Specific Performance Conditions has not been satisfied. The parties hereto
further agree that (x) following the Company's valid termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Section 8.01, the Company shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions from a court of competent jurisdiction as set forth
in Section 9.07 to enforce specifically Parent's and Merger Sub's surviving
obligations herein, including with respect to the payment of any fraud
remedies under Section 8.02 or the payments of the Parent Termination Fee
and/or any Company Expenses to which the Company is entitled under Section
9.04, and (ii) following Parent's valid termination of this Agreement in
accordance with Section 8.01, Parent shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions from a court of competent jurisdiction as set forth in Section
9.07 to enforce specifically the Company's surviving obligations herein,
including with respect to the payment of any fraud remedies under Section
8.02 or the payments of the Company Termination Fee and/or any Parent
Expenses to which Parent is entitled under Section 9.04. The parties hereto
further agree that (i) by seeking the remedies provided for in this Section
9.09, a party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek any other form
of relief that may be available to a party under this Agreement (including
fraud remedies) for breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement or in
the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in the event that the
remedies provided for in this Section 9.09 are not available or otherwise are
not granted, and (ii) nothing set forth in this Section 9.09 shall require
any party hereto to institute any Proceeding for (or limit any party's right
to institute any Proceeding for) specific performance under this Section 9.09
prior or as a condition to exercising any termination right under Article 8
(and pursuing fraud remedies), nor shall the commencement of any Proceeding
pursuant to this Section 9.09 or anything set forth in this Section 9.09
restrict or limit any party's right to terminate this Agreement in accordance
with the terms of Article 8 or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement
that may be available at any time. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, while the Company may pursue both a grant of
specific performance as and only to the extent expressly permitted by this
Section 9.09 and the payment of the Parent Termination Fee and/or Company
Expenses (only to the extent expressly permitted by Section 9.04), under no
circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both such
grant of specific performance to require Parent and Merger Sub to effect the
Closing and pay the Parent Termination Fee. The maximum aggregate liability
of Parent and Merger Sub for monetary damages in connection with this
Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter, the Guarantee and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be limited to $21,368,000 plus the
Company Expenses (the "Parent Liability Cap"). In no event shall the Company
seek or permit to be sought on behalf of the Company any damages of any kind,
including consequential, indirect, or punitive damages, from any officer,
director, agent or employee of Parent or Merger Sub, any direct or indirect
holder of any Equity Interests or securities of Parent or Merger Sub or any
direct or indirect director,  

  

 ![](leomergeragreement8kex21090.jpg) 

86 officer, employee, partner, Affiliate, member, controlling Person or
representative of any of the foregoing, in connection with this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other than as provided by
Section 8.02 and this Section 9.09, and as expressly provided by and subject
to the terms of the Equity Commitment Letter and the Guarantee); provided,
however, subject to the terms and conditions of the Equity Commitment Letter
and/or the Guarantee (and without limiting the Company's remedies thereunder
and under Section 9.09(a)), the Company may seek to cause Parent to enforce
the terms of such Equity Commitment Letter and/or Guarantee to cause the
Sponsor or Guarantor, as the case may be, to provide funds to Parent, which
shall in no event exceed, in the aggregate, the Parent Liability Cap, to
permit Parent to satisfy (i) any judgment, order or award of damages in favor
of the Company obtained by the Company in accordance with Section 8.02, (ii)
payment by Parent of the Parent Termination Fee and/or any Company Expenses,
and/or (iii) any order requiring Parent and/or Merger Sub to specifically
perform their obligations under this Agreement or other equitable relief
permitted under this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary and for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 9.09 nor
Section 9.04 shall limit in any way any fraud remedies or the remedies of the
parties under the Confidentiality Agreement. Section 9.10 Severability. If
any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by a
court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Authority to be
invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions,
covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as
the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon
such a determination, the parties hereto agree to negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner, in order that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally contemplated to
the fullest extent possible. Section 9.11 Parent Guarantee. Parent shall
cause Merger Sub to comply in all respects with each of the representations,
warranties, covenants, obligations, agreements and undertakings made or
required to be performed by Merger Sub in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, the Merger, and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. As a material inducement to the Company's willingness to enter
into this Agreement and perform its obligations hereunder, Parent hereby
unconditionally guarantees full performance and payment by Merger Sub of each
of the covenants, obligations and undertakings required to be performed by
Merger Sub under this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, subject to all terms, conditions and limitations contained in this
Agreement, and hereby represents, acknowledges and agrees that any such
breach of any such representation and warranty or default in the performance
of any such covenant, obligation, agreement or undertaking of Merger Sub
shall also be deemed to be a breach or default of Parent, and the Company
shall have the right, exercisable in its sole discretion, to pursue any and
all available remedies it may have arising out of any such breach or
nonperformance directly against either or both of Parent and Merger Sub in
the first instance. As applicable, references in this Section 9.11 to "Merger
Sub" shall also include the Surviving Corporation following the Effective  

  

 ![](leomergeragreement8kex21091.jpg) 

87 Section 9.12 Debt Financing Parties. None of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, partners,
managers, members or stockholders (in each case, in their capacity as such)
shall have any rights or claims against any Debt Financing Party in any way
relating to this Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or relating
in any way to the performance of any financing commitments of such Debt
Financing Party with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, whether
at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise. No Debt Financing Party
shall have any liability (whether in contract, in tort or otherwise) to the
Company or its Subsidiaries, affiliates, directors, officers, employees,
agents, partners, managers, members or stockholders (in each case, in their
capacity as such) for any obligations or liabilities of any party hereto
under this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason
of, the transactions contemplated hereby, including any dispute arising out
of or relating in any way to the performance of any debt financing commitments
in connection with the Merger. Section 9.13 Entire Agreement; No Reliance.
This Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement, the exhibits and schedules to
this Agreement, the Company Disclosure Schedule and any documents delivered
by the parties in connection herewith (including the Financing Commitment
Letters and the Guarantee) constitute the entire agreement among the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements
and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect
thereto. Each party hereto agrees that, except for the representations and
warranties contained in Article 4 and Article 5 of this Agreement, neither the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub makes any other representations or warranties
and each hereby disclaims any other representations or warranties made by
itself or any of its Representatives, with respect to the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, notwithstanding the delivery or disclosure to any other party or
any other party's Representatives of any document or other information with
respect to any one or more of the foregoing. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, and notwithstanding any otherwise express representations
and warranties made by the parties in this Agreement, each of Parent and
Merger Sub agrees that neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries makes
or has made any representation or warranty with respect to (i) any
projections, forecasts, estimates, plans or budgets or future revenues,
expenses or expenditures, future results of operations (or any component
thereof), future cash flows (or any component thereof) or future financial
condition (or any component thereof) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or the future business, operations or affairs of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries heretofore or hereafter delivered to or made available to it, or
(ii) any other information, statements or documents heretofore or hereafter
delivered to or made available to it, including the information in the
electronic data room of the Company, with respect to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or the business, operations or affairs of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, except to the extent and as expressly covered by a
representation and warranty made in this Agreement.
