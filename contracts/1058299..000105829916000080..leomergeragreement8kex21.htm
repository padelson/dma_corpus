The parties hereto agree that unless and until this Agreement is validly &#13;&#10;terminated in accordance with Section 8.01 and any dispute over the right to termination &#13;&#10;has been finally resolved, (i) the parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or &#13;&#10;injunctions from a court of competent jurisdiction as set forth in Section 9.07 to prevent &#13;&#10;breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this &#13;&#10;Agreement (for the avoidance of doubt, including to specifically enforce a party&#8217;s &#13;&#10;obligation to effect the Closing, but excluding the Company&#8217;s covenants in Section 6.19), &#13;&#10;without bond, or other security being required, and (ii) the right of specific enforcement &#13;&#10;is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the &#13;&#10;Merger, and without that right, none of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub would have &#13;&#10;entered into this Agreement.  The parties hereto further agree that that unless and until &#13;&#10;this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 8.01 and any dispute over the &#13;&#10;right to termination has been finally resolved, the Company shall be entitled to an &#13;&#10;injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedy to specifically enforce &#13;&#10;Parent&#8217;s and Merger Sub&#8217;s obligations to effect the Closing in the event that each of the &#13;&#10;following conditions have been satisfied: (A) the conditions set forth in Section 7.01 and &#13;&#10;Section 7.02 (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the &#13;&#10;Closing, provided that each such condition is then capable of being satisfied at the &#13;&#10;Closing) have been satisfied or waived at the time the Closing would have occurred but &#13;&#10;for the failure of the Equity Financing to be funded, and the conditions set forth in &#13;&#10;Section 7.01 remain satisfied, (B) the Debt Financing is available to be funded at the &#13;&#10;Closing and has been funded in accordance with the terms thereof or will be funded in &#13;&#10;accordance with the terms thereof at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the &#13;&#10;Closing, and (C) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing to Parent that if &#13;&#10;specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded, &#13;&#10;then the Company will take such actions as are within its control to effect the Closing &#13;&#10;(such clauses (A) and (B), together, the &#8220;Specific Performance Conditions&#8221;).  For the &#13;&#10;avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be entitled to enforce or seek to &#13;&#10;enforce specifically Parent&#8217;s right to cause the Equity Financing to be funded or to &#13;&#10;complete the Merger if the Debt Financing has not been funded (or will not be funded at &#13;&#10;the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing).  In no event shall the &#13;&#10;Company be entitled to seek the remedy of specific performance of this Agreement other &#13;&#10;than solely under the specific circumstances and as specifically set forth in this Section &#13;&#10;9.09.  For the avoidance of further doubt, in no event shall the Company or its &#13;&#10;Subsidiaries, affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, partners, managers, &#13;&#10;members or stockholders be entitled to seek any remedy of specific performance or other &#13;&#10;equitable remedies against any Debt Financing Party.  Each of the parties hereto agrees &#13;&#10;that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other &#13;&#10;equitable relief on the basis that any other of such parties has an adequate remedy at law &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;</FONT></DIV>
