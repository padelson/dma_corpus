This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of January 21, 2014 (this
"Agreement"), is by and among VMware, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"),
A.W.S. Holding, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the "Company"),
Aikman Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and with respect to Section 1.7, Section
4.4, Section 4.15, Article 7 and Article 8 only, the Representative. Certain
capitalized terms used herein have the meanings assigned to them in Section
1.4(c)(iii), Section 1.6(d)(iii) or Section 8.1.

BACKGROUND

The board of directors of each of Parent and Merger Sub, and the board of
managers of the Company, has determined that the Merger, on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein, is advisable and in the best
interests of their respective stockholders and unitholders, as the case may
be, and in furtherance thereof, has approved this Agreement, the Merger and
the other Transactions.

Holders of Company Units with sufficient voting power to adopt this Agreement
and approve the terms of the Merger have adopted this Agreement, approving the
terms of the Merger, and appointing David K. Dabbiere the initial
Representative pursuant to Section 7.16 for the purposes set forth herein, and
have executed a joinder agreement in the form of Exhibit A (the "Joinder
Agreement").

Immediately after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Parent, as
sole stockholder of Merger Sub, will vote to adopt this Agreement and approve
the terms of the Merger.

A portion of the Merger Consideration will be placed in escrow by Parent as
partial security for the indemnification obligations of the Indemnifying
Securityholders and Indemnifying Founders hereunder.

In order to induce Parent to enter into this Agreement, concurrently with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, each of the Key Employees set forth
on Schedule 5.3(l)(1A) have executed and delivered a non-competition and non-
solicitation agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (the "Non-
competition Agreements") and employment welcome or offer letters (the "Offer
Letters") with the Surviving Entity or a Subsidiary thereof, and the Key
Employees set forth on Schedule 5.3(l)(1B) have executed and delivered Offer
Letters, each of which will be effective at and subject to the occurrence of
the Closing.

In order to induce Parent to enter into this Agreement, concurrently with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, each of the Installment Parties are
executing and delivering Installment Amount Agreements with Parent, each of
which will be effective at and subject to the occurrence of the Closing.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements hereinafter set forth,
and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE 1

MERGER

Section 1.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions in this
Agreement, and in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the
"DGCL") and the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act (the "DLLCA"), Merger
Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the "Merger"), pursuant to the
certificate of merger, substantially in the form of Exhibit C (the
"Certificate of Merger"), to be filed with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware (the "Delaware Secretary") concurrently with or as soon as
practicable following the Closing. The Merger will become effective at the
time of the filing of such Certificate of Merger with the Delaware Secretary
(the "Effective Time"). The Company will be the surviving entity (sometimes
referred to as the "Surviving Entity") in the Merger and will succeed to and
assume all the rights and obligations of Merger Sub in accordance with the
DGCL and DLLCA.

Section 1.2 Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place
upon the later of (a) February 23, 2014 and (b) three Business Days after the
satisfaction or waiver of each of the conditions set forth in Article 5
(except for such conditions that by their nature will be satisfied at Closing,
but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of such conditions) or at such other
time as the parties agree in writing; provided, however, that notwithstanding
the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth herein, in no event will
Parent be required to consummate and make effective the Merger during any
period commencing on the date 15 days prior to the last day of any fiscal
quarter of Parent and ending on the last day of such fiscal quarter (a
"Finance Blackout Period"), and in the event that the Closing would occur
during a Finance Blackout Period but for this proviso, then (subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of each of the conditions set forth in Article 5
(except for such conditions that by their nature cannot be satisfied until the
Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of such conditions)) the
Closing will occur on the first Business Day immediately following the
applicable Finance Blackout Period. The Closing will take place at the offices
of Morrison and Foerster LLP, 425 Market Street, San Francisco, California or at
such other location as the parties agree in writing. The date on which the
Closing actually occurs is herein referred to as the "Closing Date."

Closing Operating Agreement"), until thereafter amended as provided by the
DLLCA and such Post-Closing Operating Agreement. (c)Managers and Officers of Surviving Entity. At the Effective Time, the

exchange therefor.

(b)Each share of common stock of Merger Sub (the "Merger Sub Common Stock")

of the Merger Consideration, as specified and allocated in this Section
1.4(c). All such Company Units will no longer be outstanding, will
automatically be canceled and will cease to exist, and each holder of any

agreement with the Escrow Agent (or such other bank or trust company in the
United States to be agreed upon by Parent, the Company and the Representative,
the "Payment Agent"), which will provide that Parent will make available at
the Effective Time to the Payment Agent cash in the amount necessary for the
payment of the Merger Consideration (for the avoidance of doubt, including
amounts required to fund the General Escrow Fund, the Litigation Escrow Fund
and the Representative Fund) as specified and allocated in Section 1.4. At the
Closing, Parent shall pay to the Insight Unitholders and the Accel
Unitholders, the Additional Consideration in accordance with Section 1.4(h).
Schedule 1.5 sets forth an illustrative payout schedule, which may be adjusted
as the Company determines is necessary to conform to the terms of this
Agreement (which for the avoidance of doubt will prevail in the event of any
inconsistency between Schedule 1.5 and this Agreement), correct errors, and
update assumptions and inputs in Schedule 1.5 for changes between the date
hereof and Closing contemplated by this Agreement. Without limitation, the
final calculation and distribution of the Merger Consideration is subject to
adjustment in accordance with the Working Capital Adjustment, the payment of
Third Party Expenses and the potential issuance of Company RSUs and Company
Options in accordance with the Agreement.

(b)Payment Procedures; Escrow and Representative Contributions.

(i)Prior to the Closing, the Company will deliver or mail to each holder of
record of any Company Units (A) a letter of transmittal substantially in the
form of Exhibit F (the "Letter of Transmittal") and (B) instructions for
submitting the Letter of Transmittal in exchange for consideration as
specified and allocated in Section 1.4. Upon submission to the Payment Agent
of a duly executed Letter of Transmittal and such other customary documents as
may reasonably be required by the Payment Agent to allow it to properly
discharge its obligations, the holder of Company Units will receive in
exchange therefor, subject to the next sentences, the applicable portion of
the Merger Consideration into which the Company Units formerly held by such
holder will have been converted in accordance with Section 1.4, as set forth
on the Spreadsheet, and the Company Units will be canceled. The amount of
Merger Consideration to be received in accordance with the preceding sentence
will be reduced by such holder's Unit General Escrow Contribution and Unit
Representative Fund Contribution, per Section 1.4.

(ii)Separate from and in addition to the reductions for Unit General Escrow
Contributions and Unit Representative Fund Contributions, if either of the
Litigations has not been finally settled (pursuant to a settlement agreement
approved by Parent) prior to the Closing, the amount of Merger Consideration
to be received by any Indemnifying Founder in accordance with this Section 1.5(b) will be reduced by such Indemnifying
Founder's Unit Litigation Escrow Contribution, per Section 1.4.

(iii)Separate from and in addition to the reductions for Unit General Escrow
Contributions, Unit Litigation Escrow Contributions and Unit Representative
Fund Contributions, the amount of Merger Consideration to be received by any
Installment Party in accordance with this Section 1.5(b) will be reduced by
such Installment Party's Unit Installment Amount, and the terms and conditions
upon which such Unit Installment Amount becomes payable to such Installment
Party will be governed by an Installment Amount Agreement in substantially the
forms attached hereto as Exhibit G (each an "Installment Amount Agreement").

(iv)If any transfer of ownership of Company Units has not been registered in
the Company's transfer records, payment may be made to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the Company Units is registered if the Letter of
Transmittal is properly endorsed or is otherwise in proper form reasonably
acceptable to the Payment Agent for transfer, and the Person requesting such
transfer or payment will pay any transfer or other Tax required by reason of
the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Company Units
or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is
not applicable. Other than interest earned on the Escrow Funds that becomes
part of the respective Escrow Fund or on the Representative Fund, and except
as otherwise stated in an Installment Amount Agreement, no interest will be
paid or will accrue on the cash payable in accordance with this Article 1.

(c)No Further Ownership Rights in Company Units. All cash paid in accordance
with the terms of this Article 1 (including cash deposited into the Escrow
Funds and Representative Fund) will be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Company Units so exchanged, the
unit transfer books of the Company will be closed immediately upon the
Effective Time, and there will be no further registration of transfers on the
unit transfer books of the Surviving Entity of the Company Units which were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(d)No Liability. None of Parent, the Surviving Entity or the Payment Agent
will be liable to any Person with respect to any cash delivered to a public
official in accordance with any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. Parent and the Surviving Entity shall provide the Representative
thirty days notice prior to any such delivery to a public official.

(e)Tax Withholding. Parent, the Surviving Entity, the Payment Agent and the
Escrow Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts otherwise
payable in accordance with this Agreement to any former holder of Company
Units or former holders of In-the-Money Vested Options such amounts as Parent,
the Surviving Entity, the Payment Agent or the Escrow Agent reasonably
believes is required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax
Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the
appropriate Tax Authority by Parent, the Surviving Entity, the Payment Agent
or the Escrow Agent, such withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Units or In-the-
Money Vested Options in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by Parent, the Surviving Entity, the Payment Agent or the Escrow Agent. Section 1.6 Options.

(a)Treatment of Company Options, Company Restricted Units and Company RSUs.

(i)At the Effective Time, each option to purchase Company Units (each, a
"Company Option") that is granted under any Company Equity Plan and is then
outstanding will:

(A)in the case of the portion of any vested Company Option that is then vested
and then exercisable for an exercise price less than the Per Unit
Consideration (any such portion of such Company Option, an "In-the-Money
Vested Option"), be cancelled in consideration of payment to the holder of
such Company Option of an amount in cash in respect thereof equal to the
amount, if any, by which (i) the aggregate amount of consideration that would
be issuable or payable in accordance with Section 1.4(c) in respect of the
Company Units issuable upon exercise of such Company Option had such Company
Option been exercised in full prior to the Effective Time (without regard to
any reduction of that amount on account of the escrow obligations as provided
in Section 1.5, but subject to Section 1.6(d)) exceeds (ii) the aggregate
exercise price for such Company Option (such payment to be Net of Tax
Withholdings);

(B)in the case of the portion of any Company Option that (i) is then unvested,
(ii) has been issued to an employee or consultant of the Company or its
Subsidiaries who will become an employee or consultant of Parent or its
Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date, and (iii) has an exercise price per share
less than the Per Unit Consideration (any such portion of Company Option, a
"Rollover Option"), Parent will substitute each such Rollover Option with an
option under Parent's equity plan to acquire, on the same terms and conditions
as were applicable to such Rollover Option as of immediately prior to such
substitution by Parent (except as provided below), the number of shares of
Class A Common Stock of Parent ("Parent Common Stock"), rounded to the nearest
whole share, determined by multiplying the number of Company Units issuable
upon the exercise in full of such Rollover Option as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time by a fraction (such fraction, the "Option Exchange Ratio"),
the numerator of which will be the Per Unit Consideration and the denominator
of which will be equal to the average of the closing prices of Parent Common
Stock on the New York Stock Exchange as reported on www.nyse.com for the 30
trading days ending on (and inclusive of) the trading day that is three
trading days immediately prior to the Closing Date, at an exercise price per
share of Parent Common Stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x)
the per share exercise price of such Company Option, by (y) the Option
Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent (each, as so adjusted, an
"Substituted Option"); provided, that in the case of any Rollover Option that
includes in its terms an ability to exercise any unvested Company Options in
exchange for Company Restricted Units, as a condition to the substitution by
Parent of such Rollover Option, the holder will waive such provision. Each
Substituted Option will provide for acceleration on the terms and conditions
set forth in Schedule 1.6. The substitution of Company Options provided for in
this Section 1.6(a)(i)(B) will be effected in a manner that is intended to
satisfy the requirements of Sections 409A and 424(a) of the Code and the
proposed and final Treasury Regulations thereunder; and (C)by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company,
Parent, Merger Sub or the holders thereof, in the case of all other Company
Options, be cancelled at the Effective Time without payment of any
consideration.

(i)Company Restricted Units. Effective as of the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger
Sub or the holders thereof, each Company Restricted Unit will accelerate
immediately prior to the Closing, and as such will be treated as a Company
Unit pursuant to Section 1.4(c).

(ii)Company RSUs. Effective as of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the
holders thereof,

(A)each restricted membership unit that does not vest by its terms on or prior
to the Effective Time (a "Company RSU") that has been issued to an employee or
consultant of the Company or its Subsidiaries who will become an employee or
consultant of Parent or its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date and remains
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will automatically be
canceled, and will be substituted with a restricted stock unit covering Parent
Common Stock (a "Replacement RSU"). The number of units subject to a
Replacement RSU will be determined by multiplying the number of units subject
to the Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Option
Exchange Ratio, and rounding to the nearest whole unit. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the number of units subject to a Replacement RSU that is
substituted for an AUS Company RSU or other Company RSU held by an Australian
taxpayer will be determined by multiplying the number of units subject to the
AUS Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time by a fraction, the
numerator of which will be the Per Unit Consideration and the denominator of
which will be equal to the closing price of Parent Common Stock on the New
York Stock Exchange as reported on www.nyse.com on the Closing Date, and
rounding down to the nearest whole unit. The Replacement RSUs will continue to
have, and be subject to, the same material terms and conditions of the Company
RSUs underlying such Replacement RSUs as are in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, including the vesting conditions and any accelerated
vesting provisions; provided, however, that the vesting date for all such
Replacement RSUs will be changed following the Closing to occur on the first
day of the applicable month in which the vesting for each Company RSU would
have otherwise occurred; provided, further, that on, and only with respect to,
the first vesting date of each Replacement RSU, an additional number of shares
of Parent Common Stock will vest equal to the number of such shares, if any,
that would have vested between the Closing Date and the first day of the
calendar month next occurring thereafter had the original vesting schedule for
the Company RSU remained in effect; and provided, further, that in the case of
any Company RSU that includes in its terms any accelerated vesting feature, as
a condition to the substitution by Parent of such Company RSU, the Replacement
RSU will also require the holder to waive the accelerated vesting. Each
Replacement RSU (except for Replacement RSUs issued in exchange for Retention
RSUs in accordance with Section 1.8) will provide for acceleration on the
terms and conditions set forth in Schedule 1.6.

(B)All other Company RSUs will be cancelled at the Effective Time without
payment of any consideration. (iv)Eligibility on Form S-8. The shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
pursuant to Substituted Options and Replacement RSUs will be registered on
Parent's existing and effective registration statement on Form S-8.

(v)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, with respect to
any Company Option that is (i) exercised prior to the Effective Time and (ii)
with respect to which the aggregate exercise price has been paid by means of a
promissory note to the Company which has not been fully satisfied prior to the
Effective Time, then an amount of cash equal to the outstanding balance of
such promissory note (including all interest payable on the promissory note)
as of immediately prior to the Closing will be deducted from the aggregate
amount of cash otherwise payable or issuable to the holder of such Company
Option pursuant to this Agreement and any such promissory note thereby will be
extinguished and be of no further force and effect.

(b)No Further Rights of Holder of Company Options, Company Restricted Units
and Company RSUs. Except as set forth above, all Company Options, Company
Restricted Units, Company RSUs and Company Equity Plans will terminate as of
the Effective Time, and, following the Effective Time, no holder of any
Company Option, Company Restricted Units or Company RSU or any participant in
any Company Equity Plan will have any right to acquire any equity securities
of the Company, its Subsidiaries, or the Surviving Entity as a result of such
holder's Company Options, Company Restricted Units or Company RSUs.

(c)Omitted.

(d)Payment. Payment of the Merger Consideration, if any, for each In-the-Money
Vested Option pursuant to this Section 1.6 will be made as follows:

(i)At the Effective Time, for each holder of an In-the-Money Vested Option,
the Merger Consideration payable to such holder pursuant to this Section 1.6
(before any required Tax withholding) will be reduced by such holder's Option
General Escrow Contribution and Option Representative Fund Contribution; and

(ii)On the Closing Date, Parent will make payment to the Payment Agent or the
Surviving Entity so that they may deliver to the holder of such In-the-Money
Vested Option the remainder (after the reductions set forth in Section
1.6(d)(i)) of such consideration payable pursuant to this Section 1.6, Net of
Tax Withholdings. To the extent that such Taxes are so deducted or withheld
and paid over to the appropriate Tax Authority, the amounts thereof will be
treated for all purposes hereunder as having been paid to the Person to whom
such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

(iii)As used in this Section 1.6 and elsewhere in this Agreement, the
following terms have the following meanings:

(A)"Option Escrow Funding Percentage" means, (i) with respect to each
Indemnifying Securityholder who is not an Installment Party, (1) the Merger
Consideration payable to such Indemnifying Securityholder pursuant to Section
1.6(a)(i)(A) before any applicable Tax withholding and before any reductions
set forth in Section 1.6(d) divided by (2) the aggregate Merger Consideration
payable to all Indemnifying Securityholders pursuant to Section 1.4 and Section 1.6(a)(i)(A) before any applicable Tax
withholding and before any reductions set forth in Section 1.5(b) and this
Section 1.6(d) and (ii) with respect to each Indemnifying Securityholder who
is an Installment Party, 0%.

(B)"Option General Escrow Contribution" means, with respect to each
Indemnifying Securityholder, (1) such Indemnifying Securityholder's Option
Escrow Funding Percentage multiplied by (2) the General Escrow Amount.

(C)"Option Representative Fund Contribution" means, with respect to each
Indemnifying Securityholder (1) such Indemnifying Securityholder's Option
Escrow Funding Percentage multiplied by (2) the Representative Fund Amount.

(e)Required Notices and Consents. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
will take all action necessary or appropriate to effect the treatment of
Company Options, Company Restricted Units and Company RSUs provided for under
this Section 1.6, under the Company Equity Plans, all Contracts governing the
terms of all Company Options, Company Restricted Units or Company RSUs, and
under any other plan or arrangement to which the Company is a party or by
which the Company may be bound, including (i) giving any required notice and
obtaining any required consent contemplated thereby and (ii) at the request of
Parent, sending to any holders of Company Options, Company Restricted Units
and Company RSUs notices prepared by Parent (and reviewed by the Company) with
respect to the treatment of such instruments under this Agreement. The Company
will not send any notices to any holders of Company Options, Company
Restricted Units or Company RSUs, or solicit any consents or other approvals
from the holders of any Company Options, Company Restricted Units or Company
RSUs unless and until Parent has reviewed and approved all notices and related
documentation (including any email messages and notifications) to be sent to
such holders (which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

Section 1.7 Adjustments to Merger Consideration.

(a)Estimated Statement. The parties hereto have contemplated that the Company
will have Working Capital as of the Closing (the "Closing Working Capital"),
as calculated in accordance with this Agreement and in accordance with and as
set forth on the Form Working Capital Statement attached hereto as Schedule
1.7, of at least $0.00 (the "Working Capital Target"). At least five Business
Days prior to the Closing, the Company will deliver to Parent a written
statement (the "Estimated Statement") setting forth the Company's good faith
estimate of the amount of the Closing Working Capital (the "Estimated Working
Capital"), together with such schedules and data as may reasonably be
appropriate to support such Estimated Statement. The "Working Capital
Adjustment" means the amount, if any, by which Estimated Working Capital is
less than the Working Capital Target. Schedule 1.7 contains a template for the
calculations of the Closing Working Capital.

(b)Closing Statement. Within 90 days after the Closing Date, Parent will, at
its option, prepare and deliver to the Representative a calculation of the
Closing Working Capital (the "Closing Statement") together with such schedules
and data setting forth in reasonable detail the particulars of any disparity
between the Estimated Statement and the Closing Statement, including a copy of
the Estimated Statement marked to indicate those specific line items that are in dispute and accompanied by Parent's calculation of each such
line item that is in dispute. All line items that are not disputed will be
final, binding and conclusive for all purposes hereunder unless the resolution
of any disputed line item affects an undisputed item, in which case such
undisputed item will remain open. If Parent elects not to prepare a Closing
Statement, then the Estimated Statement will be final, binding and complete
for all purposes hereunder. Following delivery of the Closing Statement,
Parent will provide the Representative with reasonable access to the financial
records of the Company, solely for the purpose of reviewing the Closing
Statement in accordance with this Agreement, all to the extent deemed
reasonably necessary by the Representative and in a manner not unreasonably
disruptive to the Company's business. For purposes of this Agreement, Working
Capital will be calculated in accordance with the following hierarchy: (i)
this Agreement (including Schedule 1.7 to this Agreement), (ii) with GAAP and
(iii) with GAAP applied using the same accounting methods, policies, practices
and procedures, with consistent classifications, judgments and estimation
methodology, in each case to the extent consistent with GAAP, as were used in
the preparation of the Financial Statements.

(c)Determination of Final Working Capital. If the Representative disagrees in
whole or in part with the Closing Statement, then within 60 days after its
receipt of the Closing Statement, it will notify Parent of such disagreement
in writing (the "Notice of Disagreement"), setting forth in reasonable detail
the particulars of any such disagreement; provided, however, that any such
objection will be limited to any failure on the part of Parent to prepare the
Closing Statement in accordance with the standards set forth in this Section
1.7 and to mathematical or similar errors. A Notice of Disagreement must state
which item or items are in dispute (the "Disputed Line Items") and specify in
reasonable detail the good faith basis for each Disputed Line Item. To the
extent the Representative provides a Notice of Disagreement within such 60 day
period, all items that are not Disputed Line Items will be final, binding and
conclusive for all purposes hereunder unless the resolution of any Disputed
Line Item affects an undisputed item, in which case such undisputed item will
remain open and be considered a Disputed Line Item. In the event that the
Representative does not provide a Notice of Disagreement within such 60 day
period, the Representative will be deemed to have accepted in full the Closing
Statement as prepared by Parent, which will be final, binding and conclusive
for all purposes hereunder. In the event any Notice of Disagreement is timely
provided, Parent and the Representative will use commercially reasonable
efforts for a period of 30 days following the date of Parent's receipt of the
Notice of Disagreement (or such longer period as they may mutually agree) to
resolve any Disputed Line Items. During such 30 day period, Parent and the
Representative will have access to the working papers, schedules and
calculations of the other used in the preparation of the Closing Statement and
the Notice of Disagreement and the determination of the Closing Working
Capital and Disputed Line Items. If, at the end of such period, Parent and the
Representative are unable to resolve such Disputed Line Items, then such
Disputed Line Items will be referred to an independent accounting firm of
national reputation in the United States selected by the mutual agreement of
Parent and the Representative (the "Settlement Accountant"). Parent and the
Representative will enter into reasonable and customary arrangements for the
services to be rendered by the Settlement Accountant under this Section 1.7.
The Settlement Accountant will be directed to determine as promptly as
practicable (and in any event within 30 days from the date that the dispute is
submitted to it) whether the Disputed Line Items in the Closing Statement were
prepared in accordance with the standards set forth in this Section 1.7 and
whether and to what extent (if any) the Closing Working Capital requires adjustment. The Settlement Accountant will resolve each Disputed Line
Item by calculating such Disputed Line Item in accordance with this Agreement
(for each such Disputed Line Item, the amount so calculated is referred to as
the "Accountant Determined Amount") and establishing as the final amount of
such Disputed Line Item the applicable Accountant Determined Amount; provided
that the Accountant Determined Amount for each Disputed Line Item may not be
greater than the highest amount proposed by Parent and the Representative nor
lesser than the lowest amount proposed by Parent and the Representative.
Parent and the Representative will each furnish to the Settlement Accountant
such work papers, schedules, calculations, books and records and other
documents and information relating to the disputed issues that each used in
their determinations and negotiations, and will answer questions as the
Settlement Accountant may reasonably request. The determination of the
Settlement Accountant will be final, conclusive and binding on the parties
hereto and on the Indemnifying Securityholders. The amounts determined to be
the Closing Working Capital pursuant to this Section 1.7(c) will constitute
the "Final Working Capital."

(d)Parent, on the one hand, and the Representative, on the other hand shall
each bear 50% of the costs and expenses of the Settlement Accountant arising
out of services performed pursuant to this Section 1.7.

(e)Post-Closing Adjustment Amount.

(i)If (A) the Estimated Working Capital is greater than the Final Working
Capital and (B) the Final Working Capital is less than $0.00, then Parent will
be entitled to recover the lesser of (1) the difference between $0.00 and the
Final Working Capital or (2) the difference between the Estimated Working
Capital and the Final Working Capital, in each case starting with dollar one,
from the General Escrow Fund in accordance with Article 7, and disregarding
the Indemnification Threshold provided for in Section 7.3(a).

(ii)If (A) the Final Working Capital is greater than the Estimated Working
Capital and (B) the Estimated Working Capital is less than $0.00, then Parent
will immediately pay, as additional Merger Consideration pursuant to Sections
1.5 and 1.6, to holders of Company Units and In-the-Money Vested Options the
lesser of (1) the difference between $0.00 and the Estimated Working Capital
or (2) the difference between the Estimated Working Capital and the Final
Working Capital.

(f)Calculations. The parties agree that if any provision of this Agreement
requires an amount or calculation to be "determined in accordance with this
Agreement and GAAP" (or words of similar import), then to the extent that the
terms of this Agreement (including Schedule 1.7) expressly conflict with, or
are expressly inconsistent with, GAAP in connection with such determination,
the terms of this Agreement (including Schedule 1.7) will control.

Section 1.8 Retention Equity Awards. Prior to the Closing, the Company,
following Parent's specific directions (after consultation with the Company)
identifying the recipients, allocations and terms thereof (which will include
a vesting schedule identical to Parent's employee restricted stock unit or
option vesting schedule, as applicable), will grant Company RSUs and Company
Options having an aggregate value equal to $7,000,000 (or such higher amount as instructed by Parent in writing prior to the Closing) (the
"Retention Plan" and the Company RSUs issued under the Retention Plan, the
"Retention RSUs" and the Company Options issued under the Retention Plan, the
"Retention Options"), to be effective immediately prior to the Effective Time
(the aggregate value based on Parent's methodology of calculating the value of
equity grants). Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Retention Option
will automatically be canceled and substituted for as provided in Section
1.6(a)(i)(B). Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Retention RSU will
automatically be canceled and substituted for as provided for in Section
1.6(a)(iii). For the avoidance of doubt, the Retention Plan, the Retention
RSUs and the Retention Options do not constitute a portion of the Merger
Consideration and are not included as Fully Diluted Company Units.

11 month period ended November 30, 2013 (collectively, the "Financial
Statements"). The Financial Statements (a) have been prepared in accordance
with accounting practice generally accepted in the United States of America
("GAAP") (except that the interim period financial statements do not have
notes thereto) applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods indicated
and (b) present fairly in all material respects in accordance with GAAP the
consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as of the dates and for the periods indicated therein

are material). There has been no change in the Company's accounting policies
since December 31, 2012 (the "Company Balance Sheet Date"), except as
described in the Financial Statements. There is no Company Indebtedness.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any "off-balance sheet arrangement" (as
defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC). The Company
maintains a system of internal accounting controls which provide reasonable
assurances that (i) transactions are executed in accordance with management's
authorization, and (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP, as consistently
applied by the Company, and to maintain accountability for assets (such
systems and processes are herein referred to as the "Financial Controls").
None of the Company, its Subsidiaries, their respective officers, managers or
directors nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, the Company's independent
auditors has identified or been made aware of any complaint, allegation,
deficiency, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the
Financial Controls or Financial Statements. To the Knowledge of the Company,
there have been no instances of fraud by any officer or employee of the

would reasonably be expected to result in, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company. (b)Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any material
Liabilities except for those (1) reflected in, reserved against or shown on

material respect in each case, as currently conducted by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, except as
set forth in Section 2.7 of the Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has entered into (i) any customer or other similar
Contract that materially limits the freedom of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to engage or participate, or compete with any other person, in
any line of business, market or geographic area, or to make use of any Company
Intellectual Property, or (ii) any Contract under which the Company or any of

all right, title and interest in and to (including the sole right to enforce)
the Owned Company Intellectual Property, free and clear of all Encumbrances,
other than Permitted Encumbrances, and has not (1) licensed any such Owned

such Registered Company Intellectual Property or entered into agreement
obligating the Subject Person to make such an assignment, is listed in the
records of the appropriate Governmental Authority, as the sole owner of each

proprietary protocols or standards developed or promulgated by any Person
except to the extent the Company is licensed under such protocol or standard
pursuant to a Contract listed in Section 2.8(d)(ii) of the Disclosure

the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in or with respect to such Licensed
Company Intellectual Property.

Secret included in the Company Intellectual Property, nor has any such Trade
Secret been disclosed, other than pursuant to a valid and enforceable

included), or breach of any obligations of confidentiality with respect to the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or the Company Intellectual Property.

(h)IP Assignments. Each current and former employee, officer, consultant and
contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or Person retained by

interest in and to any Intellectual Property and Intellectual Property Rights
arising from that Person's work for or on behalf of the Company or such
Subsidiary, and (2) waive any right to receive any further compensation with
respect to such assignment. To the Knowledge of the Company, no Subject Person

similar agreement or (ii) has any ownership, license or other right, title or
interest, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, in any Company
Intellectual Property.

limiting the foregoing, as of the date hereof, except as set forth in Section
2.6 or Section 2.8(j) of the Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries has received any correspondence asking or inviting the

respects with all agreements applicable to any Open Source that is or has been
incorporated into, integrated or bundled with or linked with any Company
Products. No Software included in the Owned Company Intellectual Property is
or has become subject to any Open Source license. Any written Open Source
policies of the Company or its Subsidiaries are listed in Section 2.8(k) of
the Disclosure Schedule, and complete and accurate copies thereof have been
Made Available to Parent. The Company and its Subsidiaries have not materially
deviated from or materially violated the Company's or its Subsidiaries'
policies with respect to Open Source. "Open Source" means Software that is
distributed under an open source license such as (by way of example only) the
GNU General Public License, GNU Lesser General Public License, Apache License,
Mozilla Public License, BSD License, MIT License, Common Public License, the
Artistic License, the Eclipse Public License, Netscape Public License, the
Open Software License, the Sleepycat License, the Common Development and

and not related to any infringement or other violation by the licensee or
potential licensee).

(m)Standards Bodies. The Company and its Subsidiaries are neither directly
involved nor otherwise participating in any standard-setting organizations,
industry bodies and other standards-related activities. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries have any Contracts with or are participating in
any collaborative efforts with industry bodies or consortia or other multi-
party special interest groups or activities.

(n)Source Code Release. Except as set forth on Section 2.8(n) of the
Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any
Person acting on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has
disclosed or delivered to any third party, agreed to or permitted the
disclosure or delivery to any escrow agent or other Person of, any Company
Source Code. No event has occurred, and no circumstance or condition exists,
that (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) will, or would
reasonably be expected to, require the disclosure or delivery by the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries or any other Person acting on behalf of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to any third party of any Company Source Code. Neither
the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of any of the
Transactions, in and of itself, would reasonably be expected to result in the
release of any Company Source Code from escrow or otherwise trigger any rights
to any Company Source Code to be granted to any Person. "Company Source Code"
means, collectively, any human readable Software source code, or any material
portion or aspect of the Software source code, or any material proprietary
information or algorithm contained, embedded or implemented in, in any manner,

Disclosure Schedule, there have been no prohibited transactions or breaches of
any of the duties imposed by ERISA on "fiduciaries" (within the meaning of

the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(d)Each Employee Benefit Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code is so qualified and has heretofore been determined by the IRS to be
so qualified, and each trust created thereunder has heretofore been determined
by the IRS to be exempt from tax under the provisions of Section 501(a) of the
Code, and nothing has occurred since the date of any such determination that
could reasonably be expected to give the IRS grounds to revoke such
determination. (e)Neither the Company nor any member of the Controlled Group has or has had

meaning of Section 501(c)(17) of the Code). Except as set forth in Section
2.10(h) of the Disclosure Schedule, no Employee Benefit Plan is a self-insured

(m)Except as set forth in Section 2.10(m) of the Disclosure Schedule or with
respect to a Foreign Benefit Plan, with respect to any insurance policy
providing funding for benefits under any Employee Benefit Plan, there is no
liability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the nature of a
retroactive rate adjustment, loss sharing arrangement or other actual or
contingent liability, nor would there be any such liability if such insurance
policy was terminated at or after the Closing Date.

(n)Except with respect to a Foreign Benefit Plan, the Company or one of its
Subsidiaries has the right to amend or terminate each of the Employee Benefit
Plans without the consent of any other Person, provided that such amendment or
termination does not reduce the accrued benefits of any participants or
beneficiaries.

(o)All contributions required to be paid with respect to workers' compensation
arrangements of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries have been made or

or its Subsidiaries.

(q)Except as set forth in Section 2.10(q) of the Disclosure Schedule, neither
the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
Transactions will, alone or in combination with any other event (including the
termination of employment or service with Parent or the Company or one of its
Subsidiaries following the Merger), (1) result in any payment (including,
without limitation, severance, unemployment compensation or golden parachute)
becoming due under any Employee Benefit Plan, (2) increase any benefits
(including severance, deferred compensation and equity benefits) otherwise
payable under any Employee Benefit Plan, (3) result in the acceleration of the
time of payment or vesting of any such benefits to any extent, or (4) result
in the forgiveness in whole or in part of any outstanding loans made by the
Company to any Person.

(r)Except for Foreign Benefit Plans identified on Section 2.10(a) of the
Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is
required to contribute to any Employee Benefit Plan by Law or applicable
custom of any jurisdiction outside the United States. The Foreign Benefit
Plans have been maintained, operated and administered in all material respects
in compliance with all Laws and all contributions required to be made with
respect to such Foreign Benefit Plans have been made or accrued. (s)Each Employee Benefit Plan that is a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan (within the meaning of Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) has been
maintained in compliance in all material respects with Section 409A of the

payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code.

connection with any redundancy, reduction in force, mass layoff, or plant

promulgated thereunder (the "Proposed Allocation").

(ii)Parent will deliver a copy of the Proposed Allocation to the
Representative within 120 days following the Closing (or 30 days following the
determination of the Final Working Capital) and to the extent that such
Proposed Allocation is deemed unreasonable by the Representative, the
Representative will have the right to object in writing within 30 days of such
delivery. If the Representative does not properly object to the Proposed
Allocation, then the Proposed Allocation will become the final allocation for
purposes of Section 1060 of the Code (the "Final Allocation"). If the
Representative properly objects to the Proposed Allocation, Parent and the
Representative will use commercially reasonable efforts for a period of 30 days (or such longer period as they may mutually agree) to
resolve the dispute. During such 30 day period, Parent and the Representative
will have access to the working papers, schedules and calculations of the
other used in the preparation of the Proposed Allocation. If, at the end of
such period, Parent and the Representative are unable to resolve such dispute,
then such dispute will be referred to a Settlement Accountant. Parent and the
Representative will enter into reasonable and customary arrangements for the
services to be rendered by the Settlement Accountant. The Settlement
Accountant will be directed to resolve the dispute as promptly as practicable
(and in any event within 30 days from the date that the dispute is submitted
to it). Parent and the Representative will each furnish to the Settlement
Accountant such work papers and other documents and information relating to
the disputed issues, and will answer questions as the Settlement Accountant
may reasonably request. The determination of the Settlement Accountant will be
final, conclusive and binding on the parties hereto, and will be the Final
Allocation. Parent, on the one hand, and the Representative, on the other hand
shall each bear 50% of the costs and expenses of the Settlement Accountant
arising out of services performed pursuant to this Section 4.15(d).

(iii)The Final Allocation will be binding on Parent, the Unitholders and each
of their Affiliates for all purposes (including financial accounting purposes,
financial and regulatory reporting purposes, and Tax purposes). The
Representative and Parent will prepare and timely file IRS Form 8594 (Asset
Acquisition Statement under Section 1060 of the Code) including any required
attachments or supplements thereto, which will reflect and be consistent with
the Final Allocation and any adjustments thereto to the extent required by
applicable Law. Neither Parent nor the Unitholders will take, nor permit any
of their Affiliates to take, for federal, state or local income tax purposes
any position (whether in audits, Tax Returns, or otherwise) that is
inconsistent with the Final Allocation unless otherwise required by applicable
Law. Any adjustments to the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Agreement
will result in an adjustment to the Final Allocation in accordance with
Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.

(e)Sales, Use and Other Taxes. The Parent, on the one hand, and the
Indemnifying Securityholders, on the other hand, will be liable for 50% of,
and will pay when due, any transfer, gains, documentary, sales, use,
registration, stamp, value-added or other similar Taxes ("Transfer Taxes")
which may be payable by reason of the Merger. Parent will prepare and file (or
cause to be filed) all required or advisable Transfer Tax forms, and the
Representative agrees to cooperate with Parent and to execute such Transfer
Tax forms to the extent required by applicable Law. The parties shall
cooperate with each other and use their commercially reasonable efforts to
minimize the Transfer Taxes attributable to the Merger. No later than ten (10)
Business Days prior to the Closing, the parties will mutually agree on a
reasonable estimate of the amount of Transfer Taxes to be paid. Fifty percent
(50%) of such estimate shall be retained by Parent from the Merger
Consideration otherwise payable to the Indemnifying Securityholders hereunder
and applied by Parent to satisfy the Indemnifying Securityholders' obligation
to pay its portion of the Transfer Taxes. Parent shall pay, or cause to be
paid, any such Transfer Tax to the applicable taxing authority. If the amount
retained by Parent from the Purchase Price is greater than or less than the
Indemnifying Securityholders' allocated portion of the Transfer Taxes as
provided herein, the Indemnifying Securityholders shall reimburse Parent, or
Parent shall reimburse the Indemnifying Securityholders, the amount underretained or overretained, whichever is applicable, promptly upon
determination of such amount.

(f)Tax Treatment of Transaction. The parties hereto agree that, solely for
federal, state and local income Tax purposes, the transaction will be treated
pursuant to Revenue Ruling 99-6, 1991-1 CB 432 as (i) a sale of the Company
Units by the Unitholders, and (ii) a deemed purchase of the assets of the
Company by the Parent and a deemed assumption of the liabilities of the
Company by the Parent. The parties hereto agree not to take any position on
any income Tax Return or audit or other proceeding with respect to Taxes that
is inconsistent with the treatment set forth in this Section 4.15(f).

(g)Section 338(g) Election. The Company agrees that Parent will have the
right, in its sole discretion, to make an election under Section 338(g) of the
Code and any comparable election under state or local Tax Law (the "Section
338(g) Elections") with respect to the Foreign Subsidiaries. Parent will be
responsible for the preparation and filing of all Tax Returns and forms (the
"Section 338 Forms") required under applicable law to be filed in connection
with making the Section 338(g) Elections. If the Section 338(g) Elections are
made by Parent, the Parties will allocate the Merger Consideration and any
other amounts required by the Code or Treasury Regulations to be allocated in
the manner required by Section 338 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder. Such allocation will be used for purposes of
determining the aggregate deemed sales price under the applicable Treasury
Regulations and in reporting the deemed sale of assets of the applicable
Foreign Subsidiaries in connection with the Section 338(g) Elections. Parent
shall be responsible for all Taxes imposed on the Company or any Unitholder
attributable to the making of any Section 338(g) Election in accordance with
this Section 4.15(g).

(h)Tax Filings. Prior to the Closing, the Company will file all Tax Returns
that are required to be filed by it as of the Closing Date.

(i)Intercompany Agreements. Prior to the Closing, the Company and its
Subsidiaries will enter into intercompany agreements to document their
intercompany sales, services and other transactions for purposes of the
relevant transfer pricing laws, including Treasury Regulations promulgated
under Section 482 of the Code, in the forms attached hereto as Exhibit J.

(j)Resale Certificates. Prior to the Closing, the Company will obtain and
deliver to Parent resale certificates from all of its and its Subsidiaries'
resellers and distributors.

Section 4.16 280G Approval.

(a)No later than the Closing Date, to the extent applicable, the Company's
foreign subsidiaries shall submit for approval the payment of any amount or
the provision of any benefit that would not be deductible by reason of Section
280G of the Code ("Parachute Payments") to a vote of the Company (as sole
owner of the foreign subsidiary) in a manner that satisfies all applicable
requirements of Code Section 280G(b)(5)(B) and the Treasury regulations
thereunder in all material respects (the "280G Approval"). To the extent any
individual has the legal right to a payment or benefit that would constitute a
Parachute Payment if the 280G Approval does not occur, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain, prior to the date of the 280G Approval, an agreement from such
individual to waive his or her rights to receive any amount in excess of the
permissible maximum payment amount specified under Code Section
280G(b)(2)(A)(ii) if the 280G Approval does not occur.

(b)Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, no
individual who is a disqualified individual (as defined in Section 280G of the
Code) with respect to a foreign corporation shall be entitled to any benefit
or payment provided under this Agreement (including, without limitation, any
Retention RSUs, Retention Options, bonus under Schedule 4.2(q) or acceleration
pursuant to Schedule 1.6) that would, when combined with other payments and
benefits, constitute a "parachute payment" under Section 280G of the Code,
unless, prior to Closing the Company has approved such payments in accordance
with the 280G Approval.

Section 4.17 Indemnification of Covered Persons.

(a)Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification existing as

the Effective Time in favor of the current or former managers, directors,
officers or other employees of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries
currently indemnified by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively,
the "Covered Persons") as provided by statute or in their respective
constitutional documents or the indemnity agreements listed on Schedule 4.17
will survive the transactions contemplated by the terms of this Agreement and
will continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms for a

and will cause the Surviving Entity to, honor the foregoing indemnification
obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries for acts or omissions by such
Covered Persons occurring on or prior to the Effective Time.

(b)At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company will purchase a prepaid
directors' and officers' liability insurance "run-off policy" with a claims
period of six years from the Closing Date, and on terms and conditions no less
favorable to the Covered Persons than those in effect under the Company's
existing directors' and officers' liability insurance policy in effect on the
date hereof, for the benefit of the Covered Persons with respect to their acts
and omissions as managers, directors, officers and employees of the Company or
its Subsidiaries occurring prior to the Effective Time.

(c)The provisions of this Section 4.17 are (i) intended to be for the benefit
of, and will be specifically enforceable by, each Covered Person, and each
such Person's heirs, legatees, representatives, successors and assigns, it
being expressly agreed that such Persons will be third party beneficiaries of
this Section 4.17, and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have
by contract or otherwise.

(d)The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Entity pursuant to this Section
4.17 (A) will be subject to the limitations imposed by applicable law, (B) do

Indemnifying Securityholder who is also an officer, manager or director of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries from his, her or its indemnification obligations as an Indemnifying Securityholder under Article 7
hereof (and no Indemnifying Securityholder or any affiliate of such
Indemnifying Securityholder will have any right of contribution,
indemnification or right of advancement from the Surviving Entity or Parent
with respect to any indemnification payments that such Indemnifying
Securityholder is required to pay to an Indemnified Person pursuant to Article
7 hereof); and (C) do not require the Surviving Entity or Parent to advance
expenses to an individual in respect of any good faith claim by an Indemnified
Person regarding fraud by such individual relating to this Agreement or any
Related Agreement.

Section 4.18 Further Assurances. On the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto will, and will cause
their respective Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts, and
will cooperate with the other parties hereto, to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, appropriate
or desirable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the Merger and the other Transactions, including the satisfaction
of the respective conditions set forth in Article 5.

Section 4.19 Termination of 401(k) Plan. Unless requested by Parent at least
five Business Days prior to the Closing not to take such action, the board of
managers of the Company will adopt a resolution terminating the AirWatch
401(k) and Profit Sharing Plan effective as of the day prior to the Closing
and will provide evidence of such termination acceptable to Parent prior to
the Closing. Parent or its Affiliates will take all action necessary to permit
its qualified 401(k) Plan to accept direct rollovers from the Company's 401(k)
Plan and Profit Sharing Plan, including loan rollover if permitted by the
AirWatch 401(k) and Profit Sharing Plan.

Section 4.22 Standards Organizations. The Company will, and will cause each of
its Subsidiaries not to enter into or join any standards-setting
organizations, collaborative efforts with universities or industry bodies and
consortia, and other similar multi-party special interest groups and
activities.

Section 4.23 Promissory Notes.

(a)If the Loan Triggering Condition is met on June 1, 2014, then Parent will
loan $25,000,000 to the Company, and in consideration for and prior to the
funding of such loan, the Company will issue Parent a promissory note, in the
same principal amount, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit K.

(b)If the Loan Triggering Condition is met on September 1, 2014, then Parent
will loan $25,000,000 to the Company, and in consideration for and prior to

amount, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit K.

Section 4.24 Certain Company Options. Immediately prior to the Effective Time,
the Company will cancel each unvested option to purchase Company Units held by
Australian service providers (an "AUS Company Option") and will substitute
each such AUS Company Option with a Company RSU (an "AUS Company RSU"). The
number of units subject to an AUS Company RSU will be determined by dividing
(x) the product of (i) the number of Company Units subject to such AUS Company
Option immediately prior to such cancellation and (ii) the excess of the Per
Unit Consideration over the per unit exercise price of such AUS Company Option
by (y) the Per Unit Consideration, rounded down to the nearest whole unit. The
AUS Company RSUs will continue to have, and be subject to, the same material
terms and conditions of the AUS Company Option as are in effect immediately
prior to such cancellation, including the vesting conditions. No later than
five Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company will take all action
necessary or appropriate to effect the treatment of AUS Company Options
provided for under this Section 4.24 under the Company Equity Plans, all
Contracts governing the terms of all AUS Company Options, and under any other
plan or arrangement to which the Company is a party or by which the Company
may be bound, including obtaining any required consent contemplated thereby.
The Company will not solicit any consents or other approvals from the holders
of any AUS Company Options unless and until Parent has reviewed and approved
all notices and related documentation (including any email messages and
notifications) to be sent to such holders (which approval will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed). For the avoidance of doubt: (i) immediately
prior to the Effective Time, each AUS Company RSU will automatically be
canceled and substituted with Replacement RSUs as provided for in Section
1.6(a)(iii) and (ii) this provision shall not apply to any In-the-Money Vested
Option held by Australian service providers; such In-the-Money Vested Options
shall be treated as provided in Section 1.6.

Section 4.25 Company Options and Company RSUs. At least ten Business Days
prior to the Closing, the Company will make available to Parent true and
complete copies of all award agreements evidencing Company Options and Company
RSUs, as amended or supplemented.

that is qualified by "material," "in all material respects" or "Material
Adverse Effect" or any similar term or limitation is so true and correct, and
the amount of Losses arising out of, related to or resulting from such
inaccuracy, misrepresentation or breach will be determined as if "material,"
"in all material respects," "Material Adverse Effect" or similar terms were
not included therein,

(ii)any breach of or default in connection with any of the covenants or
agreements made by the Company in this Agreement, any Related Agreement or any
certificate or other document required to be delivered to Parent or Merger Sub
in accordance with this Agreement,

(iii)any Taxes imposed on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries attributable
to any period or portion thereof ending on or before the Closing Date, but
with respect to the Taxes for periods covered by the Financial Statements only
to the extent that such Taxes exceed the amount of accrued liabilities for
Taxes (not including for this purpose any Taxes that reflect timing
differences between book and Tax income) reflected on the face of the Financial Statements or the final Closing Statement (the "Pre-Closing Tax
Liabilities") and any Transfer Taxes,

(iv)any amount by which the actual Third Party Expenses exceeds the Estimated
Third Party Expenses,

(v)any post-closing adjustment to the Working Capital recoverable by Parent in
accordance with Section 1.7(e) (without the requirement of filing a General
Claims Notice pursuant to Article 7),

(vi)any inaccuracy or omission in the Spreadsheet, including any amounts set
forth therein that are paid to a Person in excess of the amounts such Person
is entitled to receive pursuant to this Agreement or any amounts a Person was
entitled to receive pursuant to this Agreement that were omitted from the
Spreadsheet,

(vii)any claim by an Indemnifying Securityholder with respect to the actions
or omissions of the Representative, including any claim for fraud or
misrepresentation, breach or non-fulfillment of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement made by the Representative in this Agreement or in the
Escrow Agreement, and

(viii)fraud by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or any officer, manager,
or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the
diligence related to the Transactions, or the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement, and the Related Agreements.

(b)In the case of any taxable period that includes but does not end on the
Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), the amount of Pre-Closing Tax Liabilities
based on or measured by income or receipts or relating to any sales or use Tax
will be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of
business on the Closing Date, and the amount of any Pre-Closing Tax
Liabilities not based on or measured by income or receipts or relating to any
sales or use Tax for a Straddle Period will be deemed to be the amount of such
Tax for the entire period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of days in the portion of the Straddle Period ending at the end of
the day that is the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of
days in such Straddle Period.

(c)If elected by Parent in its sole discretion, Indemnified Persons may, at
any time during the General Escrow Claim Period, recover Losses pursuant to
Section 9 of an Indemnifying Securityholder's Joinder Agreement from the
proceeds that would otherwise be payable to such Indemnifying Securityholder
out of the General Escrow Fund.

Section 7.3 Limitations on General Indemnification.

(a)Subject to the following sentence, the Indemnified Persons may not recover
Losses from the General Escrow Fund or the Indemnifying Securityholders in
respect of any claim for indemnification under Section 7.2(a)(i) unless and
until Losses have been incurred or paid in an aggregate amount greater than
$500,000 (the "Indemnification Threshold"). Notwithstanding the foregoing
sentence, the Indemnified Persons will be entitled to recover for, and the
Indemnification Threshold will not apply to, any Losses with respect to any
breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made in Section 2.2
(Capitalization), Section 2.3(a) (Authority) or Section 2.9 (Taxes) (the
"Fundamental Company Representations"). Once the Indemnification Threshold has
been exceeded for all Losses incurred or paid (without counting any Losses
resulting from breaches of or inaccuracies in Fundamental Company
Representations), the Indemnified Persons will be entitled to recover for all
such Losses exceeding the Indemnification Threshold, subject to this Article
7.

(b)Recovery by Indemnified Persons of their Losses will be subject to the
following limitations:

(i)Other than with respect to breaches of or inaccuracies in any Fundamental
Company Representations, an Indemnified Person may recover Losses pursuant to
Section 7.2(a)(i) only from the General Escrow Fund.

(ii)With respect to breaches of or inaccuracies in the Fundamental Company
Representations, an Indemnified Person may recover all of its Losses (A) first
from the General Escrow Fund, and (B)(1) if the aggregate of all unresolved or
unsatisfied General Liability Claims (including General Liability Claims for
breaches or inaccuracies in the Fundamental Company Representations) set forth
in all General Claims Notices delivered to the Escrow Agent and the
Representative prior to the General Claim Period Expiration Date exceeds the
then-existing General Escrow Fund or (2) after the General Claim Period
Expiration Date, directly from each Indemnifying Securityholder, severally and
not jointly, in a pro rata amount according to its Aggregate Escrow Funding
Percentage of such Loss, up to the Merger Consideration received by it
pursuant to Section 1.4(c) and Section 1.6 (exclusive of such Indemnifying
Securityholder's portion of amounts paid to Indemnified Persons under this
Agreement from the General Escrow Fund and Litigation Escrow Fund).

(iii)With respect to Losses claimed under Sections 7.2(a)(ii) to Section
7.2(a)(vii) an Indemnified Person may recover all of its Losses (A) first from
the General Escrow Fund, and (B)(1) if the aggregate of all unresolved or
unsatisfied General Liability Claims set forth in all General Claims Notices
delivered to the Escrow Agent and the Representative prior to the General
Claim Period Expiration Date exceeds the then-existing General Escrow Fund or
(2) after the General Claim Period Expiration Date, directly from each
Indemnifying Securityholder, severally and not jointly, in a pro rata amount
according to its Aggregate Escrow Funding Percentage of such Loss, up to the
Merger Consideration received by it pursuant to Section 1.4(c) and Section 1.6
(exclusive of such Indemnifying Securityholder's portion of amounts paid to
Indemnified Persons under this Agreement from the General Escrow Fund and
Litigation Escrow Fund).

(iv)With respect to Losses claimed under Section 7.2(a)(viii), an Indemnified
Person may recover (A) first from the General Escrow Fund, and (B)(1) if the
aggregate of all unresolved or unsatisfied General Liability Claims set forth
in all General Claims Notices delivered to the Escrow Agent and the
Representative prior to the General Claim Period Expiration Date exceeds the
then-existing General Escrow Fund or (2) after the General Claim Period
Expiration Date, directly from each Indemnifying Securityholder, severally and
not jointly, such Securityholder's Aggregate Escrow Funding Percentage of such
Loss, up to the Merger Consideration received by it pursuant to Section 1.4(c)
and Section 1.6 (exclusive of such Indemnifying Securityholder's portion of amounts paid to Indemnified
Persons under this Agreement from the General Escrow Fund and Litigation
Escrow Fund), provided, however, that Indemnified Persons will not be so
limited in the amounts recoverable from those Indemnifying Securityholders who
committed such fraud.

(v)No Indemnified Person may recover Losses claimed under Section 7.2 for
Losses that are indemnified for pursuant to Section 7.9 and the General Escrow
Fund shall not be applicable to any indemnifiable Losses covered by Section
7.9.

(c)Except as otherwise required by applicable Law, the parties will treat any
indemnification payments made hereunder as an adjustment to the Merger
Consideration as specified in Section 1.4 for accounting and Tax purposes
except to the extent that the Laws of a particular jurisdiction provide
otherwise.

(d)No Indemnifying Securityholder will have any right of contribution, right
of indemnity or other right or remedy against Parent or the Surviving Entity
in connection with any indemnification obligation or any other liability to
which such Indemnifying Securityholder may become subject under or in
connection with this Agreement.

(e)If an Indemnifying Securityholder has indemnified any Indemnified Person
under this Article 7 for any Losses that are actually recovered by the
Indemnified Person under any of the policies of insurance set forth in Section
2.13 of the Disclosure Schedule (net of any increases in premiums to the
extent arising out of the relevant Loss and costs of recovery), then the
Indemnified Person will reimburse the Indemnifying Securityholders in the
event of recovery (net of any increases in premiums to the extent arising out
of the relevant Loss and costs of recovery) by such Indemnified Person under
any such occurrence-based insurance subsequent to any indemnification payment
hereunder with respect thereto being made. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section 7.3(e), with respect to any reductions to the amount
of Losses recoverable as a result of the foregoing sentence, (i) the amount
deemed to be recovered by an Indemnified Person under any of the policies of
insurance set forth in Section 2.13 of the Disclosure Schedule will be net of
(A) any deductible or retention amount for such policy and net of any increase
in the premium for such policy to the extent arising out of the relevant Loss
and (B) the difference between a new or replacement policy and the old or
replaced policy in the event such claim for coverage causes the non-renewal or
cancellation of the old or replaced policy, and the amount of any such
deductibles, retention amounts, increases or differences will not be deemed to
be excluded from the amount of Losses with respect to the applicable claim,
and (ii) for clarification and avoidance of doubt, neither Parent nor any
Indemnified Person will have any obligation or otherwise be required in any
way to initiate or seek an insurance recovery, or await any recovery of, or
mitigate in any way or manner, any portion of the subject Losses from any
insurance carrier prior to exercising its rights of indemnification hereunder,
nor will anything in this sentence be construed to reduce, dilute or otherwise
impair the rights of Parent or any Indemnified Party hereunder.

(f)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 7.2(a),
Losses will exclude punitive and exemplary damages, except to the extent
actually recovered by a third party from an Indemnified Person. Section 7.4 Survival; General Escrow Claim Period.

(a)Survival. The representations and warranties of the Company contained in or
made pursuant to this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant to
this Agreement, and the indemnity obligations related thereto, will survive in
full force and effect until the 18th month anniversary of the Closing Date;
provided, however, that (a) the representations of the Company set forth in
Section 2.2 (Capitalization) and Section 2.3(a) (Authority), and the indemnity
obligations related thereto, will survive in perpetuity and (b) the
representations of the Company set forth in Section 2.9 (Taxes) and the
indemnity obligations related thereto, will survive until 30 days following
the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, after giving effect
to any waiver, mitigation or extension. The representations and warranties of
Parent and Merger Sub contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement or in
any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement will survive in full
force until the Effective Time. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, each covenant hereunder will survive the Closing indefinitely or in
accordance with its terms.

(b)General Escrow Claim Period.

(i)The period during which claims for indemnification from the General Escrow
Fund may be initiated (the "General Escrow Claim Period") will commence on the
Closing Date and terminate at 11:59 p.m. California time on the date that is
18 months after the Closing Date (the "General Claim Period Expiration Date").
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement
to the contrary, (a) on the General Claim Period Expiration Date, such portion
of the General Escrow Fund as may be necessary in the reasonable judgment of
Parent to satisfy any unresolved or unsatisfied General Liability Claims
specified in any General Claims Notice delivered to the Escrow Agent prior to
the General Claim Period Expiration Date will remain in the General Escrow
Fund until such General Liability Claims have been resolved or satisfied and
(b) the General Escrow Fund may be continued pursuant to a court order or
other dispute resolution mechanism.

(ii)Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement to the contrary, each Indemnifying Securityholder who is an
Installment Party will not be paid his or her Unvested Escrow Portion at the
General Claim Period Expiration Date, and Parent will be entitled to receive
such amount. "Unvested Escrow Portion" as to an Installment Party means
initially 100% of such Installment Party's Unit General Escrow Contribution
plus Option General Escrow Contribution, with a portion thereof vesting and no
longer being treated as an "Unvested Escrow Portion" on the dates and in the
amounts set forth on Schedule 7.4,, and subject to the provisions for earlier
vesting and forfeiture set forth in Schedule 7.4. For the avoidance of doubt
(i) Parent will be entitled to receive any Unvested Escrow Portion immediately
upon an Installment Party's termination of employment with Parent, subject to
the provisions of Schedule 7.4, and (ii) no forfeiture of an Unvested Escrow
Portion will in any way decrease or otherwise alter an Installment Party's
Aggregate Escrow Funding Percentage for General Liability Claims, whether
arising before or after the termination of an Installment Party's employment.

(iii)Payments to Indemnifying Securityholders that are Installment Parties
from the General Escrow Fund following the General Claim Period Expiration
Date will be made, in the sole discretion of Parent, in cash or registered Parent Common
Stock eligible for immediate resale. If Parent elects to pay such amounts in
Parent Common Stock, then (i) the Parent will so notify the Escrow Agent and
the Escrow Agent will promptly return all cash amounts in the General Escrow
Fund attributable to such Installment Parties to Parent and (ii) the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock will be determined based on dividing the amount
to be paid by the closing price of Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock
Exchange as reported on www.nyse.com for the trading day immediately preceding
the General Claim Period Expiration Date. Parent shall provide such
Installment Party 30 days written notice of its intent to pay such amounts in
Parent Common Stock.

Section 7.5 Claims for General Indemnification. At any time that an
Indemnified Person desires to claim a Loss that it believes is or may be
indemnifiable under Section 7.2 (a "General Liability Claim"), Parent will
deliver a notice of such General Liability Claim (a "General Claims Notice")
to the Representative. With respect to a General Liability Claim under Section
7.2(a) against the General Escrow Fund, at the same time Parent delivers a
General Claims Notice to the Representative, Parent will deliver a General
Claims Notice to the Escrow Agent. A General Claims Notice must (A) be signed
by an officer of Parent, (B) describe the General Liability Claim in
reasonable detail and (C) indicate the amount of the Loss that has been or may
be paid, suffered, sustained or accrued by the Indemnified Persons. To the
extent that the amount of a Loss is not determinable as of the date of
delivery of a General Claims Notice, Parent may deliver a General Claims
Notice stating the maximum amount of Loss that Parent in good faith estimates
or anticipates that an Indemnified Person may pay or suffer; provided,
however, that Parent's provision of an estimated or anticipated amount of Loss
will not limit the Loss recoverable or recovered by an Indemnified Person. No
delay in or failure to give a General Claims Notice by Parent to the
Representative (or in the case of a General Liability Claim seeking recovery
from the General Escrow Fund, the Escrow Agent) pursuant to this Section 7.5
will adversely affect the Indemnified Parties' right to indemnification under
this Article 7 that Parent has under this Agreement or alter or relieve any
parties to this Agreement of their obligations to indemnify the Indemnified
Persons pursuant to this Article 7, except and to the extent that such delay
or failure has materially prejudiced such parties and except with respect to
such delay or failure that prevents the delivery of the General Claims Notice
from delivery prior to the expiration of the General Escrow Claim Period.

Section 7.6 Objections to and Payment of General Claims.

(a)The Representative may object to any General Liability Claim set forth in
such General Claims Notice by delivering written notice to Parent (with a copy
to the Escrow Agent if a General Claims Notice was delivered to the Escrow
Agent) of the Representative's objection (a "General Objection Notice"). Such
General Objection Notice must describe the grounds for such objection in
reasonable detail.

(b)If a General Objection Notice is not delivered by the Representative to
Parent (with a copy to the Escrow Agent if a General Claims Notice was
delivered to the Escrow Agent) within 30 days after delivery by Parent of the
General Claims Notice, such failure to so object will be an irrevocable
acknowledgment by each party to this Agreement (including the Representative)
that the Indemnified Persons are entitled to indemnification under Section 7.2
for the Losses set forth in such General Claims Notice in accordance with this
Article 7. (c)If the General Claims Notice was delivered to the Escrow Agent and no
General Objection Notice was delivered to the Escrow Agent within 30 days of
the delivery of the General Claims Notice to the Representative, or a General
Objection Notice was delivered to the Escrow Agent within 30 days of the
delivery of the General Claims Notice, but such General Objection Notice
objects only with respect to a portion of the Losses claimed in the General
Claims Notice, the Escrow Agent will deliver to Parent as soon as practicable
cash from the General Escrow Fund having a value equal to (1) the amount of
the Losses set forth in such General Claims Notice, if no General Objection
Notice was delivered to the Escrow Agent, or (2) the amount of the portion of
the Losses set forth in such General Claims Notice to which no objection was
made, if a General Objection Notice was delivered to the Escrow Agent;
provided, however, that, to the extent that the amount of the Losses set forth
in the General Claims Notice (or portion thereof) is an estimate, Parent (on
behalf of itself or any other Indemnified Person) will not be so entitled to
receive, and the Escrow Agent will not deliver, funds in respect of such
portions of such estimated Losses unless and until the amount of such
estimated Losses is finally determined.

(d)If, following resolution of a General Liability Claim, recovery directly
from one or more Indemnifying Securityholders is available hereunder with
respect to such Losses, and, if applicable, the entire amount then in the
General Escrow Fund is insufficient to cover Losses that would otherwise be
recoverable from the General Escrow Fund, each Indemnifying Securityholder
will, within ten Business Days of being notified of his, her or its obligation
to pay such Losses, wire transfer to Parent its Aggregate Escrow Funding
Percentage of any such amount.

(e)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Indemnifying Securityholders do not have any individual right to object to any
claim made in a General Claims Notice under this Article 7, and, except as
aforesaid, any and all claims made in a General Claims Notice on behalf of the
Indemnified Persons may be objected to only by the Representative.

Section 7.7 Resolution of Objections to General Claims.

(a)If the Representative objects in writing to any General Liability Claim
made in any General Claims Notice within 30 days after delivery of such
General Claims Notice, the Representative and Parent will attempt in good
faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each
such claim. If the Representative and Parent should so agree, a memorandum
setting forth such agreement will be prepared and signed by both parties and,
except as set forth in the next sentence, within ten days of entering into
such memorandum, each Indemnifying Securityholder will wire transfer to Parent
immediately available funds equal to its Aggregate Escrow Funding Percentage
of the amount of cash agreed to be delivered to Parent in the memorandum. To
the extent that a Liability Claim is recoverable against the General Escrow
Fund, a copy of the memorandum setting forth the agreement will be delivered
to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent will be entitled to rely on any such
memorandum and will distribute the cash as soon as practicable from the
General Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms thereof. (b)If no such agreement can be reached after good-faith negotiation and after
30 days after delivery of a General Objection Notice, either Parent or the
Representative on behalf of the Indemnifying Securityholders may bring an
action against the other to resolve the dispute.

Section 7.8 Third-Party Claims. If Parent receives written notice of a third-
party claim that Parent believes may result in a claim by or on behalf of an
Indemnified Person pursuant to Section 7.2ý, Parent will notify the
Representative of such third-party claim and provide the Representative the
opportunity to participate at the Representative's own cost in, but not direct
or conduct, any defense of such claim. The Representative's participation will
be subject to Parent's right to control such defense and Section 7.16(d).
Parent will have the right in its sole discretion to settle any such claim;
provided, however, that, without the consent of the Representative, no
settlement of any such claim with third-party claimants will be determinative
of the amount of Losses relating to such matter. If the Representative
consents to any such settlement, neither the Representative nor any
Indemnifying Securityholder will have any power or authority to object to the
amount or validity of any claim by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person for
indemnity with respect to such settlement.

Section 7.9 Litigation Indemnification. From and after the Effective Time,
subject to this Article 7, if either of the Litigations has not been finally
settled (pursuant to a settlement agreement approved by Parent) or finally
determined prior to the Closing, John Marshall, Alan Dabbiere and David
Dabbiere (collectively, the "Indemnifying Founders") will, by virtue of the
merger, severally, and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the
Indemnified Persons from and against any and all Losses arising out of,
related to or resulting from any of the Litigations. For the avoidance of
doubt, from and after the Effective Time, (i) Parent will conduct and control
the defense of the Litigations, and (ii) Parent will provide the
Representative the opportunity to participate at the Representative's own cost
in, but not direct or conduct, the defense of the Litigations.

Section 7.10 Limitations on Litigation Indemnification.

(a)An Indemnified Person may recover Losses pursuant to Section 7.9 only from
the Litigation Escrow Fund.

(b)For the avoidance of doubt, the recovery of Losses pursuant to Section 7.9
will not be subject to the Indemnification Threshold or any other deductible.

(c)Except as otherwise required by applicable Law, the parties will treat any
indemnification payments made hereunder as an adjustment to the Merger
Consideration as specified in Section 1.4 for accounting and Tax purposes
except to the extent that the Laws of a particular jurisdiction provide
otherwise, in which case such indemnification payments will be made in amount
sufficient to indemnify the relevant Indemnified Person on an after-Tax basis.

Section 7.11 Litigation Escrow Claim Period.

(a)Litigation Escrow Claim Period. The period during which claims for
indemnification from the Litigation Escrow Fund may be initiated (the
"Litigation Escrow Claim Period") will commence on the Closing Date and
terminate upon the final settlement or other final determination of all disputes or matters outstanding under all
Litigations (the "Litigation Claim Period Expiration Date"). Notwithstanding
anything contained in this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement to the contrary,
(i) on the Litigation Claim Period Expiration Date, such portion of the
Litigation Escrow Fund as may be necessary in the reasonable judgment of
Parent to satisfy any unresolved or unsatisfied Litigation Liability Claims
specified in any Litigation Claims Notice delivered to the Escrow Agent prior
to the Litigation Claim Period Expiration Date will remain in the Litigation
Escrow Fund until such Litigation Liability Claims have been resolved or
satisfied and (ii) the Litigation Escrow Fund may be continued pursuant to a
court order or other dispute resolution mechanism.

Section 7.12 Claims for Litigation Indemnification. At any time that an
Indemnified Person desires to claim a Loss that it believes is or may be
indemnifiable under Section 7.9 (a "Litigation Liability Claim"), Parent will
deliver a notice of such Litigation Liability Claim (a "Litigation Claims
Notice") to the Representative and the Escrow Agent. A Litigation Claims
Notice must (A) be signed by an officer of Parent, (B) describe the Litigation
Liability Claim in reasonable detail and (C) indicate the amount of the Loss
that has been or may be paid, suffered, sustained or accrued by the
Indemnified Persons. To the extent that the amount of a Loss is not
determinable as of the date of delivery of a Litigation Claims Notice, Parent
may deliver a Litigation Claims Notice stating the maximum amount of Loss that
Parent in good faith estimates or anticipates that an Indemnified Person may
pay or suffer; provided, however, that Parent's provision of an estimated or
anticipated amount of Loss will not limit the Loss recoverable or recovered by
an Indemnified Person. No delay in or failure to give a Litigation Claims
Notice by Parent to the Representative and the Escrow Agent pursuant to this
Section 7.12 will adversely affect any of the other rights or remedies that
Parent has under this Agreement or alter or relieve any parties to this
Agreement of their obligations to indemnify the Indemnified Persons pursuant
to this Article 7, except and to the extent that such delay or failure has
materially prejudiced such parties and except for such delay or failure that
would prevent the Litigation Claims Notice from being delivered prior to the
expiration of the Litigation Escrow Claim Period.

Section 7.13 Objections to and Payment of Litigation Claims.

(a)The Representative may object to any Litigation Liability Claim set forth
in such Litigation Claims Notice by delivering written notice to Parent (with
a copy to the Escrow Agent) of the Representative's objection (a "Litigation
Objection Notice"). Such Litigation Objection Notice must describe the grounds
for such objection in reasonable detail.

(b)If a Litigation Objection Notice is not delivered by the Representative to
Parent (with a copy to the Escrow Agent) within 30 days after delivery by
Parent of the Litigation Claims Notice, such failure to so object will be an
irrevocable acknowledgment by each party to this Agreement (including the
Representative) that the Indemnified Persons are entitled to indemnification
under Section 7.9 for the Losses set forth in such Litigation Claims Notice in
accordance with this Article 7.

(c)If the Litigation Claims Notice was delivered to the Escrow Agent and no
Litigation Objection Notice was delivered to the Escrow Agent within 30 days
of the delivery of the Litigation Claims Notice to the Representative, or a
Litigation Objection Notice was delivered to the Escrow Agent within 30 days
of the delivery of the Litigation Claims Notice, but such Litigation Objection Notice objects only with respect to a portion of the
Losses claimed in the Litigation Claims Notice, the Escrow Agent will deliver
to Parent as soon as practicable cash from the Litigation Escrow Fund having a
value equal to (1) the amount of the Losses set forth in such Litigation
Claims Notice, if no Litigation Objection Notice was delivered to the Escrow
Agent, or (2) the amount of the portion of the Losses set forth in such
Litigation Claims Notice to which no objection was made, if a Litigation
Objection Notice was delivered to the Escrow Agent; provided, however, that,
to the extent that the amount of the Losses set forth in the Litigation Claims
Notice (or portion thereof) is an estimate, Parent (on behalf of itself or any
other Indemnified Person) will not be so entitled to receive, and the Escrow
Agent will not deliver, funds in respect of such portions of such estimated
Losses unless and until the amount of such estimated Losses is finally
determined.

(d)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Indemnifying Founders do not have any individual right to object to any claim
made in a Litigation Claims Notice under this Article 7, and, except as
aforesaid, any and all claims made in a Litigation Claims Notice on behalf of
the Indemnified Persons may be objected to only by the Representative.

Section 7.14 Resolution of Objections to Litigation Claims.

(a)If the Representative objects in writing to any Litigation Liability Claim
made in any Litigation Claims Notice within 30 days after delivery of such
Litigation Claims Notice, the Representative and Parent will attempt in good
faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each
such claim. If the Representative and Parent should so agree, a memorandum
setting forth such agreement will be prepared and signed by both parties and a
copy of the memorandum setting forth the agreement will be delivered to the
Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent will be entitled to rely on any such memorandum
and will distribute the cash as soon as practicable from the Litigation Escrow
Fund in accordance with the terms thereof.

(b)If no such agreement can be reached after good-faith negotiation and after
30 days after delivery of a Litigation Objection Notice, either Parent or the
Representative on behalf of the Indemnifying Founders may bring an action
against the other to resolve the dispute. Upon the resolution of such dispute,
a memorandum setting forth such resolution will be prepared and signed by
Parent and the Representative and a copy of the memorandum setting forth the
resolution will be delivered to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent will be
entitled to rely on any such memorandum and will distribute the cash as soon
as practicable from the Litigation Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms
thereof.

Section 7.15 Exclusive Remedy.

(a)Except as expressly set forth otherwise (including without limitation in
Section 7.15(b)), this Article 7 will be the sole and exclusive remedy of the
Indemnified Persons from and after the Closing Date for any claims arising
under this Agreement, including claims of inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation of warranty; provided, however, that the foregoing sentence
will not be deemed a waiver by any party of any right to injunctive relief
pursuant to equitable law. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur to the other party in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed by in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached or threatened
to be breached and that an award of money damages might be inadequate in such
event. Accordingly, each party agrees that the other party will be entitled to
equitable relief, including an order for specific performance to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, in addition to any other remedy to which it is
entitled at law or in equity as a remedy for any such breach or threatened
breach.

(b)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
nothing herein will prevent any Indemnified Person from bringing an Action for
fraud against any Person, including any Indemnifying Securityholder, whose
fraud has caused such Indemnified Person to incur Losses or has limited the
Losses recoverable by such Indemnified Person in such Action. Nothing in this
Agreement will limit the liability of the Company for any misrepresentation or
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement if the Merger is
not consummated.

Section 7.16 Representative.

(a)At the Effective Time, David K. Dabbiere will be constituted and appointed
as the Representative, and the Representative hereby accepts such appointment.
Each Indemnifying Securityholder and Indemnifying Founders, by virtue of its
adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger, will be deemed to have
appointed and constituted the Representative as their agent and true and
lawful attorney-in-fact with the powers and authority as set forth in this
Agreement. All such actions of the Representative taken in accordance with
this Section 7.16 shall be deemed to be facts ascertainable outside the merger
agreement and shall be binding on the Indemnifying Securityholders. The
Representative will be the exclusive agent for and on behalf of the
Indemnifying Securityholders and Indemnifying Founders to (1) enter into the
Escrow Agreement; (2) give and receive notices and communications to or from
Parent (on behalf of itself or any other Indemnified Person) and/or the Escrow
Agent relating to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any of the other
documents contemplated by the Transactions; (3) authorize deliveries to Parent
of cash or other property from the Escrow Funds and legally bind each
Indemnifying Securityholder to pay cash directly to Parent in satisfaction of
claims asserted by Parent (on behalf of itself or any other Indemnified
Person, including by not objecting to such claims); (4) object to such claims
in accordance with Section 7.6 and Section 7.13; (5) consent or agree to,
negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand arbitration
and comply with Orders with respect to, such claims; (6) take all actions
necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Representative for the
accomplishment of the foregoing, in each case without having to seek or obtain
the consent of any Person under any circumstance; (7) subject to Section 6.3,
execute for and on behalf of each Indemnifying Securityholder and Indemnifying
Founder any amendment to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any exhibit,
annex or schedule hereto or thereto (including for the purpose of amending
addresses or sharing percentages), (8) enter into any waiver or extension
pursuant to Section 6.4 and (9) cause to be paid to the Indemnifying
Securityholders any balance of the Representative Fund Amount not used in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. The Representative will be
the sole and exclusive means of asserting or addressing any of the above on
behalf of the Indemnifying Securityholders and Indemnifying Founders, and no
Indemnifying Securityholder or Indemnifying Founder will have any right to act
on its own behalf with respect to any such matters, other than any claim or dispute
against the Representative. This appointment of agency and this power of
attorney is coupled with an interest and will be irrevocable and will not be
terminated by any Indemnifying Securityholder or Indemnifying Founder or by
operation of Law, whether by the death or incapacity of any Indemnifying
Securityholder or Indemnifying Founder or the occurrence of any other event,
and any action taken by the Representative will be as valid as if such death,
incapacity or other event had not occurred, regardless of whether or not any
Indemnifying Securityholder, Indemnifying Founder or the Representative will
have received any notice thereof. All reasonable and documented expenses, if
any, incurred by the Representative in connection with the performance of his,
her or its duties as the Representative in connection with General Liability
Claims will be borne and paid by the Indemnifying Securityholders according to
their Aggregate Escrow Funding Percentage (the "General Representative
Expenses"). All reasonable expenses, if any, incurred by the Representative in
connection with the performance of his, her or its duties as the
Representative in connection with Litigation Liability Claims will be borne
and paid by the Indemnifying Founders according to their Unit Litigation
Funding Percentage (the "Litigation Representative Expenses"). The
Representative will have the right to recover General Representative Expenses
from the Representative Fund as such General Representative Expenses are
incurred. Following the termination of the General Escrow Claim Period, the
resolution of all General Liability Claims and the satisfaction of all claims
made by Indemnified Parties for Losses, the Representative will have the right
to recover General Representative Expenses from the General Escrow Fund, if
and only if no amounts are then remaining in the Representative Fund, prior to
any distribution to the Indemnifying Securityholders, and prior to any such
distribution, will deliver to the Escrow Agent a certificate setting forth the
General Representative Expenses actually incurred with respect to General
Liability Claims; provided, however, that no such expenses shall be recovered
from the cash then on deposit in the General Escrow Fund attributable to an
Indemnifying Securityholder who does not give their prior written consent to
such reimbursement. Following the termination of the Litigation Escrow Claim
Period, the resolution of all Litigation Liability Claims and the satisfaction
of all claims made by Indemnified Parties for Losses, the Representative will
have the right to recover Litigation Representative Expenses from the
Litigation Escrow Fund prior to any distribution to the Indemnifying Founders,
and prior to any such distribution, will deliver to the Escrow Agent a
certificate setting forth the Litigation Representative Expenses actually
incurred with respect to Litigation Liability Claims. In the event that
neither the Representative Fund nor the Litigation Escrow Fund are available
to reimburse the Representative for Litigation Representative Expenses, the
Indemnifying Founders shall indemnify the Representative according to their
Aggregate Litigation Funding Percentage for such expenses. No bond will be
required of the Representative, and the Representative will not receive any
compensation for the Representative's services. Notices or communications to
or from the Representative will constitute notice to or from each of the
Indemnifying Securityholders or Indemnifying Founders, as applicable.

(b)The Person serving as the Representative may be replaced from time to time
by the holders of a majority in interest of the cash then on deposit in the
General Escrow Fund upon not less than ten days' prior written notice to
Parent. The agency of the Representative may be changed only when the Person
serving as the Representative is replaced pursuant to the preceding sentence.
A vacancy in the position of Representative may be filled by the holders of a majority in interest of the cash then on deposit in the
General Escrow Fund. If the Representative refuses or is no longer capable of
serving as the Representative hereunder, then the Indemnifying Securityholders
will promptly appoint a successor Representative who will thereafter be a
successor Representative hereunder, and the Representative will serve until
such successor is duly appointed and qualified to act hereunder. If there is
not a Representative at any time, any obligation to provide notice to the
Representative will be deemed satisfied if such notice is delivered to each of
the Indemnifying Securityholders or Indemnifying Founders, as applicable, at
their addresses last known to Parent.

(c)The Representative will not be liable to any Indemnifying Securityholder or
Indemnifying Founder for any act done or omitted in connection with the
Representative's services under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement while
acting in good faith and any act done or omitted in accordance with the advice
of counsel or other expert will be conclusive evidence of such good faith. The
Indemnifying Securityholders and Indemnifying Founders, as applicable, will
severally, but not jointly (based on their respective Aggregate Escrow Funding
Percentage or Unit Litigation Funding Percentage, as applicable, compared to
the total Aggregate Escrow Funding Percentage or Unit Litigation Funding
Percentage of all of the Indemnifying Securityholders or Indemnifying
Founders, respectively), indemnify the Representative from and against any and
all losses, liabilities, damages, claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures,
actions, fees, costs and expenses (including the reasonable fees and expenses
of counsel and experts and their staffs and all reasonable expense of document
location, duplication and shipment) (collectively, "Representative Losses")
arising out of or in connection with the Representative's execution and
performance of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, in each case in such
person's capacity as the Representative only, and as such Representative Loss
is suffered or incurred; provided, that in the event that any such
Representative Loss or any portion of a Representative Loss is finally
adjudicated to have been directly caused by the gross negligence or bad faith
of the Representative, the Representative will promptly reimburse the
Indemnifying Securityholders or the Indemnifying Founders, as applicable, the
amount of such indemnified Representative Loss to the extent attributable to
such gross negligence or bad faith. With respect to General Liability Claims,
if not paid directly to the Representative by the Indemnifying
Securityholders, any such Representative Losses may be recovered by the
Representative from (i) the funds in the Representative Fund and (ii) the
amounts in the General Escrow Fund at such time as remaining amounts in the
General Escrow Fund would otherwise be distributable to the Indemnifying
Securityholders. With respect to Litigation Liability Claims, if not paid
directly to the Representative by the Indemnifying Founders, any such
Representative Losses may be recovered by the Representative from the amounts
in the Litigation Escrow Fund at such time as remaining amounts in the
Litigation Escrow Fund would otherwise be distributable to the Indemnifying
Founders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, while this section allows the
Representative to be paid from the Representative Fund and the Escrow Funds,
this does not relieve the Indemnifying Securityholders or Indemnifying
Founders, as applicable, from their obligation to promptly pay such
Representative Losses as they are suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent
the Representative from seeking any remedies available to it at law or
otherwise. In no event will the Representative be required to advance its own
funds on behalf of the Indemnifying Securityholders, Indemnifying Founders or
otherwise. The Indemnifying Securityholders and Indemnifying Founders
acknowledge and agree that the foregoing indemnities will survive the
resignation or removal of the Representative or the termination of this
Agreement. (d)The Representative will have reasonable access to information about the
Surviving Entity and its then current officers and employees, as well as the
reasonable assistance of the Company's former officers and employees for
purposes of performing its duties and exercising its rights hereunder;
provided that the Representative will treat confidentially and not use or
disclose the terms of this Agreement or any nonpublic information from or
about Parent, Surviving Entity, or any Indemnified Person to anyone (except to
the Indemnifying Securityholders, Indemnifying Founders or the
Representative's employees, attorneys, accountants, financial advisors or
authorized representatives on a need to know basis, in each case who agree to
treat such information confidentially), provided, however, that neither Parent
nor the Surviving Entity will be obligated to provide such access or
information if it determines, in its reasonable judgment, that doing so would
violate applicable Law or any Contract to which Parent, the Surviving Entity
or any of their Affiliates is a party or obligation of confidentiality owed by
Parent, the Surviving Entity or any of their Affiliates to a third party,
jeopardize the protection of attorney-client privilege or any rights of Parent
or any Indemnified Person under the work-product doctrine or expose Parent or
the Surviving Entity to risk of liability for disclosure of sensitive or
personally identifiable information. The Representative will enter into a
separate confidentiality agreement prior to being provided access to such
information if requested by Parent. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, any pre-Closing attorney-client privileged communications of
the Company and its Subsidiaries that summarize, describe or refer to the
Transactions or to negotiations relating to the Transactions (including all
emails, correspondence, invoices, recordings and other documents or files,
evidencing or reflecting communications between the Company, its Subsidiaries
and their respective counsel, and all files maintained by the Company's or any
of its Subsidiaries' law firm or legal counsel ) (the "Communications") will
not become attorney-client privileged communications of the Surviving Entity,
but will instead become attorney-client privileged Communications of the
Representative; provided, however, that in the case of any good faith
allegation of fraud perpetrated by the Company or its representatives in
connection with the Transactions or negotiations relating to the Transactions,
the Representative hereby agrees to waive the attorney client privilege with
respect to any attorney client communications received or sent by any of Alan
Dabbiere, John Marshall, JP Halebeed, Dan Wardle, Jacki Hertenstein, or David
Dabbiere that would reflect Knowledge of the Company or information Known to
the Company relating to such allegation. The Representative will cause all
Communications stored on the Company's servers prior to the Closing to be
preserved.

(e)The Representative shall (i) reasonably inform each Indemnifying
Securityholder of all material actions taken in its capacity as the
Representative with respect to all material matters arising under or with
respect to this Agreement, (ii) not take any action in its capacity as the
Representative that materially adversely affects the rights or obligations of
any Indemnifying Securityholder in any manner materially different from the
other Indemnifying Securityholders without the prior written consent of such
Indemnifying Securityholder, and (iii) shall not take any action in its
capacity as the Representative (to the extent the Representative has any
authority to do so) to amend, waive or otherwise modify any provision of the
Joinder Agreement with the Insight Unitholders and Accel Unitholders, the last
sentence of Section 1.5(a) or Section 1.4(h) without the prior written consent
of the Indemnifying Securityholder(s) party thereto or effected thereby, as
the case may be. (f)By its signature to this Agreement, the initial Representative hereby
accepts the appointment contained in this Agreement, as confirmed and extended
by this Agreement, and agrees to act as the Representative and to discharge
the duties and responsibilities of the Representative pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement.

Section 7.17 Actions of and Notices to the Representative. Any notice or
communication given to or received by, and any decision, action, failure to
act within a designated period of time, agreement, consent, settlement,
resolution or instruction of, the Representative that is within the scope of
the Representative's authority under Section 7.16(a) will constitute a notice
or communication to or by, or a decision, action, failure to act within a
designated period of time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or
instruction of all Indemnifying Securityholders and will be final, binding and
conclusive upon each such Indemnifying Securityholder. Each Indemnified Person
and the Escrow Agent will be entitled to rely upon any such notice,
communication, decision, action, failure to act within a designated period of
time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction as being a
notice or communication to or by, or a decision, action, failure to act within
a designated period of time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or
instruction of, each and every such Indemnifying Securityholder. Each
Indemnified Person and the Escrow Agent are unconditionally and irrevocably
relieved from any liability to any person for any acts done by them in
accordance with any such notice, communication, decision, action, failure to
act within a designated period of time, agreement, consent or instruction of
the Representative.
