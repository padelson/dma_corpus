of  the Leased Real Property except as set forth in Section 5.18(a)(i) of 
the US Disclosure Memorandum.   (ii) Each Real Property Lease grants the
tenant under the  Real Property Lease the exclusive right to use and occupy
the demised  premises thereunder. Argenbright Security has, or will have as
of the  Closing Date, good and valid title to the leasehold    32  38  
estate under each Real Property Lease to which it is a party, free and  clear
of all Liens, other than Permitted Liens. Argenbright Security  enjoys or
will enjoy as of the Closing Date peaceful and undisturbed  possession under
its respective Real Property Leases of the Leased Real  Property.   (iii)
There are no forfeiture or other similar proceedings  pending or, to the
knowledge of any Argenbright Entity, threatened  affecting any portion of the
Leased Real Property. There is no writ,  injunction, decree, order, award,
ruling, stipulation or judgment  outstanding, nor any action, claim, suit or
proceeding pending or, to  the knowledge of any Argenbright Entity,
threatened relating to the  ownership, lease, use, occupancy or operation by
any Person of any  Leased Real Property.   (iv) Except as set forth in
Section 5.18(a)(iv) of the US  Disclosure Memorandum, the use and operation
of the Leased Real  Property in the conduct of the US Business does not
violate in any  material respect any agreement to which any Argenbright
Entity is a  party or of which any Argenbright Entity is aware affecting the
Leased  Real Property. To the best knowledge of any Argenbright Entity,
there  are no matters affecting the Leased Real Property which might
curtail  or interfere with the use of the Leased Real Property for the
purposes  for which it is used in connection with the US Business.   (v)
The Leased Real Property and the use thereof by  Argenbright Security or any
Argenbright Entity, as applicable, is in  compliance in all material respects
with all applicable building,  zoning or planning, fire, water, health,
environmental and other land  use and similar laws affecting the Leased Real
Property.   (vi) The Leased Real Property is in good operating  condition
and repair.   (vii) The expenditure of substantial sums of money on the 
Leased Real Property by Argenbright Security is not anticipated or  necessary
in the near future.   (b) Other. The Leased Real Property constitutes all
the interests in real property held for use in connection with or necessary
for the conduct of the US Business as now conducted. No Argenbright Entity
has any interest in or any right or obligation to acquire any interest in, or
any residual liability in respect of, any other real property.   Section
5.19 Intellectual Property.   (a) Section 5.19(a) of the US Disclosure
Memorandum sets forth the following information with respect to the US
Intellectual Property Rights owned or licensed and used or held for use by
Argenbright Security or any other Argenbright Entity in connection with the
US Business, specifying as to each, as applicable: (i) the nature of such US
Intellectual Property Right, (ii) the owner of such US Intellectual Property
Right, (iii) the jurisdictions by or in which such US Intellectual Property

numbers and (v) the termination or expiration dates.   (b) Section 5.19(b)
of the US Disclosure Memorandum sets forth a list of all licenses,
sublicenses and other agreements to which Argenbright Security (and the other

pursuant to which any Person (other than an Argenbright Entity) is authorized
to use any US Intellectual Property Right, including (i) the identity of all
parties thereto, (ii) a description of the nature and subject matter thereof,
(iii) the applicable royalty and/or other payments and (iv) the term
thereof.   (c) Argenbright Security has or will have as of the Closing
Date the right to use the US Intellectual Property Rights and the products,
processes and materials covered thereby. In addition, Argenbright Security
has or will have as of the Closing Date the right to sell, license, assign,
transfer, convey or dispose of all rights associated with any trademark,
trade name and service mark, including, but not limited to, the "Argenbright"
name and the Argenbright Logo, which is utilized in connection with the US
Business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the other Argenbright Entities
acknowledge and agree that each Argenbright Entity has the right to sell,
license, assign, transfer and convey all such US Intellectual Property Rights
(excluding computer software licensed from a third party) to Argenbright
Security on or before the Closing Date. To the knowledge of Holdings and the
other Argenbright Entities, all patents and registered trademarks, service
marks, trade names and other company, product or service identifiers and
copyrights held by Argenbright Security or any other Argenbright Entity in
respect to the US Intellectual Property Rights are valid and enforceable.
Neither Argenbright Security nor any other Argenbright Entity is or will be,
as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, in violation or breach of, nor will Argenbright Security or any
other Argenbright Entity forfeit, terminate or in any way impair, any
US Intellectual Property Right whether or not pursuant to any license,
sublicense or agreement with respect to such US Intellectual Property
Rights.   (d) No Argenbright Entity to the extent it is engaged in the
US Business has been a defendant in any action, suit, investigation or
proceeding relating to, or otherwise has been notified of, any alleged claim
of infringement of any US Intellectual Property Right or any claim that the
use of any US Intellectual Property infringes any right of any other Person,
and no Argenbright Entity has any knowledge of any other such infringement,
by Argenbright Security or any other Argenbright Entity and (ii) no
Argenbright Entity has an outstanding claim or suit for, nor has any
knowledge of, any continuing infringement by any other Person of any US
Intellectual Property Rights. To Sellers\' knowledge, no US Intellectual
Property Right is subject to any outstanding judgment, injunction, order,
decree or agreement restricting the use thereof by Argenbright Security or
any other Argenbright Entity or restricting the licensing thereof by
Argenbright Security or any other Argenbright Entity to any Person. Neither
Argenbright Security nor any other Argenbright Entity has entered into any
agreement to indemnify any other Person against any charge of infringement of
any US Intellectual Property Right.   (e) The US Assets will include as of
the Closing Date any and all rights to utilize all software programs,
modules, routines, data, text or graphic files, source or object codes,   
34  40  hardware, firmware and other components of all management
information systems which are used in the operation of the US Business, and
all such management operating systems shall include all written and
electronic documentation which is in the possession of any Argenbright Entity
in respect of the US Business. Except as disclosed in Section 5.19(e) of the
US Disclosure Memorandum, Argenbright Security does not lease any computer
hardware or software and has not entered into any agreements for the
maintenance or support of any computer hardware and/or software.   Section
5.20 Insurance. Section 5.20 of the US Disclosure Memorandum sets forth a
complete and correct list of all insurance policies and fidelity bonds
relating to the assets, business, operations, employees, officers or
directors of the US Business and its potential liabilities to third
parties. Holdings has furnished or made available to Purchaser true, correct
and complete copies of all such insurance policies and fidelity bonds. There
is no claim by Argenbright Security or any other Argenbright Entity pending
under any of such policies or bonds as to which coverage has been questioned,
denied or disputed by the underwriters of such policies or bonds or in
respect of which such underwriters have reserved their rights. All premiums
payable under all such policies and bonds have been timely paid and
Argenbright Security and each Argenbright Entity have otherwise complied
fully with the terms and conditions of all such policies and bonds. Such
policies of insurance and bonds (or other policies and bonds providing
substantially similar insurance coverage) have been in effect since the
Balance Sheet Date and, to the Sellers\' knowledge remain in full force and
effect. Such policies and bonds are of the type and in amounts customarily
carried by Persons conducting businesses similar to the US Business. No
Argenbright Entity knows of any threatened termination of, premium
increase with respect to, or material alteration of coverage under, any of
such policies or bonds, other than with respect to the aviation insurance
which, effective as of October 1, 2000, has a deductible of US $250,000 per
occurrence and US $1,500,000 in the aggregate. Argenbright Security has
adequately reserved on the US Balance Sheet in respect of any payments which
may be required under any self insurance policies. All Workers\' Compensation
Claims incurred prior to the Closing Date (including all incurred but not
reported claims) are either fully insured by a third-party insurer which is
not an Affiliate of Holdings or are self-insured subject to an excess
liability insurance policy carried with a third-party insurer which is not an
Affiliate of Holdings and which covers the full amount of Workers\'
Compensation Claims in excess of US $250,000 per occurrence.   Section 5.21
Licenses and Permits.   (a) Section 5.21 of the US Disclosure Memorandum
correctly describes each material license, franchise, permit, certificate,
approval or other similar authorization affecting, or relating in any way to,
the US Assets or the US Business (the "Licenses"), together with the name of
the government agency or entity issuing such License. The Licenses listed in
Section 5.21 of the US Disclosure Memorandum are all of the government
licenses, permits, approvals and other authorizations necessary to conduct
the US Business as it is now being conducted. Except as set forth in Section
5.21 of the US Disclosure Memorandum, (i) the Licenses are valid and in full
force and effect, (ii) neither Argenbright Security nor any Argenbright
Entity is in default under, and no condition exists that with notice or lapse
of time or both would constitute a default under,    35  41 the Licenses
and (iii) none of the Licenses will be terminated or impaired or become
terminable, in whole or in part, as a result of the transactions contemplated
hereby.   (b) To the knowledge of any Argenbright Entity, no proceeding
is pending or threatened seeking the revocation or limitation of any such
Licenses, and to the knowledge of any Argenbright Entity there is no basis or
grounds for any such revocation of such Licenses. Except as set forth in
Section 5.21 of the US Disclosure Memorandum, since January 1, 1995, no
notice, citation, summons or order has been received by any Argenbright
Entity, no complaint has been filed and served on any Argenbright Entity and
no penalty has been assessed with respect to (a) any alleged failure by any
Argenbright Entity to have a License in respect of the US Business or (b) any
alleged material violation by any Argenbright Entity of any Law or License in
respect to the US Business. The conduct of the US Business complies in all
respects with all applicable laws, governmental licenses, permits, orders and
other authorizations that are applicable thereto.   Section 5.22
Receivables. Section 5.22 of the US Disclosure Memorandum sets forth an
accounts receivable aging schedule. All accounts, notes receivable and other
receivables (other than receivables collected since the Balance Sheet Date)
reflected on the US Balance Sheet and in Section 5.22 of the US Disclosure
Memorandum are, and all accounts and notes receivable arising from or
otherwise relating to the US Business as of the Closing Date will be,
valid, genuine and fully collectible in the aggregate amount thereof, subject
to normal and customary trade discounts, less any reserves for doubtful
accounts recorded on the US Balance Sheet. All accounts, notes receivable and
other receivables arising out of or relating to the US Business as of the
Balance Sheet Date have been included in the US Balance Sheet, and all
accounts, notes receivable and other receivables arising out of or relating
to the US Business as of the Closing Date will be included in the Closing
Balance Sheet, in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
principles applied on a consistent basis.   Section 5.23 Accuracy of
Projections. The financial projections relating to the US Business and the UK
Business delivered to Purchaser were prepared in good faith and were based
upon reasonable assumptions at the time they were made. With respect to the
Budget attached hereto as Exhibit D, to the Knowledge of the Sellers, there
is no fact or set of circumstances that would lead them to believe that the
projections contained therein are incorrect or misleading in any material
respect. The projections contained in the Budget are the projections used by
AHL for its internal business and strategic planning purposes. Sellers have
advised Purchaser that there can be no assurances that such financial
projections will be realized and that actual results may differ from
projected results and such differences could be material.   Section 5.24
Finders\' Fees. Except for Deutsche Bank whose fees will be paid by AHL,
there is no investment banker, broker, finder or other intermediary which has
been retained by or is authorized to act on behalf of any Argenbright Entity
who might be entitled to any fee or commission in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   Section 5.25 Employees.

to any Multiemployer Plan, (iii) incurred any withdrawal liability to any
Multiemployer Plan, or (iv) sponsored, maintained, contributed to or been

violation of Sections 402, 403, 404, 405, 406 or 407 of ERISA or Section 4975

To the Knowledge of the Sellers, each Employee Plan has been maintained in
material compliance with its terms and with the requirements prescribed
by any and all applicable statutes, orders, rules and regulations, including
but not limited to ERISA and the Code. To the Knowledge of the Sellers,
nothing has occurred, whether by action or failure to act, which would cause
the loss of such qualification of an Employee Plan under Section 401(a)   
38  44  of the Code which loss would result in material liability to
Argenbright Security under the Internal Revenue Service\'s Employee Plans
Compliance Resolution System or the Department of Labor\'s Voluntary

Service\'s or the Department of Labor may be amended from time to time).

the Closing Balance Sheet or (ii) retained by Holdings or any of its
Affiliates (other than Argenbright Security). There has been no amendment to,
written interpretation of, or announcement (whether or not written) by
Argenbright Security or any Argenbright Entity relating to any other Employee
Plan or Benefit Arrangement that would materially increase the expense of
maintaining such Employee Plan or Benefit Arrangement to Argenbright
Security, either before or after Closing, above the level of the expense
incurred in respect thereof for the most recent fiscal year ended prior to
the date hereof.   (h) There is no contract, plan or arrangement (written

Security has not contributed to a nonconforming group health plan (as defined
in Section 5000(c)) of the Code and no ERISA Affiliate of Argenbright
Security has incurred a tax under Section 5000(a) of the Code which is or
could become a liability of Argenbright Security.    39  45   (j)
Except as may be required pursuant to the 401(k) Plan or the AHL Services,
Inc. Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan, no US Transferred Employee will
become entitled to any bonus, retirement, severance, job security or similar
benefit or enhanced such benefit (including acceleration of vesting or
exercise of an incentive award) from Argenbright Security under any
Employee Plan or Benefit Arrangement exclusively as a result of the sale of
US Shares or the other transactions contemplated hereby.   (k) With respect

agreements for which the stated term has expired but for which there is a
mutual agreement to continue operations as if such agreement were validly in
place.   (m) With respect to each Employee Plan or Benefit Arrangement,
the reporting and disclosure requirements of ERISA have been complied with in
all material respects.   (n) With respect to each Employee Plan or Benefit

Security, Holdings, AHL or any other Argenbright Entity is in compliance with
terms and provisions of the collective bargaining agreements set forth on
Section 5.27 of the US Disclosure Memorandum, including, without limitation,
such of the collective bargaining agreements for which the stated term has
applied but for which there is a mutual agreement to continue operations as
if such agreement were validly in place.   (q) The fiduciaries and
administrators of each Employee Plan or Benefit Arrangement have at all times
complied with all applicable provisions of law (including, without
limitation, the provisions of ERISA) in operating and dealing with each such
Employee Plan or Benefit Arrangement. No such fiduciary or administrator has
taken any action, or failed to take any action, that would subject it or any
other person to liability for excise tax or breach of fiduciary duty in
connection with any Employee Plan or Benefit Arrangement.   (r) All reports
and returns required to be filed with any government agency with respect to
each Employee Plan or Benefit Arrangement have been timely and accurately
filed.    40  46  No government agency has conducted an audit or
investigation or made an assessment of taxes or penalties with respect to an

(d) Argenbright Security and each other Argenbright Entity, with respect to
any US Assets, have been and are in compliance with all US Environmental Laws

the US Business.   Section 5.30 Record Keeping Practices. Argenbright
Security, ADI and each other Argenbright Entity, are in compliance in all

sentence, Sellers shall be permitted to hire any US Transferred Employee
(other than a US Transferred Employee whose annual compensation

(or an Affiliate of Purchaser), other than as a result of Sellers\' breach of
this Section, prior to being contacted by Sellers or (ii) responds to any

provision contained in this Section shall for any reason be held invalid,
illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this Section, but
this Section shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provision had never been contained herein. It is the intention of the parties
that if any of the restrictions or covenants contained herein is held to
cover a geographic area or to be for a length of time which is not permitted
by applicable law, or in any way construed to be too broad or to any extent
invalid, such provision shall not be construed to be null, void and of
no effect, but to the extent such provision would be valid or enforceable
under applicable law, a court of competent jurisdiction shall construe and
interpret or reform this Section to provide for a covenant having the maximum
enforceable geographic area, time period and other provisions (not greater
than those contained herein) as shall be valid and enforceable under such
applicable law. The Argenbright Entities (other than Argenbright Security
after the Closing) acknowledge that Purchaser would be irreparably harmed by
any breach of this Section and that there would be no adequate remedy at law
or in damages to compensate Purchaser for any such breach. The Argenbright
Entities (other than Argenbright Security after the Closing)    51

specific performance by the Argenbright Entities (other than Argenbright
Security after the Closing) of this Section, and the Argenbright Entities

thereof.   (d) The noncompetition provisions relating to the UK Business

reasonable actions necessary to satisfy all of the conditions to
their respective obligations hereunder as set forth in Article 15 and (c)
executing and delivering all agreements and documents required by the terms

or any of them, on or prior to the Closing. Nothing in this Section 8.07
shall prejudice the right of Purchaser to rely on the condition in Section
15.03(c). Sellers and Purchaser will use their reasonable best efforts to
obtain the consent of the other parties to any contract, license, performance
bond, lease or other document or any claim or right or benefit arising
thereunder for the assignment thereof to Purchaser as Purchaser reasonably
may request. If such consent is not obtained or if an intended assignment
thereof would be ineffective or would adversely affect the rights of Sellers
or any of their respective Affiliates thereunder so that Purchaser would not
in fact receive all such rights, Sellers and Purchaser will cooperate in a
mutually agreeable arrangement under which Purchaser would obtain the
benefits and assume the obligations thereunder in accordance with this
Agreement, including subcontracting, sublicensing or subleasing to Purchaser,
or under which Sellers would enforce for the benefit of Purchaser, with
Purchaser assuming Sellers\' obligations and any and all rights of Sellers

Assigned Contracts, use all commercially reasonable efforts to (i) to obtain
the consents of the applicable third party, (ii) make the benefit of such
Non-Assigned Contracts available to Purchaser and (iii) enforce, at the
request and expense of Purchaser and for the account of Purchaser, any rights
of Sellers arising from such Non-Assigned Contracts against the other party
or parties thereto (including the right to elect or terminate any such Non-
Assigned Contracts in accordance with the terms thereof). With respect to any
such Non-Assigned Contracts as to which the necessary    52 
58  approval or consent for the assignment or transfer to Purchaser is
obtained following the Closing, Seller shall transfer such Non-Assigned
Contracts to Purchaser by execution and delivery of an instrument of
conveyance, in a form reasonably acceptable to Purchaser, within three (3)

to such assignments or (ii) obtain for Argenbright Security licenses to
such software that are substantially equivalent and upon substantially
equivalent terms and conditions to the licenses held by Argenbright on the
date hereof. Purchaser agrees that performance by Holdings of the covenant
set forth in this Section shall not be a condition to Purchaser\'s or
Securicor Georgia\'s obligations to effect the US Closing or the UK Closing.
Holdings agrees that its covenant set forth in this Section shall survive the
Closing.   Section 8.10 Leased Real Property. Holdings shall cause any
Real Property Leases with respect to which any Argenbright Entity is not the

(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).   Section

foregoing, nothing contained herein shall limit the liability of AHL and
Sellers under this Agreement to the extent such liability results from fraud
or willful misconduct of AHL and Sellers, or any of them. In addition,
notwithstanding the foregoing, AHL and Sellers acknowledge and agree that (i)
the indemnification obligations set forth in Section 16.02(c), Section 16.05
and on the Annex XI attached hereto are not subject to the Basket or the Cap
and shall not be considered Excluded Claims, regardless of the amount of any
such claim and (ii) claims under the European Tax Warranties are not subject
to the Basket, shall not be considered Excluded Claims regardless of the
amount of any such claims but are subject to the Cap; and (iii) Claims under
the Tax Deed are not subject to the Basket, shall not be considered Excluded
Claims regardless of the amount of any such claims, are not subject to the
Cap detailed in Section 16.02(c) but are subject to a cap on liability equal
to the consideration payable for the ADI Shares as stated in clause 3.4 of
the Tax Deed.   (b) Purchaser hereby indemnifies Sellers and their
Affiliates against and agrees to hold each of them harmless from any and all
damage, loss, liability and expense (including, without limitation,
reasonable expenses of investigation and reasonable attorneys\' fees and
expenses in connection with any action, suit or proceeding (the "Purchaser
Damages")) incurred or suffered by AHL, Holdings or any of their respective
Affiliates arising out of any misrepresentation or breach of warranty,
covenant or agreement made or to be performed by Purchaser or Securicor
Georgia pursuant to this Agreement; provided, that (i) Purchaser shall not be
liable under this Section 16.02(b) unless the aggregate amount of Purchaser
Damages with respect to all matters referred to in this Section 16.02(b)
(determined without regard to any    65  71  materiality qualification
contained in any representation, warranty or covenant giving rise to the
claim for indemnity hereunder) exceeds US $750,000 (the "Purchaser Basket")
in which event Purchaser shall be liable for the entire amount of such
Purchaser Damages; (ii) in no event shall the aggregate amount of all
payments made by Purchaser for all Purchaser Damages pursuant to
its indemnification obligation under this Agreement exceed US $85,000,000
(the "Purchaser Cap"); and (iii) Purchaser shall not be liable to pay any
Purchaser\'s Damages unless the amount of any single claim or the aggregate
amount of any group of related claims of such Damages exceeds $15,000 (the
"Purchaser Excluded Claims"), and the Purchaser Damages related to such
Purchaser Excluded Claims shall not count against the Purchaser Basket.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall limit the
liability of Purchaser under this Agreement to the extent such liability
results from fraud or willful misconduct of Purchaser. In addition,
notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the
indemnification obligations set forth in Section 10.06 are not subject to the
Purchaser Basket or the Purchaser Cap and shall not be considered Purchaser
Excluded Claims, regardless of the amount of any such claim.   (c)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, AHL and Sellers,
jointly and severally, hereby indemnify and agree to hold harmless Purchaser,
its Affiliates, and their respective directors, officers and employees,
including, effective at the Closing, without duplication,
Argenbright Security, ADI and their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates
and each of their respective directors, officers and employees, from and
against:   (i) any and all damages, liabilities, losses and expenses  which
relate to or arise out of any assets, liabilities, properties or  business of
any Argenbright Entity or any member of the European Group  which does not
represent a part of the US Business and/or the UK  Business;   (ii) any and
all damages specific to litigation such as  the Philadelphia case U. S.
District Court for the E. D. Pa. Criminal  No. 000-194 which relates to or
arises out of any breach by or the  failure of Holdings or Argenbright
Security to comply with or to  perform their obligations prior to the Closing
Date pursuant to the  Philadelphia Settlement Agreement or pursuant to the
judgment in a  criminal case entered by Judge Marvin Katz of the U. S.
District Court  for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on or about October
20, 2000.   (iii) any and all Purchaser Damages which relate to or  arise
out of all lawsuits filed against an Argenbright Entity with  respect to the
US Business after October 24, 2000, to the extent that  the aggregate amount
of such damages exceeds the sum of (A) the  aggregate amount of insurance
proceeds received by the relevant  Argenbright Entity with respect to such
lawsuits and (B) the litigation  reserve included in the US Balance
Sheet;   (iv) any and all Purchaser Damages which relate to or  arise out
of the failure of Holdings to obtain, at its sole expense, or  to cause
Argenbright to assign to Argenbright Security the licenses for  the Lawson
and Oracle software used in connection with the US Business  and/or the UK
Business and to obtain the consent of the licensors to  such    66 
72   assignments or obtain, at its sole expense, for Argenbright Security 
licenses with Lawson or Oracle that are substantially equivalent to the 
licenses held by Argenbright on the date hereof;   (v) any and all Purchaser
Damages (excluding  consequential or incidental damages) which relate to or
arise out of  (A) the exercise of a change of control provision or failure to
obtain  the necessary consents for the assignment of such contract,
agreement  or license to Argenbright Security by the counterparty of any of
the US  Assumed Contracts and/or the European Assumed Contracts; (B) the 
failure to obtain a consent required as a consequence of the change of 
control of Argenbright Security with respect to any Real Property  Leases;
(C) the exercise of a change of control provision or failure to  obtain the
necessary consents for the assignment to Argenbright  Security of the
Licenses on or before Closing and/or for the assignment  to ADI of any
licenses used in respect of the UK Business on or before  Closing; and/or (D)
the failure to have in force any special security  clearances required by any
US Assumed Contracts and/or European Assumed  Contracts; and   (vi)
Purchaser Damages pertaining to any Employee Plan or  Benefit Arrangement
which relate to adoption or operation of such  Employee Plan or Benefit
Arrangement.   (d) Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement to
the contrary, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree to report any payment
made in respect of Damages as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for
accounting, Tax and all other purposes.   Section 16.03 Procedures. The
party seeking indemnification or recovery for breach of warranty under
Section 16.02 and/or Section 16.05 (the "Indemnified Party") agrees to give
prompt notice to the party against whom indemnity is sought (the
"Indemnifying Party") of the assertion of any claim, or the commencement of
any suit, action or proceeding in respect of which indemnity may be sought
under such Section, provided, however, that the failure to notify the
Indemnifying Party will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any
liability to the Indemnified Party except to the extent that the Indemnifying
Party demonstrates that the defense of such action is prejudiced by the
Indemnified Party\'s failure to give such notice. The Indemnifying Party
shall at the request of the Indemnified Party participate in and/or control
the defense of any such suit, action or proceeding at its own expense. The
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under Section 16.02 and/or Section
16.05 for any settlement effected without its consent of any claim,
litigation or proceeding in respect of which indemnity may be sought
hereunder.   Section 16.04 Waiver of Rights. The rights and remedies of
the Purchaser or Sellers in respect of the representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement (US representations and warranties), Section
16.05 of this Agreement (specific European indemnities), the European
Warranties and the Tax Deed shall not be affected by Completion, by the
giving of any time or other indulgence by the Purchaser to any person, by the
Purchaser rescinding or not rescinding this Agreement, or by any other cause
whatsoever except a specific waiver or release by the    67 
73  Purchaser in writing, and any such waiver or release shall not prejudice
or affect any remaining rights or remedies of the Purchaser.   Section
16.05 Specific European Indemnities.   (a) AHL Europe hereby indemnifies the
Purchaser (for itself and on behalf of all group companies) against all
costs, expenses, damages, compensation, fines and other liabilities arising
out of or in connection with (regardless of whether such claim has been
disclosed to the Purchaser in the European Disclosure Memorandum or
otherwise):   (i) any liabilities or obligations which ADI and/or the 
Purchaser (or any company within the Purchaser\'s group) and/or the  trustees
of the ADI Management Pension Scheme may incur as a result of  fines or
penalties (whether criminal or civil) which the Occupational  Pensions
Regulatory Authority may impose as a result of the matters  reported to it by
letter dated November 12, 1999 from the trustees of  the ADI Management
Pension Scheme and Arthur Andersen or resulting from  matters previously
reported to it;   (ii) any liabilities or obligations to make additional 
contributions or payments which ADI and/or the Purchaser (or any  company
within the Purchaser\'s group) may reasonably incur as a result  of the value
of the funds held on behalf of such member of the  Disclosed Schemes named in
Appendix B to the letter dated May 11, 1998  from EA Drake of Watson Wyatt to
Mr. N. Cotton of ADI Group ("Appendix  B") being insufficient to provide any
of the benefits which have been  promised or indicated to such members prior
to Completion provided that  such sufficiency or insufficiency shall be
calculated on the basis that  contributions due and payable after Completion
are made in accordance  with Appendix B as relevant to the member concerned,
and provided that  such contributions have been invested in funds similar to
the funds in  which contributions have been invested prior to Completion.
Such  liability or obligation shall be limited to that proportion of total 
insufficiency attributable to the number of months service with ADI  (plus,
in the case of a member who transfers accrued benefits from the  Local
Government Pension Scheme ("LGPS") to the Disclosed Schemes,  service whilst
a member of the LGPS) prior to Completion relative to  the number of months
service post Completion, but based on final  pensionable salary and final
pensionable earnings; and   (iii) any liabilities or losses arising out of
or in  connection with the exercise by British Airways Plc of the change of 
control provisions contained in the Shareholder Agreement in respect of  BA
Ground Handling Services Limited dated April 25, 1996.   (b) Any claim under
the above clauses of this Section 16.05 shall be without prejudice to any
claim which the Purchaser or any member of its group may have under the
European Warranties provided always that the Purchaser shall not recover
damages more than once in respect of the same loss.    68  74   ARTICLE

be terminated at any time prior to the Closing:   (a) By mutual written

of either party (or any stockholder, director, officer, employee, agent,

Agreement; provided, that if such termination shall result from the (i)
willful failure of either party to fulfill a condition to the performance of
the obligations of the other party, (ii) failure to perform a covenant of
this Agreement or (iii) breach by either party hereto of any representation
or warranty or agreement contained herein, such party shall be fully liable

hereto, except that Purchaser may transfer or assign, in whole or from time
to time in part, to one or more of its Affiliates, the right to purchase all

this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
of the State of Georgia, without regard to the conflicts of law rules of such
state. Annexes VI, XXII, and XVI and Schedules 3.04(a) and 8.06 shall be

the Northern District of Georgia or any other Georgia state court and each of
the parties hereby consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the
appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or
proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue
of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such
suit, action or proceeding which is brought in any such court has been
brought in an inconvenient forum. Parties seeking to enforce any rights under

to bring such action in the High Court of Justice in England and Wales.

Counterparts; Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement may be signed in any
number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.

received a counterpart hereof signed by the other party hereto. No provision
of this Agreement is intended to confer upon any Person other than

Agreement. This Agreement (including the Exhibits, the Schedules and the
Annexes attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference), the
Confidentiality Agreement and the Transaction Documents constitute the entire

this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms,
provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so
long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated
hereby is not affected, impaired or invalidated and so long as the economic
or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any parties. Upon such a determination, the
unenforceable term, provision, covenant or restriction shall be deemed to be
modified as necessary so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an enforceable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be consummated as originally contemplated to the
fullest extent possible.   Section 18.11 Captions. The captions herein are
included for convenience of reference only and shall be ignored in the

guaranty of the full and punctual payment and performance of the Obligations
and not of their collectability only. The foregoing guaranty of AHL shall not
in any way limit the obligations, covenants, agreements, representations and
warranties of Holdings and AHL Europe, or any of them, under this Agreement
(including any of the foregoing relating to indemnification), or any of the
Purchaser\'s rights or remedies with respect thereto. Should Holdings and AHL
Europe, or any of them, default in the payment or performance of any
Obligation, the obligation of AHL hereunder with respect to payment and
performance of such Obligation shall become immediately due and payable to
the Purchaser, upon written demand by the Purchaser. Payments and/or
performance by AHL hereunder may be required by the Purchaser on any number
of occasions.   Section 18.13 Governing Agreement. In the event that the
terms of this Agreement conflict in any way with the terms of any attached
Annex, Exhibit or Schedule, the terms of this Agreement shall govern.

Europe Relating To the UK Assets   Section 6.01. Terms Governing the
European Warranties.   (a) AHL Europe warrants to the Purchaser in the terms
of the European Warranties as set out in this Annex VI and Annex XII. The
provisions as stated therein of Article 16 of the Agreement and Annex XVI
shall take effect in relation to the European General Warranties and European
Environmental Warranties. The provisions as stated therein of Article 16 of
the Agreement and (to the extent specified in the Tax Deed) the Tax Deed
shall take effect in relation to the European Tax Warranties.   (b) AHL
Europe acknowledges that, in entering into this Agreement, the Purchaser has
relied upon the terms of the European Warranties.   (c) AHL Europe shall not
(in the event of any claim being made against it in connection with the sale
of the ADI Shares to the Purchaser) make any claim against ADI or any of the
European Subsidiaries or against any director or employee of ADI or any of
the European Subsidiaries on whom AHL Europe may have relied before agreeing
to any term of this Agreement or of the Tax Deed or authorizing any statement
in the European Disclosure Memorandum.   (d) Each of the European Warranties
shall be construed as a separate warranty and is given subject to the matters
which are fairly disclosed in the European Disclosure Memorandum and European
Disclosure Documents, provided in addition in the case of the European
Disclosure Documents that all such information only qualifies the European
Warranties to the extent that each matter to be disclosed is reasonably clear
from the face of each document, but (save as expressly provided to the
contrary) shall not be otherwise limited or restricted by reference to or
inference from the terms of any other European Warranty or any other term of
this Agreement.   (e) References in any of the European Warranties to any
English legal term, concept, statute, regulation, court or official (but
excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, currency) shall in respect of any
jurisdiction other than England be deemed to include what most closely
approximates in that jurisdiction to such English term, concept, statue,
regulation, court or official.   Section 6.02. Accounts   (a) General.
The European Accounts (copies of which have been delivered to the
Purchaser):    77  83   (i) Have been prepared under the historical
cost  convention and in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
practice commonly adopted by companies carrying on businesses similar  to
those carried on by the respective members of the European Group and  in
accordance with all applicable Statements of Standard Accounting  Practice
and Financial Reporting Standards (or their equivalent for  companies
incorporated outside of England and Wales);   (ii) Show a true and fair view
of the affairs of the  European Group as at the Accounts Date and of its
results for the  accounting reference period ended on that date;   (iii)
Comply with the requirements of the Companies Act (or  the equivalent law for
companies incorporated outside of England and  Wales);   (iv) Are prepared
on consistent bases and policies of  accounting which are the same as those
adopted in preparing the  Previous European Accounts and, since the Accounts
Date, have continued  to be adopted by the European Group without alteration;
and   (v) (Save as the Accounts expressly disclose) are not  affected by
any material unusual or non-recurring items.   (b) Rate of Depreciation. The
rate of depreciation adopted in the European Accounts is sufficient for the
value of each of the fixed assets of the European Group to be written down to
nil by the end of its useful working life.   (c) Profits. The profits shown
in the European Accounts have not to a material extent been affected (except
as disclosed in those accounts) by any extraordinary or exceptional event or
circumstance.   (d) Application of Warranties to ADI\'s Accounts. Each of
the statements in Sections 6.02(a) through Section 6.02(c) would be true
and accurate in relation to the accounts of ADI if:   (i) For references to
the European Accounts there were  substituted references to the audited
balance sheet of ADI as at the  Accounts Date and the audited profit and loss
account of ADI for the  accounting reference period ended on that date;
and   (ii) For references to the European Group there were  substituted
references to ADI.   (e) Position Since Accounts Date. Since the Accounts
Date:   (i) Apart from the dividends provided for in the European  Accounts
or in this Agreement, no dividend or other distribution (as  defined for the
purposes of section 209 or 210 of the Taxes Act or any  equivalent law for
companies incorporated outside of England and Wales)  has been declared, paid
or made by ADI;    78  84   (ii) The business of ADI has been carried on
in the  ordinary course and so as to maintain it as a going concern;  
(iii) There has been no material adverse change in the  financial or trading
position of ADI and the Sellers are not aware of  any circumstances which
would give rise to the same;   (iv) There has been no material reduction in
the value of  the net tangible assets of the European Group on the basis of
the  valuations adopted in the European Accounts;   (v) ADI has not
acquired or disposed of or agreed to  acquire or dispose of any business or
any material asset other than  trading stock in the ordinary course of
business;   (vi) ADI has not paid any service or management charges to  any
other person or incurred any liability to make such a payment in  excess of
(pound)50,000; and   (vii) There has been no (i) employment, deferred 
compensation, severance or retirement agreement entered into with any 
director, officer or Senior Employee (being an employee with a basic  salary
in excess of (pound)50,000 per annum) relating to the UK  Business (or any
amendment to any such existing agreement), (ii) grant  of any severance or
termination pay to any director, officer or Senior  Employee relating to the
UK Business or (iii) change in compensation or  other benefits payable to any
director, officer or Senior Employee  relating to the UK Business pursuant to
any severance or retirement  plans or policies thereof.   (viii) No terms
of trade with any customer of the European  Group have been the subject of
any material adverse change and there  are currently no negotiations in
process to amend such terms or trade  which would have a material adverse
change.   (f) Intercompany Accounts. Since the Accounts Date there has
not been any accrual of liability by ADI or any of the European Subsidiaries
to any Argenbright Entity or their Affiliates or other transaction between
ADI and any Argenbright Entity or their Affiliates, except in the ordinary
course of the UK Business consistent with past practice, and thereafter as
provided in Section 6.02(f) of the European Disclosure Memorandum.   (g)
Management Accounts. The ADI Group Monthly Reporting Pack Period 10 for the
44 weeks ended 3 November 2000 being European Disclosure Document 18.38
("Management Accounts") have been prepared in good faith and are based upon
reasonable assumptions, and AHL Europe is not aware of any fact or set of

Security and the Subsidiaries of Argenbright Security shall file all Tax
Returns in a manner consistent with such Allocation Statement.   (c) The US
Sellers will include the income of Argenbright Security and its Subsidiaries
(including any deferred income triggered into income by Treasury Regulations
ss. 1.1502-13 and -14 and any Excess Loss Accounts taken into income under
Treasury Regulation ss. 1.1502-19) on the consolidated United States federal
income Tax Returns of AHL or Holdings (as appropriate) for all Pre-Closing
Tax Periods and pay any United States federal income Taxes attributable to
such income. Argenbright Security and its Subsidiaries will furnish Tax
information to the US Sellers for inclusion in AHL\'s consolidated United
States federal income Tax Return for the Pre-Closing Tax Period ending on the
Closing Date in accordance with Argenbright Security\'s past custom
and practice. Except as otherwise contemplated in Section 11.03, the US
Sellers will take no position on such returns that relate to Argenbright
Security or its Subsidiaries that would adversely affect Argenbright Security
and its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date. The income of Argenbright
Security and its Subsidiaries will be apportioned to the period up to and
including the Closing Date and the period after the Closing Date by closing
the books of Argenbright Security and its Subsidiaries as of the end of the
Closing Date.   (d) The Purchaser will allow the US Sellers and their
counsel to participate at their own expense in any audits of Tax Returns of
Argenbright Security for Pre-Closing Tax Periods to the extent the outcome of
the audit could cause the US Sellers to be liable for any amount under this
Annex XI. The Purchaser will not settle any such audit in a manner which
would adversely affect the US Sellers after the Closing Date without the
prior written consent of the US Sellers.**   (e) The US Sellers will
immediately pay to the Purchaser any Tax refund (or reduction in Tax
liability) resulting from a carryback of a Post-Closing Period Tax Asset of
Argenbright Security or any of its Subsidiaries (excluding for this purpose
Tax Assets with respect to federal income Taxes) into any Tax Return of an
Affiliated Group of which a US Seller is a member when such refund or
reduction is realized by such Affiliated Group. The US Sellers will cooperate
with Argenbright Security and its Subsidiaries in obtaining such refunds (or
reductions in Tax liability), including through the filing of amended Tax
Returns or refund claims. The Purchaser agrees to indemnify the US Sellers
for any Taxes resulting from the disallowance of such Post-Closing Period Tax
Asset on audit or otherwise. In all other cases, the    110 
116  Purchaser will immediately pay to the US Sellers the amount of any Tax
refund or credit received by Argenbright Security or any of its Subsidiaries
with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, unless the amount of such refund
or credit was included as an asset of Argenbright Security or one of its
Subsidiaries on the Closing Balance Sheet.   (f) The US Sellers shall
prepare (or cause to be prepared) and file (or cause to be filed) all Tax
Returns for Argenbright Security and its Subsidiaries for all Tax periods
ending on or prior to the Closing Date and which are filed after the Closing
Date. The US Seller shall permit the Purchaser to review and comment on each
such Tax Return described in the preceding sentence (other than income Tax
Returns with respect to periods for which a consolidated, unitary or combined
income Tax Return of the US Sellers will include the operations of
Argenbright Security and its Subsidiaries) prior to filing. The US Sellers
shall pay all Taxes of Argenbright Security and its Subsidiaries with respect
to such Tax periods, or shall reimburse Purchaser within fifteen (15) days
after payment by Purchaser or Argenbright Security and its Subsidiaries of
such Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are not reflected in the reserve for Tax
liability (rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect
timing differences between book and Tax income) shown on the face of the
Closing Balance Sheet.   (g) Purchaser shall prepare (or cause to be
prepared), in a manner consistent with past custom and practice, and file (or
cause to be filed) all Tax Returns of Argenbright Security and its
Subsidiaries for Tax periods which begin before the Closing Date and end
after the Closing Date. Purchaser shall permit the US Sellers to review and
comment on each such Tax Return by providing copies of such Tax Returns (or
of such portions of such Tax Returns that relate to US Sellers), upon receipt
of which US Sellers shall have thirty (30) days to complete such review and
comment. The US Sellers shall pay to Purchaser within fifteen (15) days after
the date on which Taxes are paid with respect to such Tax periods an amount
equal to the portion of such Taxes which relates to the Pre-Closing Tax
Period to the extent such Taxes are not reflected in the reserve for Tax
liability (rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect
timing differences between book and Tax income) shown on the face of
the Closing Balance Sheet. For these purposes, in the case of any Taxes that
are imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a Tax period that
includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date, the portion of such Tax
which relates to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined in accordance
with Section 11.07(c) of this Annex XI.   (h) Purchaser shall have received
prior to Closing, an affidavit from each US Seller in the form of Schedule
11.04(h), signed by a responsible officer of such US Seller under penalties
of perjury that to the officer\'s knowledge and belief such US Seller is not
a foreign corporation, foreign partnership, foreign trust, or foreign estate
(as those terms are defined in the Code and Income Tax Regulations).  
Section 11.05. Termination of Existing Tax Sharing Agreements   Any and all
existing Tax Sharing Agreements to which Argenbright Security or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party (a) shall be terminated as of the date hereof, (b)
shall have no further effect for any Tax period (whether a current, future or
past period), and (c) after the date hereof,    111  117  Argenbright
Security and its Subsidiaries shall not be bound thereby or have
any liability thereunder. This Agreement shall be the sole Tax sharing
agreement relating to Argenbright Security or any of its Subsidiaries for all
Pre-Closing Tax Periods.   Section 11.06. Cooperation on Tax Matters  
(a) Purchaser and the US Sellers shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the preparation
and filing of any Tax Return (including any report required to be filed as a
result of the transactions contemplated herein), any audit, litigation or
other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the other party\'s request) the provision of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or
other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder. Argenbright Security, its Subsidiaries and the US Sellers
agree (i) to retain all books and records with respect to Tax
matters pertinent to Argenbright Security and its Subsidiaries relating to
any Pre-Closing Tax Period, and to abide by all record retention agreements
entered into with any Tax Authority until the expiration of the statute of
limitations (and, to the extent notified by Purchaser or the US Sellers, any
extensions thereof) of the respective Tax periods, and to abide by all record
retention agreements entered into with any Tax Authority, and (ii) to give
the other party reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying
or discarding any such books and records and, if the other party so requests,
Argenbright Security, its Subsidiaries or the US Sellers, as the case may be,
shall allow the other party to take possession of such books and records.  
(b) Purchaser and the US Sellers further agree, upon request, to use all
reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from
any governmental authority or customer of Argenbright Security or any of
its Subsidiaries thereof or any other person as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including but not limited
to with respect to the transactions contemplated herein).   (c) Purchaser
and the US Sellers further agree, upon request, to provide the other party
with all information that either party may be required to report pursuant to
applicable law with respect to the transactions contemplated herein.  
Section 11.07. Indemnification for Taxes   (a) The US Sellers hereby
indemnify each Purchaser Indemnitee against, and agree to hold each Purchaser
Indemnitee harmless from, without duplication, any and all of the following
amounts (such amounts hereinafter referred to as "Purchaser Tax Losses"):  
(A) any Tax of Argenbright Security or its Subsidiaries  imposed with respect
to a Pre-Closing Tax Period to the extent such Tax  is not paid prior to the
Closing Date nor reflected in the reserve for  Tax liability (rather than any
reserve for deferred Taxes established  to reflect timing differences between
book and Tax income) shown on the  face of the Closing Balance Sheet;   
112  118   (B) any Tax of Argenbright Security or its Subsidiaries 
incurred as a result of the Section 338(h)(10) Election;   (C) any liability
of Argenbright Security or any of its  Subsidiaries for the payment of any
Tax as a result of being a member  of an Affiliated Group in any Pre-Closing
Tax Period, or being a party  to any agreement or arrangement in any Pre-
Closing Tax Period as a  result of which liability of Argenbright Security or
any of its  Subsidiaries to a Tax Authority is determined or taken into
account  with reference to the liability of any other Person;   (D) any
liability of Argenbright Security or any of its  Subsidiaries for the payment
of any amount as a result of being party  to any Tax Sharing Agreement in any
Pre-Closing Tax Period or with  respect to the payment of any Tax or any
amount of the type described  in clause (C) as a result of any express or
implied obligation  (including, but not limited to, an indemnification
obligation);   (E) any Tax of Argenbright Security or its Subsidiaries 
resulting from a breach of any of the provisions of this Annex XI by  the US
Sellers, and   (F) any liabilities, costs, expenses (including, without 
limitation, reasonable expenses of investigation and attorneys\' and 
accountants\' fees and expenses), losses, damages, assessments,  settlements
or judgments arising out of or incident to the imposition,  assessment or
assertion of any Tax described in this paragraph (a)  (including this clause
(F)).   (b) The Purchaser hereby indemnifies the US Sellers against,
and agrees to hold each US Seller harmless from, without duplication, any and
all of the following amounts (such amounts hereinafter referred to as "US
Seller Tax Losses"):   (A) any Tax of Argenbright Security or its
Subsidiaries  imposed with respect to a Post-Closing Tax Period,   (B) any
Tax of a US Seller, Argenbright Security or its  Subsidiaries resulting from
a breach of any of the provisions of this  Annex XI by the Purchaser, and  
(C) any liabilities, costs, expenses (including, without  limitation,
reasonable expenses of investigation and attorneys\' and  accountants\' fees
and expenses), losses, damages, assessments,  settlements or judgments
arising out of or incident to the imposition,  assessment or assertion of any
Tax described in this paragraph (b)  (including this clause (C)).   (c) For
purposes of this Section, in the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a
periodic basis and are payable for a Tax period that includes (but does not
end on) the Closing Date, the portion of such Tax related to a Pre-Closing
Tax Period shall (i) in the case of any Taxes, other than gross receipts,
sales or use Taxes and Taxes based upon or related to income, be deemed to be
the amount of such Tax for the entire Tax period multiplied by a fraction
the    113  119  numerator of which is the number of days in the Tax
period ending on and including the Closing Date and the denominator of which
is the number of days in the entire Tax period, and (ii) in the case of any
Tax based upon or related to income and any gross receipts, sales or use Tax,
be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the relevant Tax
period ended on and included the Closing Date. The portion of any credits
relating to a Tax period that begins before and ends after the Closing Date
shall be determined as though the relevant Tax period ended on and included
the Closing Date. All determinations necessary to give effect to the
foregoing allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with prior
practice of Argenbright Security and its Subsidiaries. In the case of an
interest in an entity that is fiscally transparent for Tax purposes, items
shall be deemed to flow through on a daily basis rather than at the close of
the entity\'s Tax year.   (d) Upon payment by any Purchaser Indemnitee of
any Purchaser Tax Loss, the US Sellers shall discharge their obligation to
indemnify the Purchaser Indemnitee against such Tax Loss by paying to
Purchaser an amount equal to the amount of such Purchaser Tax Loss; provided,
however, that if Purchaser provides the US Sellers with written notice of a
Purchaser Tax Loss at least thirty (30) days prior to the date on which the
relevant Purchaser Tax Loss is required to be paid by any Purchaser
Indemnitee, the US Sellers shall discharge their obligation to indemnify the
Purchaser Indemnitee against such Purchaser Tax Loss by paying an amount
equal to the amount of such Purchaser Tax Loss to the relevant Tax Authority
or Purchaser, as directed by Purchaser.   (e) Any payment pursuant to this
Section shall be made not later than thirty (30) days after receipt by the
indemnifying party of written notice from the indemnified party in accordance
with the proviso in Section 11.07(d) of this Annex XI or stating that any
Purchaser or US Seller Tax Loss has been incurred and the amount thereof and
of the indemnity payment requested.   (f) Notwithstanding anything else in
this Annex XI or in the Agreement to the contrary, the computation and
payment of any amounts under this Section 11.07 shall not be limited in any
way by caps, baskets, thresholds, or other limitations on amounts payable
under indemnification provisions elsewhere in the Agreement.   (g) No
investigation by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates at or prior to the
Closing Date shall relieve the US Sellers of any liability under this
Section. Any claim of any Purchaser Indemnitee (other than Purchaser)
under this Section may be made and enforced by Purchaser on behalf of such
Purchaser Indemnitee.   Section 11.08. Purchase Price Adjustment and
Interest   Any amount paid under Section 11.07 of this Annex XI will be
treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price. Any payment required to be
made under Section 11.07 of this Annex XI that is not made when due shall
bear interest at the rate per annum determined, from time to time, under the
provision, of Section 6621(a)(2) of the Code for each day until paid.   
114  120   Section 11.09. Survival   Notwithstanding anything in this
Annex XI or in the Agreement to the contrary, the provisions of this Annex XI
shall survive for the full period of all applicable statutes of limitations
(giving effect to any waiver, mitigation or extension thereof).   Section
11.10. Arbitration Procedures   In the event any disagreement between the
parties under this Annex XI cannot be resolved by the parties, the dispute
shall be referred to an accounting firm (the "Auditor") which is mutually
acceptable to the parties for resolution. The Auditor shall issue a written
report which sets forth a final decision with respect to the disputed issue.
Fees and expenses of the Auditor shall be shared equally by the US Sellers,
on the one hand, and Purchaser, Argenbright Security and its Subsidiaries, on
the other.    115  121    ANNEX XII   EUROPEAN TAX REPRESENTATIONS

accountancy practices generally accepted in the United Kingdom and commonly
adopted by companies carrying on businesses similar to those carried on by
ADI.   (c) Since the Accounts Date, ADI has not been involved in
any transaction outside the ordinary course of business which has given or
may give rise to a liability to taxation on ADI (or would have given or might
give rise to such a liability but for the availability of any relief,
allowance, deduction or credit arising or relating to any period after
Closing) and no accounting period of ADI has ended save as provided by
Section 3.04(b)(iv) of the Agreement. No payment has been made to ADI to
which Section 601 of the Taxes Act applies (pension scheme surpluses:

due and careful inquiry, are likely to, reveal any transactions which may be
the subject of any dispute with the Inland Revenue or other appropriate
authorities and ADI is not and has not in the last six (6) years been the
subject of a back duty investigation or other dispute regarding tax or duty
recoverable from ADI and so far as AHL Europe is aware there are no facts
which are likely to cause such an investigation to be instituted or such a
dispute to arise and all returns made by ADI are agreed with the Inland
Revenue or other appropriate authority.   (b) Neither ADI nor any director
or officer of ADI (in his capacity as such) has paid or become liable to pay,

which it is or they are likely to become liable to pay, any penalty, fine,
surcharge or interest whether charged by virtue of the provisions of the
Taxes Management Act 1970, the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979 or the
Value Added Tax Act 1994 or otherwise.    116  122   (c) ADI has duly
submitted all claims and disclaimers which have been assumed to have been
made for the purpose of the European Accounts.   (d) All clearances obtained
by ADI have been properly obtained and all information supplied to the Inland
Revenue or other appropriate authority in connection with such clearances was
complete and accurate in all respects and any transaction for which such
clearance was obtained has been carried out only in accordance with the terms

Section 12.02 of the European Disclosure Memorandum is liable to be withdrawn
for any reason.   Section 12.03. Non Deductible Revenue Outgoings. As far as
the AHL Europe is aware, all sums payable under any obligation incurred by
ADI prior to Completion and which will continue to bind ADI after Completion
have been and will continue to be deductible for corporation tax purposes,
either in computing the profits of ADI as the case may be or in computing the
corporation tax chargeable on ADI and such sums payable by ADI shall include,
without limitation, all remuneration and other sums (including any payments
made directly or indirectly in consideration or in consequence of, or
otherwise in connection with, the termination of the holding of any office or
employment) paid or payable and all benefits provided or agreed to be
provided to employees or officers of ADI and all interest, rent, royalties,
annuities and other annual payments paid or payable by ADI under any loan
agreement, lease, contract, covenant or other commitment or arrangement.  
Section 12.04. Deductions or Withholdings. ADI has duly complied with all
requirements to deduct or withhold taxation from any payments it has
been made and has accounted in full to the appropriate authorities for all
amounts so deducted or withheld.   Section 12.05. Employee Schemes. ADI has

German Law (Keine Teilwertabschreibung). Therefore, there will be no
obligation in the future to write up the assets (Keine Zuschreibungspflicht
in der Zukunft).   Section 12.19. Application of Tax Warranties to the UK
Subsidiaries. Each of the statements in Section 12.01 through 12.18 would be

references to that European Subsidiary.   Section 12.19. Application of Tax
Warranties to the European Subsidiaries. Each of the statements in Sections
12.01, 12.02, 12.03, 12.04, 12.11, 12.12, 12.13, 12.14 and 12.18 would be

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY   Section 16.01. Limitation of Liability.   (a)
Definitions   (i) In this Annex XVI, "Relevant Claim" means a claim in 
respect of any of the European Warranties other than the European Tax 
Warranties, to which the provisions (to the extent specified in the Tax 
Deed) of the Tax Deed apply;   (ii) In addition to this Annex XVI the
provisions of  Article 16 of this Agreement shall apply to limit the
liability of the  Seller under any Relevant Claim;   (b) Qualifications  
(i) The Sellers shall not be liable in respect of a  Relevant Claim if it
would not have arisen (or where it would have been  reduced the Sellers shall
not be liable for the amount by which it  would have been reduced) but for
anything voluntarily done or omitted  to be done after Completion by the
Purchaser or ADI or any of the  European Subsidiaries in the knowledge that
the same would or would be  likely to give rise to a breach of a European
Warranty and excluding  any act: (A) carried out pursuant to a legally
binding obligation of  any of ADI or any of the European Subsidiaries, (B)
pursuant to an  obligation imposed by law, regulation or requirement having
the force  of law, (C) taking place with the written approval of AHL Europe
or  pursuant to this Agreement or any agreement executed pursuant to this 
Agreement or (D) occurring in the ordinary course of business of ADI or  any
of the European Subsidiaries.   (ii) Where the Purchaser or ADI or any of
the European  Subsidiaries (or any assignee or successor in title thereof)
is  entitled to recover from some other person any sum in respect of any 
matter or event which could give rise to a Relevant Claim, the person  so
entitled shall (subject to that party being indemnified in advance  in
respect of reasonable costs and expenses by AHL Europe) take all  appropriate
steps to recover that sum either before or after making the  Relevant Claim,
and any sum recovered (whether by payment, discount,  credit, set-off or
otherwise) will reduce the amount of the Relevant  Claim (and, in the event
of the recovery being delayed until after the  Relevant Claim has been
satisfied by the AHL Europe, shall be paid as  soon as reasonably practicable
to AHL Europe, after deduction of all  reasonable costs and expenses of the
recovery).   (iii) The Purchaser shall procure that each of the European 
Subsidiaries shall accept and comply with Subsection (ii) above as if  each
such person were a party to and bound by this Agreement.   (iv) Any Relevant
Claim, to the extent remediable, shall  not entitle the Purchaser to
compensation unless AHL Europe is given  written notice of such
Relevant    123  129   Claim and the matter or breach giving rise to the
Relevant Claim is not  remedied within 30 days after the date such notice is
served.   (v) The Purchaser shall not be entitled to recover  damages or
otherwise obtain reimbursement or restitution under this  Agreement or the
Tax Deed more than once in respect of the same loss.   (vi) Any amount paid
by AHL Europe to the Purchaser in  respect of a Relevant Claim shall be
treated as a reduction pro-rata in  the purchase consideration paid by the
Purchaser for the ADI Shares.   (vii) The Sellers shall not be liable for
any Relevant  Claim to the extent that:   (a) It is provided for or
reserved in the  European Accounts and/or in the European Completion
Accounts;   (b) Such Relevant Claim results from or is  increased or
extended by the change in the accounting  reference date of ADI or any of the
European Subsidiaries on  or after Completion or arises as a result of any
changes after  Completion in the accounting policies of ADI or any of the 
European Subsidiaries or the Purchaser save for changes  required by UK
GAAP.   (c) Such liability results from the sale of  shares in ADI or any
of the European Subsidiaries after  Completion;   (d) Such Relevant Claim
arises or is increased  as a consequence of a change in any legislation or a
change or  withdrawal of any previously published practice or concession  of
any tax authority affecting ADI or any of the European  Subsidiaries made
after the date of this Agreement or as a  result of the retrospective
imposition of taxation or increase  in the rates of taxation after the date
of this Agreement;   (e) Of the value of any benefit certified by the 
relevant company\'s auditors (at the request and expense of the  Sellers)
(including taxation benefit) accruing to the  Purchaser or ADI or any of the
European Subsidiaries as a  consequence of the relevant breach or the matter
or event  giving rise to such Relevant Claim.   (viii) The effect of the
application of Section (vii) above  shall first be taken into account for the
purposes of determining the  amount of liability for the purposes of Article
16 of the Agreement.   (ix) If any Relevant Claim shall arise by reason of
some  liability which at the time that the Relevant Claim shall be notified 
to AHL Europe shall be contingent only then AHL Europe shall not be  under
any obligation to make any payment to the    124  130   Purchaser or ADI
or any of the European Subsidiaries in respect of such  Relevant Claim until
such time as such contingent liability ceases to  be so contingent.   (x)
This paragraph applies to any Relevant Claim where  the loss or damage giving
rise to such Relevant Claim is recoverable  from insurers by ADI or any of
the European Subsidiaries or by the  Purchaser. The Purchaser shall not seek
to pursue any such Relevant  Claim against AHL Europe without first claiming
or procuring ADI or the  relevant European Subsidiary to claim against its
insurers for  compensation for the loss or damage suffered. The Purchaser
shall  pursue or shall procure ADI or the relevant European Subsidiary to 
pursue such claim for compensation. Any Relevant Claim to which this 
paragraph applies shall be limited (in addition to all other  limitations on
AHL Europe\'s liability elsewhere in this Annex) to the  amount by which the
amount of the Relevant Claim shall exceed the  insurance proceeds received
(after deducting costs and expenses  reasonably incurred in pursuing the
insurance claim).   (xi) The Purchaser confirms to AHL Europe in respect
of  the proposed purchase of the ADI Shares only that in entering into this 
Agreement it has not relied on any representation, warranty or  undertaking
except as expressly set out in this Agreement. The  Purchaser irrevocably and
unconditionally waives any right it may have  to claim damages for any
misrepresentation whether or not contained in  this Agreement or for breach
of warranty in connection with the  acquisition of the ADI Shares not
contained in this Agreement unless  such misrepresentation or warranty was
made fraudulently.   (xii) The provisions of this Annex shall remain in
force  and be fully applicable in all circumstances and in particular shall 
not be discharged by any breach of this Agreement whatever its nature  or
consequence nor by any termination or rescission by the Purchaser of  the
whole or any part of this Agreement.    125  131    EXHIBIT A

restricting Purchaser\'s day-to-day  ability to manage the business of
Argenbright Security and its  Subsidiaries, Purchaser hereby agrees to use
its reasonable endeavors  (a) to conduct the business of Argenbright Security
and its  Subsidiaries in full accordance with all applicable laws and 
regulations and (b) to carry on the business of Argenbright Security  and its
Subsidiaries (i) in the ordinary course, consistent with past  practice
(provided that Argenbright Security shall accrue all sales,  use, gross
receipts and similar taxes (including interest and  penalties)) and (ii) with
a view to maximizing sales in accordance with  the Budget. Purchaser shall
not make any material change to the nature  or scope of the business of

business of Argenbright Security and its  Subsidiaries from Purchaser\'s
other business activities and Purchaser  shall provide incentives to
employees of Argenbright Security and its  Subsidiaries which are consistent
with (i) the Budget and/or (ii) the  maximization of 2001 EBIT. For purposes
of calculating 2001 EBIT,  appropriate adjustments shall be made for the
departure by Purchaser  from the items listed above.  4. Computation. The
Final Purchase Price shall be determined as follows:   (a) If 2001 EBIT is
an amount less than the EBIT Floor, then  Holdings shall pay to Purchaser the
Maximum Purchase Price  Reduction, and the Final Purchase Price shall equal 
$175,000,000.   (b) If 2001 EBIT is an amount greater than the EBIT Ceiling,
then  Purchaser shall pay to Holdings the Maximum Earnout  Consideration,
and the Final Purchase Price shall equal  $210,000,000.   (c) If 2001 EBIT
is an amount between the EBIT Ceiling and the  EBIT Floor (inclusive of the
EBIT Ceiling and the EBIT Floor),  then the Final Purchase Price shall be
determined as follows:   (i) If 2001 EBIT equals the EBIT Equilibrium, then
the  Final Purchase Price shall be an amount equal to the  Closing Purchase
Price, and neither party shall pay  any additional amounts to the other
party.   (ii) If 2001 EBIT is less than the EBIT Equilibrium, then 
Holdings shall pay to Purchaser an amount ("Purchase  Price Reduction") equal
to (A) the difference  obtained when 2001 EBIT is subtracted from the EBIT 
Equilibrium multiplied by (B) PPAF and the Final  Purchase Price shall be an
amount equal to the  difference obtained when the Purchase Price Reduction 
is subtracted from the Closing Purchase Price.   (iii) If 2001 EBIT is
greater than the EBIT Equilibrium,  then Purchaser shall pay to Holdings an
amount  ("Earnout Consideration") equal to (A) the    132  138  
difference obtained when the EBIT Equilibrium is  subtracted from 2001 EBIT
multiplied by (B) PPAF and  the Final Purchase Price shall be an amount
obtained  when the Closing Purchase Price is added to the  Earnout
Consideration.    5. Delivery of Computation of 2001 EBIT.   (a) As soon
as may be practicable after December 28, 2001, but not  later than February
28, 2002, Purchaser will deliver to  Holdings a statement setting forth in
reasonable detail its  calculation of 2001 EBIT (including the amounts
excluded from  such calculation) and the amount of any Earnout
Consideration  to be paid by Purchaser to Holdings or the amount of any 
Purchase Price Reduction to be paid by Holdings to Purchaser.   (b) If
Holdings disagrees with Purchaser\'s calculation of 2001  EBIT derived
pursuant to Section 5(a) above, Holdings may,  within thirty (30) days after
delivery of the calculation of  2001 EBIT by Purchaser to Holdings, deliver a
notice to  Purchaser disagreeing with such calculation and setting forth 
Holdings\' calculation of such amount. During such thirty (30)  day period,
upon not less than three (3) days\' prior notice,  Purchaser shall allow
Holdings and its representatives access  to the books and records relating to
the US Business and  personnel of Argenbright Security and the Purchaser
related to  the US Business in order to determine the accuracy of the 
calculation provided by Purchaser pursuant to Section 5(a) of  this Schedule.
Any notice of disagreement sent by Holdings  pursuant to Section 5(b) of this
Schedule shall specify those  items or amounts as to which Holdings disagrees
and the  reasons for such disagreement, and Holdings shall be deemed to 
have agreed with all other items and amounts contained in  Purchaser\'s
calculation of 2001 EBIT.   (c) If a notice of disagreement shall be duly
delivered pursuant  to Section 5(b) above, Purchaser and Holdings shall,
during  the fifteen (15) days following such delivery, use their best 
efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts in  order to
determine, as may be required, the amount of Earnout  Consideration or
Purchase Price Reduction, if any, as may be  required. If, during such
period, Purchaser and Holdings are  unable to reach such agreement, they
shall promptly cause PWC  to review this Schedule and the disputed items or
amounts for  the purpose of calculating 2001 EBIT. In making this 
calculation, PWC shall consider only those items or amounts in  the
calculation of 2001 EBIT as to which Holdings has  disagreed. PWC shall
deliver to Purchaser and Holdings, as  promptly as practicable and in no
event later than sixty (60)  days following submission of such dispute to
PWC, a report  setting forth this calculation. Such report shall be final
and  binding upon Purchaser and Holdings. The cost of this review  and
report shall be borne: (i) by Holdings if PWC\'s  calculation of 2001 EBIT is

(ii) by Purchaser if PWC\'s calculation of  2001 EBIT is closer to Seller\'s

Management by Purchaser. While Purchaser has accepted in good faith all  the
standards and requirements set forth herein for purposes of  measuring 2001
EBIT, and is bound thereby, such acceptance is based on  Purchaser\'s desire
to establish a fair system of measurement of EBIT.  Subject to Section 3 of
this Schedule, nothing contained herein is  intended to restrict Purchaser in
the following respects:   (a) the ability of Purchaser\'s or Argenbright
Security\'s  management to carry on the business of Argenbright Security 
and its Subsidiaries in a manner consistent with its overall  corporate
objectives and standards;   (b) to make independent management decisions as
to corporate  organization, services, markets, pricing and technology;
and   (c) to manage and operate Argenbright Security and its  Subsidiaries
in any manner consistent with the best long-term  interest of Purchaser\'s
and Argenbright Security\'s  shareholders.    Holdings acknowledges and
agrees that Holdings shall not be  entitled to exercise any influence,
control or power of restraint over  the actions of the management of
Argenbright Security and its  Subsidiaries after the closing of the
transactions contemplated by the  Agreement; provided that Purchaser and
Holdings acknowledge and agree  that the costs and expenses incurred or
associated with deviations from  the 2001 Budget set forth in Section 7 shall
not be considered in the  calculation of 2001 EBIT.  8. Violation of
Covenant Not To Compete. Holdings hereby acknowledges and  agrees that
Purchaser shall not be obligated to pay to Holdings Earnout  Consideration in
the event of    134  140   a breach by the Argenbright Entities of the
covenant not to compete  provisions in Section 8.06(a) of the
Agreement.    135  141    SCHEDULE 3.04(A)  TAX DEED  [Intentionally

RELATING TO THE UK BUSINESS    (a) AHL Europe agrees that for a period of
two (2) full years form the Closing Date, neither it nor any of its
Affiliates shall, either directly or indirectly, (i) engage, either as a
principal or for its own account or solely or jointly with others, or as
shareholders in any company or joint venture association (other than the
ownership of less than three percent (3%) of the equity interest of any
company listed on the London Stock Exchange or on any other body which is a
recognized investment exchange for the purposes of the Financial Services Act
1986), in any business anywhere in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, or
Greece that is involved in the provision of the same services provided as
part of the UK Business up to and including the Closing Date or (ii) hire,
solicit or induce any employee of the UK Business to become an employee of
AHL Europe or any of its Affiliates.   (b) If any provision contained in
this Section shall for any reason be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable
in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not
affect any other provisions of this Section, but this Section shall be
construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never
been contained herein. It is the intention of the parties that if any of the
restrictions or covenants contained herein is held to cover a geographic area
or to be for a length of time which is not permitted by applicable law, or in
any way construed to be too broad or to any extent invalid, such provision
shall not be construed to be null, void and of no effect, but to the extent
such provision would be valid or enforceable under applicable law, a court of
competent jurisdiction shall construe and interpret or reform this Section to
provide for a covenant having the maximum enforceable geographic area, time
period and other provisions (not greater than those continued herein) as
shall be valid and enforceable under such applicable law. AHL Europe and its
Affiliates acknowledge that Purchaser would be irreparably harmed by any
breach of this Section and that there would be no adequate remedy at law or
in damages to compensate Purchaser for any such breach. AHL Europe and its
Affiliates agree that Purchaser shall be entitled to injunctive
relief requiring specific performance by the AHL Europe and its Affiliates of
this Section, and AHL Europe and its Affiliates consent to the entry
thereof.    140  146    SCHEDULE 11.04   NON-FOREIGN STATUS AFFIDAVIT
