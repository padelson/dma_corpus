_

  



  

 _INDEMNIFICATION_

  



  

Section 9.1 _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_. The
representations and warranties of the Company, the Warrantors and/or
the Selling Shareholders contained in this Agreement shall survive the
Closing until the second (2nd) anniversary of the Closing Date (the "
_Survival Period_ "). The covenants or other agreements of the Company, the
Warrantors and/or the Selling Shareholders contained in this Agreement (other
than those which by their terms are to be performed after the Closing) shall
survive the Closing in accordance with their terms, unless and only to the
extent that non-compliance with such covenants or agreements is waived in
writing by the Purchaser. If written notice of a claim for indemnification has
been given in accordance with the _Section 9.2_ prior to expiration of the
applicable representations, warranties and covenants, then relevant
representations, warranties and covenants shall survive such claim, until
such claim has been finally resolved. The rights of the Purchaser
to indemnification or any other remedy under this Agreement shall not be
impacted or limited by any knowledge that the Purchaser may have acquired, or
could have acquired, whether before or after the Closing Date, nor by any
investigation or diligence by the Purchaser. The Selling Shareholders hereby
acknowledge that, regardless of any investigation made (or not made) by or on
behalf of the Purchaser, and regardless of the results of any such
investigation, the Purchaser has entered into the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in express reliance upon the representations
and warranties of the Selling Shareholders made in this Agreement only.

  



  

Section 9.2 _Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) _Indemnification by Warrantors_. Subject to _Section 9.1_ , without
limiting any other remedy the Purchaser may have, from and after the Closing,
each of the Warrantors shall, severally and jointly, indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the Purchaser and its Affiliates (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, the Group Companies from and after the Closing) and their respective
officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and permitted assigns
(collectively, the " _Purchaser Indemnitees_ ") from and against all
Liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees and expenses incurred in connection with the investigation or
defense of any of the same or in responding to or cooperating with any
governmental investigation), fines and penalties suffered or incurred by the
Purchaser Indemnitees (in each case, whether absolute, accrued, conditional
or otherwise and whether or not resulting from Third Party Claims)
(hereinafter " _Losses_ "), arising out of or relating to:

  



  

(i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty with
respect to the Group Companies set forth in _Article III_ and any
representation or warranty with respect to the Founders set forth in _Article
IV_ , or any other representations, warranties or statements set forth in the
other certificates, schedules or other documents delivered by or on behalf of
any Warrantor hereunder;

  



  

   

 46

 



    



  

(ii) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant or obligation to be
performed by any Warrantor under this Agreement, or by any Warrantor
under any other Transaction Document;

  



  

(iii) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty with
respect to Tax obligation of the Group Companies under _Section 3.14_  and
any Tax obligations of the Group Companies for the portion of any Straddle
Period through the end of the Closing Date, except to the extent that such
Taxes are reserved for the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements; provided
that, in the case of any Straddle Period, (A) the amount of any Taxes of the
Group Companies based upon or measured by net income or gain which relate to
the portion of the Straddle Period through the end of the Closing Date will be
determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of
business on the Closing Date, and (B) the amount of any other Taxes of the
Group Companies which relate to the portion of the Straddle Period through
the end of the Closing Date will be determined according to an interim closing
of the books to the greatest extent possible, and otherwise shall be deemed
to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Straddle Period (except to the
extent that such Taxes are reserved for in the Interim Consolidated Financial
Statements) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
days in the portion of the Straddle Period through the end of the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in such
Straddle Period;

  



  

(iv) any breach of the representations and warranties set forth in _Section
3.16_ ,

  



  

(b) _Indemnification by Offshore Selling Shareholders_. Subject to _Section
9.1_ , without limiting any other remedy the Purchaser may have, from and
after the Closing, each of the Offshore Selling Shareholders shall, severally
but not jointly, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Purchaser
Indemnitees from and against all Losses, arising out of or relating to:

  



  

(i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty with
respect to such Offshore Selling Shareholder set forth in _Article IV_  (to
the extent applicable), or any other representations, warranties or statements
set forth in the other certificates, schedules or other documents (if any)
delivered by or on behalf of such Offshore Selling Shareholder hereunder;

  



  

(ii) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant or obligation to be
performed by such Offshore Selling Shareholder under this Agreement, or by
such Offshore Selling Shareholder under any other Transaction Document to
which such Offshore Selling Shareholder is a party;

  



  

   

 47

 



    



  

(iii) any Tax obligations of the Purchaser, its Affiliates or the Group
Companies arising from the failure of such Offshore Selling Shareholder to
comply with its obligations under _Section 6.8_.

  



  

provided, however, with respect to Losses arising under Section 9.2(b), each
Offshore Selling Shareholder's liability shall be several and not joint, and
shall only be with respect to the representations, warranties, covenants,
obligations and agreements of such Offshore Selling Shareholder in such
sections.

  



  

(c) _Indemnification by Purchaser and Domestic Purchaser_. The Purchaser and
Domestic Purchaser agrees to indemnify each of the Selling Shareholders and
their Affiliates, and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents
and advisors (collectively, the "Seller Indemnitees," and together with the
Purchaser Indemnitees, the "Indemnitees") from and against any and all
Losses suffered, incurred or sustained by such Seller Indemnitee as a result
of any inaccuracy in or breach of the representations and warranties made by
the Purchaser in Article V of this Agreement or as a result of any breach or
non-fulfillment of any covenant or obligation to be performed by the
Purchaser and Domestic Purchaser under this Agreement or any Transaction
Document.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary except
for the provision set forth under _Section 9.4_ , the following
limitations on indemnification shall apply:

  



  

(i) The Indemnitees, may not bring a claim against the other party for
indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)_ , _Section 9.2(b)_ or  _Section
9.2(c)_ , as the case may be, unless the aggregate amount of Losses incurred
and indemnifiable by the other Party thereunder exceeds US$1,000,000 in the
aggregate (for the purpose of this item (i), Selling Shareholders and Seller
Indemnitees shall be deemed as a party on the one hand and Purchaser and
Purchaser Indemnitees shall be deemed as a party on the other hand).

  



  

(ii) All Selling Shareholders collectively shall not be required to pay an
aggregate amount of Losses under _Section 9.2(a)_ and/or _Section 9.2(b)_ in
excess of US$10,000,000;

  



  

(iii) Except Losses arising out of or in connection with any breach by
Purchaser or Domestic Purchaser of its obligations under _Section 2.8_ , no
Purchaser or Domestic Purchaser shall be required to pay any amount of Losses
under _Section 9.2(c)_ in excess of US$10,000,000.

  



  

(iv) An Indemnitee shall use reasonable efforts to mitigate the Losses.

  



  

(v) The Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover any Losses relating to
any matter arising under one provision of this Agreement to the extent that
the Indemnitees had already been compensated with respect to such matter
pursuant to other provisions of this Agreement.

  



  

(vi) Payments due under this _Section 9.2_ shall not be set off against
payments due under any other section of this Agreement or any
other agreements, including the Transaction Documents.

  



  

   

 48

 



    



  

(e) _Procedures Relating to Indemnification_.

  



  

(i) Any Party seeking indemnification under this _Section 9.2_ (an "
_Indemnified Party_ ") shall promptly give the Party from whom
indemnification is being sought (an " _Indemnifying Party_ ") notice of any
matter which such Indemnified Party has determined that has given or could
reasonably be expected to give rise to a right of indemnification under this
Agreement, stating in reasonable detail the nature of the claim, and
containing a reference to the provisions of this Agreement in respect of
which such right of indemnification is claimed or arises; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the failure to provide such notice shall not release the
Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this _Section 9.2_ except
to the extent the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such
failure. With respect to any recovery or indemnification sought by
an Indemnified Party from the Indemnifying Party that does not involve a
Third Party Claim, if the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified
Party within thirty (30) days from its receipt of the notice from the
Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party disputes such claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have accepted and agreed with such
claim. If the Indemnifying Party has disputed a claim for indemnification
(including any Third Party Claim), the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution to such dispute.
If the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party cannot resolve such
dispute in thirty (30) days after delivery of the dispute notice by the
Indemnifying Party, such dispute shall be resolved by arbitration pursuant to
_Section 10.3_.

  



  

(ii) If an Indemnified Party shall receive notice of any Legal Proceeding,
audit, demand or assessment (each, a " _Third Party Claim_ ") against it or
which may give rise to a claim for Loss under this _Section 9.2_ , within
thirty (30) days of the receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Party shall
give the Indemnifying Party notice of such Third Party Claim; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the failure to provide such notice shall not release the
Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this _Section 9.2_
except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by
such failure. If the Indemnifying Party acknowledges in writing its
obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder against any Losses
that may result from such Third Party Claim, then the Indemnifying Party
shall be entitled to assume and control the defense of such Third Party Claim
at its expense and through counsel of its choice if it gives notice of its
intention to do so to the Indemnified Party within five (5) days of the
receipt of such notice from the Indemnified Party; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if there exists or is reasonably likely to exist a conflict of interest
that would make it inappropriate in the judgment of the Indemnified Party in
its sole and absolute discretion for the same counsel to represent both the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to retain its own counsel in each jurisdiction for which the
Indemnified Party determines counsel is required, at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party. In the event that the Indemnifying Party exercises the
right to undertake any such defense against any such Third Party Claim as
provided above, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying
Party in such defense and make available to the Indemnifying Party, at the
Indemnifying Party's expense, all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and
information in the Indemnified Party's possession or under the Indemnified
Party's control relating thereto as is reasonably required by the
Indemnifying Party. Similarly, in the event the Indemnified Party is, directly
or indirectly, conducting the defense against any such Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in such defense
and make available to the Indemnified Party, at the Indemnifying Party's
expense, all such witnesses, records, materials and information in the
Indemnifying Party's possession or under the Indemnifying Party's control
relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnified Party. No such
Third Party Claim may be settled by the Indemnifying Party without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party.

  



  

   

 49

 



    



  

Section 9.3 _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. All indemnification
payments made under this _Article IX_ shall be treated as adjustments to the
Aggregate Purchase Price and the Purchase Price for the Selling Shareholder
for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by applicable Laws.

  



  

Section 9.4 _Liquidated Damages_. Without limiting anything contained in this
Agreement, in the event that the Purchaser and/or Domestic Purchaser fail(s)
to make the full payment of the Aggregate Purchase Price to the Selling
Shareholders in accordance with this Agreement, the Domestic Purchaser shall
pay to the Onshore Selling Shareholders, and/or the Purchaser shall pay to the
Offshore Selling Shareholders, as the case may be, liquidated damages in an
amount of 0.01% of the delayed amount per day until and upon the full payment
of the Aggregate Purchase Price. The Parties further acknowledge and agree
that, the said amount is a genuine and reasonable pre-estimate of the Selling
Shareholders\' Losses caused by the said event and therefore constitutes
compensation for such losses and is not a penalty, and it reflects the
Selling Shareholders' legitimate interests and is not extravagant,
unreasonable or unconscionable.

  



  

Article X _ 
_

  



  

 _M_ _iscellaneous_

  



  

Section 10.1 _Expenses_. Each Party shall bear its own costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and each other Transaction Document and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby (the " _Transaction Expenses_ ").

  



  

Section 10.2 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed exclusively in accordance with the laws of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (without giving effect to any choice of law principles
thereof that would cause the application of the laws of
another jurisdiction).

  



  

Section 10.3 _Arbitration_.

  



  

(a) Any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement,
including any question regarding its existence, validity or
termination, shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration in Hong
Kong in accordance with the Hong Kong International Arbitration Center
Administered Arbitration Rules (the " _HKIAC Rules_ ") in force when the
notice of arbitration is submitted in accordance with the HKIAC Rules. The
HKIAC Rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference to this clause. The
tribunal shall be comprised of three arbitrators to be appointed in
accordance with the HKIAC Rules. The arbitration shall be conducted in
English. Each Party irrevocably and unconditionally consents to such
arbitration as the sole and exclusive method of resolving any dispute arising
out of or in connection with this Agreement, including any question regarding
its existence, validity or termination, other than any proceedings to seek
the remedies of specific performance as contemplated by _Section 10.5_.

  



  

   

 50

 



    



  

(b) The award of the arbitral tribunal shall be final and binding on the
Parties. The Parties agree that they will not have recourse to any judicial
proceedings, in any jurisdiction whatsoever, for the purpose of seeking
appeal, annulment, setting aside, modification or any diminution or
impairment of its terms or effect insofar as such exclusion can validly be
made. Judgment upon any award rendered may be entered in any court having
jurisdiction thereof, or application may be made to such court for a judicial
acceptance of the award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be.

  



  

Section 10.4 _Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement
(including the schedules and exhibits hereto) and the other
Transaction Documents represent the entire understanding and agreement among
the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. Except as
otherwise provided herein, this Agreement can be amended, supplemented or
changed, and any provision hereof can be waived, only by written instrument
making specific reference to this Agreement signed by the Purchaser, all
Offshore Selling Shareholders and the Company. No action taken pursuant to
this Agreement, including any investigation by or on behalf of any Party,
shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the Party taking such action of
compliance with any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained
herein. The waiver by any Party hereto of a breach of any provision of this
Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a further or continuing waiver
of such breach or as a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. No failure on
the part of any Party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right,
power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any
single or partial exercise of such right, power or remedy by such Party
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, power or remedy.

  



  

Section 10.5 _Specific Performance_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that each Party shall be
entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof. It is accordingly
agreed that prior to such termination, each Party shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent such breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically (without proof of actual damages or harm, and not subject
to any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection
therewith) such terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which each Party is entitled at law or in
equity.

  



  

Section 10.6 _Notices_. All notices and other communications under this
Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed effectively given (i) when
delivered personally by hand (with written confirmation of receipt), (ii)
when sent by fax (with written confirmation of transmission) or email
(provided that the sender of email shall not have received any message that
such email was not timely delivered) or (iii) two (2) Business Days following
the day sent by overnight courier (with written confirmation of receipt), in
each case at the addresses and facsimile numbers (or to such other address or
facsimile number as a party may have specified by notice given to the other
party pursuant to this provision) in _EXHIBIT C_.

  



  

   

 51

 



    



  

Section 10.7 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any law or public
policy, all other terms or provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of
the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

  



  

Section 10.8 _Binding Effect; Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement shall create or
be deemed to create any third party beneficiary rights in any person or
entity not a party to this Agreement except as provided in _Section 9.2_
hereof. No assignment of this Agreement or of any rights or obligations
hereunder may be made by (i) any Selling Shareholder, directly or indirectly
(by operation of law or otherwise), without the prior written consent of the
Purchaser, and (ii) the Purchaser directly or indirectly (by operation of law
or otherwise), without the prior written consent of all Offshore Selling
Shareholders and the Company, without the prior written consent of the
Purchaser, and any attempted assignment in violation of this _Section 10.8_
shall be void; _provided_ , that the Purchaser may assign its rights and
obligations under this Agreement to any of its Affiliates. Each obligation of
the Founders hereunder shall be deemed to be on a joint and several basis,
and each obligation of the Purchaser and Domestic Purchaser shall be deemed
to be on a joint and several basis. Except as specifically provided in the
preceding sentence, the obligations of each Selling Shareholder shall be
several and not joint.

  



  

Section 10.9 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts in PDF or other electronic format, each of which will be deemed
to be an original copy of this Agreement and all of which, when taken
together, will be deemed to constitute one and the same agreement.
