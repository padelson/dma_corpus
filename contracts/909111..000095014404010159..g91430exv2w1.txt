2.21    - ix -    AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   THIS AGREEMENT AND
PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated as of October 25, 2004, by and among
COLONIAL PROPERTIES TRUST, an Alabama real estate investment trust
("Colonial"), CLNL ACQUISITION SUB LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
("Colonial Merger Sub"), and CORNERSTONE REALTY INCOME TRUST, INC., a
Virginia corporation ("Cornerstone").   R E C I T A L S:   A. The Board of
Trustees of Colonial and the Board of Directors of Cornerstone deem it
advisable and in the best interests of their respective shareholders, upon
the terms and subject to the conditions contained herein, that Cornerstone
shall merge with and into Colonial Merger Sub, a wholly owned subsidiary of
Colonial that is disregarded as an entity separate from Colonial for federal
income tax purposes (the "Merger").   B. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein, Colonial Merger Sub and Cornerstone shall
execute a Certificate of Merger (the "Delaware Certificate of Merger") in
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A and shall file such
Delaware Certificate of Merger in accordance with Delaware law to effectuate
the Merger.   C. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein, Colonial Merger Sub and Cornerstone shall also execute Articles of
Merger (the "Virginia Articles of Merger") in substantially the form attached
hereto as Exhibit B and, concurrently with the filing of the Delaware
Certificate of Merger, shall file such Virginia Articles of Merger in
accordance with Virginia law to effectuate the Merger.   D. Immediately
following consummation of the Merger, Colonial shall contribute to Colonial
Realty Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership ("Colonial
Partnership"), in exchange for additional interests therein, all of the
outstanding limited liability company membership interests in Colonial Merger
Sub, with the result that Colonial Merger Sub will become a wholly owned
subsidiary of Colonial Partnership that is disregarded as an entity separate
from Colonial Partnership for federal income tax purposes.   E. For federal
income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger shall qualify as a
reorganization under Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the "Code"), with Cornerstone being treated as
having merged into Colonial for federal income tax purposes, and that this
Agreement shall constitute a plan of reorganization under Section 368(a) of
the Code.   F. Colonial and Cornerstone have each received a fairness
opinion relating to the transactions contemplated hereby as more fully
described herein.     G. Colonial, Colonial Merger Sub and Cornerstone
desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
in connection with the Merger.   H. As an inducement to Colonial and
Colonial Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement, Glade M. Knight and certain
entities controlled by Glade M. Knight have entered into a voting agreement
(the "Cornerstone Voting Agreement"), pursuant to which such person or entity
has agreed, among other things, to vote his or its Cornerstone Common Shares
(as defined herein) to approve this Agreement, the Merger and any other
matter which requires his or its vote in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.   I. As an inducement to Cornerstone to
enter into this Agreement, Thomas H. Lowder and certain entities controlled
by Thomas H. Lowder have entered into a voting agreement (the "Colonial
Voting Agreement," and together with the Cornerstone Voting Agreement, the
"Voting Agreements"), pursuant to which such person or entity has agreed,
among other things, to vote his or its shares of beneficial interest of
Colonial to approve this Agreement, the Merger and any other matter which
requires his or its vote in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the
mutual representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained
herein, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:   ARTICLE I   THE
MERGER   1.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with Title 6, Chapter 18 of
the Delaware Code Annotated, as amended (the "DE LLC Act") and Title 13.1,
Chapter 9 of the Code of Virginia, as amended (the "Virginia Corporation
Act"), Cornerstone shall be merged with and into Colonial Merger Sub, with
Colonial Merger Sub surviving as a limited liability company.   1.2
Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place commencing
at 9:00 a.m., local time, on the date to be specified by the parties, which
shall be no later than the third business day after satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions set forth in Article 6 (the "Closing Date"), at the offices of
Hogan and Hartson L.L.P., Columbia Square, 555 Thirteenth Street, NW Washington
D.C. 20004, unless another date or place is agreed to in writing by the
parties; provided that, in the event that Cornerstone has delivered a
notice of termination pursuant to Section 7.1(j), the "Closing Date" shall be
the third business day after delivery of the Top-Up Notice (as defined
herein), if any, pursuant to Section 7.1(j).   1.3 Effective Time. On the
Closing Date, Colonial Merger Sub and Cornerstone shall execute and file the
Delaware Certificate of Merger, executed in accordance with the DE LLC Act,
with the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the
"Delaware Secretary"), and the Virginia Articles of Merger, executed in
accordance with the Virginia Corporation Act, with the State Corporation
Commission of the Commonwealth of   2   Virginia (the "Virginia
Commission") and shall make all other filings and recordings required under
the DE LLC Act and the Virginia Corporation Act. The Merger shall become
effective (the "Effective Time") at such time as Colonial and Cornerstone
shall agree should be specified in the Delaware Certificate of Merger and the
Virginia Articles of Merger (not to exceed thirty (30) days after the
Delaware Certificate of Merger is accepted for record by the
Delaware Secretary). Unless otherwise agreed, the parties shall cause the
Effective Time to occur on the Closing Date.   1.4 Effect of Merger on
Certificate of Formation and Operating Agreement of Colonial Merger Sub. The
Articles of Organization, as amended, of Colonial Merger Sub and the Limited
Liability Company Operating Agreement, as amended, of Colonial Merger Sub, as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, shall
continue in full force and effect after the Merger until further amended in
accordance with applicable Delaware law.   1.5 Officers and Managers of
Colonial Merger Sub; Additional Trustee of Colonial. The officers and members
of the Board of Managers of Colonial Merger Sub following the Merger shall
consist of the officers and members of the Board of Managers of Colonial
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, who shall
continue to serve for the balance of their unexpired terms or their earlier
death, resignation or removal. Colonial shall cause Glade M. Knight to be
appointed as an additional member of the Board of Trustees of Colonial,
effective as of midnight on the Closing Date. Colonial then shall include and
recommend Glade M. Knight in the management slate of nominees for election to
the Board of Trustees of Colonial at each annual meeting or special meeting
of Colonial until at least the third anniversary of the Effective Time.  
1.6 Effect on Capital Stock and Membership Interest; Colonial Articles
Supplementary. The effect of the Merger on the shares of capital stock of
Cornerstone shall be as provided in the Delaware Certificate of Merger,
the Virginia Articles of Merger and in Section 1.8. The Merger shall not
change the shares of beneficial interest of Colonial outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time of the Merger. At the Effective Time of the
Merger, the 100% limited liability company membership interest of Colonial
Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger
(all of which shall be owned by Colonial at such time) shall be converted
into a number of units of limited liability company membership interest of
Colonial Merger Sub ("Colonial Merger Sub LLC Units") equal to the number of
Cornerstone Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
of the Merger. Prior to or as of the Effective Time, the Declaration of
Trust, as amended, of Colonial (the "Colonial Declaration of Trust") shall be
amended, in accordance with Title 10, Chapter 3 of the Alabama Code, as
amended (the "Alabama REIT Law"), and the terms of the Colonial Declaration
of Trust, by the adoption of articles supplementary substantially in the form
set forth on Exhibit C (the "Colonial Articles Supplementary") to provide for
the creation of the Colonial Series E Preferred Shares (as defined
herein).   1.7 Colonial Partnership Amendment. Prior to or as of the
Effective Time, the Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited
Partnership, as amended, of Colonial Partnership (the "Colonial Partnership
Agreement") shall be amended, in accordance with Title 6, Chapter 17 of the
Delaware Code Annotated, as amended, and the terms of the Colonial  
3   Partnership Agreement, by the adoption of an amendment in accordance
with Section 4.2.B thereof (the "Colonial Partnership Amendment") to provide
for the creation of 7.62% Series E Preferred Units of Colonial Partnership to
be owned by Colonial and having terms substantially similar to the Colonial
Series E Preferred Shares (as defined herein)) (the "Colonial Series E
Preferred OP Units").   1.8 Merger Consideration.   (a) Merger
Consideration. (i) Each common share, no par value, of Cornerstone
("Cornerstone Common Share") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time of the Merger, which under the terms of Section 1.10 is to be
converted solely into Depositary Shares of Colonial (each having
a liquidation preference of $25.00 per Depositary Share) (each a "Colonial
Series E Preferred Depositary Share") representing 1/100th of a 7.62% Series
E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Share of Beneficial Interest, $.01 par
value per share, of Colonial (each having a liquidation preference of
$2,500.00 per share) (each a "Colonial Series E Preferred Share"), shall be
converted into the right to receive a number of validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable Colonial Series E Preferred Depositary Shares (evidenced by
Depositary Receipts of Colonial ("Depositary Receipts")) equal to the
Preferred Depositary Share Conversion Rate (as defined herein). As used
herein, "Preferred Depositary Share Conversion Rate" shall mean (I) 0.4200
multiplied by (II) an amount equal to the difference obtained by subtracting
(x) one (1) minus (y) the Closing Adjustment Factor (as defined herein).  
(ii) Each Cornerstone Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time of the Merger (other than Cornerstone Common Shares to
be converted into the right to receive Colonial Series E Preferred Depositary
Shares pursuant to Section 1.8(a)(i) and Section 1.10) shall be converted
into the right to receive (A) a number of validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable common shares of beneficial interest, $.01 par value per share,
of Colonial (each a "Colonial Common Share") equal to the Common Share
Conversion Rate (as defined herein) (with each such Colonial Common Share
being issued with the related Colonial Right (as defined herein)) and (B) if
(and only if) a Top-Up Notice shall have been delivered pursuant to
Section 7.1(j), (y) if the Top-Up Amount is payable all or in part with
Colonial Common Shares, an additional number of validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable Colonial Common Shares equal to the product of the Common
Share Conversion Rate times a fraction, the numerator of which is the portion
of the Top-Up Amount (expressed in dollars) payable in Colonial Common Shares
(as specified in the Top-Up Notice) and the denominator of which is the
Average Closing Price (as defined herein) (with each such Colonial Common
Share being issued with the related Colonial Right), or (z) if the Top-Up
Amount is payable all or in part in cash, an amount of cash equal to the
product of the Common Share Conversion Rate times the portion of the Top-Up
Amount (expressed in dollars) payable in cash. As used herein, "Common Share
Conversion Rate" shall mean (I) 0.2584 multiplied by (II) an amount equal to
the difference obtained by subtracting (x) one (1) minus (y) the Closing
Adjustment Factor. "Closing Adjustment Factor" shall mean a fraction obtained
by dividing (I) the Closing Adjustment Amount by (II) the product of (x) the
sum of the total number of Cornerstone Common Shares outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time plus the total number of Net Cornerstone Option
Shares (as defined herein) determined based on the Cornerstone Stock Options
(as defined herein) outstanding immediately   4   prior to the Effective
Time and (y) $10.80. "Closing Adjustment Amount" shall mean the sum of (I)

Days (as defined herein) in the period ending ten Trading Days prior to the
Closing Date. "Trading Day" shall mean a day on which the New York Stock

Rights Agent. "Net Cornerstone Option Shares" shall be equal to (x) the
number of Cornerstone Common Shares issuable under Cornerstone Stock Options
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time with exercise prices of
less than $10.80 minus (y) the number of Cornerstone Common Shares that could
be purchased at a price of $10.80 per share using the aggregate proceeds that
would be received by Cornerstone if all of the in-the-money Cornerstone Stock
Options described in clause (x) were exercised in full.   (b) Cancelled
Status of Cornerstone Common Shares. Each Cornerstone Common Share, when so
converted as provided in Section 1.8(a)(i) or (ii) or Section 1.10(b), shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (a "Certificate")
theretofore representing such Cornerstone Common Share shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive, upon the
surrender of such Certificate in accordance with Section 1.13(c), as
applicable, (A) any dividends and other distributions in accordance with
Section 1.13(d), (B) certificates representing the Colonial Common

or payable as part of any Top-Up Amount pursuant to Section 1.8(a)(ii).  
1.9 Election by Holders of Cornerstone Common Shares to Receive Colonial
Common Shares or Colonial Series E Preferred Depositary Shares. Each holder
of Cornerstone Common Shares shall have the right to submit a Form
of Election (as defined herein) specifying the number of Cornerstone Common
Shares which such holder desires to have converted into the right to receive
Colonial Common Shares in the Merger pursuant to Section 1.8(a)(ii) and the
number which such holder desires to have converted into the right to receive
Colonial Series E Preferred Depositary Shares in the Merger pursuant to
Section 1.8(a)(i) in accordance with the following procedures:   (a) Each
holder of Cornerstone Common Shares may specify in a request made in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 1.9 (an "Election") (i) the
number of such Cornerstone Common Shares which such holder desires to have
converted into the right to receive Colonial Series E Preferred Depositary
Shares in the Merger pursuant to Section 1.8(a)(i) (a "Preferred Election")
and (ii) the number of such Cornerstone Common   5   Shares which such
holder desires to have converted into the right to receive Colonial Common
Shares in the Merger pursuant to Section 1.8(a)(ii) (a
"Common Election").   (b) Colonial and Cornerstone shall prepare, for use
by holders of Cornerstone Common Shares in surrendering Certificates
representing Cornerstone Common Shares, a form of election (the "Form of
Election") pursuant to which each holder of Cornerstone Common Shares may
make Elections. The Form of Election shall be mailed to holders of record of
Cornerstone Common Shares as of the record date for the Cornerstone
Shareholders Meeting (as defined herein) and shall accompany the Joint Proxy
Statement (as defined herein).   (c) Cornerstone shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to make the Form of Election available to all Persons (as
defined herein) who become holders of record of Cornerstone Common Shares
during the period between such record date and the Election Date (as defined
herein).   (d) An Election shall have been properly made only if
the Exchange Agent (as defined herein) shall have received, by 5:00 p.m.,
Eastern Time, on the second business day (such time on such day being
referred to herein as the "Election Date") preceding the date of the
Cornerstone Shareholders Meeting, a Form of Election properly completed and
signed (and not revoked) and accompanied by the Certificate or Certificates
representing Cornerstone Common Shares to which such Form of Election
relates, duly endorsed in blank or otherwise in form acceptable for transfer
on the books of Cornerstone (or by an appropriate guarantee of delivery of
such Certificate or Certificates as set forth in such Form of Election from a
member of any registered national securities exchange or of the National
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or a commercial bank or trust company
having an office or correspondent in the United States, provided such
Certificate or Certificates are in fact delivered by the time set forth in
such guarantee of delivery).   (e) Any holder of record of Cornerstone
Common Shares may at any time prior to the Election Date change such
holder\'s Election by written notice received by the Exchange Agent at or
prior to the Election Date accompanied by a properly completed Form of
Election. Colonial and Cornerstone shall have the right in their sole
discretion and by mutual agreement to permit changes in Elections after the
Election Date.   (f) Any holder of record of Cornerstone Common Shares may
at any time prior to the Election Date revoke such holder\'s Election by
written notice received by the Exchange Agent at or prior to the Election
Date or by withdrawal prior to the Election Date of such holder\'s
Certificates previously deposited with the Exchange Agent. Any revocation of
an Election may be withdrawn by notice of such withdrawal delivered at or
prior to the Election Date. Any such holder who shall have deposited
Certificates with the Exchange Agent shall have the right to withdraw such
Certificates by written notice received by the Exchange Agent and thereby
revoke such holder\'s Election as of the Election Date at any time after the
expiration of the period of 60 days following the Election Date if the Merger
shall not have been consummated prior thereto. Colonial shall obtain from the
Exchange Agent an agreement to return each Form of Election and accompanying
Certificates to the holders of Cornerstone Common Shares submitting the same
in the event this Agreement shall be terminated in accordance with its
terms.   6    (g) Colonial and Cornerstone by mutual agreement shall
have the right to make rules, not inconsistent with the terms of this
Agreement, governing the validity of the Form of Election, the manner and
extent to which Elections are to be taken into account in making the
determinations prescribed by Section 1.10, the issuance and delivery of
certificates for Colonial Common Shares and Colonial Series E Preferred
Depositary Shares into which Cornerstone Common Shares are converted in the
Merger and the treatment of Colonial Common Shares and Cornerstone Common
Shares held through brokers or other market participants (i.e., in street
name).   1.10 Proration. The determination of whether Cornerstone
Common Shares shall be converted in the Merger into Colonial Common Shares
in accordance with Section 1.8(a)(ii) or Colonial Series E Preferred
Depositary Shares in accordance with Section 1.8(a)(i), or the right to
receive a combination of Colonial Series E Preferred Depositary Shares and
Colonial Common Shares shall be made as set forth in this Section 1.10.  
(a) Each Cornerstone Common Share for which a Common Election is received and
each Non-Electing Share (as defined herein) shall be converted into Colonial
Common Shares in accordance with Section 1.8(a)(ii). For purposes of this
Section 1.10, outstanding Cornerstone Common Shares as to which an election
is not in effect at the Election Date and shares as to which an Election has
been withdrawn after the 60-day period following the Election Date and prior
to the Effective Time of the Merger shall be called "Non-Electing Shares." If
Colonial and Cornerstone shall determine for any reason that any Election was
not properly made with respect to Cornerstone Common Shares, such Election
shall be deemed ineffective and Cornerstone Common Shares covered by such
Election shall, for purposes hereof, be deemed to be Non-Electing Shares.  
(b) Except as provided in the immediately following sentence, each
Cornerstone Common Share for which a Preferred Election is received shall be
converted into Colonial Series E Preferred Depositary Shares in
accordance with Section 1.8(a)(i). If Preferred Elections are received for a
number of Cornerstone Common Shares which is greater than the Maximum
Preferred Depositary Share Amount (as defined herein), each Cornerstone
Common Share for which a Preferred Election has been received shall be
converted in the Merger into the right to receive (i) a number of Colonial
Series E Preferred Depositary Shares equal to the product of (w) the
Preferred Depositary Share Conversion Rate and (x) a fraction (the "Preferred
Fraction") the numerator of which shall be the Maximum Preferred Depositary
Share Amount and the denominator of which shall be the aggregate number of
Cornerstone Common Shares covered by all Preferred Elections, and (ii) a
number of Colonial Common Shares equal to the product of (y) the Common Share
Conversion Rate and (z) a fraction (the "Common Fraction") equal to one minus
the Preferred Fraction and (iii) if (and only if) a Top-Up Notice shall have
been delivered pursuant to Section 7.1(j), additional consideration in an
amount and form equal to the Common Fraction times the amount of Colonial
Common Shares and cash payable with respect to a Cornerstone Common Share for
which a Common Election is received pursuant to clause (B) of Section
1.8(a)(ii). As used herein, "Maximum Preferred Depositary Share Amount" shall
mean 14,080,954 minus the Maximum Preferred Depositary Share
Adjustment Amount. "Maximum Preferred Depositary Share Adjustment Amount"
shall be an amount   7   (rounded to the nearest whole number) equal to
the quotient obtained by dividing (I) the Closing Adjustment Amount by (II)
$10.50.   1.11 Partner Approval. Through its approval of the
Colonial Partnership Amendment as general partner of Colonial Partnership,
Colonial has obtained the requisite approval of the partners of Colonial
Partnership of the Colonial Partnership Amendment (the "Colonial Partner
Approval").   1.12 Appraisal or Dissenters Rights. The holders of
Cornerstone Common Shares and Colonial Common Shares are not entitled under
applicable law to appraisal, dissenters or similar rights as a result of the
Merger.   1.13 Exchange of Certificates; Pre-Closing Dividends;
Fractional Shares.   (a) Exchange Agent; Depositary. Prior to the Effective
Time, Colonial shall appoint EquiServe Trust Company as the exchange agent,
or another bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to Cornerstone, to act
as exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") for the exchange of the
consideration to be paid in the Merger pursuant to Section 1.8 and Section
1.10 (the "Merger Consideration") upon surrender of certificates representing
issued and outstanding Cornerstone Common Shares. In addition, prior to the
Effective Time, Colonial shall appoint Equiserve Trust Company as the
depositary for the Colonial Series E Preferred Depositary Shares, or another
bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to Cornerstone, pursuant to a
Depositary Agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Cornerstone.   (b) Colonial to Provide Merger Consideration; Cornerstone
to Provide Funds for Final Cornerstone Dividend. Colonial shall provide to
the Exchange Agent at or before the Effective Time of the Merger, for the
benefit of the holders of Cornerstone Common Shares, the Merger Consideration
issuable in exchange for the issued and outstanding Cornerstone Common Shares
pursuant to Section 1.8 and Section 1.10, together with any cash required to
make payments in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.13(g)
(the "Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Agent (or other depository acting for the
benefit of the Exchange Agent) shall invest any cash included in the Exchange
Fund as directed by Colonial, on a daily basis. Any interest or other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to Colonial. Cornerstone shall
provide to the Exchange Agent not later than three business days prior to the
Effective Time of the Merger, for the benefit of the holders of Cornerstone
Common Shares, cash payable in respect of any dividends required pursuant to
Section 1.13(d)(i). Such cash shall be invested in accordance with written
directions delivered by Cornerstone to the Exchange Agent (or other
depository) not later than three business days prior to the Effective Time of
the Merger, with any interest or other income earned on such investments to
be paid to Colonial as the successor to Cornerstone in the Merger.   (c)
Exchange Procedure. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time, Colonial shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate
or Certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding Cornerstone Common Shares (other than to holders of
Cornerstone Common Shares who previously surrendered with their Form of
Election their   8   Certificates for Cornerstone Common Shares) whose
shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 1.8(a) and Section 1.10, (i) a letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates
to the Exchange Agent and shall be in a form and have such other provisions
as Colonial may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. To the extent not previously surrendered with a Form of
Election, upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange
Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by
Colonial, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such
other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
the Merger Consideration into which the Cornerstone Common Shares theretofore
represented by such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to Section
1.8(a) and Section 1.10, together with cash, if any, payable in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.13(g), to be mailed (or made
available for collection by hand if so elected by the surrendering holder)
within five business days of receipt thereof, and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Cornerstone Common Shares which is not registered in the
transfer records of Cornerstone, payment may be made to a Person other than
the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the Person requesting such payment either shall pay any transfer
or other Taxes required by reason of such payment being made to a Person
other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to
the satisfaction of Colonial that such Tax or Taxes have been paid or are
not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.13,
each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration, without interest, into which the Cornerstone Common Shares
theretofore represented by such Certificate shall have been converted
pursuant to Section 1.8 and Section 1.10, and any cash payable in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.13(g). No interest will be paid or
will accrue on the Merger Consideration upon the surrender of any Certificate
or on any cash payable pursuant to Section 1.13(d) or Section 1.13(g).
Colonial or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled, in its sole
and absolute discretion, to deduct and withhold from the cash, Colonial
Common Shares or Colonial Series E Preferred Depositary Shares, or any
combination thereof, that otherwise is payable pursuant to this Agreement to
any holder of Cornerstone Common Shares such amounts as Colonial or the
Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code or under any provision of federal,
state, local or foreign Tax law. For this purpose, (x) any Colonial Common
Shares deducted and withheld by Colonial shall be valued at the last trading
price of the Colonial Common Shares on the NYSE on the Effective Date of the
Merger and (y) any Colonial Series E Preferred Depositary Shares deducted and
withheld by Colonial shall be valued at $25.00 (i.e., 1/100th of the
liquidation preference of a Colonial Series E Preferred Share). To the extent
that amounts are so withheld by Colonial or the Exchange Agent, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of Cornerstone Common Shares in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by Colonial or the Exchange Agent.  
9    (d) Record Dates for Final Dividends; Distributions with Respect to
Unexchanged Shares.   (i) If and to the extent necessary for Cornerstone
to satisfy the requirements of Section 857(a)(1) of the Code for the taxable
year of Cornerstone ending at the Effective Time of the Merger (and to avoid
the payment of any Tax with respect to undistributed income or gain),
Cornerstone shall declare a dividend (the "Final Cornerstone Dividend") to
holders of Cornerstone Common Shares, the record date for which shall be the
close of business no later than the sixth business day prior to the Effective
Time of the Merger, in an amount equal to the minimum dividend sufficient to
permit Cornerstone to satisfy such requirements. Any dividends payable
hereunder to holders of Cornerstone Common Shares shall be paid on the third
business day immediately preceding the Closing Date. The Final Cornerstone
Dividend shall not include any dividend or distribution in satisfaction of
the Dividend Deficiency Amount (as defined herein). In the event that any
prior or contemporaneous dividends or distributions of Cornerstone are or
have been treated as being in satisfaction of the Dividend Deficiency Amount
and Cornerstone would be required to pay a Final Cornerstone Dividend, then
an amount equal to the lesser of such Final Cornerstone Dividend or the
amount of prior or contemporaneous distributions of Cornerstone that are or
have been treated as being in satisfaction of the Dividend Deficiency Amount
shall be treated as a Closing Deficiency Dividend Amount and not a Final
Cornerstone Dividend. In the event that Cornerstone is required to declare a
Final Cornerstone Dividend with respect to the Cornerstone Common Shares,
Cornerstone shall cause Cornerstone NC Operating Limited Partnership, a
Virginia limited partnership ("Cornerstone Partnership"), to simultaneously
declare any related distribution (the "Final Cornerstone Partnership
Distribution") required under the Agreement of Limited Partnership of
Cornerstone Partnership, as amended (the "Cornerstone
Partnership Agreement"), the record date for which shall correspond to the
record date for the Final Cornerstone Dividend. Such distribution shall be
payable on the third business day immediately preceding the Closing Date.  
(ii) If Cornerstone determines that it is necessary to declare the Final
Cornerstone Dividend, Cornerstone shall notify Colonial at least 20 days
prior to the date for the Cornerstone Shareholders Meeting, and Colonial
shall be entitled to declare a dividend per share payable to holders
of shares of Colonial Common Shares (in which event Colonial shall cause
Colonial Partnership to declare a distribution per unit payable to holders of
Colonial OP Units (as defined herein) if a distribution has been declared on
the Colonial Common Shares), the record dates for which shall correspond to
the record date for the Final Cornerstone Dividend, in an amount per Colonial
Common Share (and Colonial OP Unit) equal to the quotient obtained by
dividing (A) the Final Cornerstone Dividend paid by Cornerstone with respect
to each Cornerstone Common Share by (B) the Common Share Conversion Rate (the
"Corresponding Colonial Dividends and Distributions"). If, and to the extent,
the terms of any series of Colonial Preferred Shares (as defined herein) or
Colonial Preferred OP Units (as defined herein) require the payment of a
dividend or distribution by reason of the payment of the Corresponding
Colonial Dividends and Distributions, Colonial shall (and shall cause
Colonial Partnership to) declare and pay any such required dividends and
distributions. Any dividends payable hereunder to holders of Colonial Common
Shares (and Colonial OP Units) shall be paid on the third business day
immediately preceding the Closing Date.   10    (e) No Further Ownership
Rights in Cornerstone Common Shares. All Merger Consideration paid upon the
surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Section 1.13
(including any cash paid pursuant to Section 1.13(g)) shall be deemed to have
been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Cornerstone
Common Shares theretofore represented by such Certificates; provided,
however, that Cornerstone shall transfer to the Exchange Agent cash
sufficient to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record
date prior to the Effective Time which may have been declared or made by
Cornerstone on such Cornerstone Common Shares in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement or prior to the date of this Agreement and which remain
unpaid at the Effective Time and have not been paid prior to such surrender,
and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of Cornerstone of the Cornerstone Common Shares which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to Colonial for any reason, they shall be canceled
and exchanged as provided in this Section 1.13.   (f) No Liability. None of
Cornerstone, Colonial, Colonial Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent shall be
liable to any Person in respect of any Merger Consideration or dividends
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar law. Any portion of the Exchange Fund delivered to the
Exchange Agent pursuant to this Agreement that remains unclaimed for 12
months after the Effective Time shall be redelivered by the Exchange Agent to
Colonial, upon demand, and any holders of Certificates who have not
theretofore complied with Section 1.13(c) shall thereafter look only
to Colonial for delivery of the Merger Consideration, any cash payable in
lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.13(g) and any unpaid
dividends, subject to applicable escheat and other similar laws.   (g) No
Fractional Shares.   (i) No certificates, scrip or Depositary
Receipts representing fractional Colonial Common Shares or Colonial Series E
Preferred Depositary Shares shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange
of Certificates, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the
owner thereof to vote, to receive dividends or to any other rights of a
shareholder of Colonial.   (ii) No fractional Colonial Common Shares or
Colonial Series E Preferred Depositary Shares shall be issued pursuant to
this Agreement. In lieu of the issuance of any fractional Colonial Common
Shares pursuant to this Agreement, each holder of Cornerstone Common Shares
shall be paid an amount in cash (without interest), rounded to the nearest
cent (with .5 of a cent rounded up), determined by multiplying (A) the
average closing price of one Colonial Common Share on the NYSE on the five
trading days immediately preceding the Closing Date by (B) the fraction of a
Colonial Common Share which such holder would otherwise be entitled to
receive under this Section 1.13. In lieu of the issuance of any fractional
Colonial Series E Preferred Depositary Shares pursuant to this Agreement,
each holder of Cornerstone Common Shares shall be paid an amount in cash
(without interest), rounded to the nearest cent (with .5 of a cent rounded
up), determined by multiplying (A) $25.00 (i.e., 1/100th of the liquidation
preference of a Colonial Series E Preferred Share) by (B) the fraction of a
Colonial Series E Preferred Depositary Share which such holder would
otherwise be entitled to receive under this Section 1.13.   11    (h)
Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Colonial or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as Colonial or the Exchange Agent may direct
(but consistent with the practices Colonial applies to its own shareholders)
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against them with respect to
such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the cash, Colonial Common Shares and/or
Colonial Series E Preferred Depositary Shares to which the holders thereof
are entitled pursuant to Section 1.8, any cash payable pursuant to Section
1.13(g) to which the holders thereof are entitled and any dividends or other
distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section
1.13(d).   1.14 Post-Merger Reorganization. No later than one day following
the Closing Date, Colonial shall contribute to Colonial Partnership all of
the outstanding Colonial Merger Sub LLC Units in exchange for additional
Colonial OP Units (such transaction, the "Post-Merger Reorganization"). As a
result of the Post-Merger Reorganization, Colonial Merger Sub shall become a
wholly owned subsidiary of Colonial Partnership.   1.15 Cornerstone LP
Acquisition Transaction. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein (but subject to the last sentence of this Section 1.15), Colonial
shall be permitted to enter into and consummate, or cause any Colonial
Subsidiary (as defined herein) to enter into and consummate, any transaction
or series of related transactions for the purpose of acquiring the
Cornerstone LP OP Units (as defined herein) from the holders thereof
(any such transaction, a "Cornerstone LP Acquisition Transaction"). If a
Cornerstone LP Acquisition Transaction is to be consummated concurrently with
or following the Closing Date, the terms and conditions (including
consideration payable and structure) of such Cornerstone LP Acquisition
Transaction shall be determined by Colonial in its sole discretion. If a
Cornerstone LP Acquisition Transaction is to be consummated prior to the
Closing Date, the terms and conditions (including consideration payable and
structure) of any Cornerstone LP Acquisition Transaction shall be determined
by Colonial, subject to the reasonable approval of Cornerstone. Cornerstone
shall (a) use all reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
reasonable actions and do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably
necessary to consummate and make effective any Cornerstone LP Acquisition
Transaction and (b) execute such consents, approvals and other documents and
instruments as shall be necessary under the Cornerstone Partnership Agreement
or otherwise to consummate and make effective any Cornerstone LP Acquisition
Transaction. The entering into or consummation of any Cornerstone LP
Acquisition Transaction, or any related action taken by Colonial, shall not
constitute a circumstance, event, occurrence, change or effect that would
constitute a Cornerstone Material Adverse Effect. Colonial shall not,
and shall not permit any Colonial Subsidiary (as defined herein) to, enter
into or consummate any Cornerstone LP Acquisition Transaction that could
cause the Merger not to qualify, for federal income tax purposes, as a
reorganization under Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code.   12    ARTICLE
2   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF CORNERSTONE   Except as specifically
set forth in the disclosure letter to this Agreement delivered to Colonial
prior to the execution hereof (the "Cornerstone Disclosure Letter") (each
section of which qualifies the correspondingly numbered representation and
warranty or covenant to the extent specified therein, provided that any
disclosure set forth with respect to any particular section shall be deemed
to be disclosed in reference to all other applicable sections of this
Agreement if the disclosure in respect of the particular section is
sufficient on its face without further inquiry reasonably to inform the other
parties to this Agreement of the information required to be disclosed in
respect of the other sections to avoid a breach under the representation
and warranty or covenant corresponding to such other sections),
Cornerstone represents and warrants to Colonial and Colonial Merger Sub as
follows:   2.1 Organization, Standing and Power. Cornerstone is a
corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of Virginia. Cornerstone has all requisite corporate power and
authority to own, operate, lease and encumber its properties and carry on its
business as now being conducted. The Amended and Restated Articles of
Incorporation, as amended and supplemented, of Cornerstone (the "Cornerstone
Articles") are in effect, and no dissolution, revocation or forfeiture
proceedings regarding Cornerstone have been commenced. Cornerstone is duly
qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the
ownership or leasing of its properties makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so
qualified or licensed, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to have a Cornerstone Material Adverse Effect (as defined
herein). As used in this Agreement, a "Cornerstone Material Adverse Effect"
means any circumstance, event, occurrence, change or effect that
is materially adverse to the business, properties, assets (tangible or
intangible), financial condition or results of operations of Cornerstone,
Cornerstone Partnership and the Cornerstone Subsidiaries (as defined herein),
taken as a whole, other than effects, events or changes arising out of or
resulting from (a) changes in conditions in the United States or global

the present use of, such Cornerstone Property) and (iv) liens for real estate
taxes not yet due and payable, mechanics\', carriers\', workmen\'s,
repairmen\'s liens and other Encumbrances and Property Restrictions, if any,

with respect to any Cornerstone Property that would affect title or survey
matters from the date of the information provided to the date hereof.

Environmental Mitigation (as defined herein)) has been performed, paid or
taken, as the case may be, and (ii) Cornerstone has no Knowledge of
any planned or proposed work, payments or actions that may be required after
the date hereof pursuant to such agreements, in each case except as set forth

expected to materially adversely affect the applicable Cornerstone
Property.   (f) Schedule 2.9(f) contains a true and complete list, by
type of insurance, carrier, coverages (including limits) and term, of all
material policies of casualty, liability and other types of insurance (except
title insurance) carried by Cornerstone or any Cornerstone Subsidiary. All
such policies are in full force and effect and neither Cornerstone nor
any Cornerstone Subsidiary has received from any insurance company notice of
any material   22   defects or deficiencies affecting the insurability
of Cornerstone or any Cornerstone Subsidiary or any of their respective
assets thereunder.   2.10 Environmental Matters.   (a) "Environmental Law"
shall mean all applicable Laws relating to the environment, and including,
without limitation, Laws relating to the use, manufacturing, production,
generation, installation, recycling, reuse, sale, storage, handling,

which on the property cause or threaten to cause a nuisance pursuant to
applicable statutory or common law upon the property or to adjacent
properties, (iv) which contain without limitation polychlorinated biphenyls
(PCBs), toxic mold, asbestos or asbestos-containing materials, lead-based
paints, urea-formaldehyde foam insulation, or petroleum or petroleum products
(including, without limitation, crude oil or any fraction thereof) or (v)
which pose a hazard to human health, safety, natural resources,
industrial hygiene, or the environment, or an impediment to working

groundwater, the sewer, septic system, storm drain, publicly owned treatment
works, or waste treatment, storage, or disposal systems.   (b) (i) Except
as set forth on Schedule 2.10(b) to the Cornerstone Disclosure Letter, there
have been no Releases of Hazardous Materials (and, to the Knowledge of
Cornerstone, there has been no presence of Hazardous Materials) at, on, under
or from (A) any real property owned, operated or leased by Cornerstone or any
Cornerstone Subsidiary or (B) any real property formerly owned, operated or
leased by Cornerstone or any Cornerstone Subsidiary (the "Former Cornerstone
Properties") during the period of such ownership, operation or tenancy which
would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Cornerstone Material Adverse Effect.   (ii) Cornerstone and the Cornerstone
Subsidiaries have not failed to comply with any Environmental Law, and
neither Cornerstone nor any of the Cornerstone Subsidiaries has any liability
under the Environmental Laws, except to the extent that any such failure to
comply or any such liability, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Cornerstone Material Adverse Effect.  
(iii) Cornerstone and the Cornerstone Subsidiaries have been duly issued and
maintain all permits, licenses, certificates and approvals required under any
Environmental Law (collectively, the "Environmental Permits") necessary to
operate their businesses as currently operated except where the failure to
obtain and maintain such   23   Environmental Permits would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Cornerstone Material Adverse Effect. Cornerstone and the Cornerstone
Subsidiaries have timely filed applications for all Environmental Permits
except where the failure to so timely file such applications would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Cornerstone Material Adverse Effect. All of the Environmental Permits
maintained by Cornerstone and the Cornerstone Subsidiaries are listed on
Schedule 2.10.   (iv) Cornerstone and the Cornerstone Subsidiaries have not
arranged, by contract, agreement, or otherwise, for the
transportation, disposal or treatment of Hazardous Materials at any location
such that they are or could be liable for Environmental Mitigation of such
location pursuant to Environmental Laws, except as would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Cornerstone Material
Adverse Effect.   (v) There are no facts, circumstances or
conditions existing, initiated or occurring prior to the Effective Time,
which will result in liability under Environmental Laws to Cornerstone or the
Cornerstone Subsidiaries, except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Cornerstone Material Adverse
Effect.   (vi) Except as set forth on Schedule 2.10 to the Cornerstone
Disclosure Letter, neither Cornerstone, nor any Cornerstone Subsidiary has
installed any underground storage tanks or associated piping used currently
or in the past for the management of Hazardous Materials on any real property
owned, operated or leased by Cornerstone or any Cornerstone Subsidiaries, and
to the Knowledge of Cornerstone, no such underground storage tanks are
located on any real property owned, operated or leased by Cornerstone or any
Cornerstone Subsidiary. Except as set forth on Schedule 2.10 to
the Cornerstone Disclosure Letter, to the Knowledge of Cornerstone,
neither Cornerstone, nor any Cornerstone Subsidiary is using or has used any
real property owned, operated or leased by Cornerstone or any Cornerstone
Subsidiary as a dump or landfill nor does any real property owned, operated
or leased by Cornerstone or any Cornerstone Subsidiary consist of or contain
filled in land, wetlands, asbestos-containing materials, PCBs or toxic
mold.   (c) Cornerstone has previously delivered or made available
to Colonial complete copies of all material information, documents and
reports, including, without limitation, environmental investigations and
testing or analysis, which relate to compliance with Environmental Laws by
Cornerstone and the Cornerstone Subsidiaries or to the past or current
environmental condition of any of the real property owned, operated or leased
by Cornerstone or any Cornerstone Subsidiary or Former Cornerstone Properties
that are in the possession or control of any of Cornerstone and the
Cornerstone Subsidiaries.   2.11 Related Party Transactions. Set forth in
Schedule 2.11 to the Cornerstone Disclosure Letter or in the Cornerstone SEC
Documents is a list of all arrangements, agreements and contracts entered
into by Cornerstone or any Cornerstone Subsidiary which are in effect and
which are with (a) any investment banker or financial advisor or (b) any
Person who is an officer, director or Affiliate (as defined herein) of
Cornerstone or any Cornerstone Subsidiary, any relative of any of the
foregoing or any entity of which any of the foregoing is an Affiliate and,
in   24   the case of arrangements, agreement and contracts referred to
in this clause (b), are required to be described in Item 404 of Regulation
S-K under the Securities Act. Such documents, copies of all of which have
previously been delivered or made available to Colonial, are listed in
Schedule 2.11 to the Cornerstone Disclosure Letter. As used in this
Agreement, the term "Affiliate" shall have the same meaning as such term is
defined in Rule 405 promulgated under the Securities Act.   2.12 Employee
Benefits. As used herein, the term "Employee Plan" includes any pension,
retirement, savings, disability, medical, dental, health, fringe benefit,
life, death benefit, group insurance, profit sharing, deferred compensation,
stock option, bonus, incentive, vacation pay, tuition reimbursement,
severance pay, or other employee benefit plan, trust, agreement, contract,
agreement, policy or commitment (including, without limitation, any pension
plan, as defined in Section 3(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder
("ERISA") ("Pension Plan"), and any welfare plan as defined in Section 3(1)
of ERISA ("Welfare Plan")), whether any of the foregoing is funded, insured
or self-funded, written or oral, (i) sponsored or maintained by Cornerstone
or any entity that, together with Cornerstone, is required to be treated as a
single employer under Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code (each, a
"Controlled Group Member") and covering any Controlled Group Member\'s active
or former employees (or their beneficiaries), (ii) to which any Controlled
Group Member is a party or by which any Controlled Group Member (or any of
the rights, properties or assets thereof) is bound or (iii) with respect to
which any current Controlled Group Member may otherwise have any
material liability (whether or not such Controlled Group Member still
maintains such Employee Plan). Each Employee Plan is listed on Schedule 2.12
to the Cornerstone Disclosure Letter. Except as disclosed in Schedule 2.12 to
the Cornerstone Disclosure Letter, with respect to the Employee Plans:  
(a) No Controlled Group Member has any continuing liability under any Welfare
Plan which provides for continuing benefits or coverage for any participant
or any beneficiary of a participant after such participant\'s termination of
employment, except as may be required by Section 4980B of the Code or Section
601 (et seq.) of ERISA, or under any applicable state law, and at the expense
of the participant or the beneficiary of the participant.   (b) Each
Employee Plan complies in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable law governing such
Employee Plan, and, to the Knowledge of Cornerstone, each Employee Plan has
at all times been properly administered in all material respects in
accordance with all such requirements of law, and in accordance with its
terms and the terms of any applicable collective bargaining agreement to
the extent consistent with all such requirements of law. Each Pension Plan
which is intended to be qualified is qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code, has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS stating that
such plan meets the requirements of Section 401(a) of the Code and, to the
Knowledge of Cornerstone, no event has occurred which would jeopardize the
qualified status of any such plan or the tax exempt status of any such trust
under Section 401(a) and Section 501(a) of the Code, respectively. No
lawsuits, claims (other than routine claims for benefits) or complaints to,
or by, any Person or Governmental Entity have been filed, are pending or, to
the Knowledge of Cornerstone, threatened with respect to any Employee Plan
and, to the Knowledge of Cornerstone, there is no fact or contemplated event
which would   25   be expected to give rise to any such lawsuit, claim
(other than routine claims for benefits) or complaint with respect to any
Employee Plan. Without limiting the foregoing, the following are true with
respect to each Employee Plan:   (i) all Controlled Group Members have
complied in all  material respects with the applicable reporting and
disclosure  requirements of ERISA, the Code, or both, with respect to each 
Employee Plan and no Controlled Group Member has incurred any  material
liability in connection with such reporting or disclosure;   (ii) all
contributions and payments with respect to  Employee Plans that are required
to be made by a Controlled Group  Member with respect to periods ending on or
before the Closing Date  (including periods from the first day of the current
plan or policy  year to the Closing Date) have been, or will be, made or
accrued  before the Closing Date in accordance with the appropriate plan 
document, actuarial report, collective bargaining agreements or  insurance
contracts or arrangements or as otherwise required by  ERISA or the Code;
and   (iii) with respect to each such Employee Plan, to the  extent
applicable, Cornerstone has delivered to or has made  available to Colonial
true and complete copies of (A) current plan  documents and any amendments
thereto, or any and all other documents  that establish the existence of the
plan, trust, arrangement,  contract, policy or commitment and all amendments
thereto, (B) the  most recent summary plan description and the subsequent
summaries of  material modifications, (C) all rulings, opinions or advice
issued  by the U.S. Department of Labor, the IRS or the Pension Benefit 
Guaranty Corporation, (D) the most recent determination letter, if  any,
received from the IRS, (E) the three most recent Form 5500  Annual Reports
(and all schedules and reports relating thereto) and  actuarial reports and
(F) all related trust agreements, insurance  contracts or other funding
agreements that implement each such  Employee Plan.   (c) With respect to
each Employee Plan, to the Knowledge of Cornerstone, there has not occurred,
and no Person is contractually bound to enter into, (i) any "prohibited
transaction" within the meaning of Section 4975(c) of the Code or Section 406
of ERISA, which transaction is not exempt under Section 4975(d) of the Code
or Section 408 of ERISA or (ii) any breach of responsibilities or obligations
imposed upon fiduciaries under Title I of ERISA and which in the case of
either (i) or (ii) could subject Cornerstone or any Controlled Group Member
to material liability.   (d) No Controlled Group Member has ever maintained
or participated in been otherwise obligated to contribute to (i) any Employee
Plan subject to Code Section 412 or Title IV of ERISA or (ii) any
"multiemployer plan", as such term is defined in ERISA Section 3(37). No
Employee Plan subject to Code Section 412 or Title IV of ERISA has been
terminated.   26    (e) With respect to each Pension Plan maintained by
any Controlled Group Member, such plan provides the plan sponsor the
authority to amend or terminate the Plan at any time, subject to applicable
requirements of ERISA and the Code.   (f) No Employee Plan is (i) an
"employee stock ownership plan", as defined by Code Section 4975(e)(7), or
otherwise invests in employer securities, as defined by Code Section 409(l)
or (ii) a "voluntary employees\' beneficiary association", as defined by Code
Section 501(c)(9).   (g) Except as set forth on Schedule 2.12(g) to the
Cornerstone Disclosure Letter, the consummation of the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement will not (i) result in any material payment
becoming due pursuant to an Employee Plan to any current or former employee
or other service provider of any Controlled Group Member or (ii) accelerate
the vesting or timing of the payment of material benefits or compensation
payable pursuant to any Employee Plan to any current or former employee or
other service provider of any Controlled Group Member.   (h) Except as set
forth on Schedule 2.12(h) to the Cornerstone Disclosure Letter, no amount
required to be paid or payable to or with respect to any employee or other
service provider of any Controlled Group Member in connection with the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement will be an "excess parachute
payment" as defined by Code Section 280G.   2.13 Employee Policies. The
employee handbooks of Cornerstone and the Cornerstone Subsidiaries currently
in effect have been delivered to Colonial and fairly and accurately summarize
in all material respects the employee policies, vacation policies and payroll
policies.   2.14 Taxes.   (a) Each of Cornerstone and the Cornerstone
Subsidiaries (i) has filed all Tax returns and reports required to be filed
by it (after giving effect to any filing extension properly granted by a
Governmental Entity having authority to do so) and all such returns and
reports are accurate and complete in all material respects, (ii) has paid (or
Cornerstone has paid on its behalf) all Taxes (as defined herein) shown on
such returns and reports as required to be paid by it, and (iii) has complied
in all material respects with all applicable laws, rules and regulations
relating to the payment and withholding of Taxes (including, without
limitation, withholding of Taxes pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442, 1445, 1446,
3121, 3402 and 3406 of the Code) and has, within the time period prescribed
by law, withheld and paid over to the proper governmental entities all
amounts required to be so withheld and paid over under applicable laws and
regulations, except, with respect to all of the foregoing, where the failure
to file such tax returns and reports or failure to pay such Taxes or failure
to comply with such withholding requirements would not reasonably be expected
to have a Cornerstone Material Adverse Effect. The most recent audited
financial statements contained in the Cornerstone SEC Documents reflect an
adequate reserve for all material Taxes payable by Cornerstone and the
Cornerstone Subsidiaries for all taxable periods and portions thereof through
the date of such financial   27   statements. Since the Cornerstone
Financial Statement Date, Cornerstone has incurred no liability for Taxes
under Sections 857(b), 860(c) or 4981 of the Code, including without
limitation any Tax arising from a prohibited transaction described in Section
857(b)(6) of the Code, and neither Cornerstone nor any Cornerstone Subsidiary
has incurred any material liability for Taxes other than in the ordinary
course of business. No event has occurred, and no condition or circumstance
exists, which presents a material risk that any material Tax described in the
preceding sentences will be imposed upon Cornerstone or any Cornerstone
Subsidiary. Neither Cornerstone nor any Cornerstone Subsidiary is the subject
of any audit, examination, or other proceeding in respect of federal income
Taxes, and to Cornerstone\'s Knowledge, no audit, examination or
other proceeding in respect of federal income Taxes involving Cornerstone or
any Cornerstone Subsidiary is being considered by any Tax authority. To
the Knowledge of Cornerstone, no deficiencies for any Taxes have been
proposed, asserted or assessed against Cornerstone or any Cornerstone
Subsidiary, and no requests for waivers of the time to assess any such Taxes
are pending. As used in this Agreement, "Taxes" shall include all taxes,
charges, fees, levies and other assessments, including, without limitation,
income, gross receipts, excise, property, sales, withholding (including,
without limitation, dividend withholding and withholding required pursuant to
Sections 1445 and 1446 of the Code), social security, occupation, use,
service, license, payroll, franchise, transfer and recording taxes, fees and
charges, including estimated taxes, imposed by the United States or any
taxing authority (domestic or foreign), whether computed on a separate,
consolidated, unitary, combined or any other basis, and any interest, fines,
penalties or additional amounts attributable to, or imposed upon, or with
respect to any such taxes, charges, fees, levies or other assessments.  
(b) Cornerstone (i) for all taxable years for which the Internal Revenue
Service could assert a tax liability, has been subject to taxation as a real
estate investment trust (a "REIT") within the meaning of Section 856 of the
Code and has satisfied all requirements to qualify as a REIT for all such
years, (ii) has operated since December 31, 2003 to the date of this
representation, and intends to continue to operate, in such a manner as
to qualify as a REIT for the taxable year ending on the earlier of December
31, 2004 or the Closing Date and, if later, for the taxable year of
Cornerstone ending on the Closing Date, and (iii) has not taken or omitted to
take any action which would reasonably be expected to result in a challenge
to its status as a REIT and, to Cornerstone\'s Knowledge, no such challenge
is pending or threatened. Except as set forth on Schedule 2.14(b), each
Cornerstone Subsidiary which is a partnership, joint venture or limited
liability company has been since the later of its formation or the
acquisition by Cornerstone of a direct or indirect interest therein, and
continues to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a partnership or
as an entity that is disregarded for federal income tax purposes and not as a
corporation or an association taxable as a corporation. In addition, each
Cornerstone Subsidiary which is a partnership, joint venture or limited
liability company has not since the later of its formation or the acquisition
by Cornerstone of a direct or indirect interest therein, owned any assets
(including, without limitation, securities) that would cause Cornerstone to
violate Section 856(c)(4) of the Code. Cornerstone Partnership is not a
publicly traded partnership within the meaning of Section 7704(b) of the Code
that is taxable as a corporation pursuant to Section 7704(a) of the Code. For
all taxable years for which the Internal Revenue Service either could assert
a Tax liability or could assert that Cornerstone failed to qualify as a REIT,
each Cornerstone Subsidiary which is a corporation (for federal income tax
purposes) has   28   been either, at all times during which Cornerstone
has owned an interest in such corporation representing more than 10% of the
value of the outstanding securities of such corporation or more than 10% of
the outstanding voting securities of such corporation, a qualified REIT
subsidiary under Section 856(i) of the Code, a taxable REIT subsidiary of
Cornerstone under Section 856(l) of the Code, or a corporation which
qualifies under the transitional rules set forth in Section 546(b) of the Tax
Relief Extension Act of 1999. Each Cornerstone Subsidiary that is a
"qualified REIT subsidiary" under Section 856(i) of the Code is set forth on
Schedule 5.13 to the Cornerstone Disclosure Letter. Neither Cornerstone nor
any Cornerstone Subsidiary holds any asset the disposition of which would be
subject to rules similar to Section 1374 of the Code as a result of an
election under IRS Notice 88-19, Temporary Treas. Reg. Section 1.337(d)-5T,
Treas. Reg. Section 1.337(d)-5, Treas. Reg. Section 1.337(d)-6 or the
application of Treas. Reg. Section 1.337(d)-7 except as set forth on Schedule
2.14(b).   (c) To Cornerstone\'s knowledge, as of the date
hereof, Cornerstone is a "domestically-controlled REIT" within the meaning of
Section 897(h)(4)(B) of the Code.   2.15 No Payments to Employees, Officers
or Directors. Schedule 2.15 to the Cornerstone Disclosure Letter contains a
true and complete list of all arrangements, agreements or plans pursuant to
which cash and non-cash payments which will become payable (and the maximum
aggregate amount which may be payable thereunder) to each employee, officer
or director of Cornerstone or any Cornerstone Subsidiary as a result of the
Merger or a termination of service subsequent to the consummation of the
Merger. Except as described in Schedule 2.15 to the Cornerstone Disclosure
Letter, or as otherwise provided for in this Agreement, there is no
employment or severance contract, or other agreement requiring payments,
cancellation of indebtedness or other obligations or lapse of vesting
requirements or other restrictions to be made on a change of control or
otherwise as a result of the consummation of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or as a result of a termination
of service subsequent to the consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, with respect to any employee, officer or
director of Cornerstone or any Cornerstone Subsidiary. Except as set forth on
Schedule 2.15 to the Cornerstone Disclosure Letter, there is no agreement or
arrangement with any employee, officer or other service provider under which
Cornerstone or any Cornerstone Subsidiary has agreed to pay any tax that
might be owed under Section 4999 of the Code with respect to payments to such
individuals.   2.16 Broker; Schedule of Fees and Expenses. No broker,
investment banker, financial advisor or other Person, other than Wachovia
Securities, the fees and expenses of which are described in the engagement
letter dated June 16, 2004, between Wachovia Securities and Cornerstone, a
true, correct and complete copy of which has previously been given to
Colonial, is entitled to any broker\'s, finder\'s, financial advisor\'s or
other similar fee or commission in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of
Cornerstone or any Cornerstone Subsidiary.   2.17 Compliance with Laws.
Neither Cornerstone nor any Cornerstone Subsidiary has violated or failed to
comply with any statute, law, ordinance, regulation, rule, judgment, decree
or order of any Governmental Entity applicable to its business, properties
or   29   operations, except to the extent that such violation or failure
would not reasonably be expected to have a Cornerstone Material Adverse
Effect.   2.18 Contracts; Debt Instruments.   (a) Neither Cornerstone nor
any Cornerstone Subsidiary has received a written notice that it is in
violation of or in default under (nor to the Knowledge of Cornerstone does
there exist any condition which upon the passage of time or the giving of
notice or both would cause such a violation of or default under) any material
loan or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, permit,
concession, franchise, license or any other material contract, agreement,
arrangement or understanding, to which it is a party or by which it or any of
its properties or assets is bound, nor to the Knowledge of Cornerstone does
such a violation or default exist, except to the extent that such violation
or default, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Cornerstone Material Adverse Effect.   (b) Schedule
2.18(b) to the Cornerstone Disclosure Letter sets forth a list of each
material loan or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture and any
other agreement or instrument pursuant to which any Indebtedness (as defined
herein) in excess of $1,000,000 of Cornerstone or any Cornerstone Subsidiary,
other than Indebtedness payable to Cornerstone or a Cornerstone Subsidiary,
is outstanding or may be incurred. For purposes of this Section 2.18,
"Indebtedness" shall mean (i) indebtedness for borrowed money, whether
secured or unsecured, (ii) obligations under conditional sale or other title
retention agreements relating to property purchased by such Person,
(iii) capitalized lease obligations, (iv) obligations under interest rate
cap, swap, collar or similar transaction or currency hedging transactions
(valued at the termination value thereof) and (v) guarantees of any such
indebtedness of any other Person.   (c) To the extent not set forth in
response to the requirements of Section 2.18(b), Schedule 2.18(c) to the
Cornerstone Disclosure Letter sets forth each interest rate cap, interest
rate collar, interest rate swap, currency hedging transaction, and any other
agreement relating to a similar transaction to which Cornerstone or any
Cornerstone Subsidiary is a party or an obligor with respect thereto and
which has a notional amount in excess of $1,000,000.   (d) [Intentionally
omitted.]   (e) Except as set forth on Schedule 2.18(e) of the
Cornerstone Disclosure Letter, neither Cornerstone nor any Cornerstone
Subsidiary is a party to any agreement relating to the management of any
Cornerstone Property by any Person other than Cornerstone or a Cornerstone
Subsidiary.   (f) Except as set forth on Schedule 2.18(f) to the
Cornerstone Disclosure Letter, neither Cornerstone nor any Cornerstone
Subsidiary is a party to any agreement pursuant to which Cornerstone or any
Cornerstone Subsidiary manages or provides services with respect to any real
properties other than Cornerstone Properties.   30    (g) Cornerstone
has delivered to Colonial prior to the date of this Agreement a true and
complete capital budget for the year 2004 relating to budgeted capital
improvements and development. Schedule 2.18(g) to the Cornerstone Disclosure
Letter lists all material agreements entered into by Cornerstone or any of
the Cornerstone Subsidiaries relating to the development or construction of,
or additions or expansions to, any Cornerstone Properties (or any properties
with respect to which Cornerstone or any Cornerstone Subsidiary has executed
as of the date of this Agreement a purchase agreement or other similar
agreement) which are currently in effect and under which Cornerstone or any
of the Cornerstone Subsidiaries currently has, or expects to incur, an
obligation in excess of $250,000 per agreement. True, correct and complete
copies of such agreements have previously been delivered or made available to
Colonial.   (h) Schedule 2.18(h) to the Cornerstone Disclosure Letter lists
all agreements entered into by Cornerstone or any Cornerstone
Subsidiary providing for the sale of, or option to sell, any Cornerstone
Properties or the purchase of, or option to purchase, by Cornerstone or any
Cornerstone Subsidiary, on the one hand, or the other party thereto, on the
other hand, any real estate not yet consummated as of the date hereof.  
(i) Except as set forth in Schedule 2.18(i) to the Cornerstone Disclosure
Letter, neither Cornerstone nor any Cornerstone Subsidiary has any material
continuing contractual liability (A) for indemnification or otherwise under
any agreement relating to the sale of real estate previously owned, whether
directly or indirectly by Cornerstone, or any Cornerstone Subsidiary or (B)
to pay any additional purchase price for any of the Cornerstone
Properties.   (j) Except as set forth in Schedule 2.18(j) to the
Cornerstone Disclosure Letter, neither Cornerstone nor any Cornerstone
Subsidiary has entered into or is subject, directly or indirectly, to any Tax
Protection Agreements. As used herein, a "Tax Protection Agreement" is an
agreement, oral or written, entered into between (x) either Cornerstone or a
Cornerstone Subsidiary and (y) a Person other than Cornerstone or a
Cornerstone Subsidiary and (A) that has as one of its purposes to permit a
Person to take the position that such Person could defer federal taxable
income that otherwise might have been recognized upon a transfer of property
to the Cornerstone Partnership or any other Cornerstone Subsidiary that is
treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, and that (i)
prohibits or restricts in any manner the disposition of any assets of
Cornerstone or any Cornerstone Subsidiary, (ii) requires that Cornerstone or
any Cornerstone Subsidiary maintain, put in place, or replace, indebtedness,
whether or not secured by one or more of the Cornerstone Properties, or (iii)
requires that Cornerstone or any Cornerstone Subsidiary offer to any Person
at any time the opportunity to guarantee or otherwise assume, directly or
indirectly (including, without limitation, through a "deficit restoration
obligation," guarantee (including, without limitation, a "bottom" guarantee),
indemnification agreement or other similar arrangement), the risk of loss for
federal income tax purposes for indebtedness or other liabilities of
Cornerstone or any Cornerstone Subsidiary, (B) that specifies or relates to a
method of taking into account book-tax disparities under Section 704(c) of
the Code with respect to one or more assets of Cornerstone or a Cornerstone
Subsidiary, or (C) that requires a particular method for allocating one or
more liabilities of Cornerstone or any Cornerstone Subsidiary under Section
752 of the Code. Neither   31   Cornerstone nor any Cornerstone
Subsidiary is in violation of or in default under any Tax Protection
Agreement (or similar agreement concerning action that would affect the tax
liability of any person) that it is or has been a party to, and neither
Cornerstone nor any Cornerstone Subsidiary has any outstanding tax liability
to any person under any such agreement.   (k) Except as set forth in
Schedule 2.18(k) to the Cornerstone Disclosure Letter and for the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated July 15, 2004 between Cornerstone and
Colonial (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), neither Cornerstone nor any
Cornerstone Subsidiary is a party to any (A) standstill, lock-up, financial
advisory or voting agreement or (B) confidentiality agreement related to any
of the types of transactions described in clauses (A), (B) or (C) of Section
4.3(a)(i) (but substituting 50% for each instance where 10% appears).   (l)
Cornerstone does not have any shareholder rights plan or similar arrangement
in effect.   2.19 Opinion of Financial Advisor. Cornerstone has received
the opinion of Wachovia Securities, Cornerstone\'s financial advisor, to the
effect that, as of the date thereof, the aggregate Merger Consideration to be

Wachovia Securities to such effect.   2.20 State Takeover Statutes.
Cornerstone has taken all action necessary to exempt the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement between Colonial and Cornerstone and its
Affiliates from the operation of any "fair price," "moratorium," "control

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COLONIAL  AND COLONIAL MERGER SUB  
Except as specifically set forth in the disclosure letter to this Agreement
delivered to Cornerstone prior to the execution hereof (the
"Colonial Disclosure Letter") (each section of which qualifies the
correspondingly numbered representation and warranty or covenant to the
extent specified therein, provided that any disclosure set forth with respect
to any particular section shall be deemed to be disclosed in reference to all
other applicable sections of this Agreement if the disclosure in respect of
the particular section is sufficient on its face without further inquiry
reasonably to inform the other parties to this Agreement of the information
required to be disclosed in respect of the other sections to avoid a breach
under the representation and warranty or covenant corresponding to such other
sections), Colonial and Colonial Merger Sub represent and warrant to
Cornerstone as follows:   3.1 Organization, Standing and Power of Colonial.
Colonial is a real estate investment trust duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of Alabama. Colonial has all requisite
power and authority to own, operate, lease and encumber its properties and
carry on its business as now being conducted. The Colonial Declaration of
Trust is in effect, and no dissolution, revocation or forfeiture proceedings
regarding Colonial have been commenced. Colonial is duly qualified or
licensed to do business as a foreign trust and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership or leasing
of its properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary, other than
in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Colonial Material Adverse Effect (as defined herein). As used in this
Agreement, a "Colonial Material Adverse Effect" means any circumstance,
event, occurrence, change or effect that is materially adverse to the
business, properties, assets (tangible or intangible), financial condition or
results of operations of Colonial, Colonial Partnership and the
Subsidiaries of Colonial (collectively, "Colonial Subsidiaries"), taken as a
whole, other than effects, events or changes arising out of or resulting from
(a) changes in conditions in the United States or global economy or capital
or financial markets generally, including changes in interest or exchange
rates, (b) changes in general legal, regulatory, political, economic or
business conditions or changes in GAAP (as defined herein) that, in each
case, generally affect the real estate industry and that do not affect
Colonial, Colonial Partnership or the Colonial Subsidiaries materially
disproportionately relative to other participants in the real estate industry
or (c) the negotiation, execution, announcement or performance of this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Colonial has delivered to Cornerstone complete and correct copies
of the Colonial Declaration of Trust and the Bylaws of Colonial (the
"Colonial Bylaws"), as amended or supplemented to the date of this
Agreement.   3.2 Colonial Subsidiaries.   33    (a) Schedule 3.2(a) to

Subsidiary, (iv) each property owned by such Colonial Subsidiary or such
other Person and each other asset material to such Colonial Subsidiary or
such other Person, and (v) if not wholly owned by such Colonial Subsidiary

liability company or trust is duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization and has the
requisite power and authority to own, operate, lease and encumber its
properties and carry on its business as now being conducted. Each Colonial
Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or
the ownership or leasing of its properties makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be
so qualified or licensed, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Colonial Material Adverse Effect. Complete
and correct copies of the Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws, organization
documents and partnership, joint venture and operating agreements of each
Colonial Subsidiary, as amended to the date of this Agreement, have been
previously delivered or made available to Cornerstone. No effective amendment

414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code (each, a "Colonial Controlled Group
Member") and covering any Colonial Controlled Group Member\'s active or
former employees (or their beneficiaries), (ii) to which any Colonial
Controlled Group Member is a party or by which any Colonial Controlled Group
Member (or any of the rights, properties or assets thereof) is bound or (iii)
with respect to which any current Colonial Controlled Group Member may
otherwise have any material liability (whether or not such Colonial
Controlled Group Member still maintains such Colonial Employee Plan). Each
Colonial Employee Plan is listed on Schedule 3.11 to the Colonial Disclosure
Letter. Except as disclosed in Schedule 3.11 to the Colonial Disclosure
Letter, with respect to the Colonial Employee Plans:   (a) No Colonial
Controlled Group Member has any continuing liability under any Colonial
Welfare Plan which provides for continuing benefits or coverage for any
participant or any beneficiary of a participant after such participant\'s
termination of employment, except as may be required by Section 4980B of the
Code or Section 601 (et seq.) of ERISA, or under any applicable state law,
and at the expense of the participant or the beneficiary of
the participant.   (b) Each Colonial Employee Plan complies in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of ERISA, the Code and any
other applicable law governing such Colonial Employee Plan, and, to the
Knowledge of Colonial, each Colonial Employee Plan has at all times been
properly administered in all material respects in accordance with all such
requirements of law, and in accordance with its terms and the terms of any
applicable collective   42   bargaining agreement to the extent
consistent with all such requirements of law. Each Colonial Pension Plan
which is intended to be qualified is qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code, has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS stating that
such Plan meets the requirements of Section 401(a) of the Code and, to the
Knowledge of Colonial, no event has occurred which would jeopardize the
qualified status of any such plan or the tax exempt status of any such trust
under Section 401(a) and Section 501(a) of the Code, respectively.
No lawsuits, claims (other than routine claims for benefits) or complaints
to, or by, any Person or Governmental Entity have been filed, are pending or,
to the Knowledge of Colonial, threatened with respect to any Colonial
Employee Plan and, to the Knowledge of Colonial, there is no fact or
contemplated event which would be expected to give rise to any such lawsuit,
claim (other than routine claims for benefits) or complaint with respect to
any Colonial Employee Plan. Without limiting the foregoing, the following are
true with respect to each Colonial Employee Plan:   (i) all Colonial
Controlled Group Members have complied  in all material respects with the
applicable reporting and  disclosure requirements of ERISA, the Code, or
both, with respect to  each Colonial Employee Plan and no Colonial Controlled
Group Member  has incurred any material liability in connection with such 
reporting or disclosure;   (ii) all contributions and payments with respect
to  Colonial Employee Plans that are required to be made by a Colonial 
Controlled Group Member with respect to periods ending on or before  the
Closing Date (including periods from the first day of the  current plan or
policy year to the Closing Date) have been, or will  be, made or accrued
before the Closing Date in accordance with the  appropriate plan document,
actuarial report, collective bargaining  agreements or insurance contracts or
arrangements or as otherwise  required by ERISA or the Code; and   (iii)
with respect to each such Colonial Employee Plan,  to the extent applicable,
Colonial has delivered to or has made  available to Cornerstone true and
complete copies of (A) current  plan documents and any amendments thereto, or
any and all other  documents that establish the existence of the plan,
trust,  arrangement, contract, policy or commitment and all amendments 
thereto, (B) the most recent summary plan description and the  subsequent
summaries of material modifications, (C) all rulings,  opinions or advice
issued by the U.S. Department of Labor, the IRS  or the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation, (D) the most recent  determination letter, if any,
received from the IRS, (E) the three  most recent Form 5500 Annual Reports
(and all schedules and reports  relating thereto) and actuarial reports and
(F) all related trust  agreements, insurance contracts or other funding
agreements that  implement each such Colonial Employee Plan.   (c) With
respect to each Colonial Employee Plan, to the Knowledge of Colonial, there
has not occurred, and no Person is contractually bound to enter into, (i) any
"prohibited transaction" within the meaning of Section 4975(c) of the Code or
Section 406 of   43   ERISA, which transaction is not exempt under
Section 4975(d) of the Code or Section 408 of ERISA or (ii) any breach of
responsibilities or obligations imposed upon fiduciaries under Title I of
ERISA and which in the case of either (i) or (ii) could subject Colonial or
any Colonial Controlled Group Member to material liability.   (d) No
Colonial Controlled Group Member has ever maintained or participated in been
otherwise obligated to contribute to (i) any Colonial Employee Plan subject
to Code Section 412 or Title IV of ERISA or (ii) any "multiemployer plan", as
such term is defined in ERISA Section 3(37). No Colonial Employee Plan
subject to Code Section 412 or Title IV of ERISA has been terminated.  
3.12 Taxes.   (a) Each of Colonial and the Colonial Subsidiaries (i)
has filed all Tax returns and reports required to be filed by it (after
giving effect to any filing extension properly granted by a Governmental
Entity having authority to do so), and all such returns and reports are
accurate and complete in all material respects, (ii) has paid (or Colonial
has paid on its behalf) all Taxes shown on such returns and reports as
required to be paid by it and (iii) has complied in all material respects
with all applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to the payment and
withholding of Taxes (including, without limitation, withholding of Taxes
pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442, 1445, 1446, 3121, 3402 and 3406 of the Code)
and has, within the time period prescribed by law, withheld and paid over to
the proper governmental entities all amounts required to be so withheld and
paid under applicable laws and regulations, except, with respect to all of
the foregoing, where the failure to file such tax returns or reports or
failure to pay such Taxes or failure to comply with such requirements would
not reasonably be expected to have a Colonial Material Adverse Effect. The
most recent audited financial statements contained in the Colonial SEC
Documents reflect an adequate reserve for all material Taxes payable by
Colonial and the Colonial Subsidiaries for all taxable periods and portions
thereof through the date of such financial statements. Since the Colonial
Financial Statement Date, Colonial has incurred no liability for Taxes under
Sections 857(b), 860(c) or 4981 of the Code, including without limitation any
Tax arising from a prohibited transaction described in Section 857(b)(6)
of the Code, and neither Colonial nor any Colonial Subsidiary has incurred
any material liability for Taxes other than in the ordinary course of
business. No event has occurred, and no condition or circumstance exists,
which presents a material risk that any material Tax described in the
preceding sentence will be imposed upon Colonial or any Colonial Subsidiary.
Neither Colonial nor any Colonial Subsidiary is the subject of any audit,
examination, or other proceeding in respect of Taxes, and to Colonial\'s
Knowledge, no audit, examination or other proceeding in respect of Taxes
involving Colonial or any Colonial Subsidiary is being considered by any Tax
authority. To the Knowledge of Colonial, except as set forth on Schedule
3.12(a), no deficiencies for any Taxes have been proposed, asserted or
assessed against Colonial or any of the Colonial Subsidiaries, and no
requests for waivers of the time to assess any such Taxes are pending.  
(b) Colonial (i) for all taxable years for which the Internal Revenue Service
could assert a tax liability, has been subject to taxation as a REIT within
the meaning of Section 856 of the Code and has satisfied all requirements to
qualify as a REIT for all such years,   44   (ii) has operated since
December 31, 2003 to the date of this representation, and intends to continue
to operate, in such a manner as to qualify as a REIT for the taxable year
that includes the Closing Date and (iii) has not taken or omitted to take any
action which would reasonably be expected to result in a challenge to its
status as a REIT and, to Colonial\'s Knowledge, no such challenge is pending
or threatened. Each Colonial Subsidiary which is a partnership, joint venture
or limited liability company has been since the later of its formation or the
acquisition by Colonial of a direct or indirect interest therein, and
continues to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a partnership or
as an entity that is disregarded for federal income tax purposes and not as a
corporation or an association taxable as a corporation. In addition, each
Colonial Subsidiary which is a partnership, joint venture or limited
liability company has not since the later of its formation or the acquisition
by Colonial of a direct or indirect interest therein, owned any assets
(including, without limitation, securities) that would cause Colonial
to violate Section 856(c)(4) of the Code. Colonial Partnership is not a
publicly traded partnership within the meaning of Section 7704(b) of the Code
that is taxable as a corporation pursuant to Section 7704(a) of the Code.
Each Colonial Subsidiary which is a corporation (for federal income tax
purposes) has been either, at all times during which Colonial has owned an
interest in such corporation representing more than 10% of the value of the
outstanding securities of such corporation or more than 10% of the
outstanding voting securities of such corporation, a qualified REIT
subsidiary under Section 856(i) of the Code or a taxable REIT subsidiary
under Section 865(l) of the Code. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.12(b) to
the Colonial Disclosure Letter, neither Colonial nor any Colonial Subsidiary
holds any asset the disposition of which would be subject to rules similar to
Section 1374 of the Code as a result of an election under IRS Notice 88-19,
Temporary Treas. Reg. Section 1.337(d)-5T, Treas. Reg. Section 1.337(d)-5,
Treas. Reg. Section 1.337(d)-6 or the application of Treas. Reg. Section
1.337(d)-7.   (c) To Colonial\'s knowledge, as of the date hereof,
Colonial is a "domestically-controlled REIT" within the meaning of Section
897(h)(4)(B) of the Code.   (d) Colonial (i) as a partner of Colonial
Partnership, has active and substantial management functions with respect to
the business of Colonial Partnership within the meaning of Treas. Reg.
Section 1.368-1(d)(4)(iii)(B)(2); and (ii) owns an interest in Colonial
Partnership representing a significant interest in the business of Colonial
Partnership within the meaning of Treas. Reg. Section
1.368-1(d)(4)(iii)(B)(1). In addition, the Post-Merger Reorganization will
not cause the foregoing representation and warranty to be untrue or incorrect
following the Merger.   3.13 Brokers; Schedule of Fees and Expenses. No
broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other Person, other than Banc
of America Securities, the fees and expenses of which will be paid by
Colonial and are described in the engagement letter dated September 23, 2004,
between Banc of America Securities and Colonial, a true, correct and complete
copy of which has previously been given to Cornerstone, is entitled to any
broker\'s, finder\'s, financial advisor\'s or other similar fee or commission
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby based upon
arrangements made by or on behalf of Colonial or any Colonial Subsidiary.  
3.14 Compliance with Laws. Neither Colonial nor any of the
Colonial Subsidiaries has violated or failed to comply with any statute, law,
ordinance, regulation, rule,   45   judgment, decree or order of any
Governmental Entity applicable to its business, properties or operations,
except to the extent that such violation or failure would not reasonably be
expected to have a Colonial Material Adverse Effect.   3.15 Contracts; Debt
Instruments. Neither Colonial nor any Colonial Subsidiary has received a
written notice that it is in violation of or in default under (nor to the
Knowledge of Colonial does there exist any condition which upon the passage
of time or the giving of notice or both would cause such a violation of or
default under) any material loan or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, lease, permit, concession, franchise, license or any other
material contract, agreement, arrangement or understanding, to which it is a
party or by which it or any of its properties or assets is bound, nor to
the Knowledge of Colonial does such a violation or default exist, except to
the extent such violation or default, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to have a Colonial Material Adverse Effect.  
3.16 Opinion of Financial Advisor. Colonial has received the opinion of Banc
of America Securities LLC, Colonial\'s financial advisor, to the effect that
as of the date of the opinion the Merger Consideration to be paid by Colonial
in connection with the Merger is fair, from a financial point of view to
Colonial. Within 15 days after the date hereof, Colonial will have
received the written opinion of Banc of America Securities LLC to such
effect.   3.17 State Takeover Statutes. Colonial has taken all
action necessary to exempt the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
between Colonial and Cornerstone and its Affiliates from the operation of
Takeover Statutes.   3.18 Investment Company Act of 1940. Neither Colonial
nor any of the Colonial Subsidiaries is required to be registered under the
1940 Act.   3.19 Definition of "Knowledge of Colonial". As used in
this Agreement, the phrase "Knowledge of Colonial" (or words of similar
import) means the actual knowledge of those individuals identified in
Schedule 3.19 to the Colonial Disclosure Letter.   3.20 Required
Shareholder Approval. The affirmative vote of the holders of not less than a
majority of all votes cast by holders of Colonial Common Shares (provided the
votes cast constitute over 50% of the then outstanding Colonial Common
Shares) is the only vote or approval of the holders of any class or series of
Colonial capital shares necessary or required under applicable law to approve
the issuance of Colonial Common Shares, Colonial Series E Preferred
Depositary Shares and related Colonial Series E Preferred Shares contemplated
by the Merger. The approval of Colonial, as general partner, is the only vote
or approval of the holders of any class or series of Colonial Partnership\'s
partnership interests necessary or required under the Colonial Partnership
Agreement or under applicable law to approve the issuance of the Colonial
Series E Preferred OP Units contemplated by the Merger. The approval
of Colonial, as general partner, has been obtained.   46    ARTICLE

would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, or enter
into any letter of intent, agreement in principle or agreement relating to an

4.3(a)(i).   (iii) (A) Cornerstone shall, and shall cause each Cornerstone
Subsidiary to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
activities specified in Section 4.3(a)(i) and take commercially reasonable
actions to inform each Cornerstone Representative, and each of the Persons
referred to in Section 4.3(b), of the obligations undertaken in this Section
4.3 and to cause each Cornerstone Representative to comply with
such obligations, and (B) Cornerstone shall, and shall cause each
Cornerstone Subsidiary to, promptly request each Person, if any, that has
executed a confidentiality agreement within the twelve (12) months prior to
the date hereof in connection with its consideration of any Acquisition
Proposal to return or destroy all confidential information heretofore
furnished to such Person by or on behalf of Cornerstone or the Cornerstone
Subsidiaries.   54    (iv) Cornerstone shall, and shall cause each
Cornerstone Subsidiary to, (A) notify Colonial promptly (but in any event
within twenty-four (24) hours), orally and in writing, if Cornerstone,
Cornerstone Partnership, any other Cornerstone Subsidiary or any Cornerstone
Representative receives (1) an Acquisition Proposal or any material amendment
or change in any previously received Acquisition Proposal, (2) any inquiries
or proposals from, or any request for discussions or negotiations made by,
any Person which reasonably indicates to the recipient that such Person
intends to make an Acquisition Proposal, (3) any request for confidential or
nonpublic information or data relating to, or for access to the properties,
books or records of, Cornerstone, Cornerstone Partnership or any Cornerstone
Subsidiary by any Person that has made, or to such party\'s knowledge may be
considering making, an Acquisition Proposal (unless, in the case of this
clause (3), notice to Colonial of such Acquisition Proposal has already been
given), or (4) any oral or written expression that any such activities,
discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with it,
and, as applicable, include in such notice the identity of the Person making
such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request, the material terms of such
Acquisition Proposal, indication or request and, if in writing, shall
promptly deliver to Colonial copies of any proposals, indications of
interest, indication or request along with all other related documentation
and correspondence; and (B) keep Colonial informed of the status and material
terms of (including all changes to the status or material terms of) any such
Acquisition Proposal, indication or request.   (b) Notwithstanding Section
4.3(a), the Board of Directors of Cornerstone (including with respect to
Cornerstone\'s capacity as the sole general partner of Cornerstone
Partnership) shall not be prohibited from furnishing information to or
entering into discussions or negotiations with, any Person that makes a bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal to the Board of Directors of Cornerstone
after the date hereof which was not invited, initiated, solicited or
knowingly encouraged, directly or indirectly, by Cornerstone, Cornerstone
Partnership, any other Cornerstone Subsidiary or any
Cornerstone Representative on or after the date hereof, if, and only to the
extent that (i) a majority of the Board of Directors of Cornerstone
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors of
nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel, that such
Acquisition Proposal is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Acquisition
Proposal (as defined herein), (ii) Cornerstone complies in all material
respects with all of its obligations under this Section 4.3, (iii) prior to
initially furnishing any information to, or entering into discussions or
negotiations with, such Person, Cornerstone provides written notice to
Colonial to the effect that it is furnishing information to, or entering into
discussions with such Person and (iv) Cornerstone enters into a
confidentiality agreement with such Person the material terms of which are
(without regard to the terms of such Acquisition Proposal) in all material
respects no less favorable to Cornerstone, and no less restrictive to the
Person making such Acquisition Proposal, than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement (other than those relating to the
standstill provisions contained therein).   (c) Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth in Section 4.3(a) or 4.3(b), in the event that an
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Acquisition Proposal, nothing
contained in this Section 4.3 shall prohibit the Board of Directors of
Cornerstone from withdrawing, modifying, amending or qualifying its
recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger as required under Section
5.1(d) hereof and recommending such Superior Acquisition Proposal to its
shareholders: (i) if but only if, Cornerstone: (A) complies in all material
respects   55   with this Section 4.3 and (B) provides Colonial with at
least three (3) business days\' prior written notice of its intent to
withdraw, modify, amend or qualify its recommendation of this Agreement or
the Merger, (ii) if, in the event that during such three (3) business days
Colonial makes a counter proposal to such Superior Acquisition Proposal (any
such counter proposal being referred to in this Agreement as the "Colonial
Counter Proposal"), Cornerstone\'s Board of Directors in good faith, taking
into account the advice of its outside financial advisors of nationally
recognized reputation, determines that (A) the Colonial Counter Proposal is
not at least as favorable to Cornerstone\'s shareholders as the Superior
Acquisition Proposal, from a financial point of view, and (B) the Colonial
Counter Proposal is not at least as favorable generally to Cornerstone\'s
shareholders (taking into account all financial and strategic considerations
and other relevant factors, including relevant legal, financial, regulatory
and other aspects of such proposals, and the conditions, prospects and time
required for completion of such proposal), and (iii) if Cornerstone shall
have concurrently terminated this Agreement in accordance with
Section 7.1(h).   (d) For all purposes of this Agreement, "Superior
Acquisition Proposal" means a bona fide written proposal made by a third
party to acquire, directly or indirectly, Cornerstone and/or Cornerstone
Partnership pursuant to a tender or exchange offer, merger, share exchange,
consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of
Cornerstone, Cornerstone Partnership, and the Cornerstone Subsidiaries or
otherwise (i) on terms which a majority of the Board of Directors of
Cornerstone determines in good faith, after consultation with Cornerstone\'s
financial advisors of nationally recognized reputation, to be more favorable
generally to Cornerstone\'s shareholders (taking into account all financial
and strategic considerations and other relevant factors, including relevant
legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such proposals, and the
conditions, prospects and time required for completion of such proposal)
and (ii) which the Board of Directors of Cornerstone determines in good faith
is reasonably capable of being consummated.   (e) Any action taken or
disclosure that Cornerstone may be compelled to make with respect to the
receipt of an Acquisition Proposal in order to comply with its duties to
shareholders imposed by applicable law or Rule 14d-9 or 14e-2 of the Exchange
Act will not constitute a violation of this Section 4.3.   (f) Nothing in
this Section 4.3 shall (i) permit either party to terminate this Agreement
(except as expressly provided in Article 7) or (ii) affect any other
obligations of such party under this Agreement.   4.4 Affiliates. Prior to
the Effective Time of the Merger, Cornerstone shall cause to be prepared and
delivered to Colonial a list (reasonably satisfactory to counsel for
Colonial) identifying all Persons who, at the time of the Cornerstone
Shareholders Meeting and the Colonial Shareholders Meeting, may be deemed to
be "affiliates" of Cornerstone as that term is used in paragraphs (c) and (d)
of Rule 145 under the Securities Act (the "Rule 145 Affiliates"). Cornerstone
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Person who is
identified as a Rule 145 Affiliate in such list to deliver to Colonial on or
prior to the Effective Time a written agreement, in the form previously
approved by the parties hereto, that such Rule 145 Affiliate will not sell,
pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose of any Colonial Common Shares or  
56   Colonial Series E Preferred Depositary Shares issued to such Rule 145
Affiliate pursuant to the Merger, except pursuant to an effective
registration statement under the Securities Act or in compliance with
paragraph (d) of Rule 145 or as otherwise permitted by the Securities Act.
Colonial shall be entitled to place legends as specified in such written
agreements on the certificates representing any Colonial Common Shares or
Colonial Series E Preferred Depositary Shares to be received pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement by such Rule 145 Affiliates who have executed such
agreements and to issue appropriate stop transfer instructions to the
transfer agent for the Colonial Common Shares and Colonial Series E Preferred
Depositary Shares issued to such Rule 145 Affiliates, consistent with the
terms of such agreements. Colonial shall timely file the reports required to
be filed by it under the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations adopted
by the SEC thereunder, and it will take such further action as any Rule 145
Affiliate may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to
time to enable such Rule 145 Affiliate to sell Colonial Common Shares and
Colonial Series E Preferred Depositary Shares received by such Rule 145
Affiliate in the Merger without registration under the Securities
Act pursuant to (i) Rule 145(d)(1) under the Securities Act, as such rule may
be amended from to time, or (ii) any successor rule or regulation hereafter
adopted by the SEC.   4.5 Other Actions. Cornerstone, on the one hand, and
Colonial, on the other hand, shall not take, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries not to take, any action that would result in (i) any of the
representations and warranties of such party (without giving effect to any
"knowledge" qualification) set forth in this Agreement that are qualified as
to materiality becoming untrue, (ii) any of such representations and
warranties (without giving effect to any "knowledge" qualification) that are
not so qualified becoming untrue in any material respect or (iii) except as
contemplated by Section 4.3, any of the conditions to the Merger set forth in
Article 6 not being satisfied.   ARTICLE 5   ADDITIONAL COVENANTS   5.1

or more prospectuses in connection with the registration under the Securities
Act of the Colonial Common Shares and Colonial   57   Series E Preferred
Depositary Shares to be issued to the holders of Cornerstone Common Shares in
the Merger. The respective parties will cause the Joint Proxy Statement and

rules and regulations thereunder. Each of Cornerstone and Colonial shall
furnish all information about itself and its business and operations and all
necessary financial information to the other as the other may reasonably
request in connection with the preparation of the Joint Proxy Statement and
the Form S-4. Each of Colonial and Cornerstone, if applicable, shall use its

Cornerstone, on the one hand, and Colonial, on the other hand, agree promptly
to correct any information provided by them for use in the Joint Proxy

amendment or supplement thereto, at the time of mailing thereof and at the
time of the respective meetings of shareholders of Cornerstone and Colonial,
will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the

not misleading. Colonial will advise and deliver copies (if any)
to Cornerstone, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of any request by
the SEC for amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 or
comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional
information (regardless of whether such requests relate to Colonial, on the
one hand, or Cornerstone, on the other hand), and Colonial shall promptly
notify Cornerstone, and Cornerstone shall promptly notify Colonial, if
applicable, of (i) the time when the Form S-4 has become effective, (ii) the
filing of any supplement or amendment thereto, (iii) the issuance of any stop
order, and (iv) the suspension of the qualification and registration of the
Colonial Common Shares or Colonial Series E Preferred Depositary Shares

immediately prior to the Effective Time by (B) the Common Share Conversion
Rate (or, if a Top-Up Notice has been delivered pursuant to Section 7.1(j),
the product of (1) the Common Share Conversion Rate and (2) the sum of (x)
one (1) plus (y) the Top-Up Adjustment Factor (as defined herein)), at an
exercise price per Colonial Common Share (rounded to the nearest whole cent,
with .5 cent being rounded up) equal to the exercise price per Cornerstone
Common Share divided by the Common Share Conversion Rate (or, if a Top-Up
Notice has been delivered, the product of (1) the Common Share Conversion
Rate and (2) the sum of (x) one (1) plus (y) the Top-Up Adjustment Factor).
Except   62   as contemplated by this Section 5.8(c), all the terms and
conditions in effect for each Assumed Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time, including the vesting thereof, shall continue in effect
following the assumption of such Cornerstone Stock Option in accordance with
this Agreement. "Top-Up Adjustment Factor" shall mean a fraction obtained by
dividing (A) the Top-Up Amount (expressed in dollars) by (B) the Average
Closing Price.   (ii) Colonial shall take all corporate actions necessary
to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of Colonial Common Shares for
delivery upon the exercise of the Assumed Options. As soon as
practicable after the Effective Time, Colonial shall deliver to the holders
of Cornerstone Stock Options appropriate notices setting forth such holders\'
rights pursuant to Colonial\'s stock option plans and the agreements
evidencing the grants of such Assumed Options and that such Assumed Options
shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions as the Cornerstone
Stock Options (subject to the adjustment set forth in this Section 5.8(c)).
Colonial shall, within ten days following the Effective Time, file or shall
have filed, and shall keep current a Registration Statement on Form S-8 or
other appropriate registration statement for so long as any of the Assumed
Options remain outstanding.   (d) Withholding. To the extent required by
applicable law, Cornerstone shall require each employee who exercises a
Cornerstone Stock Option or who receives Cornerstone Common Shares pursuant
to any existing commitment to pay to Cornerstone in cash or Cornerstone
Common Shares an amount sufficient to satisfy in full Cornerstone\'s
obligation to withhold Taxes incurred by reason of such exercise or issuance
(unless and to the extent such withholding is satisfied pursuant to the
provision regarding withholding in Section 1.13(c)).   5.9
Indemnification.   (a) From and after the Effective Time, Colonial and
Colonial Partnership (collectively, the "Indemnifying Parties") shall provide
exculpation and indemnification for each individual who is now or has been at
any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time
of the Merger, an officer or director of Cornerstone or any Cornerstone
Subsidiary (the "Indemnified Parties") which is the same as the exculpation
and indemnification (including any applicable provisions for payment)
provided to the Indemnified Parties by Cornerstone and the Cornerstone
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger in its
charter, bylaws or in its partnership, operating or similar agreement, as in
effect on the date hereof. Immediately prior to the Effective Time of the
Merger, Colonial shall cause Colonial Partnership to execute an irrevocable
assumption of its obligations (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to Cornerstone) as an Indemnifying Party set forth in this Section 5.9.  
(b) In addition to the rights provided in Section 5.9(a) above, in the event
of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation,
whether civil, criminal or administrative, including, without limitation, any
action by or on behalf of any or all security holders of Cornerstone or
Colonial, or by or in the right of Cornerstone or Colonial, or any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation in which any individual who is now,
or has been, at any time prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to
the Effective Time of the Merger, an Indemnified Party is, or is
threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on,   63   or
arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he
is or was an officer or director of Cornerstone or any of the
Cornerstone Subsidiaries or any action or omission by such individual in his
capacity as an officer or director, or (ii) the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement, any agreement or document contemplated hereby
or delivered in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby, whether in any case asserted or arising before or after the
Effective Time of the Merger, the Indemnifying Parties shall, from and after
the Effective Time of the Merger, indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the
full extent permitted by applicable law, each Indemnified Party against any
losses, claims, liabilities, expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees
and expenses), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in accordance
herewith in connection with any such threatened or actual claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation. Any Indemnified Party proposing to assert
the right to be indemnified under this Section 5.9(b) shall, promptly after
receipt of notice of commencement of any action against such Indemnified
Party in respect of which a claim is to be made under this Section 5.9(b)
against the Indemnifying Parties, notify the Indemnifying Parties of the
commencement of such action, enclosing a copy of all papers served; provided,
however, that the failure to provide such notice shall not affect the
obligations of the Indemnifying Parties except to the extent such failure to
notify materially prejudices the Indemnifying Parties\' ability to defend
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation; and provided further,
however, that, in the case of any action that is known by an Indemnified
Party to be pending prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, notification
pursuant to this Section 5.9(b) shall be given by such Indemnified Party to
Colonial prior to such Effective Time. If any such action is brought against
any of the Indemnified Parties and such Indemnified Party notifies
the Indemnifying Parties of its commencement, the Indemnifying Parties will
be entitled to participate in and, to the extent that they elect by
delivering written notice to such Indemnified Parties promptly after
receiving notice of the commencement of the action from the Indemnified
Parties, to assume the defense of the action and after notice from the
Indemnifying Parties to the Indemnified Parties of their election to assume
the defense, the Indemnifying Parties will not be liable to the Indemnified
Parties for any legal or other expenses except as provided below. If the
Indemnifying Parties assume the defense, the Indemnifying Parties shall have
the right to settle such action without the consent of the Indemnified
Parties; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Parties shall be required
to obtain such consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) if
the settlement includes any admission of wrongdoing on the part of the
Indemnified Parties or any decree or restriction on the Indemnified Parties;
provided further, however, that no Indemnifying Parties, in the defense of
any such action shall, except with the consent of the Indemnified Parties
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), consent to entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement that does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to
such Indemnified Party of a release from all liability with respect to such
action. The Indemnified Parties will have the right to employ their own
counsel in any such action, but the fees, expenses and other charges of such
counsel will be at the expense of such Indemnified Parties unless (i) the
employment of counsel by the Indemnified Parties has been authorized in
writing by the Indemnifying Parties, (ii) the Indemnified Parties have
reasonably concluded (based on written advice of counsel to the Indemnified
Parties) that there may be legal defenses available to them that are
different from or in addition to and inconsistent with those available to the
Indemnifying Parties, (iii) a conflict or potential conflict exists (based on
written advice of counsel to the Indemnified Parties) between the Indemnified
Parties and the Indemnifying Parties   64   (in which case the
Indemnifying Parties will not have the right to direct the defense of such
action on behalf of the Indemnified Parties) or (iv) the Indemnifying Parties
have not in fact employed counsel to assume the defense of such action within
a reasonable time after receiving notice of the commencement of the action
from the Indemnified Parties, in each of which cases the reasonable fees,
disbursements and other charges of counsel will be at the expense of the
Indemnifying Parties and shall promptly be paid by each Indemnifying Party as
they become due and payable in advance of the final disposition of the claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation to the fullest extent and in the
manner permitted by law; provided, however, that in no event shall any
contingent fee arrangement be considered reasonable. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Indemnifying Parties shall not be obligated to advance any
expenses or costs prior to receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the
Indemnified Party to repay any expenses advanced if it shall ultimately be
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that the Indemnified Party is
not entitled to be indemnified against such expense because such
indemnification is prohibited by applicable law, and such determination shall
have become final and non-appealable. It is understood that the Indemnifying
Parties shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings
in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees, disbursements
and other charges of more than one separate firm admitted to practice in such
jurisdiction at any one time for all such Indemnified Parties unless (a) the
employment of more than one counsel has been authorized in writing by the
Indemnifying Parties, (b) any of the Indemnified Parties have reasonably
concluded (based on written advice of counsel to the Indemnified Parties)
that there may be legal defenses available to them that are different from or
in addition to and inconsistent with those available to other Indemnified
Parties or (c) a conflict or potential conflict exists (based on written
advice of counsel to the Indemnified Parties) between any of the Indemnified
Parties and the other Indemnified Parties, in each case of which
the Indemnifying Parties shall be obligated to pay the reasonable fees and
expenses of such additional counsel or counsels. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Indemnifying Parties (i) shall
not be liable for any settlement effected without their prior written consent
and (ii) shall not have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party to
the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine in a final
and non-appealable order that such indemnification is prohibited by
applicable law. In the event of a final and non-appealable determination by a
court that any payment of expenses is prohibited by applicable law, the
Indemnified Parties shall promptly refund to the Indemnifying Parties the
amount of all such expenses theretofore advanced pursuant hereto.   (c)
Prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, Cornerstone shall purchase a non-
cancelable extended reporting period endorsement under Cornerstone\'s
existing directors\' and officers\' liability insurance coverage
for Cornerstone\'s directors and officers in the substantially the same form
as presently maintained by Cornerstone, which shall provide such directors
and officers with coverage for six (6) years following the Effective Time of
not less than the existing coverage under, and have other terms not less
favorable to, the insured persons than the directors\' and officers\'
liability insurance coverage presently maintained by Cornerstone.   (d)
This Section 5.9 is intended for the irrevocable benefit of, and to grant
third-party rights to, the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties and
their successors, assigns and heirs and shall be binding on all successors
and assigns of Colonial and Colonial Partnership. Each of the Indemnified
Parties and the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to   65   enforce
the covenants contained in this Section 5.9 and Colonial and
Colonial Partnership acknowledge and agree that each Indemnified Party and
Indemnified Party would suffer irreparable harm and that no adequate remedy
at law exists for a breach of such covenants and such Indemnified Party or
such Indemnified Party shall be entitled to injunctive relief and specific
performance in the event of any breach of any provision in this Section
5.9.   (e) If Colonial or Colonial Partnership or any of its respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case the
successors and assigns of such entity shall assume the obligations set forth
in this Section 5.9, which obligations are expressly intended to be for the
irrevocable benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each director and
officer covered hereby.   5.10 Declaration of Dividends and Distributions.
From and after the date of this Agreement, neither Cornerstone nor Colonial
shall make any dividend or distribution to its respective shareholders
without the prior written consent of the other party; provided, however, the
written consent of the other party shall not be required for the
authorization and payment of (a) distributions at their respective stated
dividend or distribution rates with respect to Colonial Preferred Shares or
Cornerstone Series A Preferred Shares, (b) subject to the immediately
following paragraph, quarterly distributions with respect to the Cornerstone
Common Shares of up to $0.20 per share during the quarter ending March 31,
2005 and for each quarter thereafter, and (c) quarterly distributions with
respect to the Colonial Common Shares of up to $0.67 per share during
the quarter ending December 31, 2004 and up to $0.675 per share during each
quarter thereafter; provided, however, the record date for each distribution
with respect to the Cornerstone Common Shares shall be the same date as the
record date for the quarterly distribution for the Colonial Common Shares, as
provided to Cornerstone by notice not less than twenty (20) days prior to the
record date for any quarterly Colonial distribution. From and after the date
of this Agreement, Cornerstone Partnership shall not make any distribution to
the holders of Cornerstone OP Units except distributions required under
the Cornerstone Partnership Agreement based on the dividend per share of
Cornerstone Common Shares permitted pursuant to this Section 5.10, with the
same record and payment dates as such dividend on the Cornerstone Common
Shares.   Unless Cornerstone shall have advised Colonial in writing that no
IRS Agreement (as defined herein) shall be requested pursuant to Section
5.16 (and that an opinion as to the qualification of Cornerstone as a REIT
satisfying the conditions of Section 6.2(d) herein is contemporaneously
delivered to Colonial), then, notwithstanding anything to contrary contained
in this Section 5.10, Cornerstone shall not make any dividend or distribution
to its holders of Cornerstone Common Shares, except as set forth below to
satisfy the Deficiency Dividend Amount (as defined below), until Cornerstone
shall have obtained the IRS Agreement contemplated by Section 5.16 and all
matters covered by the request for such IRS Agreement shall have been
resolved in such IRS Agreement. If Cornerstone shall have obtained an IRS
Agreement that requires the payment of a "deficiency dividend" (within the
meaning of Section 860 of the Code) (a "Deficiency Dividend," and the amount
of all Deficiency Dividends under the IRS Agreement, the "Deficiency Dividend
Amount"), whether or not such IRS Agreement   66   resolves all matters
covered by such request, then Cornerstone shall (i) not make any dividend or
distribution to its holders of Cornerstone Common Shares, except as provided
in clause (ii) below, and (ii)(A) first, to the extent not already
contemplated by such IRS Agreement, seek an additional IRS Agreement to have
distributions paid to holders of Cornerstone Common Shares during the
year ended December 31, 2004 that otherwise would not be treated as dividends
for federal income tax purposes recharacterized by the IRS as a
"deficiency dividend" in satisfaction of the Deficiency Dividend Amount,
unless Cornerstone, after good faith consultation with Colonial, reasonably
determines that it is likely that such additional IRS Agreement cannot be
obtained, (B) second, to the extent the preceding clause (A) does not satisfy
the Deficiency Dividend Amount, declare and make quarterly distributions to
holders of Cornerstone Common Shares of up to $0.20 per share for each
quarter after the quarter ending December 31, 2004 in satisfaction of the
Deficiency Dividend Amount (provided that, no portion of the quarterly
distribution shall be treated as having satisfied the Deficiency Dividend
Amount if, and to the extent, that such treatment would result in Cornerstone
being required to pay a Final Closing Dividend (that is, a dividend either to
satisfy the requirements of Section 857(a)(1) of the Code for the taxable
year of Cornerstone ending at the Effective Time of the Merger and/or
December 31, 2004 and/or a dividend to avoid the payment of any Tax
with respect to undistributed income or gain for either such year)), and (C)
third, to the extent the preceding clause (B) does not satisfy the Deficiency
Dividend Amount, declare and make a distribution (the "Closing Deficiency
Dividend") to holders of Cornerstone Common Shares, the record date for which
shall be no later than the close of business on the sixth business day prior
to the Effective Time of the Merger, in an amount equal to the Deficiency
Dividend Amount not satisfied by the preceding clauses (A) and (B) (such
amount, the "Closing Dividend Deficiency Amount") (any distributions payable
under this clause (C) to holders of Cornerstone Common Shares shall be paid
on the third business day immediately preceding the Closing Date, unless
otherwise required by the IRS Agreement). For any distribution required by
the preceding clause (B), the record date for each distribution with respect
to the Cornerstone Common Shares shall be the same date as the record date
for the quarterly distribution for the Colonial Common Shares, as provided to
Cornerstone by notice not less than twenty (20) days prior to the record date
for any quarterly Colonial distribution; provided, however, that if
Cornerstone shall have deferred the payment of any regular quarterly
distribution pursuant to this paragraph and Colonial shall have made a
distribution for the corresponding quarter, then Cornerstone shall be
permitted to make the record date for its quarterly distribution described in
the preceding clause (B) prior to the record date for the next succeeding
Colonial quarterly distribution.   The foregoing restrictions shall not
apply, however, to the extent a distribution (or an increase in a
distribution) by Cornerstone or Colonial is necessary for Cornerstone or
Colonial to maintain REIT status, avoid the incurrence of any taxes under
Section 857 of the Code, avoid the imposition of any excise taxes under
Section 4981 of the Code, or avoid the need to make one or more extraordinary
or disproportionately larger distributions to meet any of the three preceding
objectives. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any prior
dividends or distributions of Cornerstone have been treated as being in
satisfaction of the Dividend Deficiency Amount but not as part of the Closing
Deficiency Dividend Amount and Cornerstone would be required to pay
a dividend or distribution that is described in the preceding sentence, then
an amount equal to the lesser of such dividend or   67   distribution
described in the preceding sentence or the amount of prior dividends or
distributions of Cornerstone that have been treated as being in satisfaction
of the Dividend Deficiency Amount shall be treated as a Closing Deficiency
Dividend Amount and not as a dividend or distribution within the scope of the
preceding sentence.   5.11 Notices. Colonial shall provide such notice to
its preferred shareholders of the Merger as may be required under Alabama law
or the Colonial Declaration of Trust.   5.12 Resignations and Existing
Agreements with Certain Cornerstone Executives.   (a) On the Closing Date,
Cornerstone shall cause the directors and officers of Cornerstone and of each
of the Cornerstone Subsidiaries to submit their resignations from such
positions, effective as of the Effective Time of the Merger, provided,
however, that in no event shall any such resignations be deemed to be a
termination of employment as a common-law employee of Cornerstone for
purposes of any severance, stock option, change in control, or other Employee
Plan, contract entitlement or arrangement, except as provided in Section
5.12(b) of the Agreement.   (b) Colonial and Colonial Merger Sub hereby
acknowledge and agree that (i) the Closing will be considered a "Change in
Control" under the Change in Control Agreements between Cornerstone and
Messrs. Knight, Olander, Remppies and Carneal (the "CIC Agreements"), and
(ii) for all purposes under the CIC Agreements and the Employment Agreements
between Cornerstone and Messrs. Knight and Olander (the "Employment
Agreements"), the resignations of Messrs. Knight, Olander, Remppies and
Carneal as set forth in Section 5.12(a) of the Agreement will be considered a
termination by the Company other than for cause (as those terms are defined
under the CIC Agreements and the Employment Agreements). Effective as of the
Effective Time, Colonial Merger Sub hereby assumes the CIC Agreements with
Messrs. Knight, Olander, Remppies and Carneal. Messrs. Knight, Olander,
Remppies and Carneal shall be entitled to all rights and benefits under their
respective CIC Agreements, and, as of the Closing Date, Cornerstone will pay
a lump sum amount to each of Messrs. Knight and Olander equal to their
salaries under their respective Employment Agreements for the period between
the Closing Date and the end of the term of each such Employment Agreement
for settlement of Cornerstone\'s obligations under such
Employment Agreement.   5.13 Pre-Closing Reorganization Transactions.  
(a) Cornerstone shall cause Cornerstone Partnership to distribute to
Cornerstone all of Cornerstone Partnership\'s ownership interests in CRIT-
Legacy, Inc. and shall cause CRIT-Legacy, Inc. to convert or merge into a
limited liability company that will be disregarded as an entity separate
from its owner for federal income tax purposes within the meaning of Treas.
Reg. Section 301.7701-3.   (b) Cornerstone shall sell, transfer or
otherwise dispose of (but not liquidate) all of its interest in Apple
Residential Management Group, Inc. and Apple Residential Advisors, Inc.  
68    (c) Cornerstone shall cause each of the "qualified
REIT subsidiaries" and other entities listed on Schedule 5.13 to the
Cornerstone Disclosure Letter either (i) to be converted or merged into a
limited liability company in which Cornerstone is the sole member and that
will be disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for federal income
tax purposes within the meaning of Treas. Reg. Section 301.7701-3 or (ii) to
be liquidated. Cornerstone shall allow Colonial to choose whether to apply
clause (i) or clause (ii) of the preceding sentence to any particular entity.
Such choice shall be made in the sole and absolute discretion of
Colonial.   (d) Consistent with Cornerstone\'s obligations under
Section 5.3(a), Cornerstone shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain all consents necessary to consummate the transactions referred to in
Sections 5.13(a), 5.13(b) and 5.13(c) (such transactions are referred to
herein as the "Pre-Closing Reorganization Transactions") prior to the
Effective Time. In the event that all such consents shall not have been
obtained prior to the Effective Time, then (i) Cornerstone shall, upon the
written request of Colonial, nevertheless cause each of the Pre-Closing
Reorganization Transactions to be consummated within the two business days
prior to the Closing Date and (ii) if Colonial shall have provided the
written request of Colonial set forth in clause (i), the failure to obtain
all consents necessary to consummate the Pre-Closing Reorganization
Transactions may not be asserted by Cornerstone as the factual basis for any
of the conditions set forth in Sections 6.3(a), 6.3(c) and 6.3(f) or by
Colonial as the factual basis for any of the conditions set forth in Sections
6.2(a), 6.2(c) or 6.2(g).   5.14 [Intentionally omitted].   5.15
Redemption of Cornerstone Series A Preferred Shares. As soon as reasonably
practicable following the date hereof, Cornerstone shall mail a notice of
redemption to all holders of record of Cornerstone Series A Preferred Shares
which fixes a date not less than 30 days from the date of such mailing
on which Cornerstone will redeem all outstanding Cornerstone Series A
Preferred Shares in accordance with Section 9.4 of the Cornerstone Articles
(the "Cornerstone Series A Redemption Date"). On the Cornerstone Series A
Redemption Date, Cornerstone shall redeem all outstanding Cornerstone Series
A Preferred Shares at the cash redemption price set forth in, and otherwise
in accordance with, the terms of Section 9.4 of the Cornerstone Articles.  
5.16 IRS Agreements.   (a) Cornerstone shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to seek an appropriate closing agreement, private letter ruling,
determination letter or such other agreement described in Treas. Reg. Sec.
1.860-2(b)(1)(ii) from the IRS (an "IRS Agreement") resolving those matters
identified on Schedule 5.16 of the Cornerstone Disclosure Schedule and any
other matters heretofore or hereafter identified by Cornerstone as requiring
resolution through an IRS Agreement in order for (x) Cornerstone to comply
with (or, in the case of a condition, satisfy) Sections 2.6, 2.14, 4.1(f),
4.1(g), 4.1(i), 5.1(b) and 6.2(d)(i) or (y) Colonial to comply with its
obligations set forth in Section 5.1(b)(ii). Cornerstone shall (and shall
cause the counsel representing Cornerstone in such matter to) (i) consult
with Colonial regarding the application for and negotiation of such IRS
Agreement, (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to permit Colonial\'s
designated counsel to attend meetings or telephone calls with the IRS
scheduled by   69   the IRS or Cornerstone (or Cornerstone\'s counsel)
regarding any such IRS Agreement, and (iii) provide Colonial with copies of,
and the right to comment on, any written materials regarding such IRS
Agreement prior to submission to the IRS; provided, however, that Colonial\'s
rights under this Section 5.16 shall not be permitted to unduly delay or
impede Cornerstone from obtaining such IRS Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, Cornerstone shall not, without the
prior written consent of Colonial, enter into any IRS Agreement providing for
any obligation of Cornerstone or any Cornerstone Subsidiary other than the
payment in cash of a Deficiency Dividend to holders of Cornerstone Common
Shares or of amounts that would constitute Section 5.16 Expenses or Section
5.16 Interest/Penalties. The seeking of or entering into any IRS Agreement
meeting the requirements of this Section 5.16 (or any resulting Dividend
Deficiency Amount, Section 5.16 Expenses Amount or Section
5.16 Interest/Penalties Amount) shall not constitute a circumstance,
event, occurrence, change or effect that would constitute a Cornerstone
Material Adverse Effect.   (b) Cornerstone and Colonial shall each maintain
accurate records of all third party costs and expenses required in connection
with the matters described in this Section 5.16 (including (i) all
incremental costs and expenses attributable to the matters that are the
subject of this Section 5.16 incurred in connection with this Agreement, the
Form S-4 and any Form 8-K\'s or other public communications in connection
herewith and (ii) all costs and expenses described in this sentence incurred
by Cornerstone and Colonial prior to the date hereof) (collectively, the
"Section 5.16 Expenses"). Cornerstone and Colonial shall each provide to the
other (i) an itemized calculation of all Section 5.16 Expenses incurred by
such party as of a date not more than three days prior to the effectiveness
of the Form S-4 and (ii) its reasonable estimate of the remaining Section
5.16 Expenses it will incur in connection with the resolution of any request
for an IRS Agreement. The aggregate amount of all Section 5.16 Expenses of
both Cornerstone and Colonial is referred to herein as the "Section 5.16
Expenses Amount."   (c) If Cornerstone shall have obtained an IRS
Agreement pursuant to this Section 5.16 requiring the payment of any amount
to the IRS, whether denominated as taxes, a payment in lieu of taxes, a
penalty, or interest (including, without limitation, the interest payment
required under Section 860 of the Code) (collectively, the "Section 5.16
Interest/Penalties"), Cornerstone shall pay such Section 5.16
Interest/Penalties in accordance with the IRS Agreement and provide Colonial
evidence of such payment. Without limiting the foregoing, the Section 5.16
Interest/Penalties also shall include any amount payable to any state or
local taxing authority as a result of the matters covered by the IRS
Agreement. The aggregate amount of all Section 5.16 Interest/Penalties is
referred to herein as the "Section 5.16 Interest/Penalties Amount."

extent that such representations and warranties are expressly limited by
their terms to another date, in which case such representations and
warranties shall be true and correct as of such other date), except where the
failure of such representations and warranties to be true and correct would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Cornerstone Material Adverse Effect; and Colonial shall have received a

extent as the representations and warranties of Cornerstone contained herein
are so qualified) signed on behalf of Cornerstone by the chief
executive officer or the chief financial officer of Cornerstone, in such

1999, Colonial was organized and has operated in conformity with the
requirements for qualification as a REIT under the Code and that, after
giving effect to the Merger, Colonial\'s proposed method of operation will
enable it to continue to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation
as a REIT under the Code (with customary exceptions, assumptions
and qualifications and based upon customary representations, and with
such additional exceptions, assumptions, qualifications and representations
as are set forth in writing and are reasonably satisfactory to Colonial).  
(e) Tax Opinion Relating to the Merger. Colonial shall have received an
opinion dated the Closing Date from Hogan and Hartson L.L.P. or other counsel
reasonably satisfactory to Colonial, based upon customary
exceptions, assumptions, qualifications, certificates and letters, which
customary exceptions, assumptions, qualifications, letters and certificates
are to be in a form to be agreed upon by the parties and dated the Closing
Date, to the effect that the Merger will qualify as a reorganization under
the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code (but such opinion need not
conclude that the receipt of the Colonial Series E Preferred Depositary
Shares in the Merger will qualify for the nonrecognition of gain).   (f)
Nonsolicitation Agreements. Each of Glade M. Knight, S.J. Olander, Jr. and
David L. Carneal shall have entered into nonsolicitation agreements
substantially in the form set forth on Exhibit D.   (g) Consents. All
consents and waivers (including, without limitation, waivers of rights of
first refusal) from third parties necessary in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall have
been obtained, other than such consents and waivers from third parties,
which, if not obtained, would not reasonably be expected to result,
individually or in the aggregate, in a Colonial Material Adverse
Effect (after giving effect to the Merger) or a Cornerstone Material Adverse
Effect.   72    (h) Redemption. Cornerstone shall have redeemed
all outstanding Cornerstone Series A Preferred Shares for the redemption
price set forth in the Cornerstone Articles, and there shall be no
Cornerstone Series A Preferred Shares outstanding.   (i) Pre-Closing
Reorganization Transactions. The Pre-Closing Reorganization Transactions
shall have been consummated.   (j) IRS Agreement. Cornerstone shall have
submitted to the IRS a request for an IRS Agreement pursuant to Section 5.16
and shall have obtained such IRS Agreement, and all matters covered by such
request shall have been resolved in such IRS Agreement in a manner that is
reasonably satisfactory to Colonial.   6.3 Conditions to Obligations of
Cornerstone. The obligations of Cornerstone to effect the Merger and to
consummate the other transactions contemplated to occur on the Closing Date
is further subject to the following conditions, any one or more of which may
be waived by Cornerstone:   (a) Representations and Warranties. Each of
the representations and warranties of Colonial and Colonial Merger Sub set
forth in this Agreement, disregarding all qualifications and exceptions
contained therein relating to materiality or Colonial Material Adverse
Effect, shall be true and correct as of the date of this Agreement and as of
the Closing Date as though made on and as of the Closing Date (except to the
extent that such representations and warranties are expressly limited by
their terms to another date, in which case such representations and
warranties shall be true and correct as of such other date), except where the
failure of such representations and warranties to be true and correct would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Colonial Material Adverse Effect; and Cornerstone shall have received a
certificate (which certificate may be qualified by "knowledge" to the same
extent as the representations and warranties of Colonial and Colonial Merger
Sub contained herein are so qualified) signed on behalf of Colonial by the
chief executive officer or the chief financial officer of Colonial, in such
capacity, to such effect.   (b) Performance of Obligations of Colonial.
Colonial and Colonial Merger Sub shall have performed in all material
respects all obligations required to be performed by them under this
Agreement at or prior to the Effective Time, and Cornerstone shall have
received a certificate of Colonial signed on behalf of Colonial by the chief
executive officer or the chief financial officer of Colonial, in such
capacity, to such effect.   (c) Material Adverse Effect. Since the date of
this Agreement, there shall have been no Colonial Material Adverse Effect and
Cornerstone shall have received a certificate of the chief executive officer
or the chief financial officer of Colonial, in such capacity, certifying to
such effect.   (d) Tax Opinions Relating to REIT Status. Cornerstone
shall have received the opinion of Hogan and Hartson L.L.P. or other counsel to
Colonial reasonably satisfactory to Cornerstone, dated as of the Closing
Date, that, commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 1999,
Colonial was organized and has operated in conformity with the  
73   requirements for qualification as a REIT under the Code and that,
after giving effect to the Merger, Colonial\'s proposed method of operation
will enable it to continue to meet the requirements for qualification and
taxation as a REIT under the Code (with customary exceptions, assumptions and
qualifications and based upon customary representations, and with such
additional exceptions, assumptions, qualifications and representations as are
set forth in writing and are reasonably satisfactory to Cornerstone).   (e)
Tax Opinion Relating to the Merger. Cornerstone shall have received an
opinion dated the Closing Date from McGuireWoods LLP or other counsel
reasonably satisfactory to Cornerstone, based upon customary
exceptions, assumptions, qualifications, certificates and letters, which
customary exceptions, assumptions, qualifications, letters and certificates
are to be in a form to be agreed upon by the parties and dated the Closing
Date, to the effect that the Merger will qualify as a reorganization under
the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code (but such opinion need not
conclude that the receipt of the Colonial Series E Preferred Depositary
Shares in the Merger will qualify for the nonrecognition of gain).   (f)
Consents. All consents and waivers (including, without limitation, waivers or
rights of first refusal) from third parties necessary in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall have been
obtained, other than such consents and waivers from third parties, which, if
not obtained, would not result, individually or in the aggregate, in
a Colonial Material Adverse Effect (after giving effect to the Merger).  
ARTICLE 7   TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER   7.1 Termination. This
Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Effective Time of the
Merger, whether such action occurs before or after the Shareholder Approvals
are obtained:   (a) by mutual written consent duly authorized by the Board
of Trustees of Colonial and the Board of Directors of Cornerstone;   (b) by
Colonial, (i) upon a breach of or failure to perform any covenant, obligation
or agreement on the part of Cornerstone set forth in this Agreement, or (ii)
upon a breach of or in the event that any representation or warranty of
Cornerstone is or shall have become untrue, in either case such that the
conditions set forth in Section 6.2(a) or Section 6.2(b), as the case may be,
would be incapable of being satisfied by the Outside Date (as defined herein)
(or as otherwise extended);   (c) by Cornerstone, (i) upon a breach of or
failure to perform any covenant, obligation or agreement on the part of
Colonial set forth in this Agreement, or (ii) upon a breach of or in the
event that any representation or warranty of Colonial or Colonial Merger Sub
is or shall have become untrue, in either case such that the conditions set
forth in Section 6.3(a) or Section 6.3(b), as the case may be, would be
incapable of being satisfied by the Outside Date (or as otherwise
extended);   74    (d) by either Colonial or Cornerstone, if any
judgment, injunction, order, decree or action by any Governmental Entity of
competent authority preventing the consummation of the Merger shall have
become final and non-appealable;   (e) by either Colonial or Cornerstone,
if the Merger shall not have been consummated before the Outside Date;
provided, however, that a party may not terminate pursuant to this clause (e)
if the terminating party shall have breached in any material respect its
obligations under this Agreement in any manner that shall have caused the
Merger not to have been consummated by such date;   (f) by either Colonial
or Cornerstone (unless Cornerstone is in breach in any material respect of
its obligations under Section 5.1) if, upon a vote at a duly held Cornerstone
Shareholders Meeting or any adjournment thereof, the Cornerstone Shareholder
Approval shall not have been obtained as contemplated by Section 5.1;   (g)
by either Cornerstone or Colonial (unless Colonial is in breach in any
material respect of its obligations under Section 5.1) if, upon a vote at a
duly held Colonial Shareholders Meeting or any adjournment thereof, the
Colonial Shareholder Approval shall not have been obtained as contemplated by
Section 5.1;   (h) by Cornerstone (i) if the Board of Directors
of Cornerstone shall have withdrawn, modified, amended or qualified, or
proposed publicly not to recommend or to withdraw, modify, amend or qualify,
in any manner adverse to Colonial its approval or recommendation of the
Merger or this Agreement in connection with, or approved or recommended, any
Superior Acquisition Proposal, or, (ii) in order to enter into a binding
written agreement with respect to a Superior Acquisition Proposal, provided
that, in each case, Cornerstone shall not be in material breach of the terms
of Section 4.3 and termination pursuant to this Section 7.1(h) shall not be
effective until such time as Cornerstone shall have paid to Colonial
Partnership the Break-Up Fee (as defined herein) as provided by Section 7.2
hereof;   (i) by Colonial, if (i) the Board of Directors of
Cornerstone shall have failed to recommend or withdrawn, modified, amended or
qualified, or proposed publicly not to recommend or to withdraw, modify,
amend or qualify, in any manner adverse to Colonial its approval or
recommendation of the Merger or this Agreement in connection with, or
approved or recommended, any Superior Acquisition Proposal or (ii) following
the announcement or receipt of an Acquisition Proposal, Cornerstone shall
have failed to call the Cornerstone Shareholders Meeting in accordance with
Section 5.1(b) or failed to prepare and mail to its shareholders the Joint
Proxy Statement in accordance with Section 5.1(a) or 5.1(b);   (j) by
Cornerstone, if the Average Closing Price of Colonial Common Shares is less
than $31.00 and Cornerstone shall have given Colonial, within three business
days after the end of the 20-Trading Day period during which the Average
Closing Price is determined, written notice of Cornerstone\'s election to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(j), which election
shall be irrevocable (unless Colonial shall have consented otherwise
in writing) and shall be effective on the fifth business day following
receipt by Colonial of such termination notice, unless during such five
business day period Colonial shall   75   have elected by notice in
writing to Cornerstone (the "Top-Up Notice") to pay additional consideration
(the "Top-Up Amount") consisting of cash, Colonial Common Shares, or a
combination thereof, as specified in the Top-Up Notice, equal in value to
$31.00 minus the Average Closing Price of Colonial Common Shares (with the
value of any Colonial Common Shares included in the Top-Amount being equal to
the Average Closing Price) with respect to each Colonial Common Share
issuable in exchange for Cornerstone Common Shares in the Merger pursuant to
Section 1.8(a)(ii) or 1.10(b);   (k) by Colonial, if the Average Closing
Price of Colonial Common Shares is greater than $49.00; and   (l) by
Colonial, if the Closing Adjustment Amount (excluding any portion of the
Section 5.16 Expenses Amount incurred by Colonial)
exceeds $60,000,000.  For purposes of this Section 7.1, the term "Outside
Date" shall mean April 30, 2005; provided that the Outside Date shall be
extended by the number of days after January 1, 2005 until the date on which
both of the following shall have occurred: (x) Cornerstone shall have
received an IRS Agreement meeting the condition set forth in Section 6.2(j)
and (y) the parties shall have received all necessary consents for the filing
of the Form S-4; provided, further, that the Outside Date shall be no later
than June 30, 2005.   7.2 Certain Fees and Expenses. If this Agreement shall
be terminated (i) pursuant to Section 7.1(h) or 7.1(i)(i), then Cornerstone
theretofore or thereupon shall pay to Colonial Partnership a fee equal to the
Break-Up Fee, or (ii) pursuant to Section 7.1(b), 7.1(e) (if, at the time of
such termination, the condition set forth in Section 6.2(j) shall not have
been satisfied), 7.1(f) and 7.1(l), then Cornerstone shall pay to Colonial
Partnership (provided that Cornerstone was not entitled to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c) at the time of such termination) an
amount equal to the Break-Up Expenses (as defined herein). If this Agreement
shall be terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(c), 7.1(g) or 7.1(k), then
Colonial shall pay to Cornerstone (provided that Colonial was not entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(b) at the time of such
termination) an amount equal to the Break-Up Expenses. If this Agreement
shall be terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(b), 7.1(d) (if primarily
resulting from any action or inaction of Cornerstone or any Cornerstone
Subsidiary), 7.1(e) (if such termination is by Cornerstone), 7.1(f) or
7.1(i)(ii) and prior to the time of such termination an Acquisition
Proposal (but substituting 25% for 10% in the definition thereof) has been
received by Cornerstone, and either prior to the termination of this
Agreement or within twelve (12) months thereafter, Cornerstone (or
Cornerstone Partnership or any Cornerstone Subsidiary) enters into any
written agreement to consummate a transaction or series of transactions
which, had such agreement been proposed or negotiated during the term of this
Agreement, would have constituted an Acquisition Proposal (but substituting
25% for 10% in the definition thereof) pursuant to Section 4.3 (each, a
"Cornerstone Acquisition Agreement"), which is subsequently consummated (and
which, (x) in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 7.1(e) or 7.1(f),
relates to the same Acquisition Proposal that had been received at the time
of termination of this Agreement and (y) in the case of a termination
pursuant to Section 7.1(b), 7.1(d) or 7.1(i)(ii), relates to any Acquisition
Proposal, whether or not such Acquisition Proposal is the Acquisition
Proposal that had been received at the time of the termination of this
Agreement), then Cornerstone shall pay the Break-Up Fee to
Colonial Partnership.   76    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, the parties hereto expressly acknowledge and agree that,
with respect to any termination of this Agreement in circumstances where the
Break-Up Fee is payable in accordance with this Section 7.2 (other than a
termination by Colonial pursuant to Section 7.1(b) by reason of a willful or
intentional breach of this Agreement by Cornerstone), the payment of the
Break-Up Fee shall, in light of the difficulty of accurately determining
actual damages, constitute liquidated damages with respect to any claim for
damages or any other claim which Colonial and Colonial Merger Sub would
otherwise be entitled to assert against Cornerstone or any of their
respective assets, or against any of their respective directors, officers,
employees, partners, managers, members or shareholders, with respect to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and shall constitute the
sole and exclusive remedy available to Colonial or Colonial Merger Sub.
Except for nonpayment of the amounts set forth in Section 7.2, the parties
hereby agree that, upon termination of this Agreement in circumstances where
the Break-Up Fee is payable in accordance with this Section 7.2 (other than a
termination by Colonial pursuant to Section 7.1(b) by reason of a willful or
intentional breach of this Agreement by Cornerstone), in no event shall
Colonial or Colonial Merger Sub (i) seek to obtain any recovery or judgment
against Cornerstone or any of their respective assets, or against any of
their respective directors, officers, employees, partners, managers, members
or shareholders, or (ii) be entitled to seek or obtain any other damages of
any kind, including, without limitation, consequential, indirect or
punitive damages.   The Break-Up Fee shall be paid by Cornerstone to
Colonial Partnership, or the Break-Up Expenses shall be paid by Cornerstone
to Colonial Partnership or Colonial to Cornerstone (as applicable), in
immediately available funds within two (2) business days after the date the
event giving rise to the obligation to make such payment occurred (except as
otherwise provided in Section 7.1(h)). The parties hereto acknowledge that
the agreements contained in this Section 7.2 are integral parts of this
Agreement; accordingly, if (i) Cornerstone fails to promptly pay the Break-Up
Fee or Break-Up Expenses due pursuant to this Section 7.2 and, in order to
obtain payment, Colonial commences a suit which results in a judgment against
Cornerstone for any amounts owed pursuant to this Section 7.2, Cornerstone
shall pay to Colonial its costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys\' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on the amount owed at the rate on six-month U.S. Treasury
obligations in effect on the date such payment was required to be made plus
300 basis points, or (ii) Colonial fails to promptly pay the Break-
Up Expenses due pursuant to this Section 7.2 and, in order to obtain
payment, Cornerstone commences a suit which results in a judgment against
Colonial for any amounts owed pursuant to this Section 7.2, Colonial shall
pay to Cornerstone its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\'
fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on
the amount owed at the rate on six-month U.S. Treasury obligations in effect
on the date such payment was required to be made plus 300 basis points.  
As used in this Agreement, "Break-Up Fee" shall be an amount equal to the
lesser of (i) $20 million less Break-Up Expenses paid or payable under this
Section 7.2 (the "Base Amount") and (ii) the sum of (A) the maximum
amount that can be paid to Colonial Partnership without causing Colonial to
fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code
determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute income
described in Sections 856(c)(2)(A)-(H) and 856(c)(3)(A)-(I) of the Code
("Qualifying Income"), as determined by independent accountants to Colonial,
and (B) in the event Colonial receives a   77   letter from outside
counsel (the "Break-Up Fee Tax Opinion") indicating that Colonial has
received a ruling from the IRS holding that Colonial Partnership\'s receipt
of the Base Amount would either constitute Qualifying Income or would
be excluded from gross income of Colonial within the meaning of Sections
856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (the "REIT Requirements") or that the receipt
by Colonial Partnership of the remaining balance of the Base Amount following
the receipt of and pursuant to such ruling would not be deemed constructively
received prior thereto, the Base Amount less the amount payable under clause
(A) above. Cornerstone\'s obligation to pay any unpaid portion of the Break-
Up Fee shall terminate three years from the date of this Agreement. In the
event that Colonial Partnership is not able to receive the full Base Amount,
Cornerstone shall place the unpaid amount in escrow and shall not release any
portion thereof to Colonial Partnership unless and until Cornerstone receives
one or both of the following: (i) a letter from Colonial\'s independent
accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid at that time to
Colonial Partnership without causing Colonial to fail to meet the REIT
Requirements or (ii) a Break-Up Fee Tax Opinion, in either of which events
Cornerstone shall pay to Colonial Partnership the unpaid Base Amount or, if
less and either there is no Break-up Fee Tax Opinion or the ruling described
in the Break-Up Fee Tax Opinion does not hold that the Base Amount either
would constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income for
purposes of the REIT Requirements, the maximum amount stated in the letter
referred to in (i) above. Subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth
in the immediately preceding sentence, there is no limitation on the number
of distributions that can be made from the escrow prior to the third
anniversary of the date of this Agreement.   The "Break-Up Expenses" payable
to Colonial Partnership or Cornerstone, as the case may be (the "Recipient"),
shall be an amount equal to the lesser of (i) $3 million or (ii) the
Recipient\'s out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including, without
limitation, all attorneys\', accountants\' and investment bankers\' fees and
expenses); provided, however that if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
(x) Section 7.1(e) and, at the time of such termination, the condition set
forth in Section 6.2(j) shall not have been satisfied, or (y) Section 7.1(l),
then (in either case) "Break-Up Expenses" shall be calculated with $7.5
million replacing $3 million as the maximum amount of the Break-Up Expenses
set forth in clause (i). If the Break-Up Expenses payable to the Recipient
exceed the maximum amount that can be paid to the Recipient without causing
the Recipient to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3)
of the Code determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute
Qualifying Income, as determined by independent accountants to the Recipient
(the "Maximum Amount"), the amount initially payable to the Recipient shall
be limited to the Maximum Amount. If, however, within the three-year period
commencing on the date of this Agreement, the Recipient receives a Break-Up
Fee Tax Opinion indicating that it has received a ruling from the IRS holding
that the Recipient\'s receipt of the Break-Up Expenses would either
constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income of the
Recipient within the meaning of the REIT Requirements or that receipt by the
Recipient of the balance of the Break-Up Expenses above the Maximum Amount
following the receipt of and pursuant to such ruling would not be deemed
constructively received prior thereto, the Recipient shall be entitled
to have payable to it the full amount of the Break-Up Expenses. The
obligation of Colonial or Cornerstone, as applicable ("Payor"), to pay any
unpaid portion of the Break-Up Expenses shall terminate three years from the
date of this Agreement. In the event   78   that the Recipient is not
able to receive the full Break-Up Expenses, the Payor shall place the unpaid
amount in escrow and shall not release any portion thereof to the Recipient
unless and until the Payor receives either one or both of the following: (i)
a letter from the independent accountants of Colonial or Cornerstone, as the
case may be, indicating the maximum amount that can be paid at that time to
the Recipient without causing it to fail to meet the REIT Requirements or
(ii) a Break-Up Expense Tax Opinion, in either of which events the Payor
shall pay to the Recipient the unpaid Break-Up Expenses or, if less and
either there is no Break-Up Expense Tax Opinion or the ruling described
in the Break-Up Expense Tax Opinion does not hold that the Base Amount either
would constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income for
purposes of the REIT Requirements, the maximum amount stated in the letter
referred to in (i) above. Subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth
in the immediately preceding sentence, there is no limitation on the number
of distributions that can be made from the escrow prior to the third
anniversary of the date of this Agreement. Colonial Partnership is an
intended third party beneficiary of this Section 7.2.   7.3 Effect of
Termination. In the event of termination of this Agreement by either
Cornerstone or Colonial as provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement shall
forthwith become void and have no effect, without any liability or obligation
on the part of Colonial, Colonial Merger Sub or Cornerstone, other than the
last sentence of Section 5.2, Section 7.2, this Section 7.3 and Article 8,
and except to the extent that such termination results from a material
breach by any party of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement.   7.4 Amendment. This Agreement may
be amended by the parties in writing by action of the respective Board of
Trustees or Board of Directors of Colonial and Cornerstone at any time before
or after any Shareholder Approvals are obtained and prior to the filing of
the Virginia Articles of Merger and Delaware Certificate of Merger; provided,
however, that, after the Shareholder Approvals are obtained, no such
amendment, modification or supplement shall be made which by law requires the
further approval of shareholders without obtaining such further approval. The
parties agree to amend this Agreement in the manner provided in the
immediately preceding sentence to the extent required to (a) continue the
status of each party as a REIT or (b) preserve the Merger as a reorganization
under Section 368(a) of the Code.   7.5 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior
to the Effective Time, the parties may (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party, (b)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other
party contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to
this Agreement or (c) subject to the proviso of Section 7.4, waive compliance
with any of the agreements or conditions of the other party contained in this
Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert
any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a
waiver of those rights.   79    ARTICLE 8   GENERAL PROVISIONS   8.1
Nonsurvival of Representations and Warranties. None of the representations
and warranties in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to
this Agreement confirming the representations and warranties in
this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time. This Section 8.1 shall not
limit any covenant or agreement of the parties which by its terms
contemplates performance after the Effective Time.   8.2 Notices. All

Agreement shall be in writing and shall be delivered personally, sent by

such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or
unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or
affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of
this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement
is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be

not impose any personal liability on any shareholder, trustee, trust manager,
director, officer, employee or agent of Colonial or Cornerstone, and all

cumulative preferential dividends payable on each Dividend Payment Date in
cash in an amount equal to the sum of (i) $47.625 per share plus (ii) if the
sum of all dividends paid on one Common Share during the preceding Dividend
Period (i.e., the Dividend Period ending on the immediately

exceeds the Common Dividend Threshold Amount (as defined below), an amount
equal to the product of (x) 50% times (y) the excess of the Prior Period
Dividends over the Common Dividend Threshold Amount times (z) the

and shall be fully cumulative from and including the Initial Dividend Accrual
Date, whether or not in any Dividend Period or Periods there shall be funds
of the Company legally available for the payment of such dividends, and shall
be payable quarterly, when, as and if declared by the Board of Trustees, in
arrears on Dividend Payment Dates, commencing on the first Dividend Payment
Date after the Issue Date. Such dividends shall be payable in arrears to the
holders of record of Series E Preferred Shares, as they appear on the share
records of the Company at the close of business on the record date, which
shall be the 15th day of the calendar month in which the applicable Dividend
Payment Date falls or such other date designated by the Board of Trustees
that is not more than 30 nor less than 10 days preceding the relevant

Periods may be declared and paid on any date and for such interim periods,

payable for the initial Dividend Period and for any Dividend Period shorter
than a full Dividend Period for the Series E Preferred Shares shall be
computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.
Holders of Series E Preferred Shares shall not be entitled to any dividends,
whether payable in cash, property or shares of stock, in excess of cumulative
dividends, as herein provided, on the Series E Preferred Shares. No interest,
or sum of money in lieu of interest, shall be payable in respect of any
dividend payment or payments on the Series E Preferred Shares that may be in
arrears.   (c) If the Company, or any of its Subsidiaries, shall, after the
Issue Date consummate a tender or exchange offer for all or any portion of
the Company\'s Common Shares that involves an aggregate consideration per
share in excess of the Market Price per Common Share as of the date
immediately preceding the date notice is first given to the public or the
holders of Common Shares of such tender or exchange offer (the "Tender Notice
Date"), then the amount of the Prior Period Dividends for the Dividend Period
ending on or after the closing date of such tender or exchange offer, shall
include an amount equal to the fair market value (to be determined in
good    faith by the Board of Directors to be the fair market value) of
the consideration paid in such tender or exchange for each share so tendered
less the Market Price per Common Share on the date immediately preceding the
Tender Notice Date.   (d) Dividends on Series E Preferred Shares will
accrue whether or not the Company has earnings, whether or not there are
funds legally available for the payment of such dividends and whether or not
such dividends are declared.   (e) If, for any taxable year, the Company
elects to designate as "capital gain dividends" (as defined in Section 857 of
the Code), any portion (the "Capital Gains Amount") of the total dividends
paid or made available for the year to holders of all classes of capital
stock (the "Total Dividends"), then the portion of the Capital Gains Amount
that shall be allocable to holders of Series E Preferred Shares shall be in
the same portion that the Total Dividends paid or made available to the
holders of Series E Preferred Shares for the year bears to the Total
Dividends.   (f) So long as any Series E Preferred Shares are outstanding,
no dividends, except as described in the immediately following sentence,
shall be declared or paid or set apart for payment on any class or series of
Parity Shares for any period unless full cumulative dividends have been
or contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient
for the payment thereof set apart for such payment on the Series E Preferred
Shares for all Dividend Periods terminating on or prior to the dividend
payment date for such class or series of Parity Shares. When dividends are
not paid in full or a sum sufficient for such payment is not set apart, as
aforesaid, all dividends declared upon Series E Preferred Shares and all
dividends declared upon any other class or series of Parity Shares shall be
declared ratably in proportion to the respective amounts of dividends
accumulated and unpaid on the Series E Preferred Shares and accumulated and
unpaid on such Parity Shares.   (g) So long as any Series E Preferred Shares
are outstanding, no dividends (other than dividends or distributions paid
solely in, or options, warrants or rights to subscribe for or purchase, Fully
Junior Shares) shall be declared or paid or set apart for payment or other
distribution declared or made upon Junior Shares or Fully Junior Shares, nor
shall any Junior Shares or Fully Junior Shares be redeemed, purchased or
otherwise acquired (other than a redemption, purchase or other acquisition of
Common Shares made for purposes of any employee incentive or benefit plan of
the Company or any subsidiary) for any consideration (or any moneys be paid
to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any such
shares) by the Company, directly or indirectly (except by conversion into or
exchange for Fully Junior Shares), unless in each case (i) the full
cumulative dividends on all outstanding Series E Preferred Shares and any
Parity Shares shall have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid or
declared and set apart for payment for all past Dividend Periods with respect
to the Series E Preferred Shares and all past dividend periods with respect
to such Parity Shares and (ii) sufficient funds shall have been
or contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and set apart for
the payment of the dividend for the current Dividend Period with respect to
the Series E Preferred Shares and the current dividend period with respect to
such Parity Shares.     (h) No dividends on Series E Preferred Shares
shall be declared by the Board of Trustees or paid or set apart for payment
by the Company at such time as the terms and provisions of any agreement of
the Company, including any agreement relating to its indebtedness, prohibits
such declaration, payment or setting apart for payment or provides that such
declaration, payment or setting apart for payment would constitute a breach
thereof or a default thereunder, or if such declaration or payment shall be
restricted or prohibited by law.   (i) For purposes of this Section 3, the
following terms shall have the meanings set forth below:   (i) "Common
Dividend Threshold Amount" shall initially mean $0.790;  provided that if the
Company shall, after the Issue Date, (A) pay a  distribution or make a
distribution on its Common Shares in Common Shares,  (B) subdivide its
outstanding Common Shares into a greater number of  Common Shares, (C)
combine its outstanding Common Shares into a smaller  number of Common Shares
or (D) issue any Common Shares by reclassification  of its Common Shares, the
Common Dividend Threshold Amount in effect (x),  in the case of any such
distribution, at the opening of business on the  day following the date fixed
for the determination of holders entitled to  receive such distribution or
(y), in the case of any such subdivision,  combination, or recapitalization,
at the opening of business on the  Business Day next following the day on
which such subdivision, combination  or reclassification becomes effective,
shall be adjusted by multiplying  (1) the Common Dividend Threshold Amount in
effect immediately prior to  such record date in the case of a distribution
or such effective date in  the case of a subdivision, combination or
reclassification by (2) the  Adjustment Factor. So long as any Series E
Preferred Shares are  outstanding, the Company shall not pay or make a
distribution on its  Common Shares in any Junior Shares, Fully Junior Shares,
Parity Shares or  any other securities, other than Common Shares. The Company
shall be  entitled, to the extent permitted by law, to make such reductions
in the  Common Dividend Threshold Amount, in addition to those set forth
above, as  it in its discretion shall determine to be advisable in order that
any  share distributions, subdivision of shares, reclassification or 
combination of shares hereafter made by the Company to its holders shall  not
be taxable. All calculations of the Common Dividend Threshold Amount  shall
be made to the nearest $0.001 (with $.0005 being rounded upward).   (ii)
"Equalization Factor" shall initially mean 60.2991; provided  that if the
Company shall, after the Issue Date, (A) pay a distribution or  make a
distribution on its Common Shares in Common Shares, (B) subdivide  its
outstanding Common Shares into a greater number of Common Shares, (C) 
combine its outstanding Common Shares into a smaller number of Common  Shares
or (D) issue any Common Shares by reclassification of its Common  Shares, the
Equalization Factor in effect (x), in the case of any such  distribution, at
the opening of business on the day following the date  fixed for the
determination of holders entitled to receive such  distribution or (y), in
the case of any such subdivision, combination, or  recapitalization, at the
opening of business on the Business Day next  following the day on which such
subdivision, combination or  reclassification becomes effective, shall be
adjusted by dividing (1) the  Equalization Factor in effect immediately prior
to such record date in the  case of a distribution or such     effective
date in the case of a subdivision, combination or  reclassification by (2)
the Adjustment Factor. All calculations of the  Equalization Factor shall be
made to the nearest .0001 (with 0.00005 being  rounded upward).   (iii)
"Adjustment Factor" shall mean the quotient obtained by  dividing (A) the
number of Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to  (x) the record
date, in the case of a distribution of Common Shares for  which an adjustment
is to be made hereunder, or (y) the effective date, in  the case of a
subdivision, combination or reclassification for which an  adjustment is to
be made hereunder, by (B) (x) in the case of any such  distribution, the sum
of the number of Common Shares outstanding  immediately prior to the record
date for such distribution plus the number  of Common Shares distributed in
such distribution or (y) in the case of  any such subdivision, combination or
reclassification, the number of  Common Shares outstanding at the opening of
business on the Business Day  next following the day on which such
subdivision, combination or  reclassification becomes effective.   Section
4. Liquidation Rights.   (a) In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, before any
payment or distribution of the assets of the Company (whether capital or
surplus) shall be made to or set apart for the holders of Junior Shares, the
holders of the Series E Preferred Shares shall be entitled to receive Two
Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($2,500.00) per Series E Preferred Share plus
an amount equal to all dividends (whether or not earned or declared) accrued
and unpaid thereon to the date of such liquidation, dissolution or winding
up, but such holders shall not be entitled to any further payment. If, upon
any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the assets of the
Company, or proceeds thereof, distributable among the holders of the Series E
Preferred Shares shall be insufficient to pay in full the preferential amount
aforesaid and liquidating payments on any other shares of any class or series
of Parity Shares, then such assets, or the proceeds thereof, shall be
distributed among the holders of the Series E Preferred Shares and any such
Parity Shares ratably in accordance with the respective amounts that would be
payable on such Series E Preferred Shares and any such Parity Shares if all
amounts payable thereon were paid in full. For the purposes of this Section
4, (i) a consolidation or merger of the Company with one or more
corporations, real estate investment trusts, or other entities and (ii) a
sale, lease or transfer of all or substantially all of the Company\'s assets
shall not be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up, voluntary
or involuntary, of the Company.   (b) Subject to the rights of the holders
of any series or class or classes of shares of beneficial interest ranking on
a parity with or prior to the Series E Preferred Shares upon liquidation,
dissolution or winding up, upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of
the Company, after payment shall have been made in full to the holders of the
Series E Preferred Shares, as provided in this Section 4, any other series or
class or classes of Junior Shares or Fully Junior Shares shall, subject to
the respective terms and provisions (if any) applying thereto, be entitled to
receive any and all assets remaining to be paid or distributed, and the
holders of the Series E Preferred Shares shall not be entitled to share
therein.     Section 5. Conversion. The Series E Preferred Shares are not
convertible into or exchangeable for any other property or securities of the
Company.   Section 6. Redemption at the Option of the Company.   (a) The
Company, at its option, may redeem the Series E Preferred Shares, in whole or
in part, at any time or from time to time, for cash at a redemption price of
Two Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($2,500.00) per Series E Preferred Share,
plus the amounts indicated in Section 6(b). If the Company, at any
time, chooses to redeem the Series E Preferred Shares, in part and not in
whole, the Company may not redeem in the aggregate more than 60,000 of the
Series E Preferred Shares without redeeming all of the Series E Preferred
Shares that are then outstanding.   (b) Upon any redemption of the Series E
Preferred Shares pursuant to this Section 6, the Company shall pay all
accrued and unpaid dividends, if any, thereon ending on or prior to the date
of such redemption (the "Call Date"), without interest. If the Call Date
falls after a dividend payment record date and prior to the corresponding
Dividend Payment Date, then each holder of Series E Preferred Shares at the
close of business on such dividend payment record date shall be entitled to
the dividend payable on such shares on the corresponding Dividend Payment
Date notwithstanding the redemption of such shares before such Dividend
Payment Date. Except as provided above, the Company shall make no payment or
allowance for unpaid dividends, whether or not in arrears, on Series E
Preferred Shares called for redemption.   (c) If full cumulative dividends
on the Series E Preferred Shares and any class or series of Parity Shares of
the Company have not been declared and paid or declared and set apart for
payment, the Series E Preferred Shares or Parity Shares may not be redeemed
under this Section 6 in part and the Company may not purchase or otherwise
acquire any Series E Preferred Shares or any Parity Shares, otherwise than
pursuant to a purchase or exchange offer made on the same terms to all
holders of Series E Preferred Shares or Parity Shares, as the case may be;
provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prevent the
redemption, purchase or acquisition of Series E Preferred Shares by the
Company in accordance with the terms of Article VI of the Charter or
otherwise in order to ensure that the Company remains qualified as a real
estate investment trust ("REIT") for United States federal income tax
purposes.   (d) Notice of the redemption of any Series E Preferred Shares
under this Section 6 shall be given by the Company by first-class mail,
postage prepaid, by the registrar to each holder of record of Series E
Preferred Shares to be redeemed at the address of each such holder as shown
on the share transfer books of the Company, not less than 30 nor more than 60
days prior to the Call Date, or by publication in a newspaper of general
circulation in the City of New York, such publication to be made once a week
for two successive weeks commencing not less than 30 nor more than 60 days
prior to the Call Date. No failure to give any notice required by this
Section 6(d), nor any defect therein or in the mailing thereof, to any
particular holder, shall affect the sufficiency of the notice or the validity
of the proceedings for redemption with respect to the other holders. Any
notice which was mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively
presumed to have been duly given on the date mailed whether or not the holder
receives the notice. Each notice shall state: (i) the Call Date, (ii) the
number of Series E Preferred Shares to be redeemed and, if fewer than all the
shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the number    of such
shares to be redeemed from such holder, (iii) the redemption price per share,
(iv) the place or places at which certificates for such shares are to
be surrendered for payment of the redemption price, and (v) that dividends on
the shares to be redeemed shall cease to accrue on such Call Date. Notice
having been given as aforesaid, from and after the Call Date, (1) dividends
on the Series E Preferred Shares so called for redemption shall cease to
accrue, (2) such Series E Preferred Shares shall no longer be deemed to be
outstanding, and (3) all rights of the holders thereof as holders of Series E
Preferred Shares of the Company (except the right to receive the cash
redemption price payable upon such redemption, without interest thereon, upon
surrender and endorsement of their certificates if so required and to receive
any dividends payable thereon) shall cease and terminate and such shares
shall not thereafter be transferred (except with the consent of the Company)
on the Company\'s books.   (e) On or before the Call Date, the Company may
elect to deposit with a bank or trust company (which may be an affiliate of
the Company) or an affiliate of a bank or trust company, the amount of cash
necessary for such redemption, in trust, with irrevocable instructions that
such cash be applied to the redemption of the Series E Preferred Shares so
called for redemption. No interest shall accrue for the benefit of the
holders of Series E Preferred Shares to be redeemed on any cash so set aside
by the Company. If the Company elects to so deposit the cash necessary for
the redemption of the called Series E Preferred Shares, any notice to the
holders of Series E Preferred Shares called for redemption required by this
Section 6(e) shall (x) specify the office of such bank or trust company as
the place of payment of the redemption price and (y) call upon such holders
to surrender the share certificates representing such shares at such place on
or about the date fixed in such notice (which shall not be later than the
Call Date) against payment of the redemption price (including all accrued and
unpaid dividends up to the Call Date). Subject to applicable escheat laws,
any cash so deposited which remains unclaimed at the end of two years from
the Call Date shall revert to the general funds of the Company, after which
reversion, again subject to applicable escheat laws, the holders of
such shares so called for redemption shall look only to the general funds of
the Company for the payment of such cash.   As promptly as practicable
after the surrender in accordance with said notice of the certificates for
any such shares so redeemed (properly endorsed or assigned for transfer, if
the Company shall so require and if the notice shall so state), such shares
shall be exchanged for any cash (without interest thereon) for which such
shares have been redeemed. If fewer than all the outstanding Series E
Preferred Shares are to be redeemed, the shares to be redeemed shall be
determined pro rata (as nearly as practicable without creating fractional
shares) or by lot or in such other equitable manner as prescribed by the
Company\'s Board of Trustees in its sole discretion to be equitable. If
fewer than all the Series E Preferred Shares represented by any certificate
are redeemed, then new certificates representing the unredeemed shares shall
be issued without cost to the holder thereof.   Section 7. Mandatory
Redemption Upon Change of Control.   (a) If a Change of Control (as defined
below) shall occur at any time after the Issue Date, the Company shall be
required to redeem all of the outstanding Series E Preferred Shares on the
date (the "Change of Control Redemption Date") that is 30 calendar days after
the date that the Company has mailed written notice of such Change of Control
to holders of the Series E    Preferred Shares as set forth in Section
7(c), subject to the conditions set forth in Section 7(e) and otherwise in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 7. If such 30th calendar day
is not a Business Day, the Change of Control Redemption Date will be the next
succeeding Business Day. The Company shall redeem the Series F Preferred
Shares in exchange for payment, in cash, of $2,500 per share plus the amounts
specified in Section 7(b).   As used herein, a "Change of Control" shall be
deemed to have occurred upon the occurrence of any of the following events
after the Issue Date:   (i) any "person" or "group" (within the meaning of
Section 13(d) of the  Exchange Act) other than the Company, its Subsidiaries
or any  employee bene?t plan of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
files  a Schedule TO, Schedule 13D or any schedule, form or report under 
the Exchange Act disclosing that such person or group has become the  direct
or indirect ultimate "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule  13d-3 under the
Exchange Act) of shares of Common Shares  representing more than 50% of the
voting power of the Common Shares  entitled to vote generally in the election
of trustees or directors;  or   (ii) consummation of any share exchange,
consolidation or merger of the  Company pursuant to which the Common Shares
will be converted into  cash, securities or other property or any sale, lease
or transfer in  one transaction or a series of transactions of all or
substantially  all of the consolidated assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries,  taken as a whole, to any Person other than the Company or one
or  more of its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that a transaction  where
the Company is the surviving entity and the holders of the  Common Shares
immediately prior to such transaction have, directly  or indirectly, more
than 50% of the aggregate voting power of the  voting stock of the Company
entitled to vote generally in the  election of trustees or directors
immediately after such event shall  not be a Change of Control; or   (iii)
the Company or a wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company shall cease  to be
the sole general partner of Colonial Realty Limited  Partnership.   (b)
Upon any redemption of the Series E Preferred Shares pursuant to this Section
7, the Company shall pay all accrued and unpaid dividends, if any, thereon
ending on or prior to the Change of Control Redemption Date,
without interest. If the Change of Control Redemption Date falls after a
dividend payment record date and prior to the corresponding Dividend Payment
Date, then each holder of Series E Preferred Shares at the close of business
on such dividend payment record date shall be entitled to the dividend
payable on such shares on the corresponding Dividend Payment Date
notwithstanding the redemption of such shares before such Dividend Payment
Date. Except as provided above, the Company shall make no payment or
allowance for unpaid dividends, whether or not in arrears, on Series E
Preferred Shares called for redemption.   (c) Notice of the occurrence of a
Change of Control and redemption of the Series E Preferred Shares under this
Section 7 shall be given by the Company by first-class mail,
postage    prepaid, by the registrar to each holder of record of Series E
Preferred Shares at the address of each such holder as shown on the share
transfer books of the Company, within 15 days after the occurrence of the
Change of Control. No failure to give any notice required by this Section
7(c), nor any defect therein or in the mailing thereof, to any particular
holder, shall affect the sufficiency of the notice or the validity of the
proceedings for redemption with respect to the other holders. Any notice
which was mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed
to have been duly given on the date mailed whether or not the holder receives
the notice. Each notice shall state: (i) the Change of Control Redemption
Date, (ii) the redemption price per share, (iii) the place or places at which
certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for payment of the
redemption price, and (iv) that dividends on the shares to be redeemed shall
cease to accrue on the Change of Control Redemption Date. Notice having been
given as aforesaid, from and after the Change of Control Redemption Date, (x)
dividends on the Series E Preferred Shares shall cease to accrue, (y) the
Series E Preferred Shares shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding, and
(z) all rights of the holders thereof as holders of Series E Preferred Shares
of the Company (except the right to receive the cash redemption price payable
upon such redemption, without interest thereon, upon surrender
and endorsement of their certificates if so required and to receive any
dividends payable thereon) shall cease and terminate and such shares shall
not thereafter be transferred (except with the consent of the Company) on the
Company\'s books.   (d) On or before the Change of Control Redemption Date,
the Company may elect to deposit with a bank or trust company (which may be
an affiliate of the Company) or an affiliate of a bank or trust company, the
amount of cash necessary for such redemption, in trust, with irrevocable
instructions that such cash be applied to the redemption of the Series E
Preferred Shares so called for redemption. No interest shall accrue for the
benefit of the holders of Series E Preferred Shares to be redeemed on any
cash so set aside by the Company. If the Company elects to so deposit the
cash necessary for the redemption of the called Series E Preferred Shares,
any notice to the holders of Series E Preferred Shares called for redemption
required by this Section 7(d) shall (x) specify the office of such bank or
trust company as the place of payment of the redemption price and (y) call
upon such holders to surrender the share certificates representing such
shares at such place on or about the date fixed in such notice (which shall
not be later than the Change of Control Redemption Date) against payment of
the redemption price (including all accrued and unpaid dividends up to the
Change of Control Redemption Date). Subject to applicable escheat laws, any
cash so deposited which remains unclaimed at the end of two years from
the Change of Control Redemption Date shall revert to the general funds of
the Company, after which reversion, again subject to applicable escheat laws,
the holders of such shares so called for redemption shall look only to the
general funds of the Company for the payment of such cash. As promptly as
practicable after the surrender in accordance with such notice of the
certificates for any Series E Preferred Shares (properly endorsed or assigned
for transfer, if the Company shall so require and if the notice shall so
state), such shares shall be exchanged for cash (without interest thereon) in
the amount of the redemption price for the applicable shares represented by
each such certificate; provided that, if the Company shall default in the
payment of the mandatory redemption amount to the holders of the Series E
Preferred Shares as set forth in this Section 7, the Series E Preferred
Shares shall be deemed to    remain outstanding and the holders of the
Series E Preferred Shares shall have all the rights provided in these
Articles until such time as such default shall no longer be outstanding.  
(e) The obligation of the Company to redeem the Series E Preferred
Shares shall be subject to the rights of any class or series of Parity Shares
or Senior Shares and compliance with the provisions of any material debt
agreement to which the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company is a party
that would prohibit such redemption or under which such redemption would
constitute an event of default. In the event that the Company shall be
prohibited from redeeming the Series E Preferred Shares for any of the
reasons set forth in the previous sentence, (i) no dividends (other than
dividends or distributions paid solely in, or options, warrants or rights to
subscribe for or purchase, Fully Junior Shares) shall be declared or paid or
set apart for payment or other distribution declared or made upon Junior
Shares or Fully Junior Shares, nor shall any Junior Shares or Fully Junior
Shares be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired (other than a redemption,
purchase or other acquisition of Common Shares made for purposes of any
employee incentive or benefit plan of the Company or any subsidiary) for any
consideration (or any moneys be paid to or made available for a sinking fund
for the redemption of any such shares) by the Company, directly or indirectly
(except by conversion into or exchange for Fully Junior Shares), in each case
until the Company shall have paid the mandatory redemption price for the
Series E Preferred Shares in full; and (ii) the Company shall be obligated to
redeem the Series E Preferred Shares on the date not later than 45 days
following the date on which it is first able to redeem the Series E Preferred
Shares by delivering a notice of such redemption in accordance with Section
7(c) within 15 days following such date, in which event the Change of Control
Redemption Date shall be the date 30 days after the date of such notice or,
if such 30th calendar day is not a Business Day, the Change of
Control Redemption Date will be the next succeeding Business Day.   (f) The
Company\'s obligation to redeem the Series E Preferred Shares under this
Section 7 shall be satisfied if a third party purchases all Series
E Preferred Shares presented for redemption in exchange for payment of
the redemption price in cash and otherwise complies with the obligations of
the Company in connection herewith.   Section 8. Shares to be Retired. If
and when approved by the Board of Trustees, all Series E Preferred Shares
which shall have been issued and reacquired in any manner by the Company
shall be restored to the status of authorized but unissued Preferred Shares
of the Company, without designation as to class or series.   Section 9.
Ranking. Any class or series of shares of beneficial interest of the Company
shall be deemed to rank:   (a) prior to the Series E Preferred Shares, as to
the payment of dividends and as to distribution of assets upon liquidation,
dissolution or winding up, if the holders of such class or series of shares
of beneficial interest shall be entitled to the receipt of dividends or of
amounts distributable upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, as the
case may be, in preference or priority to the holders of Series E Preferred
Shares;     (b) on a parity with the Series E Preferred Shares, as to the
payment of dividends and as to distribution of assets upon liquidation,
dissolution or winding up, whether or not the dividend rates, dividend
payment dates or redemption or liquidation prices per share thereof be
different from those of the Series E Preferred Shares, if the holders of such
class or series of shares of beneficial interest and the Series E Preferred
Shares shall be entitled to the receipt of dividends and of amounts
distributable upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up in proportion to
their respective amounts of accrued and unpaid dividends per share or
liquidation preferences, without preference or priority one over the other
("Parity Shares"); as of the date hereof, the Series B Preferred Shares, the
Series C Preferred Shares and the Series D Preferred Shares constitute Parity
Shares;   (c) junior to the Series E Preferred Shares, as to the payment
of dividends or as to the distribution of assets upon liquidation,
dissolution or winding up, if such shares of beneficial of interest shall be
Junior Shares; and   (d) junior to the Series E Preferred Shares, as to the
payment of dividends and as to the distribution of assets upon liquidation
dissolution or winding up, if such shares of stock shall be Fully Junior
Shares.   Section 10. Voting.   (a) If and whenever dividends on the
Series E Preferred Shares are in arrears (which shall, with respect to any
such quarterly dividend, mean that any such dividend has not been paid in
full) for six or more quarterly periods, whether or not such quarterly
periods are consecutive, the number of Trustees then constituting the Board
of Trustees shall be increased by two, and the holders of Series E Preferred
Shares, together with the holders of shares of every series of Parity Shares
upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, voting
as a single class regardless of series, shall be entitled to elect the two
additional Trustees to serve on the Board of Trustees at any annual meeting
of shareholders or special meeting held in place thereof, or at a special
meeting of the holders of the Series E Preferred Shares and such Parity
Shares called as hereinafter provided. Whenever all arrears in dividends on
the Series E Preferred Shares and such Parity Shares then outstanding
shall have been paid and dividends thereon for the current quarterly dividend
period shall have been paid or declared and set apart for payment, then the
right of the holders of the Series E Preferred Shares and such Parity Shares
to elect such additional two Trustees shall immediately cease (but subject
always to the same provision for the vesting of such voting rights in the
case of any similar future arrearages), and the terms of office of all
persons elected as Trustees by the holders of the Series E Preferred Shares
and such Parity Shares shall immediately terminate and the number of the
Board of Trustees shall be reduced accordingly. At any time after such voting
rights shall have been so vested in the holders of Series E Preferred Shares
and such Parity Shares, the secretary of the Company may, and upon the
written request of the holders of record of at least 10% of the outstanding
Series E Preferred Shares and the holders of Parity Shares (addressed to the
secretary at the principal office of the Company) shall, call a special
meeting of the holders of the Series E Preferred Shares and of such Parity
Shares for the election of the two Trustees to be elected by them as herein
provided, such call to be made by notice similar to that provided in the
Bylaws of the Company for a special meeting of the shareholders or
as required by law. The Trustees elected at any such special    meeting
shall hold office until the next annual meeting of the shareholders
or special meeting held in lieu thereof if such office shall not have
previously terminated as above provided. If any vacancy shall occur among the
Trustees elected by the holders of the Series E Preferred Shares and such
Parity Shares, a successor shall be elected by the Board of Trustees, upon
the nomination of the then-remaining Trustee elected by the holders of the
Series E Preferred Shares and such Parity Shares or the successor of such
remaining Trustee, to serve until the next annual meeting of the shareholders
or special meeting held in place thereof if such office shall not have
previously terminated as provided above.   (b) So long as any Series E
Preferred Shares remain outstanding, the Company will not, without the
affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the
Series E Preferred Shares outstanding at the time, given in person or by
proxy, either in writing or at a meeting (such series voting separately as a
class), (i) authorize or create, or increase the authorized or issued amount
of, any class or series of capital shares ranking prior to the Series E
Preferred Shares with respect to the payment of dividends or the distribution
of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up or reclassify any
authorized shares of the Company into such shares, or create, authorize
or issue any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing the right
to purchase any such shares; or (ii) amend, alter or repeal the provisions of
the Charter, including these Articles Supplementary, whether by
merger, consolidation, or transfer or conveyance of substantially all of the
Company\'s assets or otherwise (an "Event"), so as to materially and
adversely affect any right, preference, privilege or voting power of the
Series E Preferred Shares or the holders thereof; provided, however, with
respect to the occurrence of any of the Events set forth in (ii) above, that
so long as the Series E Preferred Shares remain outstanding with the terms
thereof materially unchanged, taking into account that upon the occurrence of
an Event, the Company may not be the surviving entity, the occurrence of any
such Event shall not be deemed to materially and adversely affect such
rights, preferences, privileges or voting power of holders of Series E
Preferred Shares and provided further that (x) any increase in the amount of
the authorized Preferred Shares or the creating or issuance of any other
series of Preferred Shares, or (y) any increase in the amount of authorized
Series E Preferred Shares or any other series of Preferred Shares, in each
case ranking on a parity with or junior to the Series E Preferred Shares with
respect to payment of dividends or the distribution of assets upon
liquidation, dissolution or winding up, shall not be deemed to materially and
adversely affect such rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers. The
voting provisions set forth in this paragraph (b) will not apply if, at or
prior to the time when the act with respect to which such vote
would otherwise be required shall be effected, all outstanding Series E
Preferred Shares shall have been redeemed or called for redemption and
sufficient funds shall have been deposited in trust to effect such
redemption.   (c) For purposes of the foregoing provisions of this Section
10, each Series E Preferred Share shall have one (1) vote per share. Except
as otherwise required by applicable law or as set forth herein, the Series E
Preferred Shares shall not have any relative, participating, optional or
other special voting rights and powers, and the consent of the holders
thereof shall not be required for the taking of any corporate action.  
Section 11. Record Holders. The Company and the Transfer Agent may deem and
treat the record holder of any Series E Preferred Shares as the true
and lawful owner thereof for    all purposes, and neither the Company nor
the Transfer Agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.  
Section 12. Sinking Fund. The Series E Preferred Shares shall not be entitled
to the benefits of any retirement or sinking fund.   Section 13.
Restrictions on Ownership and Transfer. The beneficial ownership and transfer
of the Series E Preferred Shares shall in all respects be subject to the
applicable provisions of Section 6.7 of the Charter.   Section 14. Listing
on New York Stock Exchange. The Company shall (i) use reasonable best
efforts, including timely submission of all required applications and filings
and payment of required fees and expenses, to cause the Series E Preferred
Shares to be approved for listing on the New York Stock Exchange, subject to
official notice of issuance, prior to the Issue Date, and (ii) use reasonable
best efforts to maintain the listing of the Series E Preferred Shares on the
New York Stock Exchange so long as any Series E Preferred Shares are
outstanding.     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused these Articles
Supplementary to be signed in its name and on its behalf by its Chief
Financial Officer as of __, 2005.   COLONIAL PROPERTIES TRUST   By:
_________________________________  Name: Weston M. Andress  Title: Executive
Vice President and  Chief Financial Officer     Exhibit D   FORM OF
NONSOLICITATION AGREEMENT   THIS NONSOLICITATION AGREEMENT (this
"AGREEMENT") is made and entered into as of ________ __, 2004 by and among
Colonial Properties Trust, an Alabama real estate investment trust
("COLONIAL") and ________________ ("[NAME]").   WHEREAS, Colonial and
Cornerstone Realty Income Trust, Inc. ("CORNERSTONE") have entered into an
Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of October 25, 2004 (the "MERGER
AGREEMENT"), pursuant to which Cornerstone will be merged with and into a
wholly owned subsidiary of Colonial ("COLONIAL MERGER SUB"), with Colonial
Merger Sub as the surviving limited liability company (the "MERGER"), upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the
Merger Agreement;   WHEREAS, [NAME] serves as [TITLE(S)] of
Cornerstone;   WHEREAS, Cornerstone and its subsidiaries (collectively,
the "CORNERSTONE ENTITIES") are engaged in the businesses of owning,
operating, investing in, constructing, managing, developing, re-developing
and leasing multifamily properties and providing various services with
respect thereto;   WHEREAS, Colonial and its subsidiaries (collectively, the
"COLONIAL ENTITIES") are engaged in, or intend to engage in following the
closing of the Merger (the "CLOSING"), substantially similar businesses;  
[WHEREAS, [NAME] is currently party to an Employment Agreement dated as of
October 1, 2001 with Cornerstone;]   WHEREAS, effective as of the Closing,
Colonial has caused [NAME] to resign in accordance with the Merger Agreement;
and   WHEREAS, in an effort to protect the legitimate business interests of
Colonial and in order to induce Colonial to enter into the Merger
Agreement, the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the parties hereto
was made a condition to the obligations of Colonial under the Merger
Agreement to consummate the Merger.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of
the foregoing and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which hereby are acknowledged, the parties hereto hereby
agree, intending to be legally bound hereby, as follows:   1.
Nonsolicitation of Employees. During the Restricted Period (as defined
below), [NAME] shall not solicit any employee of any of the Colonial Entities
or any of the Cornerstone Entities (or any successor to any of the Colonial
Entities or Cornerstone Entities or any entity through which any of
the Colonial Entities or Cornerstone Entities may conduct business in the
future) (collectively, the "COMPANIES") for the purpose of causing such
employee    to leave the employment of any of the Companies, nor shall
[NAME], directly or indirectly, hire any such employee; provided, however,
that, if (i) Colonial indicates in writing its intention to terminate the
employment of any employee of any of the Companies (i.e., with respect to all
and not less than all of such employee\'s positions at all of the Companies),
(ii) Colonial terminates the employment of any employee of any of the
Companies (i.e., with respect to all and not less than all of such
employee\'s positions at all of the Companies), or (iii) an employee
terminates his positions at all of the Companies voluntarily and not as a
result of solicitation by [NAME], then [NAME] may solicit such employee or,
directly or indirectly, hire any such employee. In addition, from and after
the date that is one year following the date hereof, [NAME] may,
after providing Colonial ten days advance written notice, solicit or hire any
employee of the Companies if such employee is the child, stepchild,
grandchild, parent, stepparent, grandparent, spouse, sibling, mother-in-law,
father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law,
niece, nephew, uncle or aunt (including adoptive relationships) of [NAME].
For purposes of this Agreement, the term "RESTRICTED PERIOD" means the period
covering twenty-four (24) months after the date of the Closing.
"SOLICITATION" shall not be deemed to include advertisements made to the
public.   2. Reasonable and Necessary Restrictions. [NAME] acknowledges
that the restrictions, prohibitions and other provisions hereof, including,
without limitation, the Restricted Period, are reasonable, fair and equitable
in terms of duration and scope, are necessary to protect the legitimate
business interests of Colonial (including the interest of Colonial in the
goodwill of the Cornerstone Entities acquired by Colonial in the Merger), and
are a material inducement to Colonial to enter into the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement.   3. Specific Performance. [NAME]
acknowledges that the obligations undertaken pursuant to this Agreement are
unique and that Colonial will have no adequate remedy at law if [NAME] fails
to perform any of his obligations hereunder. [NAME] therefore confirms that
the right of Colonial to specific performance of the terms of this Agreement
is essential to protect the rights and interests of Colonial. Accordingly, in
addition to any other remedies that Colonial may have at law or in equity,
Colonial shall have the right to have all obligations, covenants, agreements
and other provisions of this Agreement specifically performed by [NAME], and
each of Colonial shall have the right to obtain preliminary and permanent
injunctive relief to secure specific performance and to prevent a breach or
contemplated breach of this Agreement by [NAME]. Further, [NAME] submits to
the jurisdiction of the courts of the State described in Section 4(f) for
this purpose. If any litigation with respect to the obligations of the
parties under this Agreement results in a final nonappealable order of a
court of competent jurisdiction that results in a final disposition of such
litigation, the prevailing party, as determined by the court ordering such
disposition, shall be entitled to reasonable attorneys\' fees as shall be
determined by such court. Contingent or other percentage
compensation arrangements shall not be considered reasonable attorneys\'
fees.   4. Miscellaneous Provisions.   (a) Binding Effect. Subject to any
provisions hereof restricting assignment, all covenants and agreements in
this Agreement by or on behalf of any of the parties    hereto shall bind
and inure to the benefit of their respective successors, assigns, heirs, and
personal representatives.   (b) Assignment. None of the parties hereto may
assign any of his or its rights under this Agreement or attempt to have any
other individual or entity assume any of his or its obligations
hereunder.   (c) Integration; Amendment. This Agreement constitutes
the entire agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the matters
set forth herein and supersede and render of no force and effect all prior
oral or written agreements, commitments and understandings between the
parties with respect to the matters set forth herein. Except as otherwise
expressly provided in this Agreement, no amendment, modification or discharge
of this Agreement shall be valid or binding unless set forth in writing and
duly executed by each of the parties hereto.   (d) Waivers. No waiver by a
party hereto shall be effective unless made in a written instrument duly
executed by the party against whom such waiver is sought to be enforced, and
only to the extent set forth in such instrument. Neither the waiver by either
of the parties hereto of a breach or a default under any of the provisions of
this Agreement, nor the failure of either of the parties, on one or more
occasions, to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement or to exercise
any right or privilege hereunder, shall thereafter be construed as a waiver
of any subsequent breach or default of a similar nature, or as a waiver of
any such provisions, rights or privileges hereunder.   (e) Severability. The
parties agree that if fulfillment of any provision of this Agreement, at the
time such fulfillment shall be due, shall transcend the limit of validity
prescribed by law, then the court making such determination of invalidity
shall reduce such provision and shall enforce it to the maximum extent
permitted by law. The parties further agree that if any clause or provision
contained in this Agreement operates or would operate to invalidate this
Agreement, in whole or in part, then such clause or provision only shall be
held ineffective, as though not herein contained, and the remainder of this
Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect.   (f)
Governing Law; Jurisdiction. This Agreement, the rights and obligations of
the parties hereto, and any claims or disputes relating thereto, shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of
Virginia, but not including the choice-of-law rules thereof.   (g) Headings.
Section and subsection headings contained in this Agreement are inserted for
convenience of reference only, shall not be deemed to be a part of this
Agreement for any purpose, and shall not in any way define or affect the
meaning, construction or scope of any of the provisions hereof.   (h)
Pronouns. All pronouns and any variations thereof shall be deemed to refer to
the masculine, feminine, neuter, singular or plural, as the identity of the
individual or entity may require.     (i) Execution in Counterparts. To
facilitate execution, this Agreement may be executed in as many counterparts
as may be required. It shall not be necessary that the signature of or on
behalf of each party appears on each counterpart, but it shall be sufficient
that the signature of or on behalf of each party appears on one or more of
the counterparts. All counterparts shall collectively constitute a single
agreement.   (j) Notices. All notices called for under this Agreement
shall be in writing and shall be deemed given upon receipt if delivered
personally and followed promptly by mail, or if mailed by registered or
certified mail (return receipt requested), postage prepaid, or if sent by
facsimile and followed promptly by mail, to Colonial at the following address
