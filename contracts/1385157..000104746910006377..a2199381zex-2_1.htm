 Section 2.01. _ The Offer._ (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with Section 11.01 and nothing shall have occurred that, had the Offer been commenced, would give rise to a right to terminate the Offer pursuant to any of the conditions set forth in Annex I hereto (the "Offer Conditions") (other than the conditions set forth in clause (i) and subclause (E) of clause (ii)), as promptly as practicable after the date hereof, but in no event later than 10 Business Days following the date of this Agreement, Merger Subsidiary shall, and Parent shall cause it to, commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the 1934 Act) the Offer , to purchase any and all outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, including the associated preferred stock purchase rights (the "Company Rights") issued pursuant to the Amended and Restated Rights Agreement dated as of May 9, 2007 between the Company and Computershare Investor Services, LLC, as rights agent (the "Company Rights Agreement"), for so long as such Company Rights are outstanding (each such share of Company Common Stock, together with its associated Company Right, a "Share", and collectively, the "Shares") at a price per share equal to the Offer Price. The Offer shall be subject to the Offer Conditions. The date on which Merger Subsidiary commences the Offer within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the 1934 Act is referred to as the "Offer Commencement Date". 

  

 (b) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and to the satisfaction or waiver of the Offer Conditions, Merger Subsidiary shall, and Parent shall cause it to, promptly after the expiration of the Offer, accept for payment all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer (the time at which Shares are first accepted for payment under the Offer, the "Acceptance Time"). The obligation of Merger Subsidiary to accept for payment Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be subject only to the satisfaction or waiver of each of the Offer Conditions (and shall not be subject to any other conditions). Promptly after the Acceptance Time, Merger Subsidiary shall pay the Offer Price for such Shares. 

  

 (c) Parent and Merger Subsidiary expressly reserve the right to waive any of the Offer Conditions and to make any change in the terms of or conditions to the Offer, including raising the Offer Price; 

         
  

 _provided_ that, without the prior written consent of the Company, neither
Parent nor Merger Subsidiary shall:

  

  

 (i) waive or change the Minimum Condition (as defined in Annex I); 

  

 (ii) decrease the Offer Price; 

  

 (iii) change the form of consideration to be paid in the Offer; 

  

 (iv) decrease the number of shares of Company Common Stock sought to be purchased by Merger Subsidiary in the Offer; 

  

 (v) extend or otherwise change the expiration date of the Offer except as otherwise provided herein; or 

  

 (vi) otherwise amend, modify or supplement any of the Offer Conditions or terms of the Offer in a manner that adversely affects, or would reasonably be expected to adversely affect, the holders of Shares. 

  

  

 (d) Unless extended as provided in this Agreement, the Offer shall expire on the date that is 20 Business Days (calculated as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the 1934 Act) after the Offer Commencement Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) Merger Subsidiary shall, and Parent shall cause it to, extend the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or the staff thereof or Nasdaq applicable to the Offer or for any period otherwise required by Applicable Law and (ii) if, on the initial expiration date or any subsequent date as of which the Offer is scheduled to expire, any Offer Condition is not satisfied and has not been waived, then Merger Subsidiary shall, and Parent shall cause it to, extend the Offer for one or more periods ending no later than the End Date to permit such Offer Condition to be satisfied ( _provided_ , _however_ , that, if all of the Offer Conditions other than the Minimum Tender Condition and those that by their nature are to be satisfied at the expiration of the Offer have been satisfied or waived, Merger Subsidiary shall have the right, but not the obligation, to terminate the Offer 60 days after the date on which all of the Offer Conditions other than the Minimum Tender Condition and those that by their nature are to be satisfied at the expiration of the Offer have been satisfied or, to the extent permissible, have been waived by Merger Subsidiary). Following expiration of the Offer, Merger Subsidiary may, in its sole discretion, provide a subsequent offering period ("Subsequent Offering Period") in accordance with Rule 14d-11 of the 1934 Act if, immediately following the Acceptance Time, Parent, Merger Subsidiary and their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates beneficially own less than 90% of the Shares outstanding at that time (which Shares beneficially owned shall include Shares tendered in the Offer and not withdrawn). Merger Subsidiary shall, and Parent shall cause it to, immediately accept for payment and promptly pay for all Shares as they are validly tendered during such Subsequent Offering Period and in any event in compliance with Rule 14d-11 and Rule 14e-1(c) promulgated under the 1934 Act. The Offer may be terminated prior to its expiration date (as such expiration date may be extended and re-extended in accordance with this Section 2.01(d)), but only if this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with Article 11\. 

  

 (e) As soon as practicable on the Offer Commencement Date, Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall (i) file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments and supplements thereto and including exhibits thereto, the "Schedule TO") that shall include the summary term sheet required thereby and, as exhibits, the Offer to Purchase, a form of letter of transmittal, a form of summary advertisement and any schedule or form required to be filed pursuant to the instructions to Schedule TO (collectively, together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the "Offer Documents"); (ii) timely file with the Commissioner of Commerce of the State of Minnesota any registration statement relating to the Offer required to be filed pursuant to Chapter 80B of the Minnesota Statutes (the "Minnesota Registration Statement"); and (iii) cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares to the extent required by Applicable Law (including the 1934 Act) and, by means of inclusion in the Offer Documents, shall disseminate to the

Offer shall be conducted in compliance with the 1934 Act.

  

 (f) Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall cause the Offer Documents to (i) comply with the applicable requirements of the 1934 Act and (ii) not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; _provided_ , _however_ , no covenant is made by Parent or Merger Subsidiary with respect to information supplied by the Company for inclusion in the Offer Documents. Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall cause the information supplied by Parent and its Affiliates specifically for inclusion in the Company\'s Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") or the information statement containing the information required by Section 14(f) of the 1934 Act and Rule 14(f)-1 promulgated thereunder (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the "Information Statement"), at the respective times the Schedule 14D-9 or the Information Statement are filed with the SEC not to contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each of Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the Company agrees promptly to correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become (or shall have become known to be) false or misleading in any material respect. Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall cause the Schedule TO as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and the Offer Documents as so corrected to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case to the extent required by Applicable Law (including the 1934 Act). The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents each time before any such document is filed with the SEC, and Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by the Company and its counsel. Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall provide the Company and its counsel with (i) any comments or other communications, whether written or oral, that Parent, Merger Subsidiary or their counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule TO or Offer Documents promptly after receipt of those comments or other communications and (ii) a reasonable opportunity to participate in the response of Parent and Merger Subsidiary to those comments and to provide comments on that response (to which reasonable and good faith consideration shall be given), including by participating with Parent and Merger Subsidiary or their counsel in any discussions or meetings with the SEC. Each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall respond as promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents or the Offer. 

   

 (g) Parent shall cause to be provided to Merger Subsidiary all of the funds necessary to purchase any Shares that Merger Subsidiary becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer (including pursuant to any Subsequent Offering Period), and shall cause Merger Subsidiary to perform, on a timely basis, all of Merger Subsidiary\'s obligations under this Agreement. 

  

 (h) Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall promptly file with the Commissioner of Commerce of the State of Minnesota all materials referred to in Section 80B.04 of the Minnesota Statutes. 

  

 Section 2.02. _ Company Action._ (a) The Company hereby consents to the Offer and represents that the board of directors of the Company (the "Board of Directors"), at a meeting duly called and held has unanimously (i) determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, are fair to and in the best interests of the Company\'s shareholders, (ii) approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, and the plan of merger (as such term is used in Section 302A.611 of the MBCA) (the "Plan of Merger"), each in accordance with the requirements of the MBCA and (iii) resolved, subject to its right to withdraw, modify or amend such recommendation pursuant to Section 7.04(b)(ii), to 

        
  

recommend acceptance of the Offer and, if required by Applicable Law,
approval of the Merger and adoption of the Plan of Merger by its shareholders
(such recommendation, the "Company Board Recommendation"). The Company has
been advised that all of its directors and executive officers who own Shares
intend to tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer. The Company shall
promptly furnish Parent with a list of its shareholders, mailing labels and
any available listing or computer file containing the names and addresses
of all record holders of Shares and lists of securities positions of Shares
held in stock depositories, in each case true and correct as of the most
recent practicable date, and shall provide to Parent such additional
information (including updated lists of shareholders, mailing labels and lists
of securities positions) and such other assistance as Parent may reasonably
request in connection with the Offer. Except for such steps as are necessary
to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to
consummate the Merger, Parent, Merger Subsidiary and their
Affiliates, associates, agents and advisors, shall keep such information
confidential and use the information contained in any such labels, listings
and files only in connection with the Offer and the Merger and, should the
Offer terminate or if this Agreement shall be terminated, will deliver to the
Company all copies of such information then in their possession.

  

 (b) As soon as practicable on the Offer Commencement Date, the Company shall file with the SEC and disseminate to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by Applicable Law (including the 1934 Act), the Schedule 14D-9 that, subject to its right to withdraw, modify or amend such recommendation pursuant to Section 7.04(b)(ii), shall reflect the Company Board Recommendation. The Company shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to (i) comply with the applicable requirements of the 1934 Act and (ii) not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; _provided_ , _however_ , no covenant is made by the Company with respect to information supplied by Parent or Merger Subsidiary for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9 (including any such information included in the Information Statement). The Company shall cause the information supplied by it specifically for inclusion in the Offer Documents, at the respective times the Offer Documents are filed with the SEC, not to contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Subsidiary agrees promptly to correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 (including the Information Statement) if and to the extent that it shall have become (or shall have become known to be) false or misleading in any material respect. The Company shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case to the extent required by Applicable Law (including the 1934 Act). Parent, Merger Subsidiary and their counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 each time before it is filed with the SEC, and the Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by Parent, Merger Subsidiary and their counsel. The Company shall provide Parent, Merger Subsidiary and their counsel with (i) any comments or other communications, whether written or oral, that the Company or its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of those comments or other communications and (ii) a reasonable opportunity to participate in the Company\'s response to those comments and to provide comments on that response (to which reasonable and good faith consideration shall be given), including by participating with the Company or its counsel in any discussions or meetings with the SEC. The Company shall respond as promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9. 

  

 (c) The Company shall promptly file with the Commissioner of Commerce of the State of Minnesota all materials referred to in Section 80B.04 of the Minnesota Statutes. 

   

 Section 2.03. _ Directors._ (a) Effective upon the Acceptance Time, Parent shall be entitled to designate the number of directors, rounded to the nearest whole number, on the Board of Directors 

        
  

that equals the product of (i) the total number of directors on the Board of
Directors (giving effect to the election of any additional directors pursuant
to this Section) and (ii) the percentage that the number of Shares
beneficially owned by Parent and/or Merger Subsidiary (including Shares
accepted for payment) bears to the total number of shares of Company Common
Stock outstanding determined on a Fully Diluted basis, and the Company shall
cause Parent\'s designees to be elected or appointed to the Board of
Directors, including by increasing the number of directors and seeking and
accepting resignations of incumbent directors, _provided_ , _however_ , that,
prior to the Effective Time (as hereinafter defined), the Board of Directors
shall always have at least three Continuing Directors. At such time, the
Company shall also cause individuals designated by Parent to constitute the
number of members, rounded to the nearest whole number, on (A) each committee
of the Board of Directors and (B) as requested by Parent, each board of
directors of each Subsidiary of the Company (and each committee thereof) that
represents the same percentage as such individuals represent on the Board of
Directors, in each case to the extent permitted by Applicable Law and the
rules of Nasdaq. Any and all members of the Board of Directors immediately
prior to the Acceptance Time who remain on the Board of Directors after such
designation by Parent pursuant to this Section 2.03(a) shall be referred to
as "Continuing Directors".

  

 (b) In the event that, prior to the Effective Time, the number of Continuing Directors shall be reduced below three for any reason whatsoever, the remaining Continuing Directors (or Continuing Director, if there is only one remaining) shall be entitled to designate any other Person(s) who shall not be an Affiliate, shareholder or employee of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to fill such vacancies and such Person(s) shall be deemed to be Continuing Director(s) for purposes of this Agreement. In the event that, prior to the Effective Time, no Continuing Director then remains, the other directors shall designate three Persons who shall not be Affiliates, shareholders or employees of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to fill such vacancies and such Persons shall be deemed to be Continuing Directors for purposes of this Agreement. 

  

 (c) The Company\'s obligations to appoint Parent\'s designees to the Board of Directors shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the 1934 Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all actions, and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to the Company and its officers and directors, as Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 require in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section 2.03, so long as Parent shall have timely provided to the Company all information with respect to Parent and its designees, officers, directors and Affiliates required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder. Parent shall supply to the Company in writing and be solely responsible for any information with respect to itself and its nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1. 

  

 (d) Following the election or appointment of Parent\'s designees pursuant to Section 2.03(a) and until the Effective Time, the approval of a majority of the Continuing Directors shall be required to authorize (and such authorization shall constitute the authorization of the Board of Directors and no other action on the part of the Company, including any action by any other director of the Company, shall be required to authorize): (i) any termination of this Agreement by the Company, (ii) any amendment of this Agreement requiring action by the Board of Directors, (iii) any extension of time for performance of any obligation or action hereunder by Parent or Merger Subsidiary, (iv) any waiver of compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein for the benefit of the Company, and (v) any other consent, action or recommendation by the Company or the Board of Directors with respect to this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger or any other transaction contemplated thereby or in connection therewith. The Continuing Directors shall have the authority to retain such counsel (which may include current counsel to the Company) and other advisors at the expense of the Company as determined appropriate by the Continuing Directors and shall have the authority to institute any action on behalf of the Company to enforce the performance of this Agreement. 

        

 Section 2.04. _ Top-Up Option._ (a) Subject to Section 2.04(b) and Section 2.04(c), the Company grants to Merger Subsidiary, an irrevocable option, for so long as this Agreement has not been terminated pursuant to the provisions hereof (the "Top-Up Option"), to purchase from the Company, up to the number of authorized and unissued shares of Company Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock that, when added to the number of Shares owned by Merger Subsidiary at the time of the exercise of the Top-Up Option, constitutes at least one Share more than 90% of the Shares that would be outstanding immediately after the issuance of all shares of Company Common Stock to be issued upon exercise of the Top-Up Option (such Shares to be issued upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, the "Top-Up Shares"). 

  

 (b) The Top-Up Option may be exercised by Merger Subsidiary in whole or in part, only once, at any time during the five-Business Day period following the Acceptance Time, or if any Subsequent Offering Period is provided, during the five-Business Day period following the expiration date of such Subsequent Offering Period, and only if Merger Subsidiary shall own as of such time less than 90% of the shares of Company Common Stock outstanding; _provided_ that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable (i) to the extent the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Top-Up Option would exceed the number of authorized but unissued and unreserved shares of Company Common Stock (ii) if any judgment, injunction, order or decree shall prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the delivery of the Top-Up Shares, and (iii) unless Parent or Merger Subsidiary has accepted for payment and paid for all Shares validly tendered in the Offer and not withdrawn. The Top-Up Option shall terminate upon the earlier to occur of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article 11\. The aggregate purchase price payable for the Top-Up Shares being purchased by Merger Subsidiary pursuant to the Top-Up Option shall be determined by multiplying the number of such Top-Up Shares by the Offer Price, without interest. Such purchase price may be paid by Merger Subsidiary, at its election, either (A) entirely in cash or (B) by paying in cash an amount equal to not less than the aggregate par value of such Top-Up Shares and by executing and delivering to the Company a promissory note having a principal amount equal to the balance of such purchase price. Any such promissory note shall bear interest at the rate of 3% per annum, shall mature on the first anniversary of the date of execution and delivery of such promissory note and may be prepaid without premium or penalty. Without the prior written consent of the Company, the right to exercise the Top-Up Option granted pursuant to this Agreement shall not be assigned by Merger Subsidiary except to any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent. Any attempted assignment in violation of this Section 2.04(b) shall be null and void. 

  

 (c) In the event Merger Subsidiary wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Merger Subsidiary shall deliver to the Company written notice (the "Top-Up Notice") setting forth (i) the number of Top-Up Shares that Merger Subsidiary intends to purchase pursuant to the Top-Up Option, (ii) the manner in which Merger Subsidiary intends to pay the applicable purchase price and (iii) the place and time at which the closing of the purchase of such Top-Up Shares by Merger Subsidiary is to take place. The Top-Up Notice shall also include an undertaking signed by Parent and Merger Subsidiary that, promptly following such exercise of the Top-Up Option, Merger Subsidiary intends to (and Merger Subsidiary shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Subsidiary to, promptly after such exercise) consummate the Merger in accordance with Section 302A.621 of the MBCA as contemplated by Section 9.05. At the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Shares, Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall cause to be delivered to the Company the consideration required to be delivered in exchange for the Top-Up Shares, and the Company shall cause to be issued to Merger Subsidiary a certificate representing the Top-Up Shares. The parties hereto agree to use their reasonable best efforts to cause the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Shares to occur on the same day that the Top-Up Notice is deemed received by the Company pursuant to Section 12.01, and if not so consummated on such day, as promptly thereafter as possible. The parties further agree to use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to be consummated in accordance with Section 302A.621 of the MBCA as contemplated by Section 9.05 as close in time as possible to (including, to the extent possible, on the same day as) the issuance of the Top-Up Shares. 

       

                                    

    

  (d) Parent and Merger Subsidiary understand that the Top-Up Shares
will not be registered under the 1933 Act and will be issued in reliance upon
an exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering.
Each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary represents, warrants and agrees that the
Top-Up Option is being, and the Top-Up Shares will be, acquired by Merger
Subsidiary for the purpose of investment and not with a view to or for resale
in connection with any distribution thereof within the meaning of the 1933
Act. Any certificates evidencing Top-Up Shares shall include any legends
required by applicable securities laws.

  

 (e) Any dilutive impact on the value of the Shares as a result of the issuance of the Top-Up Shares will not be taken into account in any determination of the fair value of any dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 302A.473 of the MBCA as contemplated by Section 3.04. 

  

    
ARTICLE 3 
THE MERGER 

  

 Section 3.01. _ The Merger._ (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and in accordance with the MBCA, at the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall be merged with and into the Company, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation"). 

   

 (b) Subject to the provisions of Article 10, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place in Minneapolis, Minnesota at the offices of Dorsey and Whitney LLP as soon as possible, but in any event no later than two Business Days after the date the conditions set forth in Article 10 (other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permissible, waiver of those conditions at the Closing) have been satisfied or, to the extent permissible, waived by the party or parties entitled to the benefit of such conditions, or at such other place, at such other time or on such other date as Parent and the Company may mutually agree. 

  

 (c) At the Closing, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall file articles of merger meeting the requirements of Section 302A.615 of the MBCA with the Minnesota Secretary of State. The Merger shall become effective at such time (the "Effective Time") as the articles of merger are duly filed with the Minnesota Secretary of State (or at such later time as may be mutually agreed upon by Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the Company and specified in the articles of merger). 

  

 (d) The Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 302A.641 of the MBCA. 

   

 Section 3.02. _ Conversion of Shares._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the Company or any holder of the capital stock thereof: 

  

 (a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 3.02(b), Section 3.02(c) or Section 3.04, each Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price in cash, without interest (the "Merger Consideration"). As of the Effective Time, all such Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration. 

  

 (b) Each Share held by the Company or owned by Parent or Merger Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto. 

  

 (c) Each Share held by any Subsidiary of either the Company or Parent (other than the Merger Subsidiary) immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into such number of shares of stock of the Surviving Corporation such that each such Subsidiary owns the same percentage of the outstanding capital stock of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective Time as such Subsidiary owned in the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

        

 (d) Each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.20 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 Section 3.03. _ Surrender and Payment._ (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company or similar entity reasonably acceptable to the Company which is authorized to exercise corporate trust or stock powers to act as Exchange Agent in the Merger (the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose of exchanging for the Merger Consideration (i) certificates representing Shares (the "Certificates") or (ii) uncertificated Shares (the "Uncertificated Shares"). At the Effective Time, Parent shall provide the Exchange Agent funds representing the aggregate Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Certificates and the Uncertificated Shares pursuant to Section 3.02(a) (the "Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Agent shall cause the Exchange Fund to be (i) held for the benefit of the holders of Shares and (ii) promptly applied to making the payments provided for in Section 3.02(a). The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose that is not provided for herein. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, in direct obligations of the United States of America, obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide for the payment of all principal and interest, or as otherwise directed by Parent. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be kept in the Exchange Fund. To the extent that there are losses with respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make prompt payments of the Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby, Parent shall promptly replace or restore the portion of the Exchange Fund lost through investments or other events so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make such payments. 

  

 (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of Shares at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange. Each holder of Shares that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agent\'s message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration payable for each Share represented by a Certificate or for each Uncertificated Share. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive the Merger Consideration. 

  

 (c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or, in the case of Uncertificated Shares, that such documentation as may be reasonably requested by the Exchange Agent is provided and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. 

  

 (d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article 3\. 

        

 (e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 3.03(a) (and any interest or other income earned thereon) that remains unclaimed by the holders of Shares one year after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged such Shares for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 3.03 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of such Shares without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any holder of Shares for any amount paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares immediately prior to the time when such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the property of Parent, free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

   

 (f) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 3.03(a) to pay for Shares for which rights to receive payment of the fair value of such Shares have been perfected shall be returned to Parent, upon demand. 

  

 Section 3.04. _ Dissenting Shares._ Notwithstanding Section 3.02, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger and who has properly exercised dissenters\' rights with respect thereto in accordance with Section 302A.473 of the MBCA shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and holders of such Shares will instead be entitled to receive payment of the fair value of such Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 302A.471 and Section 302A.473 of the MBCA, unless such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses the right to the payment of the fair value of such Shares under the MBCA. If, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses the right to payment under Section 302A.473 of the MBCA, such Shares shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company pursuant to Section 302A.473 of the MBCA, and Parent, at Parent\'s expense, shall have the right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands, so long as Parent does not create obligations for the Company effective prior to the Effective Time. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands. 

  

 Section 3.05. _ Company Stock Options._ (a) At the Acceptance Time, each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock outstanding under any Company Stock Plan (each a "Company Stock Option"), to the extent such Company Stock Option is not already fully vested, shall fully vest if and as provided under the terms of the applicable option award agreement. At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option shall be assumed by Parent. Each Company Stock Option so assumed by Parent under this Agreement will continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth in the applicable Company Stock Option (including any Company Stock Plan under which such Company Stock Option was issued and any applicable stock option agreement or other document evidencing such Company Stock Option) immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that (i) each Company Stock Option will be exercisable for that number of whole shares of Parent common stock equal to the product of (X) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (Y) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Offer Price and the denominator of which shall be the volume weighted average trading price per share of Parent common stock on the New York Stock Exchange (or in the event that Parent common stock is no longer listed for trading on such exchange, then the senior stock exchange on which the Parent common stock is then-listed) for the 10 trading days immediately preceding the Effective Time (the "Conversion Ratio"), rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent common stock and (ii) the per share exercise price for the shares of Parent common stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed Company Stock Option will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of such 

        
  

Company Stock Option by the Conversion Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole
cent; _provided_ that the number of shares of Parent common stock
and exercise price applicable under each assumed Company Stock Option will be
determined in a manner that would not result in Parent\'s assumption of the
options being treated as a new grant of stock options under Section 409A of
the Code. As of the Effective Time, all references in the Company Stock Plans
to shares of Company Common Stock shall thereafter be deemed to be references
to Parent common stock and all references therein to the Company shall
thereafter be deemed to be references to Parent. As soon as reasonably
practicable following the Effective Time, but in no event later than five
Business Days following the Effective Time, Parent shall file a registration
statement under the 1933 Act on Form S-8 or another appropriate form (and use
its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness thereof and
maintain the current status of the prospectuses contained therein) with
respect to Company Stock Options assumed by Parent pursuant hereto and shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement
to remain in effect for so long as such assumed Company Stock Option shall
remain outstanding.

  

 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall make any amendments to the terms of such Company Stock Plan or the agreement pursuant to which Company Stock Options were granted that are necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by Section 3.05(a).

Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and Parent shall cause it to, fulfill its obligations pursuant to Section 4.11 of the indenture governing the terms of the Company 2013 Notes, Section 4.09 of the indenture governing the terms of the Company 2015 Notes and Section 4.09 of the indenture governing the terms of the Company 2017 Notes to execute a supplemental indenture with respect to the Company 2013 Notes, the Company 2015 Notes and the Company 2017 Notes, respectively. 

  

 (b) The Company acknowledges that Parent is considering commencing prior to the Effective Time tender offers to purchase the Company Convertible Notes. Any such tender offer shall be conditioned upon consummation of the Offer. 

  

 Section 3.07. _ Adjustments._ If, during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding Shares shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class (including by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares of Company Common Stock, or stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period, but excluding any change that results from any exercise of Company Stock Options or the vesting and settlement in the form of shares of Stock Plan Awards (as defined in Section 5.05), in each case, outstanding as of the date hereof, conversion of the Company Convertible Notes or the exercise of the Top-Up Option to purchase the Top-Up Shares), the Offer Price, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted. 

  

 Section 3.08. _ Withholding Rights._ Notwithstanding any provision contained herein to the contrary, each of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to Article 2 and Article 3 such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of Applicable Law relating to Taxes and shall timely pay such withholding amount over to the appropriate taxing authority. If the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, so withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this 

        
  

Agreement as having been paid to such Person in respect of which the Exchange
Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, made such
deduction and withholding.

  

 Section 3.09. _ Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Shares represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this Article 3\.

 (i) All contributions and payments accrued under each Employee Plan, determined in accordance with prior funding and accrual practices, as adjusted to include proportional accruals for the period ending as of the date hereof, have been discharged and paid on or prior to the date hereof except to the extent reflected as a liability on the Company Balance Sheet.

Nothing in this Section 7.03 shall require the Company to provide any access, or to disclose any information (i) if permitting such access or disclosing such information would violate Applicable Law (including antitrust and privacy laws) or (ii) protected by attorney/client privilege to the extent such privilege cannot be protected by the Company through the exercise of its reasonable efforts. 

       

                                    

    

  Section 7.04. _ No Solicitation; Other Offers._ (a) After the
date hereof and prior to the earlier of the termination of this Agreement and
the Acceptance Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not (and the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its or any of its
Subsidiaries\' officers or directors, investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants, consultants or other agents or advisors (collectively,
"Representatives") not to), directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or

(iii) fail to make, withdraw, modify or amend in a manner adverse to Parent
the Company Board Recommendation (or recommend an Acquisition Proposal or
knowingly take any action or make any statement inconsistent with the Company
Board Recommendation) (any of the foregoing in this clause (iii), an "Adverse
Recommendation Change"), (iv) grant any waiver or release under any standstill
or similar agreement with respect to any class of equity securities of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or under the Company Rights Agreement, (v)

(vi) approve any transaction under, or any Person becoming an
"interested shareholder" under, Section 302A.673 of the MBCA or (vii) enter
into any agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or other similar
instrument relating to an Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality
agreement with a Person to whom the Company is permitted to provide
information in accordance with Section 7.04(b)). It is agreed that any
violation of the restrictions on the Company set forth in this Section by any
Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be a breach of
this Section by the Company.

  

 (b) Notwithstanding Section 7.04(a), at any time prior to the Acceptance Time: 

  

  

 (i) the Company, directly or indirectly through its Representatives, may (A) engage in negotiations or discussions with any Person and its Representatives that, subject to the Company\'s compliance with Section 7.04(a), has made after the date of this Agreement a _bona fide_ , written Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors reasonably believes is or will lead to a Superior Proposal and (B) furnish to such Person or its Representatives non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality agreement (a copy of which shall be provided for informational purposes only to Parent) with such Person with terms no less favorable to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, if, in the case of either clause (A) or (B), the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action is reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law; _provided_ that (1) such confidentiality agreement may contain a less restrictive or no standstill restriction, in which case the Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed to be amended to contain only such less restrictive provision, or to omit such provision, as applicable, and (2) all such information provided or made available to such Person (to the extent that such information has not been previously provided or made available to Parent) is provided or made available to Parent, as the case may be, substantially concurrent with the time it is provided or made available to such other Person; and 

  

 (ii) subject to compliance with Section 7.04(e), the Board of Directors may make an Adverse Recommendation Change if the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel (and a financial advisor, in the case of clause (A)), that (A) an Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and the failure to take such action is reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law or (B) in the absence of an Acquisition Proposal, due to material events or changes in circumstances after the date hereof that were neither known to nor reasonably foreseeable by the Company as of or prior 

  

      

  
  

to the date hereof, the failure to take such action is reasonably likely to
result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law.

  

  

 In addition, nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to the Company\'s shareholders a position with respect to a tender offer by a third party pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the 1934 Act or from making such disclosure to the Company\'s shareholders which, in the judgment of the Board of Directors, after receiving advice of outside counsel, may be required under Applicable Law (it being agreed that the issuance by the Company or the Board of Directors of a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its position, as contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the 1934 Act shall not constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change). The furnishing of information or engaging in discussions or negotiations by the Company in accordance with Section 7.04(b)(i) shall not, by themselves, constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change. 

  

 (c) For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means a _bona fide_ , unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_ that, for the purposes of this definition references to "25%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed replaced with reference to "50%") that the Board of Directors determines in good faith by a majority vote, after considering the advice of a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel, would result in a transaction more favorable, from a financial point of view, to the Company\'s shareholders than the transactions provided hereunder (taking into account, among other things, (i) all the terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal, including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to consummation, the likelihood of consummation without undue delay relative to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, if such Acquisition Proposal involves any financing, the likelihood of obtaining such financing and the terms on which such financing may be secured and (ii) any, _bona fide_ , written proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement delivered to the Company prior to the termination of this Agreement). 

   

 (d) The Company shall notify Parent in writing within one Business Day after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, any inquiry or meaningful communication with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, or request for access to the properties, books or records of the Company or any Subsidiary by any Person that informs the Board of Directors or such Subsidiary that it is considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal. The written notice shall include the material terms of the Acquisition Proposal or such inquiry, communication or request (including the identity of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, communication or request), and, if in writing, shall include a copy of such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, communication or request. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed of any material changes with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, communication or request and will provide Parent as soon as reasonably practicable (but in no event later than two Business Days) after receipt thereof copies of all correspondence and other written material sent or provided to the Company from any Person in connection therewith. 

  

 (e) The Board of Directors shall not make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Superior Proposal or exercise its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.01(d)(ii) unless: (i) the Company has promptly notified Parent in writing that the Board of Directors has determined that an Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal or that the Board of Directors intends to make an Adverse Recommendation Change in connection with such Superior Proposal, (ii) such notice (the "Superior Proposal Notice") specifies in reasonable detail (A) the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal, (B) the identity of the Person making such Superior Proposal and (C) if applicable, the terms and conditions of any proposed agreement relating to such Superior Proposal, and (iii) a period commencing on the date that the Superior Proposal Notice is deemed to be received by Parent in accordance with Section 12.01 and ending at 5:00 p.m., Central Time, on the third Business Day thereafter (such three-Business Day period, the "Notice Period") has elapsed and the Company has not received from Parent a written proposal to amend the terms of this Agreement 

        
  

that the Board of Directors determines in good faith by a majority vote,
after considering the advice of a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation and outside legal counsel, to be at least as favorable, from a
financial point of view, to the Company\'s shareholders than the transactions
described in the Superior Proposal Notice. It is understood and agreed that,
upon the expiration of a Notice Period, if the Company has not received from
Parent a written proposal to amend the terms of this Agreement that the Board
of Directors determines in good faith by a majority vote, after considering
the advice of a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and
outside legal counsel, to be at least as favorable, from a financial point of
view, to the Company\'s shareholders than the transactions described in the
Superior Proposal Notice, the Company shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 11.01(d)(ii) at any time.

  

 (f) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Person and its Representatives conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall promptly request that each Person, if any, that has executed a confidentiality agreement within the 24-month period prior to the date hereof in connection with its consideration of any Acquisition Proposal return or destroy all confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (and all analyses and other materials prepared by or on behalf of such Person that contains, reflects or analyzes that information) and that such Person provide a certificate of such return or destruction to the Company (it being agreed, however, that the Company\'s obligations pursuant to this sentence shall be limited to, and subject to the terms and conditions of, such confidentiality agreement). The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to secure all such certifications, to the extent it is entitled to such certifications under the terms of the relevant confidentiality agreement, as promptly as practicable. 

  

 Section 7.05. _ Section 16 Matters._ Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of shares of Company Common Stock in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including derivative securities of such shares) by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the 1934 Act with respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the 1934 Act. 

  

 Section 7.06. _ Compensation Arrangements._ Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company (acting through its Compensation Committee) will take all steps that may be necessary or advisable to cause each Compensation Arrangement entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on or after the date hereof to be approved by the Compensation Committee (comprised solely of "independent directors" determined in the manner described in the last sentence of Section 5.17(m)) as an "employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the 1934 Act and to satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d) of the 1934 Act. 

   

 Section 7.07. _ Stock Exchange De-listing._ After the Acceptance Time, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under Applicable Law and rules and policies of the Nasdaq to enable the de-listing by the Surviving Corporation of the Company Stock from the Nasdaq and the deregistration of the Company Stock under the 1934 Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, and in any event no more than 10 days thereafter. 

   

 Section 7.08. _ Takeover Statutes._ The Company shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, use its reasonable best efforts (a) to take all actions necessary so that no "control share acquisition," "fair price," "moratorium" or other antitakeover or similar statute or regulation becomes applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b) if any such antitakeover or similar statute or regulation becomes applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to take all actions necessary so that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly 

        
  

as practicable on the terms contemplated herein and otherwise to take all
such other actions as are reasonably necessary to eliminate or minimize the
effects of any such statute or regulation on the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 Section 8.03. _ Director and Officer Liability._ Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation hereby agrees, to do the following: 

  

 (a) For six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless the present and former officers and directors of the Company (each, an "Indemnified Person") in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time to the fullest extent permitted by the MBCA or any other Applicable Law, subject to any provisions in the Company\'s articles of incorporation and bylaws in effect on the date hereof; _provided_ that such indemnification shall be subject to any limitation imposed from time to time under Applicable Law. 

  

 (b) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect provisions in the Surviving Corporation\'s articles of incorporation and bylaws (or in such documents of any successor to the business of the Surviving Corporation) regarding elimination of liability of directors, indemnification of officers, directors and employees and advancement of expenses that are no less advantageous to the intended beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions in existence on the date of this Agreement. 

  

 (c) For the six-year period commencing at the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect, and fully pay the premium for, the non-cancellable extension of the directors\' and officers\' liability coverage of the Company\'s existing directors\' and officers\' insurance policies and the Company\'s existing fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, "DandO Insurance"), in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time with respect to any claim related to any period or time at or prior to the Effective Time, with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided under the Company\'s existing policies; _provided_ that, in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such policies pursuant to this sentence an annual premium amount in excess of 175% of the amount per annum the Company paid in its last full fiscal year, which amount is set forth in Section 8.03(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule; and _provided further_ that, if the aggregate premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount. 

  

 (d) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that 

        
  

the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 8.03.

  

 (e) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 8.03 shall be in addition to any rights such Person may have under the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, under the MBCA or any other Applicable Law or under any agreement of any Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. These rights shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person. 

   

 Section 8.04. _ Employee Matters._ (a) For a period of one year following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide to all employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time who continue employment with the Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates ("Continuing Employees") base salary or base wages and benefits (excluding, for this purpose, equity-based compensation) that is, in the aggregate, substantially comparable to such salary or wages and benefits provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (b) With respect to any "employee benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, in which any Continuing Employee becomes a participant, such Continuing Employee shall receive full credit (for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting, and benefit level with respect to vacation entitlement, severance benefits and other paid time off) for service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or predecessor employers to the extent the Company provides such past service credit) to the same extent that such service was recognized as of the Effective Date under a comparable plan of the Company and its Subsidiaries in which the Continuing Employee participated. 

  

 (c) Parent shall waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods under any welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in which the Continuing Employees (and their eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time, except to the extent that such pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods would not have been satisfied or waived under the comparable plan of the Company and its Subsidiaries in which the Continuing Employee participated. If a Continuing Employee commences participation in any health benefit plan of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries after the commencement of a calendar year, to the extent commercially practicable, Parent shall cause such plan to recognize the dollar amount of all co-payments, deductibles and similar expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) during such calendar year for purposes of satisfying such calendar year\'s deductible and co-payment limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which such Continuing Employee (and dependents) commences participation. 

  

 (d) Nothing in this Section 8.04 shall (i) be treated as an amendment of, or undertaking to amend, any benefit plan, (ii) prohibit Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, from amending any employee benefit plan or (iii) confer any rights or benefits on any person other than the parties to this Agreement.
