<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject
to the provisions of Article&nbsp;10, the closing of the Merger (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Closing</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") shall take place in
Minneapolis, Minnesota at the offices of Dorsey&nbsp;&amp; Whitney&nbsp;LLP as soon as possible, but in any event no later than two Business Days after the date the conditions set forth in

Closing) have been satisfied or, to the extent permissible, waived by the party or parties entitled to the benefit of such conditions, or at such other place, at such other time or on such other date

or trust company or similar entity reasonably acceptable to the Company which is authorized to exercise corporate trust or stock powers to act as Exchange Agent in the Merger (the

Section&nbsp;3.02(a) (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Exchange Fund</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"). The Exchange Agent shall cause the Exchange Fund to be (i)&nbsp;held for the benefit of the holders of
Shares and (ii)&nbsp;promptly applied to making the payments provided for in Section&nbsp;3.02(a). The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose that is not provided for herein. The Exchange
Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, in direct obligations of the United States of America, obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States of America is
pledged to provide for the payment of all principal and interest, or as otherwise directed by Parent. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be kept in the Exchange Fund.
To the extent that there are losses with respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make prompt payments of the Merger Consideration as
contemplated hereby, Parent shall promptly replace or restore the portion of the Exchange Fund lost through investments or other events so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is, at all times,
maintained at a level sufficient to make such payments. </FONT></P>

and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares
to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange. Each holder of Shares that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon
(i)&nbsp;surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or (ii)&nbsp;receipt of an "agent's message" by the Exchange Agent (or such
other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration payable for each
Share represented by a Certificate or for each Uncertificated Share. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent after the
Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive the Merger Consideration. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated

Uncertificated Shares, that such documentation as may be reasonably requested by the Exchange Agent is provided and (ii)&nbsp;the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any
transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange
Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After

("</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Continuing Employees</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") base salary or base wages and benefits (excluding, for this purpose, equity-based compensation) that is, in the aggregate,

Corporation, in which any Continuing Employee becomes a participant, such Continuing Employee shall receive full credit (for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting, and benefit level with
respect to vacation entitlement, severance benefits and other paid time off) for service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or predecessor employers to the extent the Company provides such
past service credit) to the same extent that such service was recognized as of the Effective Date under a comparable plan of the Company and its Subsidiaries in which the Continuing Employee
participated. </FONT></P>

and after the Effective Time, except to the extent that such pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods would
not have been satisfied or waived under the comparable plan of the Company and its Subsidiaries in which the Continuing Employee participated. If a Continuing Employee commences participation in any
health benefit plan of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries after the commencement of a calendar year, to the extent commercially practicable, Parent shall cause such plan to recognize the dollar amount
of all co-payments, deductibles and similar expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) during such calendar year for purposes of satisfying such
calendar year's deductible and co-payment limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which such Continuing Employee (and dependents) commences participation. </FONT></P>
