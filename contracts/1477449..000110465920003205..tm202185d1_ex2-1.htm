Article II. _ 
 EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK_

  



  

2.1   _Treatment of Capital Stock in the First Merger_. At the First
Effective Time, by virtue of the First Merger and without any action on the
part of Parent, Merger Sub 1, the Company or any Stockholder:

  



  

(a)   _Effect on Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective
Time that is held by a Stockholder who is an Accredited Investor, other than
shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)_
or Dissenting Shares, shall be converted into the right to receive the Per
Share Mixed Consideration upon surrender in accordance with _Section 2.3_.
Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the First Effective Time that is held by a Stockholder who is not an
Accredited Investor, other than shares of Company Common Stock to be
cancelled pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)_ or Dissenting Shares, shall be
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration upon
surrender in accordance with _Section 2.3_. As of the First Effective
Time, all shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive the Per Share Mixed
Consideration or the Per Share Cash Consideration, as applicable, to be paid
in accordance with _Section 2.3_.

  



  

(b)   _Cancellation of Certain Company Capital Stock_. Each
issued and outstanding share of Company Capital Stock held by the Company as
treasury stock or held directly by Parent, the Merger Subs or a Subsidiary of
the Company, in each case, immediately prior to the First Effective Time,
shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration or payment shall be delivered in exchange therefor or in
respect thereof.

  



  

(c)   _Effect on Merger Sub 1 Common Stock_. At the First
Effective Time, each share of the common stock, par value $0.001 per share,
of Merger Sub 1 issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First
Effective Time shall automatically be converted into and become one fully
paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the First Surviving
Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock
of the First Surviving Corporation.

  

   

4

 



    



  

(d)   _No Interest_. No interest will be paid or accrued, and no
Stockholder shall be entitled to receive, any interest upon surrender of any
Company Common Stock.

  



  

(e)  The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the purpose
and intent of this _Section 2.1_ is to allocate the consideration payable
under this Agreement in accordance with the terms of the Company's
Organizational Documents. Accordingly, if any Company Preferred Stock has not
converted to Company Common Stock prior to the First Effective Time, then at
the First Effective Time the shares of Company Preferred Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time shall be
converted into the right to receive consideration in accordance with the
Company's Organizational Documents (subject to _Section 2.3(a)_ ), and the
remaining consideration shall be allocated, after payment to such holders of
Company Preferred Stock in accordance therewith, as otherwise set forth in
this Agreement.

  



  

2.2   _Treatment of Capital Stock in the Second Merger_. At the
Second Effective Time, by virtue of the Second Merger and without any action
on the part of any of Parent, Merger Sub 2 or the First Surviving Corporation,
(a) each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Merger Sub 2
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Second Effective Time shall
automatically be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable
share of common stock of the Second Surviving Corporation and
shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Second
Surviving Corporation and (b) each share of common stock of the First
Surviving Corporation issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Second
Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist and
no consideration or payment shall be delivered in exchange therefor or in
respect thereof.

  



  

2.3   _Payment for Securities_.

  



  

(a)   _Accredited Investor Certifications_. The Company
acknowledges and agrees that the shares of Parent Stock to be issued as
consideration in the First Merger will not be registered under the Securities
Act and will be issued in reliance upon an exemption from registration
thereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, a
Stockholder shall be entitled to receive shares of Parent Stock in connection
with the First Merger only if such Stockholder delivers a duly completed and
validly executed accredited investor questionnaire in the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit E_ (an " _Accredited Investor Certification_ ") no later
than ninety (90) days following the date of this Agreement, or such later date
as Parent and the Company may jointly agree (the " _Accredited Investor
Certification Deadline_ ") demonstrating that such Stockholder is an
accredited investor within the meaning of SEC Rule 501(a) of Regulation D, as
presently in effect, under the Securities Act. In furtherance of
the foregoing, as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement
(but in any event within two (2) Business Days), the Company shall mail or
otherwise deliver to each Stockholder an Accredited Investor Certification,
and shall also mail or otherwise deliver to any Person that subsequently
becomes a Stockholder an Accredited Investor Certification after such initial
mailing. The Company shall deliver to Parent any completed Accredited
Investor Certifications that are delivered to the Company by a Stockholder.
Parent shall have the right to review, and make all final reasonable
determinations regarding, all Accredited Investor Certifications.

  



  

(b) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the First Effective Time, Parent
shall engage a reputable bank, trust or administrator company
reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the paying agent for purposes
of effecting the payment of the consideration in connection with the First
Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ "). Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, the
fees and expenses of the Paying Agent.

  



  

   

5

 



    



  

(c)   _Procedures for Surrender_.

  



  

(i)   _Certificates_. As soon as practicable after the First
Effective Time (and in no event later than two (2) Business Days after the
First Effective Time), Parent and the Second Surviving Corporation shall cause
the Paying Agent to mail or otherwise deliver to each Person that was,
immediately prior to the First Effective Time, a holder of record of Company
Capital Stock represented by certificates (the " _Certificates_ "), which
shares of Company Capital Stock were converted into the right to receive the
consideration set forth in _Section 2.1_ at the First Effective Time, a letter
of transmittal substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit F_ (a "
_Letter of Transmittal_ ") and instructions for effecting the surrender of
the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as
provided in _Section 2.3(g)_ and, if required, an indemnification agreement)
in exchange for payment of the consideration set forth in _Section 2.1_.
Following the First Effective Time, upon surrender of a Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in _Section
2.3(g)_ and, if required, an indemnification agreement) to the Paying Agent,
and delivery of a Letter of Transmittal, in accordance with the terms of such
Letter of Transmittal, duly executed and in proper form, with respect to such
Certificate, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the consideration set forth in _Section 2.1_ for each
share of Company Capital Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, and
any Certificate so surrendered shall be cancelled. If payment of such
consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
any surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent
of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer, and the Person requesting
such payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by
reason of the payment of the consideration to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered and shall have
established to the satisfaction of Parent and the Second Surviving Corporation
that such Taxes either have been paid or are not required to be paid. Until
surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the First Effective Time to represent only the right to receive
the consideration set forth in _Section 2.1_ , except for
Certificates representing Dissenting Shares, which shall be treated in
accordance with _Section 2.4_. No payment shall be made with respect to any
Certificates until the surrender of such Certificates (or affidavits of loss
in lieu of such Certificates) for exchange together with a properly completed
and duly executed Letter of Transmittal.

  



  

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares._ Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, no holder of non-certificated shares
of Company Capital Stock represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ")
shall be required to deliver a Certificate. As soon as practicable after the
First Effective Time (and in no event later than two (2) Business Days
after the First Effective Time), Parent and the Second Surviving Corporation
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail or otherwise deliver to each Person that
was, immediately prior to the First Effective Time, a holder of record of
Book-Entry Shares, which Book-Entry Shares were converted into the right to
receive the consideration set forth in _Section 2.1_ at the First Effective
Time, a Letter of Transmittal and instructions for returning such Letter of
Transmittal in exchange for the consideration set forth in _Section 2.1_.
Following the First Effective Time, upon delivery of such Letter
of Transmittal, in accordance with the terms of such Letter of Transmittal,
duly executed and in proper form, the holder of such Book-Entry Shares shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the consideration set forth in
_Section 2.1_ for each Book-Entry Share. Payment of consideration with
respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name
such Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered as contemplated
hereby, each Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the First
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the consideration set
forth in _Section 2.1_ , except for Book-Entry Shares representing Dissenting
Shares, which shall be treated in accordance with _Section 2.4_. No payment
shall be made with respect to any Book-Entry Share until the delivery of a
properly completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal.

  



  

   

6

 



    



  

(d)   _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company
Capital Stock_. At the First Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed and no transfer of shares of Company Capital Stock
shall thereafter be made. If, after the First Effective Time, Certificates
are presented to the First Surviving Corporation or the Second Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided
in this Agreement. From and after the First Effective Time, each holder of
shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the First
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights as a stockholder of the
Company, except as expressly provided in this Agreement.

  



  

(e)   _Termination of Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability_.
Any portion of the funds (including any interest received with respect
thereto) and shares of Parent Stock made available to the Paying Agent that
remains unclaimed by the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the
first anniversary of the First Effective Time will be returned to the Second
Surviving Corporation or an Affiliate thereof designated by the Second
Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any such holder who has not tendered
its Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the consideration set forth in
_Section 2.1_ in accordance with this _Section 2.3_  prior to such time shall
thereafter look only to the Second Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Laws) for delivery of such consideration,
without interest, in respect of such holder's surrender of their
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in compliance with the procedures in this
_Section 2.3_. Any consideration remaining unclaimed by the holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares immediately prior to such time as such
amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental
Authority will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property
of the Second Surviving Corporation or an Affiliate thereof designated by the
Second Surviving Corporation, free and clear of any claim or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of
Parent, the Merger Subs, the First Surviving Corporation, the Second
Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or their respective Affiliates will be
liable to any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for consideration
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law. Any portion of the consideration made
available to the Paying Agent to pay for shares of Company Capital Stock for
which appraisal rights have been perfected shall be returned to the Second
Surviving Corporation or an Affiliate thereof designated by the Second
Surviving Corporation upon demand.

(f)   _No Fractional Shares_. No certificates representing
fractional shares of Parent Stock shall be issued in connection with the
First Merger and fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof
to any rights of a shareholder of Parent.

  



  

(g)   _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event
that any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying
Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the
consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.1_. Parent or
the Paying Agent may, in their reasonable discretion and as a condition
precedent to the payment of such consideration, require the owner of any
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate to deliver an indemnification agreement
in such form and containing such substance reasonably acceptable to Parent or
the Paying Agent, as applicable, indemnifying Parent and/or the Paying Agent
against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Second Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

  



  

2.4   _Dissenting Shares_.

  



  

(a)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary
(but subject to the provisions of this _Section 2.4_ ), shares of Company
Capital Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective
Time and held by a Stockholder who is entitled to demand and has properly
demanded appraisal for such shares of Company Capital Stock in accordance
with, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL or other
similar rights (if any) under applicable Law (such shares of Company Capital
Stock, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or represent a
right to receive a portion of the consideration set forth in _Section 2.1_.
At the First Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares shall be cancelled
and cease to exist, and the holders of Dissenting Shares shall only be
entitled to the rights granted to them under Section 262 of the DGCL or other
applicable Law (if any). If any such holder fails to perfect or otherwise
waives, withdraws or loses such holder's right to appraisal under Section 262
of the DGCL or such other applicable Law, then such Dissenting Shares shall be
deemed to have been converted, as of the First Effective Time, into, and
shall represent only, the right to receive (upon surrender in accordance with
_Section 2.3_ ) the consideration set forth in _Section 2.1_ , without
interest.

  



  

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall give Parent
(i) prompt notice of any written demand for appraisal received by the Company
pursuant to the applicable provisions of the DGCL (and of any similar demand
purportedly made under other applicable Law) and (ii) the opportunity to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any such
demands or offer to settle or settle any such demands other than as required
by Law or pursuant to a final court order. Prior to the Closing Date, any
written communication to be made by the Company to any holder of
Company Capital Stock with respect to such demands shall be submitted to
Parent in advance and the Company shall consider in good faith any input from
Parent with regards to such written communication. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, to the extent that Parent, the Second Surviving Corporation or the
Company makes any payment or payments in respect of any Dissenting Shares
in excess of the consideration that otherwise would have been payable in
respect of such shares in accordance with _Section 2.1_ (" _Excess Dissenting
Share Payments_ "), Parent shall be entitled to recover the amount of
such Excess Dissenting Share Payments in accordance with the terms of
_Article VII_ hereof.

2.5   _Treatment of Company Options._

  



  

(a)  Except as may otherwise be agreed in a written agreement by
and between a holder of a Company Option set forth on _Schedule 2.5(a)_ and
Parent (any such Company Option subject to such agreement, an "
_Excluded Option_ "), at the First Effective Time, (i) each In-the-Money
Option (or portion thereof) that is outstanding (whether vested or unvested)
as of immediately prior to the First Effective Time shall be cancelled and
converted as of the First Effective Time into the right to receive an amount
in cash equal to the product of (x) the excess of the cash value of the Per
Share Mixed Consideration (using the Closing Parent Stock Price for purposes
of calculating the cash value of the number of shares of Parent Stock under
clause (b) of the definition of "Per Share Mixed Consideration") over the
exercise price per share of such In-the-Money Option, and (y) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock then subject to such In-the-Money Option,
to be paid in accordance with _Section 2.5(b)_ and (ii) each Company Option
that is neither an In-the-Money Option nor an Excluded Option will be
cancelled and forfeited for no consideration.

  



  

(b)   From and after the First Effective Time, the former holder
of any Company Option that is not an Excluded Option shall have no further
rights with respect to such Company Options, other than the right to receive
payment in accordance with _Section 2.5(a)_. No later than Parent's second
ordinary payroll payment date after the Closing, Parent shall cause to be
paid to each former holder of Company Options (other than an Excluded Option)
the cash consideration to be paid to such former holder of such Company
Option pursuant to _Section 2.5(a)_ (if any) as set forth on the Closing
Consideration Schedule, which shall be paid through the payroll system of
Parent or its Affiliate subject to applicable Tax withholding.

  



  

(c)  Prior to the First Effective Time, the Board of Directors
of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt
appropriate resolutions and take all other actions reasonably necessary or
appropriate (including sending any required notices) to effect the
transactions described in this _Section 2.5_ , and to ensure that, following
the First Effective Time, no former holder of a Company Option (other than an
Excluded Option) shall have any right to acquire any Company Capital Stock or
to receive any payment, right or benefit with respect to any award previously
granted under the Company Equity Plans, except the right to receive a payment
with respect thereto as provided in this _Section 2.5_ (if any).

  



  

2.6   _Estimated Cash Consideration Amount; Closing Consideration
Schedule_.

  



  

(a) At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing, the
Company shall deliver to Parent a statement (the  " _Estimated Closing
Certificate_ "), which shall be certified as to the Company's good
faith preparation and calculation by an officer of the Company, and which
shall set forth (i) the Company's good faith estimate, along with reasonable
supporting detail to evidence the Company's calculations, of (A) the
Transaction Expenses (the " _Estimated Transaction Expenses_ "), and (B) the
Closing Indebtedness (the " _Estimated Closing Indebtedness_ "), (ii) based
thereon, the calculation of the Estimated Cash Consideration Amount and
(iii) invoices and wire instructions for payment of the Estimated Transaction
Expenses. For purposes of this Agreement, the  " _Estimated Cash
Consideration Amount_ " means an amount equal to (1) $150,000,000; _minus_ (2)
the Estimated Transaction Expenses; _minus_ (3) the Estimated Closing
Indebtedness; _minus_ (4) the Escrow Amount _minus_  (5) the Expense Fund
Amount _minus_ (6) the aggregate amount of the Second Interim Payment and any
Additional Interim Payments. The Estimated Cash Consideration Amount shall be
subject to adjustment as set forth in _Section 2.8_. The Company shall
consider in good faith, and update the Estimated Closing Certificate to
reflect, any comments by Parent on such Estimated Closing Certificate.

  



  

   

9

 



    



  

(b)  At least one (1) Business Day prior to the Closing, the
Company shall deliver to Parent a schedule (the " _Closing Consideration
Schedule_ "), which shall set forth all of the following, in each case
calculated in accordance with this Agreement:

  



  

(i)  the Fully Diluted Share Number and the Aggregate Exercise
Amount;

  



  

(ii)  all Stockholders and their respective addresses and email
addresses (if available), the number of shares of Company Common Stock held
by each Stockholder as of immediately prior to the First Effective Time
(including their respective Certificate numbers, if applicable) and the
aggregate consideration to be paid to each Stockholder pursuant to _Section
2.1_ hereof, including the cash amount and number of shares of Parent Stock
(which shall be rounded to the nearest share of Parent Stock) to be
delivered to each Stockholder who is an Accredited Investor or the cash
amount to be delivered to each Stockholder who is not an Accredited Investor;

  



  

(iii)  all Optionholders and their respective addresses, along with
(A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying each Company
Option held by such Optionholder, in each case, as of the Closing, (B) the
exercise price per share of each such Company Option, and (C) the Company's
calculation of the consideration, if any, to be paid to such Optionholder in
respect of each Company Option (other than an Excluded Option) held by such
Optionholder pursuant to _Section 2.5(a)_ ; and

  



  

(iv)  the Pro Rata Share of each Company Equityholder.

  



  

(c)  To the extent the Closing Consideration Schedule specifies
with respect to a Stockholder the cash amount and/or shares of Parent Stock
to be received in respect of particular shares of Company Common Stock held by
such Stockholder, the parties agree to treat such specification as part of
the terms of the Mergers for purposes of Treasury Regulations Section
1.356-1(b).

  



  

2.7   _Deductions for Escrows and Expense Fund_.

  



  

(a) In order to at least partially satisfy, and to establish a
procedure for the satisfaction of, amounts owed to the Parent Indemnitees
pursuant to _Article VII_ hereof, pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, Parent
shall deposit with a reputable escrow agent reasonably acceptable to Parent
and the Equityholder Representative (the " _Escrow Agent_ ") in an escrow
account established by the Escrow Agent (the " _Indemnity Escrow Account_
") Six Million Dollars ($6,000,000) on the Closing Date (the " _Indemnity
Escrow Amount_ "). The timing and methodology for the release of the
Indemnity Escrow Amount shall be governed by the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that each of Parent and the Equityholder Representative agrees
that it will act in good faith and cooperate with one another to execute and
deliver such joint written instructions, including with respect to any
distributions of the Indemnity Escrow Funds, to the Escrow Agent as are
required to implement the intent of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.
Within three (3) Business Days after the twelve (12) month anniversary of the
Closing Date, Parent and the Equityholder Representative shall jointly
instruct the Escrow Agent to deliver to the Paying Agent, for further
distribution to the Stockholders, and Parent or an Affiliate of Parent, for
further distribution to the Optionholders through the payroll system of
Parent or its Affiliate subject to applicable Tax withholding, the remaining
Indemnity Escrow Funds minus the Pending Claims Amount. In the event of a
distribution of any Indemnity Escrow Funds to the Company Equityholders, each
Company Equityholder shall be entitled to receive its Pro Rata Share of such
distribution as set forth with respect to such Company Equityholder on the
Closing Consideration Schedule.

  



  

   

10

 



    



  

(b)  To the extent any portion of the amounts owed pursuant to
the matter set forth on _Section 10.1(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule (the "
_Earnout Matter_ ") has not been finally determined or paid by the Company
Group prior to the Closing (as reasonably agreed by Parent and the Company),
in order establish a procedure for the satisfaction of such amounts
pursuant to _Article VII_ , pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, Parent shall
deposit with the Escrow Agent in a separate escrow account established by the
Escrow Agent (the " _Earnout Escrow Account_ ") Two Million Dollars
($2,000,000) on the Closing Date (the " _Earnout Escrow Amount_ "). The
timing and methodology for the release of the Earnout Escrow Amount shall be
governed by the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that each of
Parent and the Equityholder Representative agrees that it will act in good
faith and cooperate with one another to execute and deliver such joint
written instructions, including with respect to any distributions of the
Earnout Escrow Amount, to the Escrow Agent as are required to implement the
intent of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. Within three (3) Business
Days after the final resolution of the Earnout Matter, Parent and the
Equityholder Representative shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to
deliver (i) to Parent, an amount of the Earnout Escrow Amount (if any) equal
to the amount payable to the Parent Indemnitees pursuant to _Article VII_ in
respect of the Earnout Matter, and (ii) to the Paying Agent, for further
distribution to the Stockholders, and Parent or an Affiliate of Parent, for
further distribution to the Optionholders through the payroll system of
Parent or its Affiliate subject to applicable Tax withholding, the remaining
amount of the Earnout Escrow Amount (if any). In the event of a distribution
of any Earnout Escrow Amount to the Company Equityholders, each Company
Equityholder shall be entitled to receive its Pro Rata Share of such
distribution as set forth with respect to such Company Equityholder on the
Closing Consideration Schedule.

  



  

(c) To the extent the matter described in _Section 7.2(a)(ix)_
of the Disclosure Schedule (the " _Special Indemnity Matter_ ") has not been
finally resolved by the Company Group prior to the Closing (as reasonably
agreed by Parent and the Company), in order to satisfy, and to establish a
procedure for the satisfaction of, amounts owed to the Parent Indemnitees
with respect to such matter pursuant to _Article VII_ , pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement, Parent shall deposit with the Escrow Agent in a separate escrow
account established by the Escrow Agent (the " _Special Indemnity Escrow
Account_ ") One Million Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($1,250,000) on the
Closing Date (the  " _Special Indemnity Escrow Amount_ "). The timing and
methodology for the release of the Special Indemnity Escrow Amount shall be
governed by the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that each of
Parent and the Equityholder Representative agrees that it will act in good
faith and cooperate with one another to execute and deliver such joint written
instructions, including with respect to any distributions of the Special
Indemnity Escrow Funds, to the Escrow Agent as are required to implement the
intent of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. Within three (3) Business
Days after the settlement of or final judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction with respect to the Special Indemnity Matter, Parent and the
Equityholder Representative shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to
deliver (i) to Parent, an amount of the Special Indemnity Escrow Amount equal
to the amount payable to the Parent Indemnitees pursuant to _Article VII_ in
respect of the Special Indemnity Matter, and (ii) to the Paying Agent, for
further distribution to the Stockholders, and Parent or an Affiliate of
Parent, for further distribution to the Optionholders through the payroll
system of Parent or its Affiliate subject to applicable Tax withholding, the
remaining amount of the Special Indemnity Escrow Amount (if any). In the event
of a distribution of any Special Indemnity Escrow Funds to the Company
Equityholders, each Company Equityholder shall be entitled to receive its
Pro Rata Share of such distribution as set forth with respect to such Company
Equityholder on the Closing Consideration Schedule.

  



  

   

11

 



    



  

(d)  Parent shall deposit with the Equityholder Representative
in an account established by the Equityholder Representative $Three Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($300,000) (the " _Expense Fund Amount_ ") on the Closing
Date, which will be used for the purposes of paying directly, or reimbursing
the Equityholder Representative for, any Equityholder Representative Expenses
incurred pursuant to this Agreement and the agreements ancillary hereto. The
Equityholder Representative is not providing any investment supervision,
recommendations or advice and shall have no responsibility or liability for
any loss of principal of the Expense Fund Amount other than as a result of
its gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Equityholder Representative is
not acting as a withholding agent or in any similar capacity in connection
with the Expense Fund Amount, and has no tax reporting or income
distribution obligations. The Company Equityholders will not receive any
interest on the Expense Fund Amount and assign to the
Equityholder Representative any such interest. Subject to the Advisory
Group's approval, the Equityholder Representative may contribute funds to the
Expense Fund Amount from any consideration otherwise distributable to the
Company Equityholders. As soon as practicable following the completion of the
Equityholder Representative's responsibilities, the Equityholder
Representative will deliver any remaining balance of the Expense Fund Amount
to the Paying Agent (if released together with payment of the final Escrow
Amount) for further distribution to the Stockholders, and Parent or an
Affiliate of Parent, for further distribution to the Optionholders through
the payroll system of Parent or its Affiliate subject to applicable Tax
withholding. In the event of a distribution of any Expense Fund Amount to the
Company Equityholders, each Company Equityholder shall be entitled to receive
its Pro Rata Share of such distribution as set forth with respect to such
Company Equityholder on the Closing Consideration Schedule. None of
Parent, the Company or the Second Surviving Corporation or their respective
Affiliates shall have any liability or responsibility to the Company
Equityholders with respect to the Expense Fund Amount. For tax purposes, the
Expense Fund Amount will be treated as having been received and voluntarily
set aside by the Company Equityholders at the time of Closing.

  



  

   

12

 



    



  

2.8   _Post-Closing Adjustments to the Estimated Cash Consideration
Amount_.

  



  

(a)  As promptly as practicable, but no later than ninety (90)
days following the Closing Date, Parent will prepare and deliver to the
Equityholder Representative a statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") setting
forth Parent's good faith calculation of the Cash Impact Amount.

  



  

(b)  During the forty-five (45) days after delivery of the
Closing Statement, Parent will provide the Equityholder Representative and
its accountants reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon
reasonable notice, to (x) review the financial books and records of the
Company, any of the Company's accountants' work papers related to the
calculation of amounts in the Closing Statement (subject to the execution of
any access letters that such accountants may require in connection with
the review of such work papers), and (y) the employees and other
representatives of Parent and the Company who were responsible for the
preparation of the Closing Statement to respond to questions relating to the
preparation of the Closing Statement and the calculation of the items
thereon, in each case solely to allow the Equityholder Representative to
determine the accuracy of Parent's calculation of the items set forth on the
Closing Statement. Neither Parent nor the Company shall have any obligation to
provide information or access to information, materials or persons if doing
so would reasonably be expected to (i) result in the waiver of any attorney-
client privilege, work product doctrine or other privilege applicable to such
documents or information or the disclosure of any trade secrets, (ii) violate
any Law, or (iii) violate the terms of any applicable Contract to which Parent
or the Company or any of their Affiliates is party; _provided_ that, Parent
or the Company, as applicable, shall, to the extent permissible, provide the
Equityholder Representative with a reasonably detailed description of the
information not provided and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
design and implement alternative disclosure arrangements to enable the
Equityholder Representative to evaluate any such information without
jeopardizing such privilege or violating such Law or Contract. If the
Equityholder Representative disagrees with any of Parent's calculations set
forth in the Closing Statement, the Equityholder Representative may,
within forty-five (45) days after delivery of the Closing Statement, deliver
a written notice (the " _Objection Notice_ ") to Parent disagreeing with such
calculations, which notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for
such disagreement based on the provisions of this Agreement. Any Objection
Notice shall specify those items or amounts with which the
Equityholder Representative disagrees, together with a detailed written
explanation of the reasons for disagreement with each such item or
amount, and shall set forth the Equityholder Representative's calculation,
based on such objections, of the Cash Impact Amount. To the extent not set
forth in the Objection Notice, the Equityholder Representative shall be deemed
to have agreed with Parent's calculation of all other items and amounts
contained in the Closing Statement and such amounts shall be final and binding
on the parties. If the Equityholder Representative does not deliver an
Objection Notice within such forty-five-day period, then the amounts set
forth in the Closing Statement shall be deemed to be final and binding on the
parties.

  



  

   

13

 



    



  

(c) If an Objection Notice is timely delivered pursuant to
_Section 2.8(b)_ , the Equityholder Representative and Parent shall, during
the thirty (30) days following such delivery, use their commercially
reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the value of the disputed items or
amounts. If, during such period, the Equityholder Representative and Parent
are unable to reach agreement on all disputed items, they shall promptly
thereafter mutually engage and submit such dispute to an independent
accounting firm of national recognition reasonably acceptable to both Parent
and Equityholder Representative (the  " _Independent Accounting Firm_ ") for
final and binding resolution. The Independent Accounting Firm (i)
shall consider only those items or amounts disputed by the Equityholder
Representative in the Objection Notice which remain in dispute; (ii) shall
not assign a value to any item or amount in dispute greater than the greatest
value for such item or amount assigned by the Equityholder Representative, on
the one hand, or Parent, on the other hand, or less than the smallest value
for such item or amount assigned by the Equityholder Representative, on the
one hand, or Parent, on the other hand; and (iii) shall act as an expert and
not as an arbitrator and make its determination based on the guidelines and
procedures set forth in this Agreement (i.e., not on the basis of independent
review). The Equityholder Representative and Parent shall cause the
Independent Accounting Firm to deliver to the Equityholder Representative and
Parent as promptly as practicable (but in any event within thirty (30) days
of its retention) a written report setting forth its determination of the
amounts in dispute. Such report shall be final and binding on the parties.
The cost of such review and report shall be borne (and paid) by the
Equityholder Representative (on behalf of the Company Equityholders), on the
one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, based on the percentage which the
portion of the contested amount not awarded to each party bears to the
amount actually contested by such party. For example, if closing accounts
receivable is the only disputed item, and Parent claims that closing accounts
receivable is $1,000 less than the amount determined by the Equityholder
Representative, and the Equityholder Representative contests only $500 of the
amount claimed by Parent, and if the independent accountant ultimately
resolves the dispute by awarding Parent $300 of the $500 contested, then the
cost of such review and report will be allocated 60% (i.e., 300 ÷ 500) to the
Equityholder Representative and 40% (i.e., 200 ÷ 500) to Parent.

  



  



  

(d)  If the Cash Impact Amount, as finally determined pursuant
to this _Section 2.8_ , is greater than $300,000, then, within ten (10) days
of the final determination of the Cash Impact Amount, Parent and the
Equityholder Representative shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to
deliver to deliver to Parent the amount of the Cash Impact Amount in excess of
$300,000 and solely from and only to the extent of the Indemnity Escrow
Funds.

  



  

2.9   _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the First Surviving Corporation,
the Second Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent, as the case may be,
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement, such amounts as are required to be deducted and
withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code and the
Treasury Regulations or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax
law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and timely paid over to the
appropriate Governmental Authority by Parent, the First Surviving Corporation,
the Second Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary, any compensatory payments for Tax purposes payable
pursuant to or as contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid through the
accounts payable or payroll system of Parent or its Subsidiary subject to
applicable Tax withholding.

2.10   _Adjustments to Consideration_.

  



  

(a)  Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, but
subject to _Section 2.10(c)_ , if the Closing would otherwise be required to
occur pursuant to _Section 3.1_ but for the failure of the condition set forth
in _Section 8.2(f)_ (and for the avoidance of doubt, the condition set forth
in _Section 8.2(f)_ has not been waived by the Company), Parent shall
have the right but not the obligation, in its sole discretion, to elect to
increase the number of shares of Parent Stock deliverable pursuant to this
Agreement and make an equivalent reduction to the amount of cash consideration
(with the value of the Parent Stock determined in accordance with _Section
6.5(e)_ ) such that the value of the Parent Stock consideration deliverable
pursuant to this Agreement for Company Capital Stock represents forty percent
(40%) of the value of the total consideration deliverable pursuant to this
Agreement for Company Capital Stock (with the value of the Parent Stock
determined in accordance with _Section 6.5(e)_ ) (the " _Consideration
Adjustment_ "); _provided_ , that the aggregate value of such total
consideration shall be the Aggregate Closing Consideration Value (without
taking into account the Aggregate Exercise Amount) as of the date that the
Closing would otherwise have occurred but for the failure of the condition set
forth in _Section 8.2(f)_. This _Section 2.10_ and _Section 8.2(f)_ are
intended to ensure that the Mergers contemplated by this Agreement comply with
the requirements of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1(e) and shall be
interpreted in furtherance of such intent.

  



  

(b)  Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, but
subject to _Section 2.10(c)_ , if the Closing would otherwise be required to
occur pursuant to _Section 3.1_ but for the failure of the condition set forth
in _Section 8.3(e)_ , Parent shall increase the amount of cash deliverable
pursuant to this Agreement and make a reduction to the number of shares of
Parent Stock deliverable pursuant to this Agreement such that the condition
set forth in _Section 8.3(e)_ will be met, up to an aggregate of Fifty
Million Dollars ($50,000,000); _provided_ that, in such event (i) that the
aggregate value of such total consideration shall be the Aggregate Closing
Consideration Value (without taking into account the Aggregate Exercise
Amount) as of the date that the Closing would otherwise have occurred but for
the failure of the condition set forth in _Section 8.3(e)_ , (ii) the
Estimated Cash Consideration Amount shall be increased to the amount required
such that the condition set forth in _Section 8.3(e)_  will be met (up to an
additional $50,000,000), (iii) the number of shares of Parent Stock
deliverable shall be determined based in the difference between (i) and (ii)
using the Closing Parent Stock Price.

  



  

(c)  In the event that the adjustments set forth in _Section
2.10(a)_ and _2.10(b)_ are both applicable and cannot be made such that both
of the conditions set forth in _Section 8.2(f)_ and _Section 8.3(e)_ are
satisfied, then, if the Company and Parent mutually agree, Parent may pay the
entire amount of the Aggregate Closing Consideration Value in cash, in
which case the conditions set forth in _Section 8.2(f)_ shall be deemed
satisfied; _provided_ , that the Aggregate Closing Consideration Value
(without taking into account the Aggregate Exercise Amount) as of the date
that the Closing would otherwise have occurred but for the failure of the
conditions set forth in _Section 8.2(f)_ and _Section 8.3(e)_.

  



  

(d)  In the event that the number of shares of Parent Stock or
the cash consideration is adjusted pursuant to this _Section 2.10_ , the
consideration payable pursuant to _Sections 2.1_ and _2.4_ shall be allocated
consistent with the existing provisions of this Agreement taking into account
such adjustments.

Article III.

  

 _CLOSING_

  



  

3.1   _The Closing_. The closing of the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") will take
place at 9:00 a.m., Pacific Time, on the fifth (5th) Business Day after
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article VIII_ (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing,
but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions at the Closing),
at the offices of Latham and Watkins LLP, 355 South Grand Avenue, Los Angeles,
California 90071, unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing
by Parent and the Company; _provided_ , that, in the event Parent elects to

ownership or any such right, claim, interest or option of such Contributor in
such Company Owned Intellectual Property, nor threatened in writing to make
any such assertion. At no time during the conception of or reduction to

educational institution or private source utilizing the facilities of any
Governmental Authority or educational institution, or, to the Knowledge of
the Company, subject to any employment agreement or invention assignment or
nondisclosure agreement with any third Person, in each case that required

Intellectual Property or Intellectual Property Rights resulting from services
provided to the Company Group. The Company Group has not been a member or

and has been designed by Parent's principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, or under their supervision, to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Parent's
internal control over financial reporting is effective for purposes of Rules
13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act and Parent is not aware of any
material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. Since
December 31, 2018, there has been no change in Parent's internal control over

and, to the actual knowledge of the Parent, no claim or Action is threatened
(y) alleging a violation of any Person's privacy or confidentiality rights
under the Parent's privacy policies or applicable Law or (z) with respect to
the security, use, transfer or disclosure of Personal Information
specifically. The Parent has fulfilled in compliance with applicable Law all
requests from the subjects of Personal Information to access, remove
or update such Personal Information stored by or on behalf of the Parent.
Neither this Agreement, nor any other Ancillary Agreement to which the Parent

or data protection with respect to the Processing of Personal Information or
of the Parent's privacy policies. The Parent has established and implemented
policies, programs, and procedures that conform with all requirements of
applicable Law, including administrative, technical and physical safeguards

Affiliates, the form and content of which information shall not have been
approved by Parent prior to such inclusion. The Stockholder Notice will not
contain, at or prior to the Closing, any untrue statement of a material fact
and will not omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make
the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, provided, however, that the Company makes no
representation or warranty with respect to information supplied by or on
behalf of Parent or the Merger Subs with respect to such entities for
inclusion in the Stockholder Notice. Prior to delivering the Stockholder

6.5 _Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a)   _Tax Returns_.

  



  

(i) The Company shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be
prepared or timely filed, all Tax Returns in respect of any member of
the Company Group that are required to be filed (taking into account any
extension) on or before the Closing Date, and shall pay, or cause to be paid,
all Taxes of the Company Group due on or before the Closing Date. Such Tax
Returns shall be prepared by treating items on such Tax Returns in a manner
consistent with past practices of such member, except as required by
applicable Law.

  



  

(ii) Parent shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be
prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns for each member of the
Company Group for any periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date that are
filed after the Closing Date and all Tax Returns for the Company Group for
any Straddle Periods. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared on a basis consistent
with the most recent Tax Returns of the applicable member of the Company
Group, except as required by applicable Law. Not later than thirty (30)
days prior to the due date for filing of such Tax Returns, Parent shall
provide the Equityholder Representative with drafts of such Tax Returns. The
parties shall work together in good faith to resolve any differences and to
the extent such differences have not been resolved, the principles of
_Section 2.8_ shall apply thereto. Parent shall make any changes to the
Tax Returns as finally determined pursuant to the preceding sentence and
shall file such Tax Returns consistent therewith. For purposes of this
Agreement, the portion of Taxes payable for any Straddle Period allocable to
the Pre-Closing Tax Period will be (i) in the case of Property Taxes, deemed
to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by
a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days of such
Straddle Period in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which is
the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period and (ii) in the case
of all other Taxes, determined as though the taxable year of the Company
terminated at the close of business on the Closing Date, except
that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual
basis, such as the deduction for depreciation, shall be apportioned on a time
basis.

  



  

   

49

 



    



  

(iii) Neither Parent or the Second Surviving Corporation, nor any
of their Affiliates shall (or after the Closing, shall cause or permit
the Second Surviving Corporation to) (i) file, amend, refile or otherwise
modify any Tax Return relating in whole or in part to the Company with
respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, or (ii) make or change any Tax election
of the Company that has any effect on a Pre-Closing Tax Period, in each case,
except as required by a Governmental Authority or applicable Law, without the
prior written consent of the Equityholder Representative, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  



  

(b)   _Cooperation on Tax Matters_.

  



  

(i) Parent, the Second Surviving Corporation and the
Equityholder Representative shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns pursuant to this Agreement and any Tax Contest (as defined below).
 Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other party's
request) the provision of records and information which may be reasonably
relevant to any such Tax Return or Tax Contest and making appropriate persons
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information
and explanation of any material provided hereunder. Parent and the
Second Surviving Corporation agree (i) to retain all books and records with
respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company relating to any Tax period
beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the relevant
statutes of limitations (and, to the extent notified by Parent or
Equityholder Representative, any extensions thereof) of the respective Tax
periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with
any Governmental Authority and (ii) to give to the other Person
reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any
such books and records and, if the other Person so requests, the Second
Surviving Corporation or the Equityholder Representative, as the case may be,
shall allow the other Person to take possession of such books and records.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Equityholder
Representative shall have no obligation under this Agreement to prepare or
file any Tax Returns.

  



  

(ii) Parent, the Second Surviving Corporation and the
Equityholder Representative further agree, upon request, to use their
reasonable best efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any
Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including, but not limited
to, with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby).

  



  

(c) _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, stamp, documentary, sales,
use, registration, value-added and other similar Taxes (including all
applicable real estate transfer Taxes) incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (" _Transfer Taxes_ ")
will be borne fifty percent (50%) by Parent and fifty percent (50%) by the
Stockholders. Each Person required by applicable Law agrees to file, or cause
to be filed, in a timely manner all necessary documents (including, but not
limited to, all Tax Returns) with respect to such Transfer Taxes.

  

  



  

   

50

 



    



  

(d)   _Tax Contests_.

  



  

(i) Parent and the Equityholder Representative shall promptly
notify each other in writing upon receipt by such party or any of their
respective Affiliates of notice of any pending or threatened federal, state,
local or foreign audits, examinations, claims, assessments or administrative
or court proceeding relating to Taxes of the Company (a " _Tax Contest_ ") for
which such party is entitled to seek, or is seeking or intends to seek,
indemnification pursuant to this Agreement.

  



  

(ii)  Notwithstanding _Article VII_, subject to the consent
rights of any insurer or any other limitations in the RandW Insurance Policy,
to the extent the Company Equityholders may be held liable for any Taxes under
the provisions of this Agreement (and taking into account the RandW Insurance
Policy), then:

  



  

(A) the Equityholder Representative shall have the right, in good
faith, to control and to represent the interests of any member of the Company
Group in and with respect to any Tax Contest for any Tax period ending on or
prior to the Closing Date and to employ counsel of its own choice for such
purpose; _provided_ , _however_ , Parent shall be entitled to participate at
its expense in or with respect to any such Tax Contest. The Equityholder
Representative shall have the right to settle or compromise, or agree to
settle or compromise, either administratively or after the commencement of
litigation, any Tax Contest for any Tax period ending on or prior to the
Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , no such settlement, compromise or
agreement shall be effectuated without Parent's prior written consent, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

  



  

(B)  Parent and Equityholder Representative shall have the right,
in good faith, to jointly control and to represent the interests of the
Company in and with respect to any Tax Contest for any Straddle Period;
_provided_ , _however_ , that neither party may settle or compromise, or
agree to settle or compromise, either administratively or after the
commencement of litigation, any Tax Contest for any Straddle Period without
the prior written consent of both parties, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

  



  

(e) _Tax Consequences_. For United States federal income tax
purposes, the Mergers are intended to constitute a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder. The parties to this Agreement adopt this Agreement as a plan of
reorganization within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-2(g)
and Proposed Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-3(a). Each of Parent, Merger
Sub 1, Merger Sub 2 and the Company shall report the Merger as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, unless the
condition set forth in _Section 8.2(f)_ is waived by the Company, _Section
2.10(c)_ applies, or otherwise required pursuant to a  "determination" within
the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code. None of Parent, Merger Sub 1,
Merger Sub 2 or the Company shall take any actions (or refrain from taking
any actions) to prevent the Mergers from qualifying as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. The parties to this
Agreement agree that the Closing Parent Stock Price is intended to be treated
as the fair market value of the Parent Stock delivered pursuant to this
Agreement for purposes of determining whether the continuity of interest
requirement under Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1(e) is satisfied
pursuant to Revenue Procedure 2018-12 and agree to make all Tax reporting
consistent with such intent, and any adjustments to the allocation of
consideration between cash and shares of Parent Stock pursuant to _Section
2.10_ shall be made based upon the Closing Parent Stock Price.

  



  

   

51

 



    



  

(f)   _No duplication_. This _Section 6.5_ shall be interpreted
as to avoid duplication.

  



  

6.6 _Indemnification of Officers and Directors_.

  



  

(a)  Parent acknowledges that all rights to indemnification for
acts or omissions occurring prior to the First Effective Time existing as of
the date of this Agreement in favor of the current and former directors and
officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to the DGCL,
Organizational Documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries and any
indemnification agreements set forth on _Section 6.6(a)_ of the Disclosure
Schedule shall survive the Mergers and shall continue in full force and effect
in accordance with their terms for a period of six (6) years following the
First Effective Time, and Parent shall cause the Second Surviving Corporation
to fulfill and honor such obligations to the maximum extent permitted by
applicable Law.

  



  

(b)  Prior to the Closing, the Company shall purchase "tail"
insurance coverage for the Company's directors and officers, in a form
reasonably acceptable to the Parent, which shall provide such directors and

to claims arising out of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Closing (the " _D andO Tail Policy_"). The cost of obtaining the DandO Tail
Policy shall be borne by the Company.

  



  

(c)  The provisions of this _Section 6.6_ shall survive the
Closing and are intended to be for the benefit of, and enforceable by, each
current or former director and officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries and
his or her heirs and personal representatives, and nothing in this Agreement
shall affect any indemnification rights that any such current or former
director or officer and his or her heirs and personal representatives may
have under the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or equivalent
organizational documents of the Company or its Subsidiaries or under any
Contract or applicable Law.

  



  

(d)  In the event that the Second Surviving Corporation or any
of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors or
assigns of the Second Surviving Corporation or any of its respective
successors or assigns, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations
set forth in this _Section 6.6_.

  



  

6.7 _Confidentiality; Publicity_.

initial press release concerning this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. The Company shall not issue any additional press releases
or make any additional public announcements concerning this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby without the prior consent of Parent, except
as may be required by applicable Law, in which case the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to consult in good faith with Parent
before issuing any such press releases or making any such public
announcements. Parent may issue such press releases or make such other public
statements concerning this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
as Parent may, in its reasonable discretion, determine after consultation
with the Company and consideration in good faith of any comments provided by
the Company, or as may be required by applicable Law or rules of the New York
Stock Exchange, in which case Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to consult in good faith with the Company and shall consider in good
faith any comments provided by the Company before issuing any such press
releases or making any such public announcements; provided, that Parent may,
without consultation with the Company, make any public statement to the
press, analysts, investors, lenders, rating agencies, proxy advisory firms or
those attending industry conferences or Parent conference calls, so long as
such statements are substantially similar to previous press releases, public
disclosures or public statements made by Parent.

  



  

6.8 _Exclusivity_. During the Interim Period, the Company shall
not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their employees,
stockholders and other representatives (including any investment bankers) not

its Subsidiaries and its and their employees, stockholders and other
representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any and all
existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any third parties
conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. As promptly as
practicable (and in any event within one (1) Business Day) after receipt of
any Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic information or inquiry
which it reasonably believes would lead to an Acquisition Proposal, the
Company shall provide Parent with oral and written notice of the material
terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal.

  



  

6.9 _Payoff Letters_. At least two (2) Business Days prior to the

individual (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code) to receive or retain
any and all payments and other benefits contingent (within the meaning of
Section 280G(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Code) on the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to the extent necessary so that no such
payment or benefit would be a "parachute payment" under Section 280G(b) of the
Code, in a manner that satisfies the stockholder approval requirements under
Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder,
including QandA 7 of Section 1.280G-1 of such regulations. Such vote shall

disqualified individual prior to the vote. In connection with the
solicitation of the vote from the Stockholders, the Company shall provide
adequate disclosure to the Stockholders of all material facts concerning all
payments that, but for such vote, could be deemed parachute payments to a
disqualified individual under Section 280G of the Code in a manner that
satisfies Section 280G(b)(5)(B)(ii) of the Code and regulations promulgated
thereunder. A reasonable period of time prior to the vote, Parent and its
counsel shall have the right to review and comment on all documents to be
delivered to the Stockholders in connection with such vote and any required
disqualified individual waivers or consents (which review and comment shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and the Company shall reflect all
reasonable comments of Parent thereon. Parent and its counsel shall be
provided copies of all documents executed by the Stockholders and
disqualified individuals in connection with the vote provided under this
_Section 6.12_.

  



  

6.13   _Benefits Plan Terminations_. If requested by Parent at least
five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall, prior to
but conditioned upon the Closing, take all actions reasonably necessary to
terminate or cancel any Employee Benefit Plan that provides group welfare
benefits or is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code as of
no later than one day prior to the Closing Date and provide evidence of such
termination or cancellation reasonably acceptable to Parent. In the event
that termination of any such Employee Benefit Plan would reasonably be
anticipated to trigger liquidation charges, surrender charges or other fees,
then such charges or fees shall be the responsibility of Parent.

6.14   _Continuation of Benefits_.

  



  

(a)  Parent agrees that for a period of at least twelve (12)
months following the First Effective Time, each employee of the Company Group
as of the First Effective Time (a " _Continuing Employee_ ") shall, while such
Continuing Employee remains employed, receive (i) a base salary or hourly
wage rate and target annual cash incentive compensation opportunity
(excluding specific performance goals and equity-based compensation) that, in
each case, is no less favorable than the base salary or wage rate and target
annual cash incentive compensation opportunity (excluding specific performance
goals and equity-based compensation), respectively, as was provided to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the First Effective Time and (ii)
employee benefits that, in the aggregate, are substantially comparable to the
employee benefits of similarly situated employees of Parent excluding for
comparability purposes any change in control, retention or similar benefits,
bonus, equity or equity-based awards. In addition, each Continuing Employee
shall, as of the First Effective Time, receive full credit for service with
the Company Group prior to the First Effective Time for purposes of
eligibility to participate, vesting and vacation entitlement under the
employee benefit plans, programs and policies of Parent in which such
Continuing Employee participates (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt,
with respect to any equity awards or incentives granted after the First
Effective Time) to the same extent such service was recognized by the Company
Group prior to the First Effective Time under comparable Employee Benefit
Plans; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall result in the
duplication of any benefits for the same period of service.

  



  

(b) With respect to each health or welfare benefit plan
maintained by Parent or the Second Surviving Corporation in which a
Continuing Employee participates, Parent shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause (i) to be waived for the calendar year in which
the First Effective Time occurs any eligibility waiting periods or the
application of any pre-existing condition limitations under such plan to the
extent such were waived or satisfied under the comparable health or welfare
benefit plan of the Company Group immediately prior to the First Effective
Time, and (ii) each Continuing Employee to be given credit under such plan
for all amounts paid by such Continuing Employee under any similar Employee
Benefit Plan for the plan year that includes the First Effective Time for
purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as
though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions
of the plans maintained by Parent or the Second Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, for the plan year in which the First Effective Time occurs;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent's obligations under this clause (ii)
shall be subject to its receipt of all necessary information, from either the
Company Group or such Continuing Employee, related to such amounts paid by
such Continuing Employee.

  



  

(c) The provisions of this _Section 6.14_ are solely for the
benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and no Continuing
Employee (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) shall be regarded
for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement, and no
provision of this _Section 6.14_ shall create such rights in any such persons
or any other third party. Nothing herein shall (i) guarantee employment for
any period of time or preclude the ability of Parent or the Second Surviving
Corporation to terminate the employment of any Continuing Employee at any
time and for any reason, (ii) require Parent or the Second
Surviving Corporation to continue any Employee Benefit Plans, or other
employee benefit plans or arrangements or prevent the amendment, modification
or termination thereof after the First Effective Time, or (iii) amend or
establish any Employee Benefit Plans or other employee benefit plans or
arrangements.

  



  

   

55

 



    



  

6.15 _Notices of Certain Events_. During the Interim Period, each
of Parent and the Company shall promptly notify the other of (a) any
notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the consent of
such Person is required in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; (b) any notice or other communication from any Governmental
Authority delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; (c) any Action commenced or, to its Knowledge, threatened against
Parent, the Company, or their Affiliates (as applicable) that relates to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (d) any
inaccuracy or breach of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in
this Agreement of which Parent or the Company (as applicable) has Knowledge
that would result in the failure of any of the conditions set forth in
_Article VIII_. No such notice by the Company shall be deemed to supplement
or amend the Disclosure Schedule for any purpose, including for
(i) determining the accuracy of any of the representations and warranties
made by the Company in this Agreement or (ii) determining whether any
condition set forth in _Article VIII_ has been satisfied.

  



  

6.16 _Further Assurances_. Pursuant to the terms and subject to the
conditions contained herein, the parties agree: (a) to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, (b)
to execute any documents, instruments or conveyances of any kind which may be
reasonably necessary or advisable to carry out any of the transactions
contemplated hereunder or thereunder, and (c) to cooperate with each other in
connection with the foregoing.

  



  

6.17 _Legal Representation_. All communications involving attorney-
client confidences among the Company Group and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and
Rosati in the course of the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will be deemed to be attorney-
client confidences that belong solely to the Stockholders (and not Parent
or the Second Surviving Corporation or their subsidiaries or Affiliates) and
may be controlled by the Equityholder Representative. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, upon and after the Closing, (a) the
Stockholders and their Affiliates will be the sole holders of the attorney-
client privilege with respect to the negotiation, documentation and
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively,
the " _Pre-Merger Communications_ "), and none of the Parent or the Second
Surviving Corporation or their subsidiaries or Affiliates will be a holder
thereof, (b) to the extent that files of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati with
respect to the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement constitute property of
the client, only the Stockholders and their Affiliates will hold such
property rights and (c) Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati will not have any
duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose the Pre-Merger Communications or files
pertaining to the Pre-Merger Communications to Parent or the Second Surviving
Corporation or any of their subsidiaries or Affiliates by reason of any
attorney-client relationship between any of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati
LLP and the Company or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event that a dispute arises between the Parent, the Second Surviving
Corporation or their subsidiaries or Affiliates, on the one hand, and a third
party other than the Stockholders, on the other hand, Parent may assert the
attorney-client privilege to prevent the disclosure of the Pre-Merger
Communications to such third party or waive such privilege if desired in
connection with resolving such dispute. In the event that Parent is legally
required or requested by governmental order or otherwise (any such request or
order, a " _Legal Request_ ") to access or obtain a copy of all or a portion
of the Pre-Merger Communications, Parent shall be entitled to access or
obtain a copy of and disclose the Pre-Merger Communications to the extent
necessary to comply with any such Legal Request. In the event of any Legal
Request, Parent shall promptly notify the Equityholder Representative
in writing (prior to the disclosure by Parent of any Pre-Merger
Communications to the extent practicable) so that the Equityholder
Representative can seek a protective order and Parent agrees to use all
commercially reasonable efforts (at the sole cost and expense of the Company
Equityholders) to assist therewith.

relating to the Company's 2019 audit as reasonably requested by the Parent
Representative; _provided_  that Parent shall cause the Parent Representative

(vii)_ shall survive until the Survival Period Termination Date and claims
thereunder may be asserted at any time before the Survival Period Termination
Date. The indemnification obligations of the Company Equityholders pursuant

forth in this _Section 7.1_ or any provision to the contrary contained
herein, any claim relating to Fraud may be brought at any time to the maximum
extent permitted by applicable Laws (including the maximum period of
extensions under Section 8106(c) of Title 10 of the DGCL).

  



  

7.2 _Indemnification_.

Affiliates (including, following the Closing, the Second Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries), and each of their respective
representatives (collectively, the " _Parent Indemnitees_ "), from and
against any and all Losses incurred in connection with, arising out of,
resulting from or incident to (i) any breach or inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty made by the Company in _Article IV_ or any
certificate delivered in connection with this Agreement (in each case, without

qualifications for purposes of determining whether there is a breach or
inaccuracy and with respect to the calculation of the amount of Losses
incurred by a Parent Indemnitee); (ii) any breach of any covenant or
agreement made by the Company in this Agreement and required to be performed

and (ix) fifty percent (50%) of any settlement costs agreed or judgment
required to be paid in respect of the matter set forth on _Section
7.2(a)(ix)_ of the Disclosure Schedule.

Company Equityholder under this _Section 7.2(a)_ , any portion of the
Indemnity Escrow Funds that are distributed to a Parent Indemnitee pursuant to
this _Article VII_ shall be deemed to have been "severally" recovered from
all of the Company Equityholders. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Equityholder Representative shall represent the Company Equityholders with
respect to all matters pursuant to this _Article VII_ as provided in _Section
10.18_ (and any notice requirement with respect to any notice required to be

representation or warranty made by Parent or the Merger Subs in _Article V_

qualifications with respect to the calculation of the amount of Losses
incurred by a Stockholder Indemnitee); or (ii) any breach of any covenant or
agreement made by Parent or the Merger Subs in this Agreement.

($3,000,000) (the " _Deductible_ "), at which time the Parent Indemnitees
shall have the right to recover all Losses in excess of the Deductible,
subject to the other limitations set forth in this _Article VII_ ; 
_provided_ , that the Deductible shall not apply to indemnification claims for
breaches of the Fundamental Representations or breaches of _Section 4.21_
(Tax Matters). The aggregate liability of the Company Equityholders with
respect to claims for indemnification by the Parent Indemnitees pursuant to
_Section 7.2(a)(i)_ shall not exceed Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000).

  



  

(b)  The Indemnity Escrow Funds shall be the sole source of
recovery with respect to Losses indemnifiable pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)_ ,
and in no event shall the Parent Indemnitees be entitled to recover more than
the Indemnity Escrow Funds pursuant to  _Section 7.2(a)_ in the aggregate,
except (i) with respect to Losses indemnifiable pursuant to Section
_7.2(a)(iii)_ , (ii) that the Earnout Escrow Amount shall be the sole source

Losses), and (iii) that the Special Indemnity Escrow Amount shall be the sole

the Deductible shall not apply to indemnification claims for breaches of the

7.4 _Direct Claims Indemnification Procedures_.

  



  

(a)  If a Person is entitled to indemnification hereunder (an "
_Indemnified Party_ "), the Indemnified Party shall deliver a written demand
(a " _Claim Certificate_ ") to Parent (in the case of an indemnification claim
from a Stockholder Indemnitee) or the Equityholder Representative (in the
case of an indemnification claim from a Parent Indemnitee), as applicable
(each, an " _Indemnifying Party_ "), which Claim Certificate shall contain a
description of, and if reasonably determinable at the time such demand is
delivered, the amount of any Losses incurred or reasonably expected to be
incurred by such Indemnified Party and a reasonable explanation of the basis
therefor. The failure to provide such notice to the Indemnifying Party shall
not affect the Indemnifying Party's obligations under this _Article VII_
except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially
prejudiced by such failure.

  



  

(b)  In the event that the Indemnifying Party does not, within
thirty (30) days of the receipt thereof, object in writing to any claim or
claims made in any Claim Certificate pursuant to the terms hereof, the
Indemnifying Party shall deliver to the Indemnified Party an amount equal to
the Losses set forth in the Claim Certificate arising out of any claim or
claims that are not objected to by the Indemnifying Party; _provided_ , that
if the Indemnified Party is a Parent Indemnitee, then such amount may be
recoverable from the applicable Escrow Account in accordance with the terms
hereof and of the Escrow Agreement.

  



  

(c)  In case the Indemnifying Party shall object in writing to
any claim or claims made in any Claim Certificate, the Indemnifying Party and
Indemnified Party shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the
respective parties with respect to each of such claims. If the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party should so agree, a memorandum setting forth
such agreement shall be prepared and signed, and the Indemnifying Party shall
deliver to the Indemnified Party the amount set forth in such memorandum in
accordance with the terms thereof; _provided_ , that if the Indemnified Party
is a Parent Indemnitee, then such amount may be recoverable from the
applicable Escrow Account in accordance with the terms hereof and of the
Escrow Agreement. In the event that the parties to this Agreement are not
able to reach an agreement, or the memorandum contains an agreement as to
only a portion of the Losses in question, the parties may resolve such
dispute in the manner provided in _Section 10.5_.

  



  

   

62

 



    



  

7.5 _Defense of Third-Party Claims_.

  



  

(a) A party seeking indemnification hereunder in connection
with a claim by any Person other than the Indemnified Party (a  " _Third-
Party Claim_ ") shall provide prompt notice of such Third-Party Claim to
Parent (in the case of an indemnification claim from a Stockholder
Indemnitee) or the Equityholder Representative (in the case of an
indemnification claim from a Parent Indemnitee), as applicable, which notice
describes in reasonable detail such Third-Party Claim and includes copies of
all material written correspondence received by such party in connection
therewith; _provided_ that the failure to provide such notice shall not
affect an Indemnifying Party's obligations under this _Article VII_  except
and only to the extent that an Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by
such failure. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, subject to the
consent rights of any insurer or any other limitations in the RandW Insurance
Policy, in its discretion and at its expense, to participate in and control
the defense or settlement of such Third-Party Claim; _provided_  that the
Indemnifying Party may control the defense or settlement of such Third-Party
Claim only if (i) the claim does not seek an injunction or other equitable
relief; (ii) the claim does not involve criminal allegations, a Governmental
Authority, or any material supplier, customer, or other partner to the
business conducted by the Company Group; (iii) the Indemnifying Party admits
that such Third-Party Claim is indemnifiable pursuant to this _Article VII_
and the amount of such Third-Party Claim is less than the amount of the then-
available Indemnity Escrow Funds (excluding other pending claims); (iv) such
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of such Third-Party Claim within thirty
(30) days of receipt by the Indemnifying Party of notice of such Third-Party
Claim and a reasonable description of such Third-Party Claim; (v) such
Indemnifying Party conducts the defense of the Third-Party Claim diligently;
(vi) the Indemnifying Party is not a party to the Third-Party Claim and
outside counsel for the Indemnifying Party has determined in good faith that
there would be no conflict of interest or other inappropriate matter
associated with joint representation and (vii) in the case of a claim against
a Parent Indemnitee, the assumption of the defense would not cause any Parent
Indemnitee to lose coverage under the RandW Insurance Policy. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of such Third-Party Claim, (A) the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled, at its own cost and expense, to
participate in the defense of such Third-Party Claim and to employ separate
counsel of its choice for such purpose and (B) the Indemnifying Party shall
keep the Indemnified Party apprised of all developments, including settlement
offers, with respect to the Third-Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this _Section 7.5(a)_ , the Equityholder Representative, on
behalf of the Company Equityholders, shall have the right to control
the defense or settlement of the Earnout Matter; _provided_ , that the
Equityholder Representative shall not admit to any Liability with respect to,
consent to the entry of any judgment, or settle, compromise or discharge, the
Earnout Matter without the prior written consent (not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned) of Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this _Section 7.5(a)_ , after the Closing, Parent shall have the
right to control the defense or settlement of the Special Indemnity Matter;
_provided_ , that Parent shall not consent to the entry of any judgment,
or settle, compromise or discharge, the Special Indemnity Matter without the
prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned) of the Equityholder Representative, on behalf of the Company
Equityholders; and _provided_ , _further_ , that (1) the Equityholder
Representative, on behalf of the Company Equityholders, shall be entitled, at
its own cost and expense, to participate in the defense of the Special
Indemnity Matter and to employ separate counsel of its choice for
such purpose, and (2) Parent shall keep the Equityholder Representative
apprised of all developments, including settlement offers, with respect to

(b) Whether or not the Indemnifying Party shall have assumed
the defense of a Third-Party Claim, neither party shall admit to any
Liability with respect to, consent to the entry of any judgment, or settle,
compromise or discharge, any Third-Party Claim for which indemnity is sought
without the prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned) of the other party; _provided_ , that an Indemnified Party shall
have no obligation of any kind to consent to the entrance of any judgment or
into any settlement unless such judgment or settlement (i) is for only money
damages, the full amount of which shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party and
the RandW Insurance Policy, and (ii) includes, as a condition thereof, an
express, unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from any liability or
obligation with respect to such Third-Party Claim; _provided_ _,_ _further_ ,
that, notwithstanding the foregoing, such consent shall be subject, in all
cases, to the terms (including any right of the insurer to consent) of
the RandW Insurance Policy.

  



  

(c)  If any condition in _Section 7.5(a)_ is or becomes
unsatisfied, subject to the last two sentences thereof, (i) the Indemnified
Party may defend against the Third-Party Claim, (ii) the Indemnifying Party
shall be entitled, at its own cost and expense, to participate in the defense
of such Third-Party Claim and to employ separate counsel of its choice for
such purpose, (iii) the Indemnified Party shall keep the Indemnifying Party
reasonably apprised of all material developments, including
settlement offers, with respect to the Third-Party Claim, (iv) any settlement
shall be governed by the provisions of _Section 7.5(b)_ , (v) to the extent
the Indemnifying Party is liable for such Losses under this _Article VII_ ,
the Indemnifying Party will reimburse the Indemnified Party promptly and
periodically (but no less often than monthly) for the costs of defending
against the Third-Party Claim, including reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel engaged by the Indemnified Party, and (vi) to the extent the
Indemnifying Party is liable for such Losses under this _Article VII_ , the
Indemnifying Party will remain responsible for any Losses the Indemnified
Party may suffer, sustain or become subject to, as result of, arising out of,
relating to or in connection with the Third-Party Claim to the fullest extent
provided (and subject to the limitations of) in this _Article VII_. This
_Section 7.5_ shall not apply to Tax Contests which shall be governed by
_Section 6.5(d)_.

  



  

7.6 _Effect of Knowledge or Waiver of Condition_. The right to
indemnification, payment of Losses or other remedy based on any
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements will not be affected by
any investigation conducted with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or
capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution
and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing, with respect to the accuracy
or inaccuracy of, or compliance with, any such representation, warranty,
covenant or obligation. The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of
any representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance
with any covenant or obligation, will not affect the right to
indemnification, payment of Losses, or other remedies based on such
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements.

  



   

64

 



    

   



  

7.7   _Escrow; Payment._

  



  

(a)  Any indemnification of the Parent Indemnitees or the Stockholder
Indemnitees pursuant to this _Article VII_ shall be effected by wire transfer
of immediately available funds from the applicable Persons to an account
designated in writing by the applicable Parent Indemnitees or Stockholder
Indemnitees, as the case may be, within ten (10) days after the final
determination thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) any indemnification
owed by the Company Equityholders to the Parent Indemnitees pursuant to
_Section 7.2(a)(i)_ , _(ii)_ , _(iv)_ , _(v)_ , _(vi)_ , and _(vii)_ will
solely be satisfied from the Indemnity Escrow Account, (ii) any
indemnification owed by the Company Equityholders to the Parent Indemnitees
pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)(viii)_ will solely be satisfied from the Earnout
Escrow Account, and (iii) any indemnification owed by the Company
Equityholders to the Parent Indemnitees pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)(ix)_ will
solely be satisfied from the Special Indemnity Escrow Account. For the
avoidance of doubt, any indemnification owed by the Company Equityholders to
the Parent Indemnitees pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)(iii)_ in excess of the
funds in the Indemnity Escrow Account shall be paid directly by the
Company Equityholders.

  



  

(b)  Parent and the Equityholder Representative shall deliver joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to make
any distributions from the Indemnity Escrow Account as provided for herein.

Indemnitee to which such Company Equityholder may become subject under or in
connection with this Agreement.

the remedies contemplated by _Section 10.17_ , (x) as set forth in
_Section 7.9(b)_ and (y) in the case of Fraud, the parties hereby (i) agree
that the indemnification provisions set forth in this _Article VII_ are the
exclusive provisions in this Agreement with respect to the liability of the
Company Equityholder or Parent for the breach, inaccuracy or nonfulfillment
of any representation or warranty or any pre-Closing covenants, agreements
or other pre-Closing obligations contained in this Agreement and the sole
remedy of the Parent Indemnitees and the Stockholder Indemnitees for any
claims for breach of representation or warranty or pre-Closing covenants,
agreements or other pre-Closing obligations arising out of this Agreement or
any law or legal theory applicable thereto and (ii) irrevocably waive any
remedy relating to any such breach other than the indemnification rights
provided pursuant to this _Article VII_ (whether by contract, common law,
statute, regulation or otherwise). Subject to the following sentence, in the
event the Closing occurs, no Person shall have liability with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in excess of the amount of
consideration actually received by such Person under this Agreement;
_provided_ that the Stockholder listed on _Schedule 7.9(a)_ shall not have
liability with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
excess of the amount of consideration actually received by such Person under
this Agreement whether or not the Closing occurs. With respect to Fraud, (A)
the liability of any Person who did not commit the Fraud or have actual
knowledge of such Fraud shall not exceed the amount of consideration actually
received by such Person under this Agreement, and (B) nothing in this
Agreement shall limit the liability of any Person for any Losses resulting
from any Fraud committed by such Person or of any Person who had actual
knowledge of such Fraud; _provided_ that, notwithstanding any provision to the
contrary in this Agreement, the liability of the Stockholder listed on
_Schedule 7.9(a)_ shall not exceed the amount of consideration actually
received by such Person, except in the case of Fraud actually committed by
such Person.

  



  

   

65

 



    



  

(b)  For the avoidance of doubt, nothing set forth in this _Article
VII_ or otherwise in this Agreement shall affect any right or claim of Parent
or the Second Surviving Corporation pursuant to any Letter of Transmittal,
Restrictive Covenant Agreement or Support Agreement signed by any Company
Equityholder with respect to any representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements set forth in such Letter of Transmittal, Restrictive Covenant
Agreement or Support Agreement; _provided_ that, in the event the Closing
occurs, no party to a Support Agreement shall have liability pursuant thereto
in excess of the amount of consideration actually received by such Person
under this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Stockholder listed on
_Schedule 7.9(a)_ shall not have liability pursuant any Ancillary Agreement
in excess of the amount of consideration actually received by such Person
under this Agreement, except in the case of Fraud actually committed by such
Person.

  



  

7.10   _Tax_ _Consequences of Payments_. Any payments made to an
Indemnified Party pursuant to any indemnification obligations under this
_Article VII_ will be treated as adjustments to the purchase price for all
federal, state, local and foreign Tax purposes, and the parties shall file
their respective Tax Returns accordingly and such agreed treatment will
govern for purposes of this Agreement, unless otherwise required by law.

  



  

7.11   _Losses Net of Insurance_. Losses indemnifiable pursuant to this
_Article VII_ shall be reduced by the amount of insurance proceeds actually
recovered by Parent (other than the RandW Insurance Policy) with respect to the
Losses, net of any likely increase in premium, or cost of recovery. If a
Parent Indemnitee recovers, under insurance policies (other than any amounts
related to the retention under the RandW Insurance Policy), any amount in
respect of a matter for which such Parent Indemnitee was already indemnified
by the Company Equityholders pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)_ , Parent shall
promptly pay over to the amount so recovered (after deducting therefrom the
full amount of the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such Parent
Indemnitee in obtaining and paying over the amount of such recovery and
likely increase in premium) to the Paying Agent, for further distribution to
the Stockholders, and Parent or an Affiliate of Parent, for further
distribution to the Optionholders through the payroll system subject to
applicable Tax withholding; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such recovery
occurs prior to the expiration of the survival periods under _Section 7.1_ or
while any claim by a Parent Indemnitee remains pending in accordance with
_Section 7.1_ , then such recovered amount shall be re-deposited in the
Indemnity Escrow Account until it is released in accordance with this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Parent
Indemnitee shall have any obligation to make, or to cause any Company Group
to make, any insurance claim or to pursue any recovery from any insurance
carrier or third party with respect thereto.

term, condition or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable
manner to the end that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

  



  

   

90

 



    



  

10.12   _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements
and the Confidentiality Agreement, together with all exhibits, appendices and
schedules (including the Disclosure Schedule), constitute the entire agreement
and understanding of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter
hereof and supersede any and all prior negotiations, correspondence,
agreements, understandings, duties or obligations between the parties hereto
with respect to the subject matter hereof.

  



  

10.13   _Construction_. Each party hereto agrees that they have been
represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement

understandings and arrangements relating hereto and/or to the transactions
contemplated hereby have been negotiated, executed and delivered on behalf of
the parties hereto by their respective officers, directors, employees,
members, managers, partners, attorneys and/or agents in their representative
capacities and not individually, and, except as set forth in this Agreement,
no officer, director, employee, member, manager, partner, attorney or agent

10.16   _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement and all of its
conditions and provisions are for the sole and exclusive benefit of the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, and
nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any
Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement or any provision hereof;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) any Person that is not a party to this
Agreement but, by the terms of _Article VII_ , is entitled to indemnification

damage, for which monetary damages (even if available) would not be an
adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not
perform any provision of this Agreement in accordance with its specified
terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that the parties hereto shall be entitled to an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
in Law or in equity. Each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose
the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable
relief on the basis that any other party has an adequate remedy at Law or that
any award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason
at Law or in equity. Any party hereto seeking an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with such order or injunction.

schedule, exhibit or the Disclosure Schedule. The Equityholder Representative
shall be entitled to: (x) rely upon the Closing Consideration Schedule, (y)
rely upon any signature believed by it to be genuine, and (z) reasonably
assume that a signatory has proper authorization to sign on behalf of the
applicable Company Equityholder or other party. The Equityholder
Representative may resign at any time, and may be removed or replaced by a
majority of the Advisory Group. The immunities and rights to indemnification
shall survive the resignation or removal of the Equityholder Representative or
any member of the Advisory Group and the Closing and/or any termination of
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

(b) Certain Company Equityholders have entered into an engagement
agreement (the " _Equityholder Representative Engagement Agreement_ ") with
the Equityholder Representative to provide direction to the Equityholder
Representative in connection with its services under this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement and the Equityholder Representative Engagement Agreement
(such Company Equityholders, including their individual representatives,
collectively hereinafter referred to as the " _Advisory Group_ "). Neither
the Equityholder Representative nor its members, managers, directors,
officers, contractors, agents and employees nor any member of the Advisory
Group (collectively, the  " _Equityholder Representative Group_ "), shall be
liable to any Company Equityholder for any action or failure to act in
connection with the acceptance or administration of the Equityholder
Representative's responsibilities hereunder, under the Escrow Agreement or
under the Equityholder Representative Engagement Agreement, unless and only
to the extent such action or failure to act constitutes gross negligence or
willful misconduct. The Company Equityholders, severally and not jointly, on
a pro rata basis based on the amount of consideration to be received by
each such Company Equityholder under this Agreement, shall indemnify, defend
and hold harmless the Equityholder Representative Group from and against any
and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, fees, costs, expenses (including
fees, disbursements and costs of counsel and other skilled professionals and
in connection with seeking recovery from insurers), judgments, fines or
amounts paid in settlement (collectively, the " _Equityholder Representative
Expenses_ ") incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct on the
part of the Equityholder Representative and arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of its duties hereunder,
under the Escrow Agreement or under the Equityholder Representative
Engagement Agreement; provided that in no event shall such liability of any
Company Equityholder exceed the amount of consideration received by such
Company Equityholder under this Agreement. Such Equityholder Representative
Expenses may be recovered first, from the Expense Fund Amount, second, from
any distribution of the Escrow Amount otherwise distributable to the Company
Equityholders at the time of distribution, and third, directly from the
Company Equityholders. The Company Equityholders acknowledge that the
Equityholder Representative shall not be required to expend or risk its
own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the exercise or
performance of any of its powers, rights, duties or privileges or pursuant to
this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Equityholder Representative
Engagement Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.
Furthermore, the Equityholder Representative shall not be required to take
any action unless the Equityholder Representative has been provided with
funds, security or indemnities which, in its reasonable determination, are
sufficient to protect the Equityholder Representative against the costs,
expenses and liabilities which may be incurred by the Equityholder
Representative in performing such actions.

  



  

(c)  The powers, immunities and rights to indemnification granted
to the Equityholder Representative Group hereunder: (i) are coupled with an
interest and shall be irrevocable and survive the death, incompetence,
bankruptcy or liquidation of any Company Equityholder and shall be binding on
any successor thereto, and (ii) shall survive the delivery of an assignment by
any Company Equityholder of the whole or any fraction of his, her or its
interest in the Escrow Funds. All actions taken by the Equityholder
Representative under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Equityholder
Representative Engagement Agreement shall be binding upon each Company
Equityholder and such Company Equityholder's successors as if expressly
confirmed and ratified in writing by such Company Equityholder, and all
defenses which may be available to any Company Equityholder to contest, negate
or disaffirm the action of the Equityholder Representative taken in good
faith under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Equityholder
Representative Engagement Agreement are waived.

10.19   _No Recourse_. Notwithstanding any of the terms or provisions of
this Agreement, the Merger Subs and Parent (the " _Buyers_ ") agree that
neither they nor any person acting on their behalf may assert any claims or
causes of action against any officer, director, partner, member or
stockholder of Investcare Partners Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited
partnership (" _Investcare_ ") in connection with or arising out of this
Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements, or the transactions contemplated hereby.
It is understood and agreed by Investcare and the Buyers that the U.S. Small
Business Administration (" _SBA_ ") a Federal agency, is not a party to this
Agreement, and that neither the SBA, either as a Receiver for Investcare or
in any other capacity, nor any agent, employee or consultant of the SBA as
Receiver or in any other capacity, shall have any liability with respect to
any and all matters relating to, or arising under, this Agreement, the
Ancillary Agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby. Accordingly, it
is understood that the Buyers' recourse with respect to any claims or causes
of action asserted by the Buyers against Investcare shall be solely against
the assets of the receivership estate of Investcare.
