that closing accounts receivable is $1,000 less than the amount determined by the Equityholder Representative, and
the Equityholder Representative contests only $500 of the amount claimed by Parent, and if the independent accountant

Agreement (such Company Equityholders, including their individual representatives, collectively hereinafter referred to as
the &#8220;<U>Advisory Group</U>&#8221;). Neither the </FONT>Equityholder Representative nor its members, managers,
directors, officers, contractors, agents and employees nor any member of the Advisory Group (collectively, the
 &#8220;<U>Equityholder Representative Group</U>&#8221;), shall be liable to any Company Equityholder for any action or
failure to act in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Equityholder Representative&#8217;s
responsibilities hereunder, under the Escrow Agreement or under the Equityholder Representative Engagement Agreement, unless
and only to the extent such action or failure to act constitutes gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Company
Equityholders, severally and not jointly, on a pro rata basis based on the amount of consideration to be received by each
such Company Equityholder under this Agreement, shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Equityholder Representative
Group from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, fees, costs, expenses (including fees, disbursements
and costs of counsel and other skilled professionals and in connection with seeking recovery from insurers), judgments, fines
or amounts paid in settlement (collectively, the &#8220;<U>Equityholder Representative Expenses</U>&#8221;) incurred without
gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Equityholder Representative and arising out of or in connection
with the acceptance or administration of its duties hereunder, under the Escrow Agreement or under the Equityholder
Representative Engagement Agreement; provided that in no event shall such liability of any Company Equityholder exceed the
amount of consideration received by such Company Equityholder under this Agreement. Such Equityholder Representative Expenses
may be recovered first, from the Expense Fund Amount, second, from any distribution of the Escrow Amount otherwise
distributable to the Company Equityholders at the time of distribution, and third, directly from the Company Equityholders.
The Company Equityholders acknowledge that the Equityholder Representative shall not be required to expend or risk its own
funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the exercise or performance of any of its powers, rights, duties or
privileges or pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Equityholder Representative Engagement Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Furthermore, the Equityholder Representative shall not be required to take any
action unless the Equityholder Representative has been provided with funds, security or indemnities which, in its reasonable
determination, are sufficient to protect the Equityholder Representative against the costs, expenses and liabilities which
may be incurred by the Equityholder Representative in performing such actions.</P>
