not have been terminated pursuant to _Article X_  and that none of the events
or circumstances set forth in clauses (C)(1) or (C)(4) of _Annex A_ shall have
occurred and be existing (and shall not have been waived by Parent), as

Agreement and in _Annex A_. Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub shall use its
reasonable best efforts to consummate the Offer, subject to the terms and
conditions hereof and thereof. The Offer shall be subject only to:

(i) the condition (the " _Minimum Condition_ ") that, prior to the expiration

Acquisition Sub to) (i) waive the Minimum Condition, the condition set forth
in clause (A) of _Annex A_ or the condition set forth in clause (C)(1) of
_Annex A_ , and (ii) make any change in the terms of or conditions to the
Offer that (A) changes the form of consideration to be paid in the Offer, (B)

(C) extends the Offer, other than in a manner contemplated by the provisions
of  _Section 2.1(d)_ or _Section 2.1(f)_, (D) imposes conditions to the
Offer other than those set forth in _Annex A_ , (E) modifies the conditions
set forth in _Annex A_ , or (F) amends any other term or condition of the
Offer in any manner that is adverse to the holders of Shares.



 

-14- (c) _Adjustments to the Offer Price_. The Offer Price shall be adjusted
appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Company Common Stock), reclassification, combination,
exchange of shares or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock
occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to Acquisition Subs

pursuant to the Offer.

 

(d) _Expiration and Extension of the Offer_.

 

(i) Unless the Offer is extended pursuant to and in accordance with this
Agreement, the Offer shall expire at midnight, New York Time, on the date

with Section 14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under the Exchange Act) after the date
the Offer is first commenced (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2
promulgated under the Exchange Act). In the event that the Offer is extended
pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement, then the Offer shall expire
on the date and at the time to which the Offer has been so extended.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 2.1(d)(i)_ or anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement: 

(A) Acquisition Sub shall extend the Offer for any period required by any Law
or Order, or any rule or regulation of the SEC or the NYSE, in any such case
which is applicable to the Offer;

(B) in the event that all of the conditions to the Offer, including the
Minimum Condition or any of the other conditions set forth on _Annex A_ , are
not satisfied or waived (if permitted hereunder) as of any then scheduled
expiration of the Offer, Acquisition Sub shall extend the Offer for
successive extension periods of up to ten (10) Business Days each (or any
longer period as may be approved in advance by the Company) in order to permit
the satisfaction of all of the conditions to the Offer; and

 

(C) in the event that the Company shall have delivered a Recommendation Change
Notice pursuant to _Section 6.3(b)_ or a Superior Proposal Notice pursuant
to _Section 10.1(e)_, Acquisition Sub shall extend the Offer until the
expiration of the three (3) Business Day period following such delivery of

_Section 6.3(b)_ and _Section 10.1(e)_;

_provided, however_ , that the foregoing clauses (A), (B) or (C) of this
_Section 2.1(d)(ii)_ shall not (a) be deemed to impair, limit or otherwise
restrict in any manner the right of the parties to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to the terms of _Article X_ or (b) require the extension of the
Offer if prohibited by any Law or Order or any rule or regulation of the SEC
or the NYSE, in any such case which is applicable to the Offer.

foregoing, Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Acquisition Sub on
a timely basis the funds necessary to pay for any Company Shares that

Price payable in respect of each Company Share validly tendered and not
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be paid net to the holder thereof in
cash, subject to reduction for any applicable federal back-up withholding or
other Taxes payable by or with respect to such holder.

 

(f) _Subsequent Offering Periods_. If upon the acceptance for payment of, and
payment for, all Company Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant
to the Offer, Parent and Acquisition Sub collectively do not beneficially own
at least 90% of the Company Shares then outstanding assuming exercise in full
of the Top-Up Option, Acquisition Sub may (but shall not be required to), and
the Offer to Purchase shall reserve the right to, provide for one or more
"subsequent offering periods" (within the meaning of Rule 14d-11 promulgated

during such "subsequent offering period." Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Acquisition Sub
on a timely basis the funds necessary to pay for any Company Shares that
Acquisition Sub becomes obligated to purchase during such "subsequent
offering period." The Offer Price payable in respect of each Company Share
that is validly tendered during the "subsequent offering period" shall be paid
net to the holder thereof in cash, subject to reduction for any applicable
federal back-up withholding or other Taxes payable by or with respect to such
holder.

may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule
14D-9 promptly after such receipt, and the Company shall provide Parent,
Acquisition Sub and their counsel a reasonable opportunity to participate in
the formulation of any response to any such comments of the SEC or its staff
(including a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any such
response, to which the Company shall give reasonable and good faith
consideration to any comments made by Parent, Acquisition Sub and their
counsel) and to participate in any discussions with the SEC or its staff
regarding any such comments.

(c) _Company Information_. In connection with the Offer, the Company
shall promptly, or shall cause its transfer agent to, furnish Parent and
Acquisition Sub with such assistance and such information and assistance as
Parent or Acquisition Sub and their respective agents may reasonably request
in order to disseminate and otherwise communicate the Offer to the record and
beneficial holders of Company Shares, including a list, as of the most recent
practicable date, of the stockholders of the Company, mailing labels and any
available listing or computer files containing the names and addresses of all
record and beneficial holders of



 

-19-  Company Shares, and lists of security positions of Company Shares held in
stock depositories (including updated lists of stockholders, mailing labels,
listings or files of securities positions). Subject to applicable Laws, and
except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and
any other documents necessary to consummate the Merger, Parent and Acquisition
Sub (and their respective agents) shall:

 

(i) hold in confidence the information contained in any such lists of
stockholders, mailing labels and listings or files of securities positions;

(ii) use such information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger;
and

 

(iii) if (A) this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to _Article X_ , and
(B) Parent and Acquisition Sub shall withdraw the Offer, promptly return (and
shall use their respective reasonable efforts to cause their agents to
deliver) to the Company any and all copies and any extracts or summaries from
such information then in their possession or control. 

2.3 _Company Board of Directors and Committees; Section 14(f) of Exchange
Act_.

 

(a) _Composition of Company Board and Board Committees_. Effective upon the
initial acceptance for payment by Acquisition Sub of Company Shares pursuant
to the Offer (the " _Appointment Time_ ," the use of which term herein shall
not, unless the context otherwise requires, depend upon whether Parent shall
exercise its rights under this _Section 2.3(a)_) and from time to time
thereafter, Parent shall be entitled to designate up to such number of
directors on the Company Board equal to the product (rounded up to the next
whole number) obtained by multiplying (x) the number of directors on
the Company Board (giving effect to any increase in the number of directors
pursuant to this _Section 2.3_) and (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of Company Shares beneficially owned by Parent and Acquisition
Sub (giving effect to the Company Shares accepted for payment pursuant to the
Offer), and the denominator of which is the total number of then outstanding
Company Shares. Following a request by Parent, the Company shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Laws and the certificate of incorporation of
the Company, take at the Companys expense all action necessary to cause the
individuals so designated by Parent to be elected or appointed to the Company
Board, including (at the election of Parent) by increasing the size of the
Company Board or by seeking and accepting or otherwise securing the
resignations of such number of then incumbent directors as is necessary to
enable the individuals so designated by Parent to be elected or appointed to
the Company Board. From time to time after the Appointment Time, at the
request of Parent, the Company shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
Laws and the certificate of incorporation of the Company, take all action
necessary to cause the individuals so designated by Parent to constitute
substantially the same percentage (rounding up where appropriate) as is on the
Company Board on (i) each committee of the Company Board, (ii) each board of
directors of each Subsidiary of the Company and (iii) each committee of each
such board of directors of each Subsidiary of the Company, in each case to the
fullest extent permitted by all applicable Laws. The Company shall promptly
amend, or cause to be amended, its bylaws, if necessary, to comply with the
obligations of the Company pursuant to this _Section 2.3_. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, from the Appointment Time until the Effective Time, the Company
shall use its 



 

-20-  commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Company Board to always have at
least three (3) directors who are directors on the date hereof, who are not
employed by the Company and who are not Affiliates or employees of Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries, and who are independent directors for purposes of the
continued listing requirements of the NYSE (the " _Continuing Directors_ ");
_provided_ that, if the number of Continuing Directors shall be reduced below
three (3) for any reason whatsoever, the remaining Continuing Director(s)
shall be entitled to designate any other Person(s) who shall not be an
Affiliate or employee of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to fill such
vacancies and such Person(s) shall be deemed to be a Continuing Director(s)
for purposes of this Agreement; _provided further_ , that the remaining
Continuing Director shall fill such vacancies as soon as practicable, but in
any event within ten (10) Business Days, and further provided that if no such
Continuing Director(s) are appointed in such time period, Parent shall
designate such Continuing Director(s); _provided further_ , that if no
Continuing Director then remains, the other directors shall designate three
(3) Persons who shall not be Affiliates, consultants, representatives or
employees of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to fill such vacancies and such
Persons shall be deemed to be Continuing Directors for purposes of this
Agreement.

(b) _Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act_. The Companys obligation to appoint
Parents designees to the Company Board shall be subject to Section 14(f) of
the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder and the Companys
receipt of sufficient information from Parent to enable the Company to
include in the Schedule 14D-9 the information required by Section 14(f) of the
Exchange Act and Rule and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder in respect of
Parents designees to the Company Board. The Company shall take all action
required pursuant to this _Section 2.3_ and Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in
order to fulfill its obligations under this _Section 2.3_, and shall include
in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to the Company and its
directors and officers, as well as Parents designees to the Company Board, as
is required under such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its
obligations under this _Section 2.3_. Parent shall provide to the Company in
writing, and be solely responsible for, any information with respect to itself
and its designees to the Company Board required by such Section 14(f) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. 

(c) _Required Approvals of Continuing Directors_. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, following the election or appointment of
Parents designees to the Company Board pursuant to _Section 2.3(a)_ and
until the Effective Time, the approval of a majority of the Continuing
Directors shall be required to authorize (and such authorization shall
constitute the authorization of the Company Board and no other action on the
part of the Company, including any action by any other director of the
Company, shall be required to authorize) (i) any amendment or termination
of this Agreement on behalf of the Company, (ii) any amendment of this
Agreement requiring action by the Company Board, (iii) any extension of time
for performance of any obligation or action hereunder by Parent or Acquisition
Sub, (iv) any exercise, enforcement or waiver of compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein for the benefit of the Company, (v)
any amendment of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company
that would adversely affect the Company Stockholders, and (vi) any other
action to be taken or not to be taken on behalf of the Company under or in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby;
_provided, however,_ that following the Appointment Time, Parent may cause
its designees elected or appointed pursuant



 

-21-  to _Section 2.3(a)_ to withdraw or modify any Company Board Recommendation
Change that may have been made prior to such time without the approval of the
majority of the Continuing Directors. The Continuing Directors shall have the
authority to retain counsel (which may include current counsel to the Company)
at the expense of the Company for the purpose of fulfilling their obligations
hereunder, and shall have the authority, after the Appointment Time, to
institute any action on behalf of the Company to enforce the performance of
this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

 

2.4 _Top-Up Option_.

 

(a) The Company hereby irrevocably grants to Acquisition Sub an option (the "
_Top-Up Option_ "), exercisable only upon the terms and conditions set forth
in this _Section 2.4_, to purchase that number of authorized and unissued
Company Shares (the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ") equal to the lowest number of
Company Shares that, when added to the number of Company Shares beneficially
owned by Parent and/or Acquisition Sub at the time of such exercise, shall
constitute 100 Company Shares more than 90% of the Company Shares outstanding,
assuming the issuance of all Company Shares that are issuable within ten
Business Days after the scheduled closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option
Shares upon the vesting, conversion or exercise of all outstanding options,
warrants, convertible or exchangeable securities and similar
rights, regardless of the conversion or exercise price or other terms and
conditions thereof (assuming the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares) at a
price per share equal to the Offer Price; _provided, however_ , that the Top-
Up Option shall not be exercisable unless immediately after such exercise and
the issuance of Company Shares pursuant thereto, Acquisition Sub would own
more than 90% of the Company Shares then outstanding (assuming the issuance of
the Top-Up Option Shares); and  _provided further_ , that in no event shall
the Top-Up Option be exercisable (A) for a number of Company Shares in excess
of the Companys then authorized and unissued shares of Company Common Stock
or (B) if any applicable Law or any applicable Order shall prohibit the
exercise of the Top-Up Option or the delivery of the Top-Up Option Shares.

(b) Provided that no applicable Law or Order shall prohibit the exercise of
the Top-Up Option or the delivery of the Top-Up Option Shares in respect
thereof, Acquisition Sub may exercise the Top-Up Option, in whole but not in
part, at any one time after the Appointment Time and prior to the earlier to
occur of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms. The aggregate purchase price payable for the Top-Up
Option Shares being purchased by Acquisition Sub pursuant to the Top-Up
Option shall be determined by multiplying the number of such Top-Up Option
Shares by the Offer Price, without interest. Such purchase price may be paid
by Acquisition Sub, at its election, either (A) entirely in cash or (B) in
cash in an amount equal to the aggregate par value of the purchased Top-Up
Option Shares and by executing and delivering to the Company a full recourse
unsecured promissory note issued by the Acquisition Sub having a principal
amount equal to the remainder of such purchase price. Any such promissory note
shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the prime lending rate
prevailing during the period in which any portion of the principal amount
of such promissory note remains outstanding, as published in _The Wall Street
Journal_ , calculated on a daily basis on the outstanding principal amount of
such promissory note from the date such promissory note is originally issued
until the date of payment in full of such promissory note, and may be prepaid
without premium or penalty.



 

-22- (c) In the event Acquisition Sub wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option,
Acquisition Sub shall deliver to the Company a notice (the " _Top-Up Notice_
") setting forth (i) the number of Top-Up Option Shares that Acquisition Sub
intends to purchase pursuant to the Top-Up Option, (ii) the manner in which
Acquisition Sub intends to pay the applicable purchase price and (iii) the
place and time at which the closing of the purchase of such Top-Up Option
Shares by Acquisition Sub is to take place. At the closing of the purchase of
the Top-Up Option Shares, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall cause to be
delivered to the Company the consideration required to be delivered in
exchange for the Top-Up Option Shares being purchased pursuant to the Top-Up
Option, and the Company shall cause to be issued to Acquisition Sub a
certificate representing such Top-Up Option Shares. The parties hereto agree
to use their reasonable best efforts to cause the closing of the purchase of
such Top-Up Option Shares to occur on the same day that the Top-Up Notice is
deemed received by the Company pursuant to _Section 11.2_, and if not so
consummated on such day, as promptly thereafter as possible. The parties
further agree to use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to be
consummated in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL and as contemplated by
_Section 8.3(c)_ as close in time as possible to (including, to the extent
possible, on the same day as) the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares.

 

(d) Parent and Acquisition Sub understand that the Company Shares which
Acquisition Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be
registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon an
exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Parent
and Acquisition Sub represent and warrant to the Company that Acquisition Sub
is, or will be upon the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, an "accredited
investor," as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the
Securities Act. Acquisition Sub agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up
Option Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and
will be acquired by Acquisition Sub for the purpose of investment and not with
a view to or for resale in connection with any distribution thereof within the
meaning of the Securities Act. Any certificates evidencing Top-Up Option
Shares shall include any legends required by applicable securities Laws.

-24- 3.7 _Effect on Capital Stock_.

 

(a) _Capital Stock_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at and as of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company, the
following shall occur:

 

(i) _Capital Stock of Acquisition Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of Acquisition Sub that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. Each
certificate evidencing ownership of such shares of common stock
of Acquisition Sub shall thereafter evidence ownership of shares of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(ii) _Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (A) shares of
Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Acquisition Sub or the Company, or by
any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent, Acquisition Sub or
the Company, in each case immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (B) any
Dissenting Company Shares) shall be canceled and extinguished and
automatically converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to
the Offer Price (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), without interest thereon,
upon the surrender of the certificate representing such share of Company
Common Stock in the manner provided in  _Section 3.8_ (or in the case of a
lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit in the
manner provided in _Section 3.10_).

 

(iii) _Owned Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock owned
by Parent, Acquisition Sub or the Company, or by any direct or indirect
wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent, Acquisition Sub or the Company, in each
case immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be cancelled and
extinguished without any conversion thereof or consideration paid therefor. 

(b) _Adjustment to the Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration shall
be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reclassification,
combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to Company
Common Stock occurring on or after the consummation of the Offer and prior to
the Effective Time.

(c) _Statutory Rights of Appraisal_.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, any
shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and held by a Company Stockholder who is entitled
to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares of Company Common
Stock pursuant to, and who complies in all material respects with, Section
262 of the DGCL (collectively, " _Dissenting_



 

-25-   __ _Company Shares_ ") shall not be converted into, or represent the right
to receive, the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.7(a)_, but rather
such Company Stockholders shall be entitled to receive payment of the
appraised value of such Dissenting Company Shares in accordance with the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided, however_ , that all
Dissenting Company Shares held by Company Stockholders who shall have failed
to perfect or who shall have otherwise waived, withdrawn or lost their rights
to appraisal of such Dissenting Company Shares under such Section 262 of the
DGCL shall no longer be considered to be Dissenting Company Shares and shall
thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become
exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate or
certificates that formerly evidenced such shares of Company Common Stock in
the manner provided in _Section 3.8_.

 

(ii) The Company shall give Parent (A) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to Delaware Law and received by the Company in
respect of Dissenting Company Shares and (B) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under
Delaware Law in respect of Dissenting Company Shares. The Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment
with respect to any demands for appraisal, or settle or offer to settle any
such demands for payment, in respect of Dissenting Company Shares. In
determining the fair value of any Dissenting Company Shares pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL in any proceedings with respect to demands for
appraisal under Delaware Law in respect of Dissenting Company Shares, none of
Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company or the Surviving Corporation shall take
into account the Top-Up Option, the Top-Up Option Shares or any promissory
note issued to pay any portion of the purchase price for such Top-Up Option
Shares.

(d) _Company RSUs_.

 

(i) In connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, but no
later than the Effective Time, each award of Unvested Company RSUs shall be
assumed by Parent (each, an " _Assumed RSU_ "). The number of shares of Parent
Common Stock subject to each award of Assumed RSUs shall be determined by
multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to each
award of Unvested Company RSUs as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
by the Incentive Award Exchange Ratio (with the resulting number rounded down
to the nearest whole share). Each such award of Assumed RSUs otherwise
shall, except as otherwise agreed to by Parent and a holder of such Assumed
RSUs, be subject to the same terms and conditions as applied to the related
award of Unvested Company RSUs immediately prior to the Effective Time,
including the vesting schedule applicable thereto.

(ii) The Company shall take all actions necessary to effect the transactions
contemplated by this  _Section 3.7(d)_ under all Company Stock Plans and any
other plan or arrangement of the Company, including delivering all notices and
making any determinations and/or resolutions of the Company Board or a
committee thereof.

 



 

-26- (e) _Company Options_.

 

(i) Parent shall not assume any Vested Company Options in connection with the
Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Company
shall take such action as may be necessary so that immediately prior to the
Effective Time, (i) each Vested Company Option that remains outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and terminated as
of the Effective Time and (ii) in consideration of such cancellation and
termination, each holder of each such Vested Company Option shall be paid by
the Company at or promptly after the Effective Time, subject to _Section
3.8(e)_, an amount in cash (without interest), if any, equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common
Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Vested Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (y) the Offer Price, _less_ the
per share exercise price of such Vested Company Option (the " _Option
Consideration_ ") (it being understood and agreed that such exercise price
shall not actually be paid to the Company by the holder of a Vested Company
Option).

 

(ii) In connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, but
no later than the Effective Time, each Unvested Company Option shall be
assumed by Parent (each, an " _Assumed Option_ "). Each such Assumed Option
shall, except as otherwise agreed to by Parent and a holder of such Assumed
Option, be subject to the same terms and conditions as applied to the related
Unvested Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, including the
vesting schedule applicable thereto, except that (i) the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock subject to each Assumed Option shall be determined
by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Assumed Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Incentive
Award Exchange Ratio (with the resulting number rounded down to the nearest
whole share), and (ii) the per share exercise price of the Parent Common
Stock issuable upon the exercise of each Assumed Option shall be equal to the
quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of Company Common
Stock as of immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Incentive Award
Exchange Ratio, with the resulting price per share rounded up to the nearest
whole cent. It is the intention of the parties that each Assumed Option so
assumed by Parent shall qualify following the Effective Time as an incentive
stock option as defined in Section 422 of the Code to the extent permitted
under Section 422 of the Code and to the extent such Assumed Option qualified
as an incentive stock option prior to the Effective Time, and, further, that
the assumption of Company Unvested Options pursuant to this Section shall be
effected in a manner that satisfies the requirements of Sections 409A and
424(a) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, and
this  _Section 3.7_ will be construed consistent with this intent.

(iii) With respect to Company Options a portion of which is vested and a
portion of which is unvested, this _Section 3.7(e)_ shall be applied by
treating the vested portion as a separate Vested Company Option and the
unvested portion as a separate Unvested Company Option.

 

(iv) The Company shall take all actions necessary to effect the transactions
contemplated by this _Section 3.7(e)_ under all Company Option agreements
and any other plan or arrangement of the Company, including delivering all
required notices and making any determinations and/or resolutions of the
Company Board or a committee thereof. Parent 



 

-27-  shall take all actions reasonably necessary or appropriate to have available
for issuance or transfer a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock
for delivery upon exercise of the Assumed RSUs and Assumed Options. Promptly
after the Effective Time (but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days
following the Effective Time), Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a
registration statement on Form S-8 (or other appropriate form) registering a
number of shares of Parent Common Stock necessary to fulfill Parents
obligations under _Section 3.7(d)_ and this _Section 3.7(e)_.

 

(f) _Company ESPP_.

 

(i) Prior to the Appointment Time, the Company shall take all actions
necessary such that the current offering period in progress as of the date of
this Agreement shall be the final offering period under the Company ESPP. If
such offering period has not ended prior to the Appointment Time, then, prior
to the Appointment Time, the Company (x) shall take all actions
necessary such that a date to be determined by the Company (but in no event
later than the Appointment Time) shall be the last day of such offering period
and (y) shall make such other pro-rata adjustments as may be necessary to
reflect the shortened and final offering period but otherwise treating such
shortened and final offering period as a fully effective and completed
offering period for all purposes under the Company ESPP. In addition,
effective as of the date of this Agreement, the Company shall have taken all
actions necessary such that (x) no new participant shall be permitted to join
the current offering period in progress under the Company ESPP and (y) no
participant in the Company ESPP with respect to the current offering period
shall be permitted to increase his or her elections with respect to the
current offering period.

(ii) Unless it has earlier terminated, the Company shall take all actions
necessary so that the Company ESPP shall terminate immediately prior to and
effective as of the Appointment Time. All amounts withheld by the Company on
behalf of the participants in the Company ESPP that have not been used to
purchase Company Common Stock at or prior to the Appointment Time will be
returned to the participants without interest pursuant to the terms of the
Company ESPP.

 

(iii) The Company agrees to take any and all actions necessary to approve and
effectuate the foregoing provisions of this  _Section 3.7(f)_ including
making any determinations and/or resolutions of the Company Board or a
committee thereof.

 

(g) _Company Restricted Stock_. In connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, but no later than the Effective Time, and
without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each Company Restricted
Stock Award shall automatically be cancelled, and each share of Company Common
Stock subject to a Company Restricted Stock Award shall be converted into
the right to receive an amount of cash equal to the Merger Consideration,
which shall be subject to, and payable to the holder of such Company
Restricted Stock Award, in accordance with the vesting schedule applicable to
such Company Restricted Stock Award as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time.



 

-28- 3.8 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Payment Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the payment
agent for the Merger (the " _Payment Agent_ ").

(b) _Exchange Fund_. At or before the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit
(or cause to be deposited) with the Payment Agent, for payment to the holders
of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the provisions of this _Article
III_, an amount of cash equal to the aggregate consideration to which holders
of Company Common Stock and holders of Vested Company RSUs and Vested Company
Options become entitled under this _Article III_ (other than any portion
thereof allocable to any Dissenting Company Shares, which shall be withheld
by Parent or the Surviving Corporation to satisfy related appraisal or
dissenters rights matters and the costs thereof). Until disbursed in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such funds shall
be invested by the Payment Agent, as directed by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America,
obligations of an agency of the United States of America which are backed by
the full faith and credit of the United States of America, commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $1 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of
such bank that are then publicly available) (such cash amount being referred
to herein as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). Any interest and other income or net
profits resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent. To the extent
that there are any losses with respect to any investments of the Exchange
Fund, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required
for the Payment Agent to promptly pay the consideration contemplated by this
_Article III_ , upon demand by the Payment Agent, Parent shall, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, promptly reimburse any such loss so as to
ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient
for the Payment Agent to make such payments contemplated by this _Article
III_.

 

(c) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Payment Agent to mail to each
holder of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of (i) a
certificate or certificates (the " _Certificates_ ") which immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
(other than Dissenting Company Shares) and (ii) uncertificated shares of
Company Common Stock (other than Owned Company Shares) (the " _Uncertificated
Shares_ "), in each case, whose shares were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.7_ (A) a letter of
transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Payment Agent), and/or (B)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates and
Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in
respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_. Upon
surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Payment Agent or to such
other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificate that were converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.7_, by (y)

 



 

-29-  the Merger Consideration (less any applicable withholding taxes payable in
respect thereof), and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. The holders of such Uncertificated Shares shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such holders transferred Uncertificated Shares that were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 3.7_, by (y) the Merger Consideration, upon the entry through a
book-entry transfer agent of the surrender of such shares on a book-entry
account statement, and the transferred Uncertificated Shares so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. The Payment Agent shall accept such Certificates
and transferred Uncertificated Shares upon compliance with such reasonable
terms and conditions as the Payment Agent may impose to effect an orderly
exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest
shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates and
Uncertificated Shares on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender
of such Certificates and Uncertificated Shares pursuant to this _Section
3.8_. Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates and Uncertificated Shares
shall be deemed from and after the Effective Time, to evidence only the right
to receive upon surrender the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon,
payable in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_.

 

(d) _Transfers of Ownership_. In the event that a transfer of ownership of
shares of Company Common Stock is not registered in the stock transfer books
or ledger of the Company, or if the Merger Consideration is to be paid in a
name other than that in which the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares
surrendered in exchange therefor are registered in the stock transfer books
or ledger of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be paid to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the Certificate or Uncertificated Share so
surrendered is registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company
only if such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares is properly endorsed and
otherwise in proper form for surrender and transfer and the Person requesting
such payment has paid to Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate
or Uncertificated Shares, or established to the satisfaction of Parent (or any
agent designated by Parent) that such transfer or other Taxes have been paid
or are otherwise not payable.

(e) _Required Withholding_. Each of the Payment Agent, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
cash amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder
of shares of Company Common Stock, Company RSUs and Company Options such
amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under United
States federal or state, local or foreign Tax Laws. To the extent that such
amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such
amounts would otherwise have been paid.

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or any other party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Company
Common Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.



 

-30- (g) _Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares on the date that is twelve (12) months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of
shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Merger who have not theretofore surrendered their Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares representing such shares of Company Common Stock for
exchange pursuant to the provisions of this  _Section 3.8_ shall thereafter
look for payment of the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares
of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated
Shares solely to Parent, as general creditors thereof, for any claim to the
applicable Merger Consideration to which such holders may be entitled pursuant
to the provisions of this _Article III_.

 

3.9 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. From and after the
Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled, retired and cease to exist,
and each holder of a Certificate or Uncertificated Shares theretofore
representing any shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration payable therefor upon the surrender thereof in accordance with
the provisions of _Section 3.8_. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance
with the terms of this _Article III_ shall be deemed to have been paid in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of the Company
Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of
shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, other than transfers to reflect, in accordance
with customary settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are
presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled
and exchanged as provided in this _Article III_.

 

3.10 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 3.7_; 
_provided, however_ , that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the payment thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate to deliver a bond in such sum as Parent may reasonably
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to the Certificate
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 

3.11 _Necessary Further Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title
and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Acquisition Sub, the directors and officers
of the Company and Acquisition Sub shall take all such lawful and necessary
action.

the requisite corporate power and authority to conduct its business as it is
presently being conducted and to own, lease or operate its properties and
assets. The Company is duly licensed and qualified to do business and is
in good standing (or equivalent status) in each jurisdiction where the
character of its properties owned or leased or the nature of its activities
make such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so

Company has delivered or made available to Parent complete and correct copies
of the certificates of incorporation and bylaws, as amended to date, of the
Company. The Company is not in material violation of its certificate of

Agreement, the performance by the Company of its covenants and obligations
hereunder and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated

reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws affecting or relating to
creditors rights generally, and (b) is subject to general principles of
equity.

4.3 _Requisite Stockholder Approval_. The only vote of the holders of

Stockholder Approval_ ").

this Agreement, the performance by the Company of its covenants and

the termination of, or accelerate the performance required by, or result in a
right of termination or acceleration under, any Material Contract, (c)

properties or Assets are bound, or (d) result in the creation of any Lien
(other than Permitted Liens) upon any of the Assets, except in the case of
each of clauses (b), (c) and (d) above, for such violations, conflicts,
defaults, terminations, accelerations or Liens which would not have,

or materially delay the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated hereby or the performance by the Company of its covenants and
obligations hereunder.

any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person,
on the other hand (such as any arrangement described in Section 303(a)(4) of
Regulation S-K under the Securities Act)) where the purpose or effect of
such arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the Companys consolidated financial
statements.

-60- 6.2 _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) The Company and its Subsidiaries shall immediately cease any and all
existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted
heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.

(b) Subject to _Section 6.2(c)_, at all times during the period commencing
with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the
earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article X_
and the Effective Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not, nor shall
they authorize or knowingly permit any of their respective directors, officers
or other employees, controlled affiliates, or any investment banker, attorney
or other agent or representative (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") to,
directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or induce the making, submission
or announcement of, or knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist, an
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) furnish to any Person (other than Parent,
Acquisition Sub or any designees of Parent or Acquisition Sub) any non-public
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or afford to
any Person (other than Parent, Acquisition Sub or any designees of Parent or
Acquisition Sub) access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or
other information, or to any personnel, of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, in any such case that would reasonably be expected to induce the
making, submission or announcement of, or encourage, facilitate or assist, an
Acquisition Proposal or any inquiries or the making of any proposal that would
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) participate
or engage in discussions or negotiations with any Person with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal, (iv) approve, endorse or recommend an Acquisition
Proposal, (v) enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding or

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this _Section 6.2_
or elsewhere in this Agreement, prior to the Appointment Time, the Company
Board may, directly or indirectly through the Companys Representatives, (i)
participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with any Person that has
made a _bona fide,_ written and unsolicited Acquisition Proposal that the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel) either constitutes or is reasonably likely
to lead to a Superior Proposal, and/or (ii) furnish to any Person that has
made a _bona fide,_ written and unsolicited Acquisition Proposal that the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel) either constitutes or is reasonably likely
to lead to a Superior Proposal any non-public information relating to the
Company and access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or
other non-public information, or to any personnel, of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, in each case under this clause (ii) pursuant to a
confidentiality agreement, the terms of which are no less favorable to the
Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (it being
understood and agreed that such confidentiality agreement need not contain a
"standstill" or other similar provision that prohibits such third party from
making any proposal to acquire the Company, acquire securities of the
Company, nominate for election members of the Company Board or take any other
action); _provided however_ , that in the case of any action taken pursuant to
the preceding clauses (i) or (ii), (A) the Company Board determines in good
faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure to take
such action would reasonably be expected to be a breach of its fiduciary
duties to the Company Stockholders under applicable Delaware Law, (B) the
Company gives



 

-61-  Parent not less than 24 hours prior written notice of the identity of such
Person and the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal (unless such
Acquisition Proposal is in written form, in which case the Company shall give
Parent a copy thereof) and of the Companys intention to participate or engage
in discussions or negotiations with, or furnish non-public information to,
such Person, and (C) contemporaneously with furnishing any non-public
information to such Person, the Company furnishes such non-public information
to Parent to the extent such information has not been previously furnished by
the Company to Parent. The Company shall provide Parent with a correct and
complete copy of any confidentiality agreement entered into pursuant to this
paragraph within 24 hours of the execution thereof. The Company shall not
terminate, waive, amend, release or modify any material provision of
any confidentiality agreement to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and shall enforce the material
provisions of any such agreement and shall provide Parent with copies of any
additional written documentation delivered to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or its or its Subsidiaries Representatives in connection
therewith.

 

(d) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent, Acquisition Sub
and the Company acknowledge and hereby agree that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.2_ by any directors or officers of
the Company shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 6.2_ by the
Company.

 

(e) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in _Section
6.2(b)_, the Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours
following receipt) notify Parent orally and in writing if the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or any of its or its Subsidiaries Representatives
receives (i) any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any request for information that
would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) any
inquiry with respect to, or which would reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal, such notice to include the terms and conditions of such
Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry (including a copy, if made in
writing, or a written summary, if made orally), and the identity of the Person
or group making any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry. The Company
shall keep Parent informed on a current basis of the status and terms of any
such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, and any material developments
related thereto.

 

6.3 _Company Board Recommendation_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms of _Section 6.3(b)_ and _Section 6.3(c)_, the
Company Board shall recommend that the holders of Company Shares accept the
Offer, tender their Company Shares to Acquisition Sub pursuant to the Offer
and, if required by the applicable provisions of Delaware Law, adopt this
Agreement (the " _Company Board Recommendation_ "). 

(b) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) fail to make
the Company Board Recommendation to the holders of the Company Shares, (ii)
withhold, withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, or publicly
propose to withhold, withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent,
the Company Board Recommendation, (iii) adopt, approve, recommend, endorse or
otherwise declare advisable the adoption of any Acquisition Proposal (it being
understood that, only with respect to a tender offer or exchange offer, taking
a neutral position or no position (other than in a communication made



 

-62-  in compliance with Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act) with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal shall be considered a breach of this
clause (iii)), or (iv) resolve, agree or publicly propose to take any such
actions (each such foregoing action or failure to act in clauses (i) through
(iv) being referred to herein as an " _Company Board Recommendation Change_
"). Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, if, at any time prior to the Appointment Time, the Company
Board receives a Superior Proposal or there occurs an Intervening Event, the
Company Board may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change provided that
(i) the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside legal counsel) that the failure to effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to be a breach of its
fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under applicable Delaware Law,
and in the case of a Superior Proposal, the Company Board approves or
recommends such Superior Proposal; (ii) the Company has notified Parent in
writing that it intends to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change,
describing in reasonable detail the reasons, including the material terms and
conditions of any such Superior Proposal and a copy of the final form of any
related agreements or a description in reasonable detail of such Intervening
Event, as the case may be, for such Company Board Recommendation Change (a "
_Recommendation Change Notice_ ") (it being understood that the Recommendation
Change Notice shall not constitute a Company Board Recommendation Change for
purposes of this Agreement); (iii) if requested by Parent, the Company shall
have made its Representatives available to discuss and negotiate in good faith
with Parents Representatives any proposed modifications to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement during the three (3) Business Day period
following delivery by the Company to Parent of such Recommendation Change
Notice; and (iv) if Parent shall have delivered to the Company a
written proposal capable of being accepted by the Company to alter the terms
or conditions of this Agreement during such three (3) Business Day period, the
Company Board shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with
outside legal counsel), after considering the terms of such proposal by
Parent, that a Company Board Recommendation Change is still necessary in light
of such Superior Proposal or Intervening Event in order to comply with its
fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under applicable Delaware Law.
Any material amendment or modification to any Superior Proposal will be deemed
to be a new Superior Proposal for purposes of this _Section 6.3_. The Company
shall keep confidential any proposals made by Parent to revise the terms of
this Agreement, other than in the event of any amendment to this Agreement and
to the extent required to be disclosed in any Company SEC Reports.

 

(c) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board from (i) taking
and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying with the provisions of Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act, and (ii) making any disclosure to the
Company Stockholders that the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to make such
disclosure would reasonably be expected to be a breach of its fiduciary duties
to the Company Stockholders under applicable Delaware Law;
_provided, however_ , that in no event shall this _Section 6.3(c)_ affect
the obligations of the Company set forth in _Sections 6.2_ and _6.3_ ; and
_provided, further_ , that any such disclosure will be deemed to be a Company
Board Recommendation Change unless the Board of Directors publicly reaffirms
the Company Board Recommendation within five Business Days of such disclosure.



 

-63- 6.4 _Access_. At all times during the period commencing with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article X_ and the Appointment
Time, the Company shall afford Parent and its financial advisors, business
consultants, legal counsel, accountants and other agents and representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours, upon reasonable notice, to the
properties, books and records and personnel of the Company; _provided,
however_ , that the Company may restrict or otherwise prohibit access to any
documents or information to the extent that (i) any applicable Law requires
the Company to restrict or otherwise prohibit access to such documents or
information, (ii) access to such documents or information would give rise to
a material risk of waiving any attorney-client privilege, work product
doctrine or other applicable privilege applicable to such documents or
information, or (iii) access to a Contract to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound would violate or cause a default
under, or give a third party the right terminate or accelerate the rights
under, such Contract; and _provided further_ , that no information or
knowledge obtained by Parent in any investigation conducted pursuant to the
access contemplated by this _Section 6.4_ shall affect or be deemed to modify
any representation or warranty of the Company set forth in this Agreement or
otherwise impair the rights and remedies available to Parent and Acquisition
Sub hereunder. In the event that the Company does not provide access or
information in reliance on the preceding sentence, it shall use its reasonable
best efforts to communicate the applicable information to Parent in a way
that would not violate the applicable Law, Contract or obligation or to waive
such a privilege. Any investigation conducted pursuant to the access
contemplated by this _Section 6.4_ shall be conducted in a manner that does
not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company and
its Subsidiaries or create a risk of damage or destruction to any property or
assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Any access to the Companys
properties shall be subject to the Companys reasonable security measures and
insurance requirements and shall not include the right to perform invasive
testing. The Company shall make available to Parent, by 11:59 p.m. (Pacific
time) on August 23, 2010, (i) a list of commercial Software code that is
incorporated by the Company or its Subsidiaries into the products of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and that is licensed to Company or its
Subsidiaries by a third party pursuant to a negotiated license with the
Company or its Subsidiaries, and (ii) copies of the applicable licenses; in
each case, excluding "open source" Software and Software licensed pursuant to
non-negotiable Contracts (including "shrink-wrap" and "click-through"
Contracts). The terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall
apply to any information obtained by Parent or any of its financial advisors,
business consultants, legal counsel, accountants and other agents and
representatives in connection with any investigation conducted pursuant to the
access contemplated by this _Section 6.4_.

 

6.5 _Certain Litigation_. The Company shall promptly advise Parent of any
litigation commenced after the date hereof against the Company or any of its
directors (in their capacity as such) by any Company Stockholders (on their
own behalf or on behalf of the Company) relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, and shall keep Parent reasonably informed
regarding any such litigation. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity
to participate in the defense or settlement of any such stockholder litigation
and agrees that it shall not settle or offer to settle any such
stockholder litigation without the prior written consent of Parent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).



 

-64- 6.6 _Section 16(b) Exemption_. The Company shall take all actions to cause
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any other dispositions of
equity securities of the Company (including derivative securities) in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is a director or executive officer of the Company to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

ARTICLE VII 

COVENANTS OF PARENT AND ACQUISITION SUB

 

7.1 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to) honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries under any and all indemnification agreements
between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of their
respective current or former directors and officers and any person who
becomes a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior
to the Appointment Time (the " _Indemnified Persons_ "). In addition, during
the period commencing at the Appointment Time and ending on the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to) cause the certificates of incorporation and bylaws (and
other similar organizational documents) of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification,
exculpation and the advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable as
the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions
contained in the certificates of incorporation and bylaws (or other similar
organizational documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date
hereof, and during such six-year period, such provisions shall not be
repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner except as required by
applicable Law.

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of the provisions of _Section 7.1(a)_,
during the period commencing at the Appointment Time and ending on the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to)
indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Person from and against any
reasonably incurred costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees and investigation expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim,
proceeding, investigation or inquiry, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative, to the extent such claim, proceeding, investigation or
inquiry arises out of or pertains directly or indirectly to (i) any action or
omission or alleged action or omission in such Indemnified Persons capacity
as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or other Affiliates (regardless of whether such action or
omission, or alleged action or omission, occurred prior to, at or after the
Effective Time), or (ii) any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided, however_ , that if, at any time prior to the
sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Person delivers to
Parent a written notice asserting a claim for indemnification under this
_Section 7.1(b)_, then the claim

 



 

-65-  asserted in such notice shall survive the sixth anniversary of the Effective
Time until such time as such claim is fully and finally resolved. In addition,
during the period commencing at the Appointment Time and ending on the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to)
advance, prior to the final disposition of any claim, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry for which indemnification may be sought under this
Agreement, promptly following request by an Indemnified Person therefor, all
costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
investigation expenses) reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Person in
connection with any such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry upon
receipt of an undertaking by such Indemnified Person to repay such advances
if it is ultimately decided in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of
competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to
indemnification. In the event of any such claim, proceeding, investigation or
inquiry, (i) the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to control the
defense thereof after the Effective Time, (ii) each Indemnified Person shall
be entitled to retain his or her own counsel, whether or not the Surviving
Corporation shall elect to control the defense of any such claim, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry, (iii) the Surviving Corporation shall pay all
reasonable fees and expenses of any counsel retained by an Indemnified Person
promptly after statements therefor are received, whether or not the Surviving
Corporation shall elect to control the defense of any such claim, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry, and (iv) no Indemnified Person shall be liable for
any settlement effected without his or her prior express written consent.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this _Section 7.1(b)_
or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither the Surviving Corporation nor any of
its Affiliates (including Parent) shall settle or otherwise compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek termination with
respect to any claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry for which
indemnification may be sought by an Indemnified Person under this Agreement
unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an
unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from all liability arising
out of such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry.

 

(c) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain in effect the
Companys current directors and officers liability insurance (" _D andO
Insurance_") in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, covering each person covered by the DandO Insurance, on terms
with respect to the coverage and amounts that are equivalent to those of the
DandO Insurance; _provided, however_ , that in satisfying its obligations under
this _Section 7.1(c)_, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be
obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of
the amount paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year
(such three hundred percent (300%) amount, the " _Maximum Annual Premium_ ")
(which premiums the Company represents and warrants to be as set forth in
_Section 7.1(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter);  _provided_ that, if the
annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium. Prior to the
Effective Time, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, the Company may purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid policy on the
DandO Insurance, provided that the aggregate annual premium for such "tail 



 

-66-  policy" shall not exceed 500% of the annual premium paid by the Company for
its existing directors and officers liability insurance policies during the
fiscal year ended March 31, 2010. In the event that the Company elects to
purchase such a "tail" policy prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to)
maintain such "tail" policy in full force and effect and continue to honor
their respective obligations thereunder, in lieu of all other obligations of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation under the first sentence of this _Section
7.1(c)_ for so long as such "tail" policy shall be maintained in full force
and effect.

(d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger, or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall
assume all of the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set
forth in this _Section 7.1_.

(e) The obligations set forth in this _Section 7.1_ shall not be
terminated, amended or otherwise modified in any manner that adversely
affects any Indemnified Person (or any other person who is a beneficiary under
the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section 7.1(c)_ (and
their heirs and representatives)) without the prior written consent of such
affected Indemnified Person or other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO
Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section 7.1(c)_ (and their
heirs and representatives). Each of the Indemnified Persons or other persons
who are beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to
in _Section 7.1(c)_ (and their heirs and representatives) are intended to be
third party beneficiaries of this _Section 7.1_, with full rights of
enforcement as if a party thereto. The rights of the Indemnified Persons (and
other persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or the
"tail" policy referred to in _Section 7.1(c)_ (and their heirs and
representatives)) under this _Section 7.1_ shall be in addition to, and not
in substitution for, any other rights that such persons may have under the
certificates of incorporation, bylaws or other equivalent organizational
documents, any and all indemnification agreements of or entered into by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or applicable Law (whether at law or in
equity).

 

(f) The obligations and liability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and
their respective Subsidiaries under this  _Section 7.1_ shall be joint and
several.

(g) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this _Section 7.1_ is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

 

7.2 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change of control" (or similar phrase)
within the meaning of the Employee Plans, as applicable, will occur as of the
Appointment Time or Effective Time, as applicable.



 

-67- (b) Except as provided in _Section 7.2(b)_, from and after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to) honor all Employee Plans and compensation arrangements in
accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Appointment
Time, provided that nothing in this sentence shall prohibit the Surviving
Corporation from amending or terminating, or from causing the Surviving
Corporation to amend or terminate, any such Benefit Plans, arrangements or
agreements in accordance with their terms or if otherwise required by
applicable Law. As of the Effective Time, Parent shall or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to assume the Employee Plans set forth in _Section
7.2(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.

 

(c) The Company shall take (or cause to be taken) all action necessary or
appropriate to terminate, effective no later than the day immediately
preceding the Appointment Time, any Employee Plan that contains a cash or
deferred arrangement intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code (the
" _401(k) Plans_ "), unless Parent, in its sole and absolute discretion,
agrees to sponsor and maintain any such 401(k) Plan by providing the Company
with written notice of such election (an " _Election Notice_ ") at least three
days before the Appointment Time. Unless Parent timely provides an Election
Notice to the Company, the Company shall deliver to Parent, prior to the
Appointment Time, evidence that the Companys board of directors has validly
adopted resolutions to terminate the 401(k) Plans (the form and substance of
which resolutions shall be subject to review and approval of Parent),
effective no later than the date immediately preceding the Appointment Time.
Parent shall cause a plan intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code
(the " _Parent 401(k) Plan_ ") to accept rollovers (including rollover loans)
from any 401(k) plan of the Company.

(d) For a period of one year following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to)
provide (i) at least the same level of base salary or base wages to each
Continuing Employee as the base salary or base wages provided to each such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) benefits
and severance payments (other than equity based benefits, change in control
benefits and individual employment agreements) to each Continuing Employee
employed in the United States that, taken as a whole, are substantially
similar in the aggregate to the benefits and severance payments (other than
equity based benefits, change in control benefits and individual
employment agreements) provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and
its Subsidiaries. Parent agrees that it shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to pay an annual cash bonus to each participant in an annual cash bonus plan
of the Company as of the Effective Time (excluding, for avoidance of doubt,
sales and commission plans) equal to the amount determined by (i) determining
the annual cash bonus that would have been paid to such participant based on
deemed performance for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2011 using the rate
of accrual for purposes of the Companys financial statements as of
immediately prior to the date of this Agreement and (ii) multiplying the
number determined pursuant to clause (i) by 0.8356 (i.e., 305/365), with the
resulting amount reduced by any portion of such annual bonus previously paid
to the participant. Such bonus will be paid in February 2011 subject to the
participants continued employment through January 31, 2011.



 

-68- (e) To the extent that an Employee Plan or employee benefit plan of Parent is
made available to any Continuing Employee on or following the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to) cause to be granted to such Continuing Employee credit for all
service with the Company and its Subsidiaries (and their predecessors) prior
to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and
entitlement to benefits where length of service is relevant (including, but
not limited to, for purposes of vacation, sick and paid time off accrual and
severance pay entitlement); _provided, however_ , that such service need not
be credited (i) to the extent that it would result in duplication of coverage
or benefits or (ii) under any new plan or arrangement to the extent that such
plan or arrangement does not provide prior service credit to employees
generally. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
at the Effective Time: (i) each Continuing Employee shall be immediately
eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all employee
benefit plans sponsored by the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
(other than the Employee Plans) (such plans, collectively, the " _New Plans_
") to the extent coverage under any such New Plan replaces coverage under a
comparable Employee Plan in which such Continuing Employee participates
immediately before the Appointment Time (such plans, collectively, the "
_Old Plans_ "); and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical,
dental, pharmaceutical, vision and/or disability benefits to any Continuing
Employee, the Surviving Corporation shall cause all waiting periods, pre-
existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements and
actively-at-work or similar requirements of such New Plan to be waived for
such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, and the Surviving
Corporation shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing
Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year
of the Old Plan ending on the date such employees participation in the
corresponding New Plan begins to be given full credit under such New Plan for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Plan, and (iii) the Surviving Corporation shall
credit the accounts of such Continuing Employees under any New Plan which is a
flexible spending plan with any unused balance in the account of such
Continuing Employee under the applicable Employee Plan. Any vacation or paid
time off accrued but unused by a Continuing Employee as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be credited to such Continuing Employee following
the Effective Time, and shall not be subject to accrual limits or other
forfeiture and shall not limit future accruals.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no
provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) guarantee employment for
any period of time for, or preclude the ability of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation to terminate, any Continuing Employee for any reason, or (ii)
subject to the limitations and requirements specifically set forth in this
_Section 7.2_, require Parent or the Surviving Corporation to continue any
Employee Plan or prevent the amendment, modification or termination thereof
after the Effective Time.

(g) This _Section 7.2_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit
of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this _Section 7.2_,
expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights
or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this  _Section
7.2_. Without limiting the foregoing, no provision of this _Section 7.2_ will
create any third party beneficiary rights in any current or former employee,
director or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in respect
of continued employment (or resumed employment) or any other matter.



 

-69- (h) Effective as of immediately prior to, and contingent upon, the Appointment
Time, the Company shall cause to be amended each outstanding Company RSU,
Company Option and Company Restricted Stock Award to provide that, if upon or
within twelve (12) months following the Appointment Time, the employment or
service of the holder of any such Company RSU, Company Option and/or Company
Restricted Stock Award is terminated by the Company or the Parent (or any
employing parent or subsidiary thereof) by reason of elimination of the
holders position due to redundancy or integration of Parent and Company
business units (but, for avoidance of doubt, excluding terminations for death,
"Disability," "Serious Misconduct," or "Poor Performance," (as such terms are
defined in  _Section 7.2(h)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter), then one
hundred percent (100%) of the then unvested shares subject to such Company
RSU, Company Option and/or Company Restricted Stock Award shall become
immediately vested and, if applicable, exercisable.

7.3 _Obligations of Acquisition Sub_. Parent shall take all action necessary
to cause Acquisition Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their
respective obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement.

failure of the Company to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under
this Agreement, in any such case if and only to the extent that such untruth
or inaccuracy, or such failure, would reasonably be expected to cause any of
the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Acquisition Sub to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby set forth in paragraphs (C)(2) and
(C)(3) of _Annex A_ to fail to be satisfied at the then scheduled expiration
of the Offer; _provided, however_ , that no such notification shall affect or

Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or of any
failure of Parent or Acquisition Sub to comply with or satisfy in any material
respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it under this Agreement, in any such case if and only to the extent that
such untruth or inaccuracy, or such failure, would reasonably be expected to
prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger) or the ability of
Parent and Acquisition Sub to fully perform their respective covenants and
obligations under this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that no such

release or make any public announcement concerning this Agreement or the

or conditioned), except as such release or announcement may be required by
applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable United States
securities exchange or regulatory or Governmental Authority to which the
relevant party is subject or submits, wherever situated, in which case the
party required to make the release or announcement shall use its reasonable
best efforts to allow the other party or parties hereto reasonable time to
comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance (it being

Company Common Stock into such tender or exchange offer, or (b) in the case of
any other Acquisition Proposal, within ten (10) Business Days of a written
request by Parent following the public announcement of the commencement of
such Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall not have publicly reaffirmed its
adoption and recommendation of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

10.2 _Termination Before or After Appointment Time and Prior to Effective
Time_. Notwithstanding the prior adoption of this Agreement by the Company
Stockholders in accordance with the DGCL, this Agreement may be terminated and
the Offer and/or the Merger may be abandoned, at any time prior to the
Effective Time (it being agreed that the party hereto terminating
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10.2_ shall give prompt written
notice of such termination to the other party or parties hereto), by either
Parent or the Company if any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction
shall have (i) enacted, issued or promulgated any Law that is in effect and
has the effect of making the consummation of the Offer or the Merger illegal
or which has the effect of prohibiting or otherwise preventing the
consummation of the Offer or the Merger, or (ii) issued or granted any Order
that is in effect and has the effect of making the consummation of the Offer
or the Merger illegal or which has the effect of prohibiting or otherwise
preventing the consummation of the Merger, and such Order has become final
and non-appealable.

10.3 _Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination_. Any proper and valid
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1_ or _Section 10.2_
shall be effective immediately upon the delivery of written notice of the
terminating party to the other party or parties hereto, as applicable. In the
event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1 _or
_Section 10.2_, this Agreement shall be of no further force or effect without
liability of any party or parties hereto, as applicable (or any
director, officer, employee, affiliate, agent or other representative of such
party or parties) to the other party or parties hereto, as applicable, except
(a) for the terms of _Section 8.8_, this _Section 10.3_,  _Section 10.4_
and _Article XI_ , each of which shall survive the termination of this
Agreement, and (b) that nothing herein shall relieve any party or parties

 



 

-78-  hereto, as applicable, from liability for any knowing and intentional breach
of, or fraud in connection with, this Agreement. In addition to the foregoing,
no termination of this Agreement shall affect the obligations of the parties
hereto set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement, all of which obligations
shall survive termination of this Agreement in accordance with their terms.

 

10.4 _Fees and Expenses_.

 

(a) _General_. Except as set forth in this _Section 10.4_, all fees and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party or parties, as applicable,
incurring such expenses whether or not the Offer and/or the Merger is
consummated.

 

(b) _Company Payments_.

 

(i) The Company shall pay to Parent $53,500,000.00 (the " _Termination Fee_
"), by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated in writing by Parent, within two Business Days, in the event that:
(A) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section
10.1(a)_ or _Section 10.1(b)_ as a result of the failure to satisfy the
Minimum Condition prior to such termination (provided that all other
conditions in Annex A have been satisfied other than those that were to be
satisfied at the Appointment Time); (B) after the date of this Agreement and
prior to such termination, an offer or proposal that constitutes an
Acquisition Proposal (excluding for this purpose any mere "inquiry" from the
definition of Acquisition Proposal) shall have been publicly announced or
shall have become publicly known; and (C) within twelve months following such
termination, either a Competing Acquisition Transaction (whether or not
resulting from the Acquisition Proposal referenced in the preceding clause
(B)) is consummated or the Company enters into a definitive agreement
providing for a Competing Acquisition Transaction (whether or not resulting
from the Acquisition Proposal referenced in the preceding clause (B)). For
purposes of the foregoing, a " _Competing Acquisition Transaction_ " shall
have the same meaning as an "Acquisition Transaction" except that all
references therein to "more than twenty percent (20%)" shall be deemed to be
references to "a majority," and the reference therein to "eighty percent
(80%)" shall be deemed to be a reference to "fifty percent (50%)."

 

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
_Section 10.1(e)_, the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated in writing by Parent, as a condition to the effectiveness of such
termination.

 

(iii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
_Section 10.1(f)_ (or by the Company pursuant to  _Section 10.1(b)_
following any time at which Parent was entitled to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 10.1(f)_), the Company shall pay to Parent the
Termination Fee, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account or accounts designated in writing by Parent, within two (2) Business
Days.

(c) _Single Payment Only_. The parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree
that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on
more than one occasion, whether or not the Termination Fee may be payable
under more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at different
times and the occurrence of different events.



 

-79- (d) _Liquidated Damages_. In the event that Parent shall receive the
Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 10.4(b)_, the receipt of such fee shall
be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered
or incurred by Parent, Acquisition Sub, any of their respective Affiliates or
any other Person in connection with this Agreement (and the termination
thereof), the transactions contemplated hereby (and the abandonment thereof)
or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and none of Parent,
Acquisition Sub, any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person shall
be entitled to bring or maintain any other claim, action or proceeding against
the Company arising out of this Agreement (and the termination thereof), the
transactions contemplated hereby (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter
forming the basis for such termination.

10.5 _Amendment_ _._ Subject to applicable Law and subject to the other
provisions of this Agreement, this Agreement may be amended by the parties
hereto at any time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf
of each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company; _provided, however_ ,
that in the event that this Agreement has been adopted by the Company
Stockholders in accordance with Delaware Law, no amendment shall be made to
this Agreement that requires the approval of such Company Stockholders under
Delaware Law without such approval.

10.6 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time and from time to time prior to the
Effective Time, any party or parties hereto may, to the extent legally
allowed and except as otherwise set forth herein, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party or
parties hereto, as applicable, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties made to such party or parties hereto contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance
with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party or
parties hereto contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party or
parties hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party or
parties, as applicable. Any delay in exercising any right under this
Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right.

-81- 11.3 _Assignment_. No party may assign either this Agreement or any of its
rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written
approval of the other parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

11.4 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the documents and instruments and
other agreements among the parties hereto as contemplated by or referred to
herein, including the Company Disclosure Letter and the Annexes hereto,
constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof;
_provided, however_ , the Confidentiality Agreement shall not be superseded,
shall survive any termination of this Agreement and shall continue in full
force and effect until the earlier to occur of (a) the Effective Time and (b)
the date on which the Confidentiality Agreement expires in accordance with its
terms or is validly terminated by the parties thereto. EACH PARTY HERETO
AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS
AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARENT AND ACQUISITION SUB, ON THE ONE HAND, NOR THE
COMPANY, ON THE OTHER HAND, MAKES ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES TO THE
OTHER, AND EACH PARTY HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OR AS TO THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY
OTHER INFORMATION, MADE (OR MADE AVAILABLE BY) BY ITSELF OR ANY OF
ITS REPRESENTATIVES, WITH RESPECT TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THE NEGOTIATION,
EXECUTION OR DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY, NOTWITHSTANDING THE DELIVERY OR DISCLOSURE TO THE OTHER OR THE OTHERS
REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY DOCUMENTATION OR OTHER INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO ANY
ONE OR MORE OF THE FOREGOING.

11.5 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to, and
shall not, confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder,
except (a) as set forth in or contemplated by the terms and provisions of
_Section 7.1_, (b) from and after the Appointment Time, the rights of
holders of shares of the Company Common Stock and other Company Securities to
receive the consideration pursuant to the Offer, as set forth in _Article
II_, and (c) from and after the Effective Time, the rights of holders of
shares of the Company Common Stock and other Company Securities to receive the
consideration pursuant to the Merger, as set forth in _Article III_. Parent
and Acquisition Sub hereby expressly acknowledge and agree that, prior to the
Effective Time, the Companys measure of damages for a willful and material
breach of this Agreement by Parent or Acquisition Sub may include the loss of
the economic benefits of the transaction to Company Stockholders and other
relief (including equitable relief), whether or not this Agreement has been
validly terminated pursuant to _Article X_.

  

 

-82- 11.6 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or
the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible,
the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

11.7 _Remedies_. 

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly
conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of
any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and
the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of
any other remedy.

 

(b) The parties hereto hereby agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with its specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that money damages or
other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such damages.
Accordingly, the parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that in
the event of any breach or threatened breach by the Company, on the one hand,
or Parent and/or Acquisition Sub, on the other hand, of any of their
respective covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement, the Company,
on the one hand, and Parent and Acquisition Sub, on the other hand, shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement, by the other (as applicable), and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants and obligations of the other under this Agreement. The Company, on
the one hand, and Parent and Acquisition Sub, on the other hand hereby agree
not to raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of
specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of
this Agreement by such party (or parties), and to specifically enforce the
terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of
such party (or parties) under this Agreement.

 

11.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws
that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law
thereof.

11.9 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereto (a) irrevocably
consents to the service of the summons and complaint and any other process in
any action or proceeding relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, for and on behalf of itself or any of its properties or assets, in
accordance with _Section 11.2_ or in such other manner as may be permitted by
applicable Law, and nothing in this _Section 11.9_ shall affect the right of
any party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by applicable
Law; (b) irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits itself and its
properties and assets in any action or proceeding to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, only if
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction
over a

 



 

-83-  particular matter, any federal court within the State of Delaware) in the
event any dispute or controversy arises out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, or for recognition and enforcement of any
judgment in respect thereof; (c) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or
defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from
any such court; (d) agrees that any actions or proceedings arising in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be brought, tried and determined only in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware (or, only if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines
to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal court within the
State of Delaware); (e) waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have
to the venue of any such action or proceeding in any such court or that such
action or proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to
plead or claim the same; and (f) agrees that it will not bring any action
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in any
court other than the aforesaid courts. Each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and
the Company agrees that a final judgment in any action or proceeding in such
courts as provided above shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
applicable law.

11.10 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF PARENT, ACQUISITION SUB AND THE
COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT,
ACQUISITION SUB OR THE COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION,
PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

11.11 _Company Disclosure Letter References_. The parties hereto agree that
the disclosure set forth in any particular section or subsection of the
Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to be an exception to (or, as
applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) (i) the representations
and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company that are set
forth in the corresponding section or subsection of this Agreement, and (ii)
any other representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the
Company that are set forth in this Agreement, but in the case of this clause
(ii) only if the relevance of that disclosure as an exception to (or a
disclosure for purposes of) such other representations and warranties (or
covenants, as applicable) is readily apparent on the face of such disclosure.

11.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same
agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being
understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart.
